3840033
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
obtain the files by file#listfiles on a directory from one disk iterate over each of them create a new file on the other disk read from a fileinputstream from the file from one disk and write it to a fileoutputstream on the file on the other disk

3840035
toolbar	docking
mainwindow a modern action-based main window toolbar menu and docking architecture

3840053
stdout	fflush
if you have access to the source code you can probably just add calls to fflush stdout after every printf

3840056
ubuntu	linux
also it seems like linux has ubuntu fedora

3840058
hide	show
if this is element 6 then hide play pause if it is element 1 show play pause

3840099
temp	tmp
you don t show the full file name of the temp file you refer to but dreamweaver has a preview in browser option that creates temp files typically with random characters starting with tmp but i ve not used that feature in quite a while

3840112
visualvm	jhat
monitoring memory with jruby part 1 jhat and visualvm

3840112
profiling	debugging
their basic argument although they are too polite to spell it out that way is that using anything other than jruby to debugging memory leaks is just plain stupid simply because jruby can use java tools which have more engineering effort put into them than all ruby profiling tools together

3840139
qlabel	pyqt
see wxwidgets and pyqt for a trivial example with a qplaintextedit should be easy to adjust for a qlabel

3840144
ssl	https
when you use https the ssl tls connection is established before any http traffic is sent thus the whole request including the url and its parameters will be encrypted and won t be readable

3840166
firefox	safari
now if i request this on the local development server i m using safari but firefox works too it works and i see a black square

3840184
range	minimum
i trying to do a validates_length_of but specifying the range minimum maximum at run time

3840196
inherited	subclassing
i do want the attribute to get inherited by other subclassing just not this one

3840246
portrait	landscape
i use uiscrollview and pagecontroller it works on landscape but not portrait

3840246
width	height
if the app starting portrait mode and then when i rotate the device the view do not fit to screen i think that the uiscrollview content size need to redefined then i assign the height to width of the content and width to height of the content but it does not properly

3840250
hide	show
my problem is that it only show the elements matching the pattern and hide their children except they also match the pattern

3840354
firebird	dbisam
you could use a database such as dbisam firebird etc

3840418
width	height
you need to set a height and width on the ul or whatever container holds the images

3840427
uiview	calayer
i m trying to draw a bunch of preloaded images in a uiview s calayer but whenever the image displays the app s memory usage spikes and the memory is not reclaimed whenever the image changes

3840451
vmware	virtualbox
if you want to experience with linux get a distribution of your choice linux-mint is a good introction coming from windows and try it in a vm vmware or virtualbox

3840452
width	height
i m trying to make text automatically resize to fully fit inside a static 200 width 100 height div

3840526
free	malloc
the biggest issue you ll have will be with malloc free vs

3840527
inherited	properties
you could inherited off the attribute and add a properties that controls whether the attrbiute code fires or not

3840550
min	max
here i m using max but min or even avg would work just as well

3840569
keydown	keyup
how it works is simple a content script is injected into every page which then listens for keydown and keyup events

3840619
adc	uart
then to actually communicate that data to a computer you can fairly easily throw all those adc values onto the uart for the computer to pick up and process as it sees fit

3840673
client-side	server-side
i have a mixed client-side server-side validation using jquery validation plugin

3840675
ubuntu	linux
imho ubuntu is best for starters or anyone as a matter of fact because it has a lot of support a good user base and is compatible with pretty much any linux software installer rpm deb etc. you can choose any other distribution it doesn t really matter but i recommend this one

3840675
ubuntu	linux	xfce	gnome	xfce	kubuntu	xfce	kde	kubuntu	gnome	kde	kubuntu	kde	gnome
1 ubuntu a linux distribution comes with gnome as gui while kubuntu with kde and xubuntu has xfce

3840691
thin	unicorn
based on my research so far i am currently leaning towards nginx + haproxy + unicorn thin + memcached + mysql and deploying on linode

3840700
post	put
i would put the post outside of color box

3840749
floating-point	fractions
floating-point numbers are normally represented as binary fractions times a power of two for efficiency

3840755
pop-up	dialog
a better way to do this is to pop-up a dialog box and get the name you wish to use

3840804
width	height
i would like after that to be able to retrieve in code-behind the width or height of my column 0

3840804
width	height
edit since i have children into my grid 0 i accessed it s width and height with

3840811
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
but in google-chrome and safari and opera

3840860
serializable	deserialization
the property will need a setter even though it s a calculated field so that the string from the serializable object can be fed into a new instance on deserialization

3840873
margin	height
although they vary slightly as to how they retrieve a height value i.e some would calculate the whole element including padding margin scrollbar etc and others would just calculate the element in its raw form

3840905
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works just fine in google-chrome safari but bugs in firefox - i just can t find an explanation for which it wouldn t work

3840942
int	double
you can also create other versions for the other integral types supported by sum double float int long

3840972
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and ie work perfectly and firefox too only if i run it with administrator permissions

3840982
scheme	racket
it appears plt scheme has changed name to racket

3841007
hide	show
2. have the hover trigger a separate offset div to show hide

3841029
client-side	server-side
however you will need to perform similar validation on the server-side anyway because javascript can be disabled at the client or your html can be edited client-side to remove the validation call from the form element

3841115
installation	upgrade
as for updates i don t believe you could have it do updates automatically when they re available without some other mechanism having the app call home and check for updates or something but if you just point the browser at the updated package to download it it will handle the upgrade as well upon download and installation

3841130
mouseover	mouseleave
that will stop the mouseover animation and perform the mouseleave animation immediately

3841130
mouseover	mouseout
without it the mouseover animation will continue to run and if the mouse has left the area before it finishes it won t register that it needs to run the mouseout animation

3841199
google-chrome	firefox
i am able to browse the internet when i enable the autoproxy url in most browsers i use ie 7 ie 8 firefox google-chrome

3841199
nexus	artifactory
i can manually download these libraries from maven2 repositories and have an internal repository hosted using artifactory or nexus but i would like to know if there is any way i can do it from ide itself.

3841209
kde	gnome
of course kde and gnome might have separate screensaver implementations by now - there is very little uniformity when it comes to linux guis unfortunately.

3841284
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it renders fine in ie safari google-chrome and every other browser invented by man but in firefox the background images do not show the feedback link on the left and a white box around the content

3841312
hide	show
that is we d dynamically set this style to none hide and show using jquery

3841320
hide	show
if you want to show and hide you can use those jquery methods

3841332
postgresql	mysql
supports more databases sql server mysql postgresql oracle sqlite + more

3841363
postgresql	mysql
not sure what postgresql sql server mysql etc will or won t allow

3841410
ant	maven
netbeans offers great integration with ant and or maven for build purposes it s basically just a gui wrapper around those tools and there are a number of ant tasks out there that can do what you re wanting

3841410
ant	maven
if your netbeans project s are maven-based then you can always plug in one of these ant tasks there using the antrun plugin for maven

3841410
ant	maven
if you re not used to dealing with ant or maven directly in netbeans then just switch to the files tab and look at your project s root directory

3841410
maven	pom.xml
if its a maven project the build script will be named pom.xml

3841437
gridview	formview
i ve got a gridview formview master detail relationship going on

3841449
isapi	iirf
since iis 6.0 doesn t have a convenient way of turning off compression based on the user agent i used iirf an isapi filter that rewrites urls to rewrite the accept-encoding header when it comes from safari

3841449
chunked	transfer-encoding
but if safari is receiving dynamic compressed content that is the server is serving a response being rendered by asp.net and the content length is not known until it s done so the server sends transfer-encoding chunked then safari goes into flaky sir-hangs-a-lot mode

3841477
rss	feed
i m parsing rss feed however some feed have what look to be blank images in them from feedburner

3841496
equals	compareto
but when i perform a compareto i get a non-zero number and equals returns false

3841528
uilabel	uibutton
i found the fontlabel open source that can use ttf with uilabel but unfortunately i can t set my uibutton s titlelabel to a created fontlabel

3841541
mvp	presenter
first i m not mad because i use mvvm in winforms- i know about mvp model view presenter pattern and it s variants

3841643
equals	gethashcode
it should still obey the contract of gethashcode even if the field order changes equals values will have equals hash codes within the lifetime of that process

3841674
gitx	repo
git and subversion are fairly different and i know a tool to view a log and diffs for a checkout of a part of the subversion repo certainly wouldn t be the same as viewing a git repo via gitx

3841708
put	get	post	get	post	put
a post does not seem correct because it is not idempotent while a put is and thus more closely resembles the behavior or of a get

3841734
google-chrome	firefox
i recommend getting a more advanced browser toolkit such as the firebug plugin for firefox or using google-chrome s developer tools

3841736
onfocus	onblur
the reason it doesn t work is that you re calling the functions immediately and assigning the return value of undefined to onfocus and onblur

3841736
onfocus	onblur
instead onfocus and onblur should reference the functions by name

3841736
onfocus	onblur
now onfocus and onblur are referencing the functions and will call them when the events occur

3841737
pull	push
bundles are easier since it does not maintain that the two repo from which you push and pull have to be available at the same time

3841804
postgresql	mysql
there are exceptions though mysql and postgresql seem to have additional smartness that allows it

3841813
typedef	struct
with typedef you are saying that frame_t and struct frame_s are the exact same type

3841817
int	double
but not for int double etc

3841821
typedef	struct
usually you do such a typedef so that you can use the typedef name frame_t and don t have to write struct whenever you refer to the type

3841835
spaces	delimiter
for delimiter other than spaces such as commas peter s answer seems more appropriate

3841843
equals	gethashcode
heap the fact that for a value type equivalence relates to value while for an object type equivalence relates to identity even when an object defines a different form of equivalence by overriding equals and gethashcode the concept of reference-equality still exists and is still useful

3841893
int	double
widening conversion is when you go from a int to a double you are increasing the precision of the cast

3841893
int	double
narrowing conversion is the inverse of that when you go from double to int

3841896
pull	push
mercurial is able to compress data being sent for both ssh and https so you can push and pull faster

3841902
int	double
a widening cast is a cast from one type to another where the destination type has a larger range or precision than the source int to long float to double

3841929
post	get
however a few things about the post confuse me and i d love to get some help deciphering it

3841953
portrait	landscape
if i create the main view in portrait mode then rotate in landscape and after that i create my modal view.

3841953
portrait	landscape
the modal is in portrait mode and not in landscape as it should be

3841955
free	malloc
i played around with free and malloc but it didn t work..

3841955
memcpy	realloc
i m aware that the realloc could also result in a memcpy call but not everytime

3841967
children	parent
to implement this you need a parent class or interface that is something like bookoremptyspace stupid name that can have children book or emptyspace

3841969
sharpmap	proj
there s a decent implementation in the sharpmap proj which you should be able to use independently careful of the license though it s lgpl

3841976
pop-up	dialog
when run from the console it pop-up a dialog saying blah.exe has stopped working

3842033
post	get
third you can post the parameters to a queries resource and have that respond with 201 created and a new url like queries 78a65g82 in the location response header which the client then calls get on repeatedly or even in ranges if that s a benefit to retrieve the result

3842087
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	modulo	multiplying	subtract
you can multiplying add subtract divide find modulo and exponentiate any number that has an exact string representation

3842088
centos	linux
i m implementing my own graph library in linux fedora 10 and centos 5 with gcc 4.3.2 and using stl containers then i found some problems with memory

3842094
google-chrome	firefox
.hide worked great in firefox google-chrome but not in ie6 7 8

3842149
free	malloc
in addition to the stl container it might be the libc itself doing so the new delete - malloc free implementation

3842154
implements	extends
these descendant stylesheets can extends base styles with more granularity as needed e.g. might get extended by or which is a great design pattern for implements so-called object-oriented css

3842199
tinyint	boolean
cakephp considers tinyint 1 to be a boolean so

3842219
put	get
but if you just get a silent crash you re going to have to put on your detective hat as per xavier s answer

3842231
thin	unicorn	passenger	unicorn	passenger	thin
i personally prefer passenger over thin unicorn having run nginx to thin backends for a long while just for the convenience but your proposed setup is fairly standard

3842231
ubuntu	centos	redhat	fedora
many folks go with ubuntu or redhat centos fedora distros - i like centos myself - but it s really just about what you feel most comfortable with

3842231
ubuntu	centos
if you don t have a favorite distro i would recommend trying ubuntu centos as they tend to be quite friendly to the beginner and have extremely robust community support

3842266
mouse	keyboard
note the highlighting works fine when a user selects a row with mouse or keyboard

3842268
put	get
when i put the lines that are causing errors in an implemeation cointext i.e between implemtation and end i get

3842276
cos	sin
so if you re on such a processor and if you have no dependencies in your code you don t need the result of one sin computation in order to start the next one then you probably won t get much faster than using sin and cos directly as they will be fully pipelined achieving an effective rate of 1 per cycle

3842289
free	malloc
there is also overhead of malloc both time and memory because malloc puts a special header _crtmemblockheader before the memory area it returns that s why you have to give exactly the same pointer to the free and are able to use functions like _msize

3842295
hide	show
click 1 should hide show and click 2 should reverse

3842309
terminate	timeout
it seems that the connection to the database has timeout and has been terminate by the database server

3842341
ssl	https
how would i apply ssl https to my php login system

3842341
ssl	https
i ll need some kind of ssl https checking

3842389
post	get
here s how it works assuming no caching specified on the server side by default get requests will be cached by the browser and post requests not cached unless you specify the cache true attribute when sending the ajax requests which allows you to override the client caching strategy

3842406
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
unless you have a huge installation base and draconian upgrade policies costs like microsoft with it s office you should have no problems with users needing to open new versioning files on older versioning of software

3842406
versioning	upgrade
one thing you can foresee and consider now is to create a some free player to let users that have new format file and old versioning of software see this new file and maybe decide to upgrade and b converter module that will convert newer format to older possibly dropping some unsupported features elements

3842476
folder	dir
my new problem is that i am now storing user uploads in a folder inside of my django app so i can t just remove the whole app dir anymore or i would loose all of my users files

3842512
firefox	safari
it shows up fine in safari and firefox but in ie7 it is nowhere to be seen

3842515
equals	gethashcode
gethashcode will say that they are not equals

3842612
google-chrome	firefox
however if you re into web development i think test www selenium is becoming indespensable for testing javascript-heavy web pages and their behavior in the most common web browsers firefox iexplorer google-chrome etc.

3842646
min	max
then summarize those values for min max and average

3842647
umbraco	dotnetnuke	kentico	dotnetnuke	kentico	umbraco
i am intrigued by sitefinity umbraco and kentico for sites where all that s really needed is a cms but not enough that i ve bothered trying them over dotnetnuke

3842667
dictionary	map
to relate two strings it s easiest to use an object to create a dictionary map as shown below

3842681
width	height
that means the packer computes how large a master must be to just exactly meet the needs of its slaves and it sets the requested width and height of the master to these dimensions quoting from the official tcl tk man pages 1

3842704
comparator	icomparer
another option would be to pass in an icomparer or a delegate comparator for custom comparing

3842707
min	max
on the one hand if you do not close the connection it will remain open until it times out 1 min under load you will hit the max connections default 10

3842713
width	height
the content itself has much more height than width and it would be perfect to have the screen split down the middle horizontally with the content on the left and the virtual keyboard on the right

3842719
sorting	grouping
i am at a loss as to how to split the string and then cover all the sorting grouping combinations given that there are no rules around the form_name format

3842759
google-chrome	firefox
i m looking for a google-chrome or firefox extension that will auto validate your webpages from specific urls

3842773
webclient	httpwebrequest
1st code that goes before using a webclient or httpwebrequest object

3842805
phpstorm	aptana
aptana phpstorm are the ones i ve tried and saw that at least phpstorm show very good notices when something s wrong in your js code including jquery

3842812
dictionary	map
to relate two strings it s easiest to use an object to create a dictionary map as shown below

3842816
google-chrome	firefox
changing background-position in a css sprite on a visited is working for me in firefox 3.6 but not in google-chrome 6

3842879
post	get
the problem is that i can t get the old individual blog post to redirect to the new ones - they have the same name structure on the new domain name eg olddomain.com post-1 is now newdomain.com post-1 but if i type in one of the old post urls i get a 500 error

3842981
printf	strncpy
have you looked into using the alternate safe versions of functions like printf strncpy etc.

3843014
try-catch	exception-handling
is there something pure-java to do this or do i have to create an other type of exception-handling which is not an instance of ioexception to avoid the try-catch body will handle it

3843088
pull	push
i use bitbucket as my repo and i can simply perform push on my dev box and run pull update on stage prod box

3843090
public	protected
you can access public and protected parent member variables via

3843141
opera	firefox
the technique you re using for non-blocking scripts appending a script dom element will not keep script execution order on all browsers only on firefox and opera

3843155
int	chars
the issue is that range treats its arguments like int and if you give it a single chars it will convert it to its ascii chars code

3843155
int	chars
in the first case you re getting all chars between chars a int 65 and chars z int 122

3843155
int	chars
this is one of the rare cases where php converts single chars to their ascii codes rather than parsing the string as int the way it does normally

3843155
int	chars
if needle is not a string it is converted to an int and applied as the ordinal value of a chars

3843168
svg	vml
different ways of rendering the chart svg vml versus html 5 canvas

3843193
hide	show
i have a set of tabbed divs that i am hiding and showing with jquery hide and show this works great in all browsers except ie where the tabbed elements that have been hidden when show are not clickable as links or focusable selectable as form select text field etc

3843230
stdout	stderr
read both the stdout and stderr streams of the process returned by runtime#exec

3843289
cpython	pypy
true lazy evaluation is not available in cpython of course but is available in pypy using the thunk object space

3843331
mouseup	mousedown
i just noticed that mousedown or mouseup event of the datagrid is still fired when the disabled cell is clicked

3843353
post	get
by default php will recognize that get post data that contains s should be made into an array

3843378
children	parent
there is nothing wrong with using pointers for this it s clean using pointers as well because parent nodes own their children so cleanup and destruction is easy

3843387
uiview	subviews
i have a uiimageview add to a uiview as a subviews

3843406
put	get
this will make your complex datamining much more difficult--you don t just need to put data into the database you also need to get it out

3843416
put	get
also you can put asserts into pointer accesses before you get something from the pointer

3843467
git-rebase	undo
i don t think you can undo a hard reset to get uncommitted changes back - you can undo a git-rebase because the blobs are still available but if you never committed your newest changes to git ever anything it overwrote is most likely history

3843486
uiview	uiwindow
uiwindow is a subclass of uiview so if you want to make sure your notification is visible to the user you can add it directly to the keywindow using addsubview and it will instantly be the top most view

3843538
ubuntu	centos
the easiest way is to use any server oriented distro like ubuntu server or centos

3843560
stdout	stderr
note that the php exec functions only capture the standard output stdout not the error output stderr

3843560
stdout	stderr
you should redirect stderr to stdout when executing your command

3843602
inherited	properties
uiimageview inherited from uiview so it has a layer properties

3843615
notepad++	textpad
any text editor with a macro record feature will let you automate this -- vs.net textpad notepad++

3843631
metaclass	subclassing
python calls __subclasscheck__ on sometype s metaclass to determine if something a subclassing of sometype

3843643
put	get
this predates d2010 and extended rtti. your #2 looks like the best way to get it and is probably how a hypothetical trttiobject.unitname would calculate it if they were to put one in

3843646
hash	md5
my goal is to submit a md5 hash to and receive the plaintext back

3843649
getter	setter
i tried to create a simple double object and it s getter and setter but when i run the application it throws an error telling that column calc_column doesn t exist because jpa eclipselink is trying to use it as a valid database column column calc_column is either not in any table in the from list...

3843668
pull	push
very good git integration when i pull push my repo i want the management files to go too

3843673
post	get
you should probably post some of your code to get better answers

3843687
rss	feed
i m trying to build an rss reader and i m trying to use a feed from craigslist

3843704
oncreate	ondestroy
this causes the normal chain of onstop ondestroy oncreate etc.

3843706
scrollable	panels
right now i m looking for a replacement which may end up just being a scrollable stack panels with manually added controls

3843716
getter	setter
i tried to create a simple double object and it s getter and setter but when i run the application it throws an error telling that column calc_column doesn t exist because jpa eclipselink is trying to use it as a valid database column column calc_column is either not in any table in the from list...

3843778
post	get
i want to be able to automatically get the first 300 characters of text or 500 or 200 â i haven t worked out the number to use on pages when i don t want to display the full blog post like on the front page

3843827
implements	extends
since arrays implements which in turn extends you could use an empty array for your empty collection

3843830
pascal	delphi
but turbo pascal or delphi for the last two lines which we ve already established doesn t support nesting would accept all of those as perfectly valid comments

3843833
udp	tcp
the length of the udp header is fixed unlike the length of the tcp header

3843845
hash	md5
in general the output of a hash function is formatted as a hexadecimal string for example the md5 of foo.mp3 is 10ebb1120767e9de166e0f5905077cb1

3843845
folder	directory
you can create 16 folder one for each of possible hexadecimal characters - so you have a directory 0 one named 1 and so on up to f

3843872
put	get
when you get to a text token that would put you over the limit copy only enough characters to reach the limit generate closing tags for any unclosed tags on your stack and stop processing

3843926
qtkit	coremidi
the frameworks i use are cocoa appkit coredata foundation coremidi quartz quartzcore opengl qtkit

3843932
onmouseover	onclick
so html tags are preserved but events like onmouseover onmouseout onclick etc

3843939
ubuntu	debian
if that isn t your concern fedora ubuntu debian - or really any recent distro with a fairly big community will do fine

3843944
post	get
maybe your xml data is not very long but it s not suggested that you send data using this way.it refers to security problem.so use post instead of get

3843944
post	get
forget this post i get something wrong...sorry

3843947
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
however this only works in firefox and not ie6 7 8 google-chrome or safari

3843968
cyberduck	winscp
cyberduck on mac or winscp on windows are good options

folder	directory
to stop a user from seeing the directory all you need to do is create an index page in that folder

3843989
ftp	telnet
you can also rename it via telnet or your ftp program and you should be familiar enough with one of those so as not to need explaining

3844097
width	height
for now i am just handling the datacontextchanged event of the window and setting the width and height from the viewmodel manually

3844109
int	double
as far as i know notsimple is not an element such as int double etc

3844126
button	checkbox
what i need is just selecting input file select output directory a few checkbox or such trivial options and big process button

3844134
int	double
2 types can be primitives like int double or objects of a particular class

3844140
floating-point	integer
note that this only depends on integer arithmetic which avoids errors due to floating-point rounding.

3844145
post	get
if you want to post code we can get into greater specifics

3844150
int	boolean
a string is namely an object not a primitive like int boolean etc for which the would work as intented and expected

3844160
pecl	pear
as codaddict already mentioned try pecl zip module or pear file_archive

3844217
memcached	apc
but if you ve already apc installed you can store it in there or use memcached or redis

3844274
pwd	chdir
you can change your pwd using chdir and then do the fopen s

3844283
intersect	contains
i might need to know what all strings a given id contains and then intersect the list with another list obtained for a different id

3844314
width	height
i can control the height via css but cannot figure out how to change the width i want thinner than the default infowindow

3844345
put	get
you have to put in a reasonable amount of effort to get a sensible timestamp

3844399
nunit	mstest
then i ran tests in both mstest 2008 and nunit 2.5.2

3844399
nunit	mstest
nonetheless i tried to compare the sum of all test speeds and in some cases nunit is faster and in other cases mstest is faster

3844399
nunit	mstest
thus i suspect when people say that nunit is much faster than mstest it is because of the loading and updating delays but the actual test execution time appears to be very similar

3844428
getter	setter
i wrote a setter and getter method following apple s conventions and noticed that despite having no variable i can still access the setter and getter using the dot syntax

3844449
accessor	properties
likewise accessing a properties which is an accessor message and accessing an instance variable which is just accessing a variable nothing more are very different

3844453
jar	war
both the ejb jar and war are deployed in the same ear

3844458
google-chrome	firefox
i ve only tested it with firefox and google-chrome but seems to work okay

3844477
post	get
search and browse content and get suggested post users though we will be using the solr search server to index db data and run these type of queries

3844489
google-chrome	firefox
i have a div section in which i have an image whose onlick event should execute a function called in it but it is not executable in firefox or google-chrome with my code infact the image is not clickable at all

3844516
mouse	keyboard
it is pretty quick to insert all the quotes and _ in the vba editor if you put them in the clipboard and use the mouse and keyboard to click ctrl-v click ctrl-v buzzing down through the rows

3844526
google-chrome	firefox
however when firefox or google-chrome tries to view the page it won t display

3844608
swt	windowbuilder
i am using google windowbuilder pro for swt and we use a lot of custom components here

3844648
qevent	qapplication
use a queued signal slot connection or a custom qevent and qapplication postevent to do this

3844673
pop-up	dialog
afterwards a dialog box will pop-up when the user next syncs their device asking if it s ok to send data to apple

3844708
post	put
i put up a set of simple post on dependency injection and its benefits here

3844710
g++	gcc
to clarify - your source file ends with a .c extension and you are compiling it with gcc not g++

3844733
int	chars
this time the value 65536 can t be considered as a chars at compile time the max value for a chars is 65535 see character.max_value so it will be considered as an int so x will be too

3844733
int	chars
to summarize if one of the operand is an int and the other a chars there are two possible conversions

3844733
int	chars
the int is narrowed into a chars loss of precision

3844733
int	chars
the chars is widen into an int no loss of precision

3844734
int	chars
since you are using a chars the x is 88 in ascii and it is being seen as an int since they are compatible

3844735
int	chars
if one of the operands is of type t where t is byte short or chars and the other operand is a constant expression of type int whose value is representable in type t then the type of the conditional expression is t

3844735
int	chars
binary numeric promotion converts the chars x to an int 88 and the second statement prints 88 - hence the overall result of x88

3844736
int	chars
in your example x is converted from chars to int and x has an ascii code of 88

3844741
int	chars
this applies to both statements since both chars and int are numeric types and thus 5.1.8 trivially applies

3844749
png	ico
use imagemagick to convert the ico files to png files

3844755
dictionary	map
there are 13k airfields in the us and i ve created a map of about 300k permutations again a dictionary with prefixes of varying lengths each corresponding to a list of matches

3844768
accessor	properties
also accessor properties will give you problems they could be mimicked with widely supported non-standard methods such as __definegetter__ __definesetter__ but again you can t change the properties attributes

3844768
inherited	properties
another problem aside the properties descriptors is that the object.create method can accept null as an argument to create an object that doesn t inherited from anything

3844768
inherited	properties
this can t be emulated with the crockford s object.create shim because when the new operator is used with a constructor function that has a prototype properties containing null -or any other non-object value- the newly created object will inherited from object.prototype anyway by default

3844844
getter	setter
properties rather than getter and setter

3844851
hex	binary
if you want to know what it looks like in some other base base 2 or binary you either have to provide the proper printf format string if it exists x for hex or just build that string yourself and print it out

3844905
getter	setter
the only thing that comes into my mind is the abbreviation poco for plain old c-object or pojo for plain old java-object which denominates a very simple object that only has some simple attributes and setter getter for this - no other logic or functionality

3844941
post	get
i need to send and receive get post requests

3844949
getter	setter
insert in every public setter a boolean value like m_ischanged then using a public getter only to check if one of the properties has been changed

3844969
switching	screens
i get the same problem when switching to fullscreen the gray area covers the entire screens but i only have a small box in the corner being rendered to

3844972
put	get
edit i will put example of the site i want to get

3845000
margin	height
easiest fix for this is to simply remove any margin or padding you have on elements you ve set to height 100

3845021
int	chars
since i found that a explicit typecast worked as well chars sizeof int

3845032
int	boolean
boolean operators are usually used on boolean values but bitwise operators are usually used on int values

3845039
onfocus	onblur
i am not able to call a functions on onfocus and onblur events both perfectly working in html but not in php here is code in php

3845096
int	boolean
in theory and and or come straight from boolean logic and therefore operate on two boolean to produce a boolean while and | apply the boolean and or to the individual bits of int

3845126
charindex	substr
using the charindex and substr functions

3845150
folder	directory
i want to point to a folder and then the php script should take the list of sub directory from that folder and save it into the database

3845159
vb.net	vb6
am a vb6 and vb.net average programmer and would be ok if help comes from any of the programming languages i mentioned

3845169
keydown	keyup
also you should be doing this for the keydown event because keyup is too late

3845184
poe	anyevent
you may want to use anyevent or poe

3845220
integer	unsigned
a signed 64 bit integer is long an unsigned is ulong

3845312
x86	64bit
i am using an unmanaged library in a .net application which is used on x86 and 64bit systems alike and therefore is compiled as any cpu

3845331
youtube	vimeo
consider uploading the movie to a video hosting site such as youtube or vimeo and then embed their player

3845380
children	parent
while name and age of parent show correctly i dont see the children combo box populated

3845442
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in ie but not in firefox google-chrome etc...

3845442
google-chrome	safari
it works in some browsers but not safari or google-chrome

3845498
webclient	httpwebrequest
you would use the httpwebrequest httpwebresponse classes or simpler requirements can be fulfilled with webclient

3845551
gmail	hotmail
hotmail and gmail users don t receive them or they end up in spam-folder

3845578
profiling	debugging
you will be able to see if you can debugging in the cloud if you can profiling when load testing if you can do fast work inhouse which then works well when deployed to the cloud

3845612
public	protected
only public and protected members are accessible in subclasses

3845642
int	chars
the list passed in could be of either int or string and i want to return a list of all members of the passed in list that have an even number of chars

3845657
put	get	post	get	post	put
most of the web servers and frameworks support by default get and post http methods and do not promote or even disallow usage of put and delete methods

3845702
bluetooth	usb
usb device bluetooth usb host

3845710
getter	setter
and of course update getter setter and mapping accordingly

3845760
dbf	dbase
i m using c# and .net 3.5 trying to import some data from old dbf files using odbc with microsoft dbase driver

3845760
dbf	dbase
the dbf s are in dbase iii format and using ibm850 encoding for strings

3845784
quicksort	mergesort
but it would be silly to compare quicksort and mergesort on the basis of the depth of recursion of the mergesort vs

3845795
post	get
then do a get or a post with ajax to delete.php

3845795
post	get
as davide suggested in the comments it might be a better idea to use post commands instead of get to perform this kind of operation

3845807
implements	extends
the easiest way would involve your classes all implements an interface or extends a base class that expose the common attribute lifetime used for the comparison

3845814
width	height
note that you can also use width and height here as well.

3845833
button	checkbox	post	get
if you have a submit button below the checkbox just send the form to the server with post or get whatever you require

3845840
screens	tablet
screens resolution small normal phones large tablet

3845878
uiview	subviews
there are many different kinds of uiview s see the graphic in the uiview programming guide link so for your case you could use a simple uiview with a background image set to your calendar box graphic and add a subviews of type uilabel

3845882
post	put
there really are no performance benefits of using put and delete over post

3845920
udp	tcp
then you just use tcp udp normally

3845926
addition	multiplication	subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication
this also explains why addition subtraction and multiplication have the same result as a bit pattern regardless of whether you compute with signed or unsigned integers

3845927
versioning	upgrade
i just want to test the app in a real device but it seems the sdk does not match i only have a 10.5.8 mac and can not upgrade to 10.6 rightnow then i could not get the lastest sdk versioning 4

3845933
vbulletin	phpbb
there s phpbb vbulletin but they re older so i doubt they meet the above 2 criteria

3845972
setinterval	settimeout
i m aware of both setinterval and settimeout functions but it s not suitable for my case because i need to create an img dom element in the interval of 7 seconds

3845983
setinterval	settimeout
the solution is to use timers settimeout or setinterval

3845983
setinterval	settimeout
now that you know why a blocking sleep function won t work check out tomalak s link for a few solutions using settimeout or setinterval

3846043
rss	feed
i m using php to process rss data however often feed have more than image in the description

3846058
setinterval	settimeout
you re complaining about settimeout and setinterval but then describing how you are using them badly

3846058
clearinterval	settimeout	setinterval	clearinterval	setinterval	settimeout
either user settimeout not in a loop and have it call another settimeout if there is more to do or use setinterval and call clearinterval after a maintained count is reached

3846077
post	get
if you get stuck with anything you don t understand post it here

3846078
post	get
the implementations vary from simple things like sending get post requests to advanced topics like automatic cookie handling and javascript engines

3846088
decoder	encoder
the mx library has a base64 encoder decoder class but there are a few other implementations laying around..

3846104
backgrounding	multitasking
since ios 4 s multitasking jettisoning also happens to backgrounding tasks.

3846115
puts	gets
you can change where it gets its files from and where it puts them so you aren t tied to its default structure

3846136
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
now this works fine in google-chrome and safari ie not tested but firefox styles the closebar with the #ebdfd3 background somehow adds a padding to the image and messes up the position of the container element

3846136
google-chrome	safari
i really don t have a clue what to do considering the fact it works in google-chrome and safari

3846160
width	height
i have a problem i want so many control on my window form label textbox how can i disable all control when my form load to caught one by one and do visibilty false is very irretating for me and after that i want to pass the control inside the function and set its width and height how can i achive it

3846206
width	height
you have to realize that your control cannot have the width or height bigger than the container in which that control is

3846225
portrait	landscape
the standard approach is to put the portrait version in res layout and the landscape version in res layout-land with the same name appwidgetmain.xml

3846251
folder	directory
the way i understand the directory structure is that you have source packages in src folder and they are built into the build folder

3846252
width	height
now what happens is that layer4 and layer6 witness some animation but interestingly the height changes and not the width

3846253
unsigned	short
the ranges of signed char unsigned char and unsigned short are implementation defined but again commonly they are -128â 127 0â 255 and 0â 65535 respectively

3846257
calloc	malloc
it hasn t been allocated any space by way of malloc or calloc

3846257
unsigned	short
unsigned short takes up 2 bytes atleast on my system

3846259
postgresql	mysql
in particular you might want to use model classes and a persistence layer to avoid dealing directly with sqlite mysql postgresql odbc blah

3846259
postgresql	mysql
the easiest way is to use the db-provided c library libpq5 for postgresql 8.4 libmysqlclient16 for mysql 5.1 etc

3846265
unsigned	short
such a value not within the range representable by unsigned short

3846265
unsigned	short
in this case your unsigned short can represent values up to 65535 so -35 is brought into range by adding 65536 which gives 65501

3846294
unsigned	short
unsigned short has a range of at least 0

3846321
bash	subshell
pure bash using subshell much slower

3846346
disk	ram
a good host for mysql is a decent two-core system with plenty of ram and the fastest disk io channels and disk you can afford

3846353
postgresql	mysql
i imagine a web developer would have to know html php and database knowledge eg mysql or postgresql

3846353
post	get
i recently read a post on linux journal that mentions redcap but it seems you have to get institutional permission to use

3846354
maven	m2e
i use maven and eclipse with m2e for java projects

3846464
int	chars
ord convert chars to int

3846475
vb6	vba
vba being a whole lot less than vb6

3846475
vb.net	vb6	vb6	vba
vb.net will not fade away and vb6 and vba have not yet exhausted their potential

3846487
debian	linux
the top of the file usr local etc mono 4.0 settings.map on one debian linux machine is

3846490
vb.net	vb6
microsoft is focusing on making c# and vb.net not vb6 similar in what is being termed as a co-evolution of the languages

3846502
persistent	transient
a static transient property defines a list of property names that should not be persistent to the database

3846503
persistent	transient
using transient key word gorm can be directed not to persistent specific property

3846503
persistent	transient
digitalcopy property included in transient declaration notifies gorm not to persistent digitalcopy

3846532
int	chars
our compiling process knows that this means storing an int followed by a pointer to an array of chars

3846532
int	chars
it therefore knows that accessing _id means accessing the int at the address of the start of the structure and accessing _username means accessing the pointer to chars at a given offset from the address of the start of the structure

3846543
folder	directory
is there another place in which the root directory for folder is set

3846546
touchesbegan	touchesended
1 using instances of uibutton that bypass the uicontrolevent or whatever in order to use touchesbegan and touchesended

3846552
scheme	racket
i m using racket for scheme programming

i d like to be able to connect directly to that interpreter and run jsx files just as i would in extendscript

3846750
decimal	ieee
decimal is a built in python class that handles floating points correctly as base 10 not as ieee 7somethingsomething standard

3846757
public	protected
don t use inner classes in c++ unless you really know what it does for inner classes protected and private members of the outer classes are seen as if they were public

3846772
width	height
but when this window resizes i want to make the mychild width and height to fit the window

3846784
google-chrome	safari
i have a site that is fully functioning in google-chrome safari and heavily relied on sqlite to store access data

3846800
typedef	struct
you are declaring the struct in the typedef

3846863
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
this is either explicit in the class name uiviewcontroller uitableviewcontroller or implicit uitabbarcontroller since a uitabbar is a view

3846892
width	height
an easy trick here would be add empty a href ... s after your img tags and then use css to make them display block position absolute and set the top left height width and z-index to position these otherwise invisible anchors above the relevant parts of your images

3846963
intersect	contains
a given id contains and then intersect

3846963
post	get
they even work together here s a blog post from a 10gen member to get you started 10gen makes mongo

3846978
disk	ram
another possibility might to to use a ram disk

3847015
keydown	keyup
in non-ie browsers before version 9 the event associated with a keydown or keyup event has a keycode property the same property ie uses for all key events

3847033
width	height
you need to use width ad height along with overflow overflow

3847033
width	height
overflow hidden will hide the content that is more than the width provided a height is given

3847039
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately this is only supported in very modern browsers like google-chrome safari and the firefox 4 beta

3847050
uibezierpath	nsbezierpath
from what i can see to save messing around with coregraphics i can use uibezierpath i ve done similar with nsbezierpath on the mac

3847074
folder	directory
okay so i m trying to get a directory of folder and sub folder but it just goes into a infinite loop

3847094
vsto	add-in
add-in using visual studio tools for office vsto are automatically loaded within a shim and executes within a separate appdomain

3847094
vsto	add-in
vsto is a gorgeous system for making very rich excel add-in but execution speed is its weakness for applications such as yours

3847108
client-side	server-side
same language for client-side and server-side

3847108
client-side	server-side
i just can t see how sharing code between server-side and client-side could be useful in practice.

3847112
inherited	subclassing
since constructors are not inherited there is no way to force a zero arg constructor to be present unless there are no constructors in the subclassing

3847146
margin	text-align
the equivalent of align for images is float for div elements it is either margin or text-align depending on if you are dealing with the block itself or some inline content inside it

3847148
folder	directory
i am trying to get all music files from all of the nested directory that itunes created and dump them into one folder so that i can use a more competent program to organize my music no offense to itunes fans

3847168
pop-up	dialog
from what i can discern from your question the user experience you are trying to create is a modal pop-up via dialog which contains a series of cascading drop-down lists

3847168
pop-up	dialog
essentially you want to load a modal pop-up via dialog which contains three drop-down lists

3847173
super	extends
the passed list is a or any class not extends number nor in the super hierarchy of number ie

3847173
superclass	subclassing
even if string fits in object which is a superclass of number you woudln t be sure to be able to add a number to a list that contain any subclassing from one of the super classes of number

3847178
mouse	keyboard
i am trying to do away with the mouse and keyboard for an app i am working on and would like to use only the touchscreen

struts	wicket
if you already know java why not use one of the rich web application frameworks on java such as spring or struts or wicket or google web toolkit

3847247
gif	png
only replace images jpg jpeg gif png

3847280
profiling	debugging
tool support for profiling and debugging multi-threaded multi-event programs

3847321
implements	extends
since number extends object implements serializable this means that the only types that are currently capture-convertible by are

3847321
super	extends
pecs stands for producer- extends consumer- super

3847375
keydown	keyup
i ve edited this based on tim down s comment and replaced keycode with which which is correct across keydown keyup and keypress events

3847378
hide	show	mouseover	mouseout
ok let s say i have a navigation system constructed in nested divs and i want to show sub-menu divs and sub-sub-menu divs when i do a mouseover on the menu div and hide sub-menu divs and sub-sub-menu divs on a mouseout or more precisely when i mouseover a different menu div

3847385
post	get
later once the subscriptions is acknowledged you will get post requests with the content of the update in the body

3847431
blogspot	blogger
you do not have to do that google owns blogger blogspot and does that automatically

3847466
superclass	subclassing
in your first choice the logs of a subclassing end up in the category of the superclass

3847470
for-loop	arrays
in the for-loop update the arrays with the return value of the function and call the function again

3847483
hide	show
i believe what you need is a popup window where you can have list of options whenever your button is clicked show this window hide it when user selects an item in the list or clicks outside of the working area

3847495
google-chrome	safari
en-us applewebkit 534.3 khtml like gecko google-chrome 6.0.472.63 safari 534.3

3847499
hlsl	glsl
also you need to decide how you will interact with gpu - through gpgpu libs - such as cuda opencl or just through pixel shaders - such as glsl hlsl

3847507
width	height
i have quite an odd problem here - i am using jquery for resizing my background image png width 1793 height 1200 size 872kb

3847538
post	get
i ve not yet coded error handling for when the post does not exist so that when people type random things in the url they don t get the single_post view

3847573
octal	binary	octal	hex	octal	decimal	hex	binary
to make it work with any representation decimal hex octal binary you need to pass in the base as a parameter

3847598
int	chars
also it is a little dubious that value an int variable is assigned and compared against n a chars literal

3847602
rss	feed
i m attempting to generate a dynamic rss feed for a website and i m running into trouble writing a mysql query for it

3847660
ati	nvidia
however according to the ati stream computing guide this is the situation for radeon cards for 5xxx banks are 2kb apart and you want to make sure that you distribute your accesses meaning from all worgroups simulateously active equaly over all banks so i would imagine that nvidia cards behave similary

3847700
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
or at least ie8 google-chrome firefox and opera

3847737
integer	unsigned
depending on how you access this memory space either via the f data member or the u data member the program will interpret the memory region as either a float or an unsigned integer respectively

3847744
debian	linux
debian linux distro

3847752
getter	setter
i would define a getter and a setter function in a.c

3847752
getter	setter
using a setter getter has a bunch of advantages

3847760
pull	push
now interestingly if i create an almost blank db with just a single test entry in it i can push pull it fine

3847760
pull	push
either way i did an explicit push this way and a subsequent pull still has the same problem

3847770
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
one tab displays a uinavigationcontroller the other a uiviewcontroller that i have customized

3847770
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
it does not appear that the uinavigationcontroller is a delegate of the uitabbar or uitabbarcontroller which would have been one option

uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
what uitabbarcontroller is doing is that whenever you tap a already selected tab it checks if the uiviewcontroller of that tab is an uinavigationcontroller

3847826
rss	feed
if your tweets are public you can grab them in an rss feed without login

3847857
pull	push
i switch my ruby version to 1.8.7 when using taps to push and pull when i get errors so you might want to give that a try

3847879
client-side	server-side
you can t get this value with php because php processes things server-side and the hash in the url is client-side only and never gets sent to the server

3847898
put	get
all nodes get put in the smallest bbox possible

3847913
implements	extends
if a extends implements b then is a greater-than b

3847919
super	self
it actually equals to super b self .example

3847941
nsinteger	double	int	double
however if not an nsstring i don t know the datatype of value as it could be nsnumber nsinteger int float double etc.

3847946
getter	setter
in other cases in other languages one would have a getter and setter method something like int getid to obtain a value and void setid int val to update it

3847946
getter	setter	public	protected
up until private setter being introduced actually what changed with c# 2 is the syntax for having a private setter and a public or protected getter in the same block we could have a private method to do the work of the private setter so private setter aren t really necessary

3847946
getter	setter	public	protected
encapsulation is a matter not of whether your setter or getter are public private protected or internal but a matter of whether they are appropriate

3847946
public	protected
as for your last question to be immutable means that a class has no public protected or internal setters and no public protected or internal methods that change any fields

3847963
maven	m2e
i use maven and eclipse with m2e for java projects

3847964
hide	show
you only want to hide and show the direct child of #tabs

3847964
fadein	fadeout
include the fadein in the callback of the fadeout this ll make things appear a little smoother since it ensures that fadein only begins once fadeout ends

3848009
public	protected
private setters allow you to create read-only public or protected properties

3848009
getter	setter
yes you can create a read-only property by only specifying the getter but with auto-implmeneted properties you are required to specify both get and set so if you want an auto-implemented property to be read-only you must use private setter

3848015
for-loop	loops
after these changes it should be obvious that you can omit i entirely and therefore replace the for-loop with a while loops

3848017
fadein	hide
edit i removed the hide fadein slow and now it s working correctly in firefox

3848056
super	self
unless you have super -calls involved or more generally subclasses that override x and call directly to a.x self as part of their override s implementation looking for the first item in type self .mro that has an x attribute would work --

3848056
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
if you do need to cover for super -calls it s harder -- unless you happen to know that no super -class of a defines an x attribute and of course it s easier to know about your superclass than your subclassing though multiple inherited does complicate it

3848059
folder	directory
so it seems these files need to exist in a folder outside of the library in a virtual directory in iis for instance

3848067
stdout	stderr
so if you explicitly redirect stdout and stderr to nohup.out then nohup doesn t print that message

3848067
stdout	stderr
note that if you redirect just stdout nohup prints a redirecting stderr to stdout message

3848127
google-chrome	firefox
for regression testing in firefox and google-chrome i

3848127
google-chrome	firefox
make sure function x still works after a change you can use the free imacros for firefox and google-chrome addons

3848172
backgrounding	multitasking
i am looking into the feasibility of supporting multitasking while doing audio recordings in the backgrounding

3848230
put	get
it s good to handle this in general even if it s not happening in this case. it depends exactly how it s implemented but i don t think that you re allowed to put a on the end of a command to get it to run in the background

3848236
quicksort	mergesort
i m trying to write my own mergesort function in the same fashion as c s quicksort function

3848255
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
rootviewcontroller - uitabbarcontroller - uinavigationcontroller - subviewcontrollers

3848257
associativity	operator-precedence
operator-precedence and associativity

3848272
afp	smb
our only real issues have had to do with afp and smb on the mac mini -- nothing to do with hudson at all more just our internal network infrastructure

3848286
rss	feed
what i d like to do is have a facebook status feed alongside my twitter feed see footer of this page but cant seem to find a way of doing this without creating an app to convert my statuses to rss then reading the rss in php

3848301
getattr	setattr
for normal attribute access use the getattr setattr delattr builtins

3848310
scheme	racket
i m working on a deque in scheme sicp exercise 3.23 and i ve got a simple doubly-linked list implementation i would like to test out but i can t seem to find out how to print out a circular list in scheme mit-scheme and mzscheme racket

3848315
pull	push
sounds like you could db pull from your main app and then db push into your production app

3848332
ienumerator	idisposable
and again for completeness ienumerator t with idisposable

3848332
ienumerable	ienumerator
c# s foreach keyword supports looping over anything that has a getenumerator method that returns an ienumerator and therefore you can use any type that implements ienumerable with a foreach loop

3848352
jaxws-maven-plugin	jaxb2-maven-plugin
until now my options are jaxb2-maven-plugin axistools-maven-plugin and jaxws-maven-plugin

3848352
jaxws-maven-plugin	cxf-codegen-plugin
this leaves us with the jax-ws ri and the apache cxf stacks and their respective maven plugins the jaxws-maven-plugin instructions to use the jaxws-maven-plugin can be found on the usage page and the cxf-codegen-plugin

3848378
profiler	gprof
it looks like the cpu profiler part is like so many other profilers that are based on the same concepts as gprof

3848388
packets	pcap
pcap will return a pointer to a data packets to me

3848415
free	malloc
you can have the caller allocate a new array and pass in both pointers or you can do it yourself with malloc don t forget to free

3848415
memcpy	memmove
memmove and memcpy may use such optimizations on some architectures

3848417
sip	sdp
i wrote up a couple of code project pages on getting started with sip sdp for anyone else who comes across this page it is pretty generic between languages and apis

3848427
qobject	qvector
in the moment the data is stored column-wise in qvectors together with one global timereference qvector in one seperate qobject

3848474
fread	strlen
fread does not nul terminate the buffer so strlen is not appropriate

3848482
sudo	passwd
i am a ubuntu user 10.04 as of now since i use it over a year i have to manually enter the command sudo pppoeconf everytime i turn on the computer and want to connect to the internet the i click enter some times enter my passwd of my internet provider then i click enter some more times to have internet

3848498
webrat	cucumber
cucumber using capybara and culerity we just converted from webrat in order to get coverage of js-heavy front-ends from cucumber

3848503
ubuntu	linux
i m a ubuntu 10.04 user who is looking for a way to for example make my computer type a + character when i hold down the windows key i think it s called super in linux world and press the k key

3848507
disk	ram
i believe it spawns another process to save to disk does that mean it actually copies the memory and i should always assume if i have 16 gigs of ram 8 is the max for a single redis process

3848608
post	get
the idea is to get the categories and then iterate through all post for each category

3848614
stdout	stderr	feof	fread
using php s proc_open i can start a process read from stdout and stderr separately an arbitrary number of bytes at a time using fread while the process is running detect when the process is done using feof on the stdout and stderr pipes and then use proc_close to get the exit code of the process

3848614
stdout	stderr
read stdout and stderr separately

3848614
stdout	stderr
read stdout and stderr an arbitrary number of bytes at a time while the process is running without having to wait for the process to finish

3848673
client-side	server-side
the types of client-side form fields server-side handlers and database tables match up

3848673
haskell	ocaml
there are also some web frameworks in haskell ocaml and scala that try to do some of that

3848673
haskell	ocaml
there are type-safe embeddings of sql into haskell for example or an html templating language in ocaml that doesn t allow the user to generate invalid html

3848675
stdout	stderr
read stdout and stderr separately an arbitrary number of bytes at a time

3848675
stdout	stderr
as it warns it s easy to get yourself deadlocked when you have separate stdout and stderr pipes if you re not careful

3848700
bindingsource	dataadapter
i also suggest that you read the msdn both related to bindingsource and dataadapter as you need to use both in conjunction for your functionality to work as you would like it to

3848747
innodb	myisam
apart from mysql s native full text searching solution which as you already identified requires the myisam storage engine you may also want to consider the popular third-party search engines sphinx and apache lucene with which you can use innodb tables

3848762
innodb	myisam
in fact that is one of innodb s major advantages over myisam it has row-level locking

3848805
superclass	subclassing	abstract-class	superclass
overloading means two methods or more with the same name but with different parameters just like your example.while overriding you implements a method from an interface or abstract-class so the method in the superclass has an implementation and in the subclassing has a different one still they have the same method name and parameters

3848814
post	get
i want to get my blog post ordered in however way i decide and then have comments ordered within my blog post by reverse order by date or any other sorting i want

3848817
colt	jama
generally though jama jampack and colt are getting old and do not represent the state of the current performance available in java for linear algebra

3848845
hide	show
but when i wanted to hide some of the nodes from appearing on menu while staying show on sitemappath i cannot figure it out

3848867
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
ps. firefox google-chrome and opera work a expected

3848869
keydown	keyup
keydown and keyup provide a code indicating which key is pressed while keypress indicates which character was entered

3848943
submit	submission
value and title are only examples the latter should describe what is the purpose of the submit control in a non-ambiguous way there can be many reset controls and obviously a true submission form element

3848955
uilabel	cagradientlayer	uiview	cagradientlayer
how do i make cagradientlayer draw behind the text of the uilabel or do i have to put a uiview behind the uilabel with the cagradientlayer as background

3849099
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the uinavigationcontroller for example maintains a stack of uiviewcontroller each of which handle one page of the display

3849104
int	chars
therefore i would use an int if ever possible or possibly a combination of two int - but certainly never a varchar column - especially if that column is potentially wide 10 chars and is bound to change

3849143
children	parent
in that case you can call qobject children on the widget that is the parent of all your qlineedit s if they share some common name qobject findchildren will also work

3849157
implements	extends
i am looking for hints how this is best implements starting from scratch extends prioriyqueue or queue ...

3849212
post	get
i also want to get the name slug of the post for each comment without running a query for each comment

3849229
vim	emacs
i m trying to switch to emacs from vim for a few months and faced the strange problem

3849250
rss	feed
the first thing the app does is to fetch an rss feed and then display it

3849271
folder	directory
but it will only work if i copy precompt to every sub directory and every folder that contains a .pcf file

3849327
decoder	encoder
but you can easily modify an encoder decoder to do this on android yes

3849343
width	height
i want to add a view inside a framelayout programmatically and to place it in a specific point within the layout with a specific width and height

3849373
range	minimum
instead i want to pick them according to the minimum date range in which all items can be picked

3849398
ienumerable	ienumerator
similar to how foreach is with ienumerable and the ienumerator calling getenumerator current movenext although i think it doesn t do this with arrays only collection classes

3849409
width	height
i have a site with width 100 and height 100 and overflow hidden on the body

3849423
width	height
put a link around a box with css-defined width and height for instance

3849556
persistent	transient
is transient and you don t require message persistent

3849559
post	get
the type of request to make post or get default is get

3849582
google-chrome	safari
the problem here is not the function but that safari and google-chrome thinks the scrollheight is something alot bigger than it is

3849582
google-chrome	safari
i have tried alerting the scrollheight and the nr is always around 2000px in google-chrome and safari but in other browsers it is dynamic as it should be 500 300 800 etc .

3849582
google-chrome	safari
i noticed when i click a link on the index and then click the browser back button the iframe does resize correctly in safari and google-chrome

3849582
google-chrome	safari
t figure out why google-chrome safari can #39

3849600
public	protected
on the other hand because javascript has no concept of public and private methods there are no internal methods that could be protected by simply signing a class

3849613
post	put
if you want it restful you could go about it this way put the parameters to the server at a location of your choosing or you could post them and let the server place them for you

3849613
put	get
consider this put tells proxies that they shouldn t cache the response but a retry by any infrastructure element along the line is definitely possible since it s idempotent just like get

3849614
qtcore	qtgui
also you can use the core non gui classes by themselves they are in their own qtcore namespace separate form the qtgui namespace and there are compiled to separate dynamically linked libraries

3849626
haskell	scheme
some small experience with haskell and scheme i wanted to play around with this library to learn about reasonable applications of this library

3849639
post	get
i use some java script code to get some user inputs and want to attach those to request post data

3849643
google-chrome	safari
i just asked a question about why a certain js code won t work in google-chrome and safari 100 but after more troubleshooting i think i have found out that this is the question i should be posting

3849643
google-chrome	safari
this works fine and it does in fact get resized but in google-chrome and safari the resize is setting a height higher than it should be

3849643
google-chrome	safari
so if the height is 500px then google-chrome and safari sets it to around 2000px which is the maximum of the iframe document height

3849643
google-chrome	safari
one thing that confuses me is that when i click a link on the main page and then hit back the page resize works good and is set to 500px as it should be even in google-chrome safari

3849644
hid	keyboard
i am currently trying to get simple keyboard input on osx right now i am doing it through the leopard hid manager object and that generally works but since that is pretty low level i am wondering if there is an api available that has some extra functionality build it like key repetition or unicode support since when i catch the events on hid i o level i think i have to write all these fancy extras from scratch

3849645
allocator	stl
as to the security holes if you refer to buffer overruns allocator deallocation errors the answer is stl

3849700
outputstream	inputstream
the the client is able to send requests to the server via the outputstream and read server data from the inputstream

3849747
versioning	upgrade
although in the past i managed to manually extract the stuff i needed for my work and add it to the versioning control it becomes a real pita to later upgrade it to a newer versioning - the subdirectory structure changes files change and you never really know what files are the bare necessities and what files can safely be removed

3849749
width	height
as for setting the width and height of the view also like quinn1000 said you supply the v.setlayoutparams method a layoutparams object depending on the container you chose absolutelayout linearlayout etc.

3849776
ocp	principles
i would personally recommend robert martin s articles for getting a good hold on this especially the ocp principles

3849787
imagemagick	pdftk
i need to call ghostscript imagemagick s convert pdftk etc

3849808
width	margin
if your parent div has a variable width and your images are left floated i think the only way to make sure your images are equally spaced is to declare margin 10px on all sides or at least on the left and right side

3849819
metaspace	permgen
as of java 8 the permgen space has been replaced with metaspace

3849819
metaspace	permgen
java 8 from permgen to metaspace

3849833
google-chrome	safari
at the moment it s a webkit google-chrome safari etc. specific thing you re seeing or rather not seeing as bobince points out in other browsers you can see the real url in the bar

3849873
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the closest thing i can think of is writing a firefox google-chrome ie safari plugin and have the user install it on his her browser to run your gui to control your device

3849899
boost	stl
what i found was the qt s containers were much easier to use than standard template library or some of boost s specialized ones because at the time i didn t know stl well enough

3850037
rss	feed
disable your rss feed too as google uses rss for indexing

3850042
google-chrome	firefox
its blazing fast in google-chrome and dog slow in firefox

3850042
google-chrome	firefox
in the google-chrome profiler i spend 10 in a method in firefox the same method is 30 of the execution time

3850049
rss	feed
before working on an rss feed in php i just had a few questions that aren t covered in the basic online guides

3850053
notepad++	textpad
i have neither notepad++ nor textpad installed so i can t say for sure but one of the following might work there

3850068
superclass	subclassing
assume a valid superclass and a valid subclassing ie the classes work

3850068
super	self
self super init

3850075
post	get
after processing post request your code should redirect a browser using get method

3850095
next	except
this will match anything except z and therefore stop right before the next z

3850148
width	height
i tried adding a standard iframe with height and width 100 however when i use them to display them in the simulator from the local files i cant scroll even after setting scrolling to auto

3850159
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
also do keep in mind that there is a java console on the browser ie firefox google-chrome safari you can take a look at to see what s the error you are getting on applet execution

3850176
post	get
check which will be get or post

3850177
equals	gethashcode
so i have a class which overrides equals object obj and gethashcode along with implementing iequatable

3850187
trie	tree
they are purely functional tree indexed fixed-width integers in the form of a trie and thus have fixed depth

3850212
firefox	safari
it works perfect in firefox and ie but not at all in safari

3850248
hide	show
you should hide the ul using js create the li s loaded with content and then show the ul

3850248
hide	show
in fact all the css should be hardcoded into the stylesheet hide the ul load the lis show the ul

3850249
mef	prism
now i m asp.net mvc2 + wpf and a bit silverlight programmer and after about 3 months while i s developing asp.mvc website i ve learnt many interesting things about building modular and extensible applications mef and prism about architecture di ioc frameworks ninject castle windsor structmap entityframework as orm nhibernate .

3850252
qlayout	qwidget
qwidget setlayout attempting to set qlayout on cgsearchresult

3850256
backtracking	greedy
to understand how this works we need to understand two concepts of regex engines greedy and backtracking

3850256
backtracking	greedy
possessive quantifiers are also greedy but as mentioned once they return a match the engine can no longer backtracking past that point

3850290
strstr	substr
when strstr fails to find the substr it returns null

3850294
hudson	bamboo
artifactory has oss plugins for integrating with all common build servers hudson teamcity and bamboo

3850295
public	protected
the accessibility public private protected or whether it has a definition aren t considered in this phase

3850299
pull	push
currently i m doing a heroku db pull to my local machine then heroku db push --app testapp but this is becoming time consuming

3850305
public	protected
that s true no matter what privacy level private protected or public the explicit declaration has

3850312
google-chrome	firefox
i ve logged the objects in google-chrome s and firefox s consoles and everything about them looks fine

3850312
google-chrome	firefox
i m testing this in google-chrome 6 and firefox 3.6.10 as i go and they re both puzzling me with this behavior

3850312
google-chrome	firefox
no errors or issues show in google-chrome s console but if i try calling draw only once the firefox throw this

3850313
public	protected
any copy constructor declared in the class be it private public or protected means the compiler will not generate a default copy ctor

3850332
jobs	cron
appenginefan s excellent blog also has info on scalable non-sharded counters see this one which uses task queues and points to the previous article on using cron jobs instead

3850335
ssl	https
in practice this means that the sjcl code should be served across a ssl tls session https

3850378
perl	tcl
such as perl php python tcl and

3850403
hide	show
i can then use a link to show or hide the grouped items

3850442
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
edit this has to work in opera 10.6 firefox 4 google-chrome 6 ie 9 and safari 5

3850478
idictionary	ilist
since the ilist and idictionary interfaces do not guarantee you that they are editable which was possibly a bad idea the designers decided to return the concrete type

3850526
post	get
i used this blog post to get going

3850536
lisp	scheme	erlang	lisp	erlang	scheme
examples lisp scheme standard ml erlang etc.

3850572
filtering	grouping
explanation what s happening with the filtering is that it is narrowing the li.foo elements down to the first in a grouping has at least one li.foo after it and none before

3850579
strtol	atoi
if you want better error checking use strtol instead of atoi

3850658
disk	ram
another option is to create a ram disk if you have sufficient control of the environment and copy the file there

3850709
int	boolean
exactly - between is a boolean operator which means it returns a boolean value true or false and interval wants an int

3850716
fixed-point	fractions
load movl 0x... and multiply by imull a fixed-point fractions obtaining a 64-bit result this is 32-bit code

3850720
width	height
the only way around it that i can think of is to find the image s native height width wrap it in a div with those dimensions plus a little padding

3850733
ant	cruisecontrol
on any modification an ant script is called by cruisecontrol which in turn calls a custom ant task

3850733
ant	cruisecontrol
this custom ant task needs to know which files exactly have been modified to trigger the cruisecontrol run so that it can select the correct test host based on the names of the modificated files they contain the architecture in their name

3850747
post	get
i get the controller action from the referrer that should always be set as this is coming from a post action

3850759
portrait	landscape
where you pop the sub-view off the stack and return to the previous view currently stays in landscape you d like in portrait you could try sending it to the setneedslayout selector

3850761
direct3d	direct2d
if absolute rendering speed is required you may want to switch to direct2d or direct3d for rendering

3850765
google-chrome	firefox
it works for firefox google-chrome

exif	jfif
it cannot be considered as proper usage since both specs - jfif and exif state that corresponding markers should immediately follow soi

3850868
int	chars	for-loop	arrays
i was thinking about a for-loop that checks whether the int chars is between 48-57 en if so puts the value into a seperate arrays

3850871
disk	ram
if you don t have tons of ram to support that it s going to have to do a lot of disk access and really kill performance

3850874
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie i have v8

3850880
post	get
i was going to post links to the books and sites mentioned above but apparently i m on probation till i get 10 points

3850897
setinterval	clearinterval
you could use setinterval and clearinterval

3850900
rss	feed
you can pull other content into wordpress via rss too and either have that content appear as an rss feed or have it integrated into published posts

3850934
curlpp	libcurl
i m using curlpp on to of libcurl lib in order to download videos from youtube

3850935
pop-up	dialog
the bound to dialog will pop-up

3850944
equals	compareto
in your code you have implemented compareto but you have not overriden equals so you are inheriting the implementation of equals from object and the above condition is not met

i m using netbeans and i can only get it to compile at runtime when i put the directory in the src folder

3850983
folder	directory
here s what works when i put the files to be compiled at runtime in a folder called scripts in the src directory

3850983
folder	directory
it doesn t work if i put the scripts folder in the same directory as the jar

3850983
folder	directory
i can only get it to work when i run the project from inside the ide with the scripts folder in the src directory

3850991
queue	fifo
for example here one could use the average of the values in a 128 register fifo queue

3851017
passenger	unicorn
for example it seems clear an n-mongrel ruby on rails application stack will have worse latency wait time with a queue on each mongrel than a unicorn passenger system with a single queue for each group of app workers

3851044
implements	extends
it implements in perl the grep functionality and extends it

3851076
multiplying	subtract
then you ll go back to the 23-30 bits you want to convert it to an int to do this multiplying each bit by 2 i 23 bit is 0 24 bit is 1 etc and then you ll want to subtract the offset from the int

3851078
versioning	upgrade
some time later i add a new property to one entity-type and now i want to upgrade the sql-database to fit the new versioning of the dbml-schema

3851099
int	double
either single or double quotes are fine and int will be treated the same way css does not have a distinction between strings and int

3851102
free	malloc
yes somehow free knows how much was malloc ed but it does so in a way that is not visible or accessible to the programmer

3851102
free	malloc
if you do decide to try and decode what malloc and free does then it will lead you down the road to proprietary compiler implementations

3851106
int	double
there is also no distinction between strings double int

3851217
x86	64bit
c program files x86 microsoft sdks windows v6.0a bootstrapper packages 64bit machine

3851290
decimal	ieee
sqlite internally uses ieee binary floating point arithmetic which truly does not lend itself well to maintaining a particular number of decimal

3851290
decimal	ieee
ieee decimal floating point rather uncommon or

3851309
division	multiplication
as hroptatyr mentioned the multiplication is quite fast and it s much faster than division

3851309
division	multiplication
so the basic idea is to transform the division into multiplication like

3851344
super	extends
the children simply extends this calling the super s constructor feel free to use this

3851347
rss	feed
i m parsing forum threads with nokogiri and putting them into a rss feed

3851347
rss	feed
the forum itself doesn t have rss or any other kind of news feed

3851367
int	double
either constructor is going to need a conversion int to int64_t vs int to long double

3851375
getter	setter
what you can do instead is using the good old getter setter and if there is a lot of them generate them with your ide

3851375
getter	setter
eclipse generate all getter setter in package

3851375
getter	setter
java getter and setter

3851383
getter	setter
i m not sure why creating a getter setter for each private variable is a problem but passing around strings that map to a variable s symbolic name would be hard to maintain and confusing

3851401
stdout	stderr
stdin stdout and stderr work as expected

3851402
rss	feed
you can embed html in rss items but imo that results in lousy looking feed and can lead to problems farther down the road if someone else wants to reuse the data

3851410
queue	fifo
as a fifo queue you can use for instance java.util.linkedlist or java.util.arraydeque

3851455
codeigniter	cakephp
framewok codeigniter or cakephp but i wouldn t try to work with a framework as a beginner

3851458
multiplying	division
magic division works by multiplying a number by another suitably large number rolling it over in such a way as to yield the answer of division mul imul is faster than div idiv

3851469
google-chrome	firefox
i ve check it in google-chrome firefox ie6 7 8 and they all seem fine

3851469
opera	safari
i haven t checked it in opera or safari though

3851478
realloc	malloc
msize called on a pointer returned from malloc or realloc would return the actual amount of memory the system had allocated for the user program at that address which might be more than was requested if it got rounded up for alignment reasons or whatever.

3851525
post	get
i ve tried different variations as you can see all suggestions from other post but i get nothing

3851550
hash	salt
encrypt hash and salt passwords rather than storing them plain-text

3851550
ssl	https
use ssl https for login and any pages where sensitive data is entered like credit card info

3851588
opera	safari
because some browsers older safari and opera report onload completed before css renders you need to set a micro timeout and blank out and reassign the iframe s src

3851592
folder	directory
after performing a clean build i can find stock.class in my classes stockscreener directory however when i click run main project in netbeans i immediately see the class disappear get deleted from my view of the folder

3851596
backgrounding	multitasking
specifically the sections on the application life cycle multitasking and executing code in the backgrounding

3851600
mousemove	mousedown
mousedown creates a high z-index div transparent body with a nice border which has its dimensions informed by mousemove

3851637
touchesbegan	touchesended
but the problem is when i double-tap my touchesended withevent method only fires once but my touchesbegan withevent method fires twice

3851637
touchesbegan	touchesended
since touchesbegan sets a timer and touchesended invalidates it then when touchesended only fires once the timer is still running

3851640
superclass	subclassing
sometimes you want to generate a superclass with certain functionality and allow the subclassing to wrap it up in a neat package

3851641
uiview	subviews
so to get the terminology right a view-controller is an object that manages a single full-screen view or almost full screen if it s nested inside a navigation controller or tab bar controller for example and a view is the big area managed by the view controller as well as all the subviews images buttons labels etc. within it they are all uiview sub-classes

3851691
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome 6 os x similar errors in firefox and safari

3851750
inherited	subclassing
it would be impossible for a subclassing to implement a private abstract method because private methods are not inherited by subclassing

3851771
mouse	keyboard
xevie is a x extension providing functionalities to allow users intercept keyboard mouse events

3851776
groupbox	panel
you group radio buttons by drawing them inside a container such as a panel control a groupbox control or a form

3851780
division	multiplication
when you compile this function using g++ -o2 it will not do an actual division but some magic multiplication bit-shifting and correction instead

3851790
groupbox	panel
if you don t like your container to be visible - use panel control instead of groupbox

3851790
groupbox	panel
as you can probably guess the upper one is a groupbox the lower one which is invisble but allows only one readiobutton within it to be selected is a panel

3851842
put	get
then you put the left tab corner background on the link tag and the right one the span maybe it s a bad example because you could use the list tag to avoid the span but you get my point

3851889
goto	break
goto 2 break after a maximum number of iterations or if the last iteration didn t find any improvement

3851915
put	get
when they are added they get put into another queue to be lazily compressed down via gzip or some such

3851919
draggable	droppable
i ve read lots of articles and tried everything i can think of but i can t manage all three position a draggable object make it move correctly and get the droppable object to recognize it

3851951
rubygems	bundler
c ruby187 lib rubygems 1.8 gems bundler-1.0.2 lib bundler resolver.rb 132 in catch

3851954
width	height
if i define the height and width as fill_parent it fills over the two text views

3852000
submit	submission
use a submit event handler to pick up the form submission and execute script eg using jquery

3852015
wordpress	joomla
the top cmses we re evaluating are wordpress drupal and joomla

3852019
for-loop	loops
i do realize that it is stylistically better to move the declarations outside the for-loop and the swap to the end of the inside of loops

3852061
free	malloc
so it is really ok to call free on it and it is going to release the same amount of memory you initially got by calling malloc

3852063
free	malloc
not only is it ok but the only way to free a memory block allocated by malloc is to give the pointer returned by malloc to free

3852063
free	malloc
as far as the issue of might have been casted into different types and structs etc. - there s no problem with that as far as malloc and free are concerned as long as when you free the block there s nothing left actively using it

3852063
free	malloc
however you might need to be concerned about other issues concerning casting into different types and structs such as alignement and aliasing issues - but malloc and free have no part in that as long as you don t corrupt memory outside the allocated block

3852080
post	get
my present concern is for the get request as post will be handled by the same method i expect

3852080
put	get
another approach would be to put my sso solution in front of these services which would then force people to log in if they don t have credentials so the authentication would be done by sso and since the web service directory could be a subdirectory of the main sso page then i could decrypt the cookie and get the username that way but that would be annoying for the mobile users which would include the senior management

3852091
getter	setter
in case you don t know project lombok helps with some of the annoyances of java with stuff like generating getter and setter with annotations and even simple javabean like generation with data

3852144
guava	lombok
i ve recently discovered an interesting way to create a new instance of an object in guava and project lombok hide a constructor behind a static creator method

3852155
getter	setter
followup - the lombok developers recognize that not generating javadoc comments for synthesized getter and setter methods is an issue

3852209
chown	chmod
anyway after beating my head against this problem for some time since chown and chmod don t seem to work on mounted samba shares this finally worked

3852230
ubuntu	linux
i m using ubuntu linux so i m wondering what the easiest way would be to suppress the actual browser instances showing up for the user who started the selenium instances since i am threading like 25 of these at the moment and its kind of strange annoying having all of them open

3852234
nsformatter	nsnumberformatter
creating a subclass of nsformatter or nsnumberformatter in my case and overriding getobjectvalue forstring errordescription as follows overrides the default behaviour of returning nil which makes the binding use the registered default value to instead return 0 when the text field is empty

3852263
width	height
and we want to add a comment at the line minwidth 800 minheight 600 to say this is the minimum width height of the application

3852314
jobs	cron
using cron or scheduled tasks it s pretty easy to get these jobs to run

3852331
wordpress	joomla
my best advice is to look at how other apps drupal joomla wordpress handle localization and implement something similar

3852331
translation	localization
these files are then loaded by a localization class which has functions that handle setting the language to be used based on a config value or user setting loading the file and handle the translation of the string-id into the string value

3852338
packets	multicast
binding filters incoming addresses so if you bind to an adapter address you only get packets with matching destination address unicast packets if you bind to a multicast address you will only get multicast packets

3852338
packets	multicast
to get multicast and unicast packets you must bind to inaddr_any or in6addr_any

3852444
hash	salt
because you generate the hash by using not only the data but also a secret salt only you can generate the correct hash signature for a given piece of data

3852444
hash	salt
if someone modifies your data they will be unable to make the corresponding change to the hash without the salt value

3852494
put	get
the senior programmer has told me that it s better to put this logic inside currentcustomer s get accessor because then

3852507
clang	llvm
i m using llvm clang xcode

i want to take all entries in the database and create an rss feed out of it

3852564
implements	extends
class persondaoimpl extends abstractdaojpaimpl and implements persondao and otherinterface which adds aditionalmethods .

3852579
min	max
the 0.0901 number is simply max - min 10 + smalldelta

3852592
accessor	properties
he is also anticipating not leaving it in the properties accessor but refactoring it elsewhere

3852725
groovy	gpath
in groovy you will apply it in form of gpath

3852736
rtmfp	rtmp
flash is used to communicate with rtmp server and stream video and audio using rtmfp p2p but the actual client logic is handled in c#

3852829
next	except
there s really nothing to be gained by letting them go except a if you re not actively using them you save a few steps and b a few days before expiration next year

3852877
subtract	add
i m using timers to add subtract a number from the current x coordinate to get it to move

3852919
x86	64bit
movq assuming you re talking about x86 is a move of a quadword 64bit value

3852933
jobs	cron
this would be similar to cron jobs

3852994
postgresql	mysql
many people swear by sqlite postgresql or even mssql i ve admittedly only used mysql and sqlite

3853043
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

3853043
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

3853058
fseek	fread
at the c runtime library level look at fread fwrite and fseek

3853067
hide	show
as mentioned it would be better to include other elements which you can show hide in their entirety rather than modifying content dynamically like this

3853070
cvs	svn
i m a long-time command-line cvs and svn user

3853096
width	height
the width and height of the silverlight control are such that i should get a vertical scroll bar which i do and no horizontal scroll bar

3853153
disk	ram
also it is unlikely unless your system has less spare ram than your disk controller that scenario 3 will come into play

3853189
int	double
d is for int use f instead it works for both float and double types

3853198
post	get
here type import matplotlib your package name which you are trying to import if you get an error like importerror no module named matplotlib that means as matthew f suggested you need to update your pythonpath either in user specific env or in windows system env otherwise post the error message that you are getting while running the script

3853241
rspec	capybara
i do an rspec integration test of the jquery ui autocomplete functionality by using capybara

3853382
boost	stl
i am a c++ programmer and over the years have been subjected to hearing the notion that stl is not good for use in embedded environments and hence usually prohibited in usage for embedded environment based projects.i believe stl libraries like boost are far more powerful and provide a much more faster less error prone means of development ofcourse the syntax is little intimidating but once past that i think it s a real treasure .also i find the claims that stl is heavy and increases final footprint of code absurd because since it is templatized one is only going to get compilable code which he asked for and not the entire stl

3853382
allocator	stl
coping with huge dymanice allocator by stl containers

3853407
qlist	qvector
classes like qlist and qvector can be replaced by stl counterparts without much problems but the signal slot part is something else

3853407
put	get
if it s not you ll have to get each sample out of the qvector and copy it to a memory chunk then process then put it back in the qvector

3853407
qlist	qmap
which brings us to your question about qlist qmap it can be done with any of them but they are actually designed as dynamic containers with random access iterators while you are having chunks of memory of a fixed size holding 2d data

3853439
boost	stl
finally boost is template based so if your looking at the size of generated template code it ll suffer the same as stl

3853439
boost	stl
to clear up my last statement which was just refering to boost vs stl

3853439
boost	stl
stl gains because you can pass your project around and not require a download accompanyment of boost

3853464
strtol	atoi
the process that did popen could then read that line from the filehandle it got and extract a useful pid from that using strtol or atoi and keep that around to use with kill later on after having read the actual output of its child process

3853515
udp	tcp
keep in mind that tcp has some reliability features not found in udp

3853534
submit	submission
i would like to change the default behavior of zend_form so that whenever the submit button is clicked form submission is prevented and an arbitrary javascript function is called

3853537
wordpress	joomla
it is true that drupal has got a sharper learning curve than joomla or wordpress

3853537
wordpress	joomla
but drupal i believe is more powerful than wordpress and joomla

3853537
wordpress	joomla
wordpress though fast maturing with version 3.0 is still a ways away in being as feature rich as drupal joomla

3853538
tostring	getter
the same goes for the tostring annotation and its parameters which clearly communicate the desired behavior regarding included excluded fields usage of getter or field access and wether or not to call super.tostring

3853538
getter	setter
and again by annotating an entire class with getter or setter accesslevel.none and optionally overriding any divergent methods it s immediately clear what methods will be available for the fields

3853560
google-chrome	firefox
it shows nicely in firefox google-chrome

union	distinct
distinct and union stand for totally different tasks

3853696
width	height
there are two blocks of misplaced graphics on the left and right of the activity - they are two lines just bellow the titlebar with 1px height and about 5-10px width

in my signin method apart from username and password which anyone can acquire since it s a part of a public site i receive a third parameter - the session key hash by md5 algorithm with 6 bytes as salt

3853853
ienumerable	iqueryable
there are two convenient ways of sorting a list strictly one way of sorting a list and another of sorting any ienumerable or iqueryable

3853886
integer	unsigned
what you have just done is allocated a buffer the same size as the size_t 4 byte or 8 byte unsigned integer at basically you try to allocate a buffer of essentially random size

3853901
phpunit	simpletest
i had a look at a few phpunit and simpletest scripts and i find the required syntactic sugar appalling

3853926
many-to-one	one-to-many
it generates the 3 one-to-many many-to-one entities instead of 2 manytomany entities

3853940
width	height
i tried to resize svg file to be opened in illustrator with smaller width and height pixels or cm i did this by changing width height and viewbox attributes in tag but it doesn t work at all

3853955
public	protected
to make sure the public or protected members of the base-class are properly initialized before they are used in the derived class

3853955
base-class	derived-class
to be precise the derived-class constructor is run first with an implicit call to the base-class constructor inserted as the first statement in the body of the derived-class constructor by the compiler assuming default no-arg constructors

3853956
free	malloc
since you are using malloc you should also loop through a i from i 0 to 4 and and then free a

3853980
put	get
i have put example.txt in the same folder as the source file containing the example code but i get the following error

3853982
salt	md5
then only after they ve md5 with the correct salt as per your server side comparison you re then trusting that source

3853982
ssl	https
i think you re best bet is to use an ssl certificate so your web service is running over https along with the username and password

3853982
hash	md5
as a side note if you want to hash something don t use md5 its broken

3854021
stdout	stderr
it will cause printing everything even stderr output to stdout output

3854094
httphandler	httpmodule
googling this error usually turns up the suggestion to add the correct httphandler and httpmodule into the web.config file

3854097

bear in mind also that the person writing the admin class need not have any knowledge of how user works beyond what is documented about its public and protected interface

3854258
google-chrome	firefox
tested in ie 8 firefox 3.6 and google-chrome 6

3854298
post	get
use forms and post instead of links and get

3854434
free	malloc
then at the end of the application you re free ing just the space allocated with the first malloc while you made other five allocations one for each row

3854434
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
remember for each malloc or calloc you have to have it s corresponding free otherwise you re leaking memory

3854517
udp	tcp
suppose you were forced to use tcp sockets over udp sockets ie something that silverlight insists on

3854518
jobs	cron
i ve found cronwtf to be incredibly helpful when writing crontabs - it translates your stars and commands into something more human friendly to make it easier to read strange cron jobs

3854518
jobs	cron
better yet because it s all javascript you can run it locally and noone need know about your top sekrit cron jobs

3854568
udp	tcp
you may need to scale the updates to the slowest connection and you may find that tcp udp issues are not enough of a concern as the difference in connection speeds are a far bigger problem

3854592
getter	setter
take a look at project lombok which will let you skip all setter and getter and more

width	height
i would advice to store additional information at the beginning of the shared memory width height pixel type incremental integer to know whether the image has changed from the last read...

3854708
width	height
after this header store the pixel data generated by you application which size depends actually by width height and pixel size

3854740
backgrounding	multitasking
my app works fine in backgrounding for iphone 3gs and iphone 4 if i cracked my iphone 3g in order to support multitasking whether my app works fine in backgrounding mode or not

3854748
implements	extends
for example class hashset extends abstractset and also implements set but abstractset already implements set

3854814
inherited	properties
my default.aspx.cs page inherited the basepage class and allows me to access the usersession properties as expected

3854850
atomic	interlocked
if interlocked operations are used for all accesses to the variable the lock is redundant since all access via interlocked class methods is atomic

3854865
dns	spf
you can add your application server to your dns using spf records

3854880
inherited	properties
this would allow you to access the properties from the masterpage as well as the pages that inherited from it

3854881
public	protected
then as long as usersession is public or internal or protected internal which might make good sense here it can access that property

3854882
processors	hyperthreading
its intel xeon processors have hyperthreading ht enabled so in fact there should be 24 processes running in parallel to make them fully utilized

3854882
processors	hyperthreading
however our calcs are more efficient to run on 12x100 than 24x50 so we tried to turn hyperthreading off via processors pane in system preferences in order to get higher performance

xom jdom etc

3855331
width	height
setting just the width means that the image s width height ratio will be preserved by the browser

3855366
actualheight	actualwidth
occurs when either the actualheight or the actualwidth properties change value on a frameworkelement

3855397
next	except
you can for example use eax only in one instruction at a time - the next use of eax in the next instruction bears no relationship with its previous use except for the unwritten logical connection which the programmer had in mind - this is the reason why it is so easy to create bugs in assembler

3855445

hyperthreading is a poor-man s approach to parallelisation it allows you to have 2 pipelines of pending instructions on one cpu

3855677
floating-point	integer
but it doesn t provide extra floating-point or integer arithmetic units or more registers

3855677
cpu	hyperthreading	fflush	gets
this contrasts with the situation on a cpu without hyperthreading where when the instruction pipeline stalls it has to be fflush and refilled with instructions from another process before the cpu gets back up to speed

3855677
processors	hyperthreading
if you are running loads in which pipeline stalls are perfectly synchronised and represent a major part of the total execution time of your program mix then you might double the speed of a program by going from an unhyperthreaded processors to a hyperthreading processors

implements	extends
uikit is not thread safe therefore you cannot change the view from the background all nsobjects have the selector performselectoronmainthread since nsthread extends nsobject then you can use that method to execute code in the main thread that is where you should change the uiviews frame also you must have the reference to the uiview somewhere...the way i would do it is define a protocol on the nsthread subclass and implements the protocol in the views view controller then whenever u need to change the view frame call the delegate method in the main thread to change the views frame...hope this helps

after reading the kind post i tinkered a little an voila my extreme brute force approach dont we all miss those days when elegant design was something only marketing execs spoke of to get the sale

3860111
post	get
i can get the post request to the server like this

3860149
put	get	post	get	post	put
the problem seems to be that php only really completely understands two http methods get and post with put considered to be for file uploads

3860153
post	get
for example to obtain form parameters you can use to get the form input value either query string form post or cookie with the name input1

3860169
min	max
another option is to calculate formulae for the intervals that form each edge essentially lines with a min and max value and solve these

3860197
next	except
uncheck everything except other and type ctrl+j into the field next to it

edit i m asking this question because i m making a full screen application and need to show hide based on user selection

3860265

note that i pretty much randomly pulled wterm from the ubuntu debian repositories

3860352
width	height
let w and h be the width and height of the rectangle

3860382
width	height
i m not certain as why we would want to restore the initial selection if the width or height is 0 if you do know why please leave a comment as i m interested in finding out

3860393
put	get
when i put the same line in my didselectrowatindexpath method i get a bad_access error

3860422
int	double
it logically represents a single value similar to primitive types int double and so on

3860430
solaris	irix	irix	linux
this page which i can t read right now maybe blender.org is down shows that blender 2.49b for windows was built with python 2.6 for linux irix and solaris doesn t say for macosx for powerpc requires python 2.3 for macosx for intel 2.3 or 2.5

3860430
maya	blender
python 2.5 is pretty solidly guaranteed for reasonably recent maya and blender except for blender 2.49b on macosc for powerpc only you re limited to python 2.3

3860464
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox google-chrome and ie8 in compatibility mode

3860486
google-chrome	firefox
imacros for firefox google-chrome free open source works with many ajax sites and works on linux too

3860486
google-chrome	firefox
the google-chrome version is still a bit buggy but the firefox version works great

3860490
dotnetzip	sharpziplib
i used it because it is small 6 kb compiled with just the extraction making it far smaller than dotnetzip which is more than 150 kb and is more permissive than sharpziplib

3860495
free	malloc
the implementation for this modified behaviour of free using malloc_trim could be done using the malloc hook functionality

3860513
versioning	upgrade
i leave the upgrade code the same for each installer versioning

3860530
post	put
if your in earnest i could probably put together a usable example and post it on my blog or something

3860574
subscript	superscript
other things in mathematica work like normal word processors -- you can style fonts as italic bold big small colored -- but the subscript and superscript functions common in word processors seems to be missing

3860615
multiplying	multiplication
if you are using one thread do to do one multiplication then for that thread you have to pull two pieces of data from memory multiplying them then do some logarthmic number of adds

3860620
rsa	aes
the programs i use have 2048 bit rsa and 256 bit aes level encryption respectively

3860629
hide	show
what i m trying to do is show hide a list of options depending on the approprate check box status

3860636
versioning	upgrade
well the basic processes workflow are delivered as part of the product our customers can change these processes and adapt them to their needs the problem arises when trying to upgrade to a newer versioning of the product then trying to update the database records data there are problems for records deleted or modified by our customers

3860640
spaces	delimiter
so basically you have to first iterate over the stream copying each character into another streambuffer and then when you hit a delimiter like a spaces or a comma use the second streambuffer with the time_get facilities

3860644
implements	extends
as you mentioned a class like hashset implements set but a class like treeset though it also extends abstractset implements sortedset instead which is more specific than just set

3860644
implements	extends
it extends abstractqueue but doesn t explicitly implements queue

3860678
width	height
this goes wrong early the size of the rotated bitmap is not width x height

3860687
matplotlib	scipy
update i think the following first example named tick label like annotations on the matplotlib transformations page of the scipy cookbook covers the general method you re after

3860690
put	get
unfortunately if i put a breakpoint in the position indicated in the code above then all i get is the typeloadexception with no inner exception

3860704
width	margin
slogan should have a fixed width for the margin 0px auto to center it

3860754
hash	md5
you could generate a hash on the server such as an md5 or better sha-1 or something based on the form structure which you then send back to the server on the form submission and recalculate on the server to see if the user tampered with anything in the form

3860812
wordpress	joomla
i would tend to stay away from wordpress as extending it is not nearly as simple as drupal or joomla

3860851
subtract	add
but the original load store add subtract and or etc instructions are all there

3860851
subtract	add
286 specific nuances may not work perhaps as with other new features of specific generations but the core instructions load store add subtract push pop etc all still work and will continue to work

3860851
toolchain	binutils
you will want an instruction set reference and an assembler like nasm or gas gnu assembler part of binutils that comes with most gcc based compiler toolchain

3860934
post	get
you must add a post as ie tends to cache the data results using get requests

3860943
int	chars
my view is that a c implementation cannot satisfy the specification of certain stdio functions particularly fputc fgetc if since the int needs to be able to hold any possible value of unsigned chars or eof -1

3860943
range	minimum
obviously sizeof int cannot be 1 if char_bit is 8 due to the minimum required range for int so we re implicitly only talking about implementations with for instance dsps where typical implementations would be a freestanding implementation rather than a hosted implementation and thus not required to provide stdio .

3860943
int	chars
chars converted to an int and advances the associated ï le position indicator for the

3860943
int	chars
reading back unsigned chars values outside the range of int could simply have undefined implementation-defined behavior in the implementation

3860943
int	chars
then there would be no way an application could read any data written by itself only from an input device on stdin which could be implemented so as to only give positive chars values which fit in int

3860943
int	chars
eof is traditionally -1 but may be any negative int and hence distinguishable from any valid chars code

3860953
mouse	keyboard
it s probably better to just fork out and buy a mac mini then you can use your existing monitor mouse and keyboard and it s pretty ok price wise

3860966
width	height
one of these properties is dimensions returns a class with height width and depth properties

3860971
lxml	beautifulsoup
libraries like beautifulsoup lxml or even pyparsing will make for more robust web scrapers

3860982
int	chars
because a hosted implementation must implement stdio.h and if fwrite is to be able to stick int on the disk then fgetc could return any bit pattern that would fit in a chars and that must not interfere with returning eof

3860996
backgrounding	multitasking
your app does not need to take advantage of the multitasking features but it does need to gracefully handle being put in the backgrounding and never receiving a notice that the application will quit

3861015
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
also as an addenda i d strongly suggest that you develop your sites scripts with either google-chrome with the web inspector safari webkit as with google-chrome mozilla firefox with firebug as above and or opera with dragonfly

3861099
width	height
i don t understand why you are accessing pixel data blindly by 1d index while you already know the image dimension proved by the usage of iplimage height and iplimage width and opencv does provide function to access pixel value

3861111
free	realloc
and your first realloc calls the length with 0 which is a free

3861121
lisp	smalltalk	eiffel	smalltalk
not surprising given that ruby was influenced primarily by perl smalltalk eiffel and lisp

3861143
onclick	onsubmit
all this being said it s quite possible that overriding onsubmit of the form is more in-line with your interests than overriding the button s onclick anyway as s.jones suggested but at least this should solve the mystery

3861167
filtering	grouping
you can do this by choosing the content grouping in the views filtering drop down

3861207
pop-up	dialog
use jquery dialog they are purely javascript and so pop-up blockers will not block this

3861217

i am working on ubuntu 10.04 and i am using feed-zirra to parse rss feed and i have mysql database

3861217

jboss	glassfish
once you have understood the basics you can then move forward to things like javaee and the various other frameworks and start looking into what actual java application servers like glassfish jboss etc

3861271
versioning	upgrade
it s a script that upgrade internet explorer so that it will act as a newer versioning

3861291
post	get
maybe is too easy but can t really figure out how to get this done because i don t know how to deal with custom post types and taxonomies in an homogeneized custom permalink structure

3861306
post	put
you re probably sending your request with the wrong verb post instead of put

3861387
post	put
in that i have put method or post method which consumes the json as mediatype in the rest web service

3861387
post	put
how do we pass that json as input from client side to those put and post method and how would we consume the json format in the put or post method from server side

3861404
hide	show
this hide both the elements i want to hide small and show the big form

3861426
octal	hex	octal	decimal
hex decimal octal unsigned signed string character etc are manifestations of programming languages

3861426
int	chars
it may seem logical to use unsigned chars above but unsigned int depending on the target processor could produce much better cleaner faster code

3861443
width	height
then use a single call of fillarc int x int y int width int height int startangle int arcangle to draw your crescent shape

3861465
sitecore	kentico
hope there are some people around with experience in multiple big w-cms s sitecore kentico episerver etc

3861506
int	chars
the interface for fgetc says that it returns the chars read as an unsigned chars converted to an int

3861506
int	chars
similarly nowhere does it say that you can t pass eof to fputc so long as that happens to coincide with the value of an unsigned chars converted to an int

3861506
int	chars
of course platforms where you will have real problems are those where and the conversion from unsigned chars to int is not an injection

3861540
int	chars
sizeof int 1 with one-complement s or sign-magnitude negative values or padding bits in the int type not all unsigned chars values can be converted to a valid int value

3861636
post	get
the http command would almost always be get or post and would be almost irrelevant

3861643
primefaces	richfaces
you can t use richfaces 3.3.3 and primefaces together

3861643
primefaces	richfaces
primefaces needs jsf 2.0 features and richfaces 3.3.3 doesn t work with them

3861683
ssl	https
in this case your service will be secured with https requires server certificate for ssl which has to be trusted on clients and authentication will be provided on message level with username token profile soap header

for example suppose superclass is in a.jar and subclassing is in b.jar and you re executing code in an instance method declared in superclass but where this refers to an instance of subclassing

3862026
submit	submission
somebody could submit post requests to your form submission pages without actually using your site which is the exact same problem

3862027
implements	extends
you could create an interface or an abstract class let s say typeabstract for instance that typea and typeb would extends or implements depending on your choice

3862068
post	get
i would get those strange outputs under the list of post

3862075
submit	submission
this is a noob question i belieive in a content management system as well as several other types of sites that work on submission once you submit a url in a url shortening website for instance how do you use php to redirect to the appropriate url without a 404 or without using an htaccess

3862076

3862281
listview	gridview
putting both strings and a gridview inside one single listview

3862281
listview	gridview
as per now i can only show the first item in the gridview and it acts just as a regular string element in the listview

3862292
rss	feed
yes of course you can generate rss in a view by adding a display of type feed a display just like page and block except that it generates rss xml

3862309

post	get
in particular it mentions a built in cherrypy dispatcher called methoddispatcher which invokes methods based on their http-verb identifiers get post etc...

3862755
folder	directory
if the library comes in a zip i usually decompress them under a c dev directory in order to facilitate further migrations and to make the folder shorter to type and easier to find

3862755
folder	directory
instead i will then use the cmake gui to browse for the directory where the header files and the library files are located and manually set up the correct folder

3862880
google-chrome	firefox
as to the cookie name the default name for asp.net session cookie is asp.net_sessionid but the name can be different as it can be changed in web.config or they might not be using asp.net sessions their own implementation for example so you ll have to check the cookies you get from the domain of that application you can use an http sniffer like fiddler or more easily if you re using firefox or google-chrome you can check the names and contents of the cookies you get from that domain in the options dialog box

3862883
httphandler	httpmodule
you need to watch out for things like custom httpmodule and httphandler that your root application may use but your sub-applications don t

3862955
memcpy	memset
for simple operations such as memset memcpy etc where there is very little computation there is little point in simd optimisation since memory bandwidth will usually be the limiting factor

3862966
post	get
but i don t like webob s php-like usage of get and post for parameter dictionaries because http is not limited to get and post and the distinction is not necessary when accessing params

3862972
post	get
also check the httpclient is doing a get not a post

3863010

yslow	pagespeed
while pagespeed gives us a check for leverage browser caching yslow gives us an f on add expires headers

3863094
accessor	ivar
in this line you simply assign a string value to your ivar and your accessor methods do not get called - so if you re assigning autoreleased string it may be released and become invalid

3863095
post	get
worked it out in advanced list properties you can set an option to edit only your own post however where i was going wrong is the ui still shows the edit option but you get an access denied message when you try and save....great

versioning	upgrade
today the application has told me that we need to upgrade to a newer versioning of 4.0

3863107
versioning	upgrade
we donâ t want to upgrade to the newer versioning as we will need to do it on all our client machines

3863107

a fairly tradition ear structure that wraps up your presentation layer which would be your war which can be a separate project if you like and your core business logic dao layer your single jar

3863135
ant	maven
if you do end up splitting them out i can recommend maven or ant ivy to help you structure this

3863144
yslow	pagespeed
remember that pagespeed and yslow are tools that offer guidelines and i severely frown on yslow s advice to turn off e-tags as 99.9999 of the time that makes things worse

ilist	icollection
for list explicitly yes it should be private depending on what the functionality you re exposing is supposed to do interfaces such as ienuemerable icollection or ilist would be a better choice or if you re exposing a collection see slaks reply

3863399
ienumerable	icollection
use ienumerable if client code needs to index use icollection and so forth

opera	safari
the contenteditable property works in ff3 opera and safari

3863484
free	malloc
it depends on the implementation of malloc free how exactly this memory is handled internally

3863484
free	malloc
malloc will manage the memory internally in some way and doesn t necessarily immediately return anything free to the os

3863484
free	malloc
it probably just internally marks it as free and would reuse it on later calls to malloc

3863484
free	malloc
the physical memory used might increase because the memory that is getting free needs to be swapped in if your malloc implementation stores some management information next to the allocated block for example how big the block is

installation	upgrade
installation cannot upgrade a per-user

3863518
dynamic-languages	typechecking
a lot of people complain about java these days but despite the lack of static typechecking most people would probably consider ruby and python easier to write in most cases java being a fairly simple static language-which are much harder to design well without large built-in feature sets then a simple dynamic-languages

3864036
many-to-one	one-to-many	many-to-many	many-to-one	many-to-many	one-to-many

min	max
if you hate joins you could combine the max and min managers and even then it would work if there is always 2 managers and they can t have the same name

3864283

3864990
expandablelistview	spinner
i would like to use a spinner to allow users to select values from the 2nd lvl of the array but i would like to display the selection options in a expandablelistview using the values of the 1st lvl of the array as category headers

viewdidload	viewdidappear
you would probably want to do the animate block in viewdidload or viewdidappear

3865269
post	get
however if i change the post to get and change request.form to request.querystring it does work

3865269
post	get
the problem with get is that we can t enter very much data into the description field of our form without getting a 414 error - hence the use of post

3865283
dictionary	map
like django s lets me store and retrieve nested dictionary attributes but written entirely in python to ease deployment and avoids javascript syntax for map reduce

to keep things simple i can accept the same protections in place on both dev and beta -- basically don t let it get spidered and put something short of user names and passwords in place to prevent everyone and their brother from gaining access again there s a need to be practical

3865419
onresume	onpause
i imagine such a task will never have onresume or onpause called

3865441
post	get
in addition you can mark your action method as only accepting post requests to prevent any one from trying to access it with a get request

3865513
vsto	add-in
i am convinced you are on a wrong way com add-in based on add-in express vsto or shared add-in should read and write excel cells at the same speed

3865513
vsto	add-in
vsto doesn t allow developing a com add-in supporting office 2000-2010

3865513
vsto	add-in
vsto beats add-in express in one area it allows creating so-called document-level add-in

3865563

you cannot directly use an expandablelistview for the spinner popup any more than you can directly use a listview for the spinner popup

3865596
pop-up	dialog
subclassing spinner and overriding whatever drives the pop-up dialog

3865596
pop-up	dialog
copying spinner into your project and replacing whatever drives the pop-up dialog if overriding will not work due to method visibility etc.

3865596
expandablelistview	spinner
don t use a spinner and instead use a button plus an alertdialog containing an expandablelistview or something like that

i would begin by going into the instrumentation application and selecting the leaks profiling

3865757
serializable	deserialization
xml serializable deserialization is rarely the constraining factor

3865762
int	boolean
i d guess that in your circumstance you probably want to store either 1 an arraylist of boolean flags storing the checkedness of your radiobuttons or 2 an arraylist of strings or int storing the ids or index of the checked radiobuttons

3865764
post	get
i ve made a similar chaining interface before i like your idea of using it on get post vars

3865773
qmainwindow	qpushbutton
i have a qmainwindow with 2 qpushbutton

3865799
3des	aes
if aes encryption or 3des encryption didn t require a key during the encryption process then breaking the encryption would just be a matter of trying every standard decryption method until you got a meaningful result

3865831
post	put
if you d like to pass the id value of the page to the next page in a post request without using flashdata you can put it in a hidden input box with name page_value or something

3865844
bash	zsh
since you are using bash this would also apply to zsh or similar you could use its in-built parameter substitution

3865889
post	get
using a post instead of a get isn t really going to help fix your problem because anyone can fake a post nearly just as easily as a get

3865910
vb.net	vb6
this is redundant both in the vb6 and the migrated vb.net

3865910
vb.net	vb6
so just change to this in either vb6 or vb.net

3865910
vb.net	vb6
you could just replace with this code in either vb6 or vb.net

3865914

codeigniter	cakephp
i ve spun up two codeigniter applications both relatively simple and both took twice the work twice the amount of new code than if i had gone with say cakephp

3866092
int	double
they are concrete data types--they aren t abstract but are as concrete as int and double

3866104
int	chars
fgetc returns an int not a chars so you can tell the difference between eof and a chars with the same value as eof

3866129
int	chars
the problem is that you re storing the int return value of getc in a chars which collapses 0xff onto -1 actually it s implementation-defined behavior but that s what common implementations will do

3866129
int	chars
the return value of getc is an int whose value is either in the range of unsigned chars or eof which has value -1

3866130
put	get
if i loop through the whole collection i m going to get duplicates of my property types unless i put some ugly previous value and current value comparisons in there

3866173
int	chars
i personally go for option 2 in my apps as that s how i ve seen most third-party applications do it and it avoids the slew of problems that you already brought up in your post with regards to mixing chars and int primary keys in the django orm

3866177
client-side	server-side
you ll probably need to learn both a server-side and a client-side language

3866189
width	height
to solve this problem you can set width and height of the main div

3866189
width	height
if you set width height and overflow auto you ll get also a scrollbar in case of a too long content

3866271
put	get
if you find that if you put them in one table you will routinely have to add a type check to all queries so you only get the right one then they fail the data test

i think that since you are setting both the height and width properties that the image is coming up with a weird aspect ratio

3866511
google-chrome	firefox
i tried to call my helloworld by just including javascript inside webform but when running it page is blank on both google-chrome and firefox

3866535
post	get
you were incorrectly targetting the spans and also sending get parameters over a post request

3866544
equals	compareto
unlike compareto this method considers two bigdecimal objects equals only if they are equals in value and scale thus 2.0 is not equals to 2.00 when compared by this method

3866548
put	get
afaik you can simply get the python executable and put them somewhere where the scripts can access them inside your project code

3866556
post	get
it looks like you need to get the result for hdntype from your post action first in a separate function then call submit on the form

3866608
opera	google-chrome
i can t seem to get the following functionality to work under google-chrome and opera latest versions on windows xp

getter	setter
i have the following code for a property whose getter setter i write manually using the dynamic keyword

3866879
queue	fifo
i am trying to make a fifo queue that is filled with my own class object

3866889
getter	setter
so even if you do have your own setter and getter you need to keep the retain to keep your place in memory because in the end you only have a pointer to that position and that is why the compiler tels you that you may modifying another object or what ever takes the place of your object

3866935
spaces	delimiter
delimiter include white spaces spaces tabs newlines the comment-start character | which can occur on its own line or after other text and the comma to separate operands in an instruction

3867145
typedef	struct
in addition you have to distinguish between the forward declaration of a struct and of a typedef

3867145
typedef	struct
the easiest way to have that is to use the same token as struct tag and as a typedef identifier

3867145
typedef	struct
you d have to find out to which it applies to the struct declaration or the typedef

3867192
installation	upgrade
clickonce will greatly simplify this process of installation upgrade

the ti c55x compiler i am using has a 16bit chars and 16bit int and does include a standard library

3867432
innodb	myisam
having written a similar query on a different large table i did notice that changing the engine from innodb to myisam sped up the query considerably innodb is not needed for these tables as they do not have foreign key checks

3867442
filtering	grouping
add another filtering from the drop down grouping content

3867471
int	double
double can accurately represent int up to a very large value 2 53 no rounding errors up to that value

another recommended option when profiling asp.net is to profiling using instrumentation mode

3867562
pop-up	dialog
either the pop-up disappears when the modal dialog is displayed staysopen false or it stays visible on top of the dialog staysopen true

3867562
pop-up	dialog
however i did find a work-around that approximates the behavior i wanted simply re-open the pop-up isopen true after the dialog is closed

3867582
vxworks	qnx
posix is probably the closest you will get to that being supported on linux unix osx which is unix qnx vxworks beos and many others

3867783
clang	llvm
clang with llvm will generate high quality asm files

3867795
hide	show
because this is a product with multiple clients we need to enable disable hide show buttons based on the features client have bought

width	height
but now i d like to be able to interpret parameters like height width etc

3867954
getter	setter
bean should be considered just an object for temporary state preservation having setter and getter that might have light additional functionality

3867954
getter	setter
the term bean started to be used in spring framework for instance where it is just a class that is part of application context spring container not a getter setter javabean at all

3867978
serializable	deserialization
i ask because of all the serializable deserialization that will be going on between the 3 services is probably going to consume a lot of cpu for the server and have a performance impact on the application as a whole or am i wrong

3867979
uicontrol	uibutton
you must use a uicontrol to properly get event dispatch for instance a uibutton instead of simple uiview uiimageview

3867987
versioning	upgrade
at my current job it goes without question that if a new versioning of a technology that we use in our project is released we upgrade it asap

3868014
cassini	iis
the error goes away when i remove the web.config or remove the virtual path new debugger configuration or move debugging from cassini to iis and manually create an application at new

3868014
cassini	iis
this and cassini are supposed to make it easier for my content creators to participate in development and testing with their local copy of vs2010 without having to install iis on their windows pcs

3868015
vsto	add-in
i ve got a word add-in in vb.net and vsto that exposes a com compatible object via word.comaddins.object so that the add-in functionality can be called external to word without accesses to word itself being cross-process

3868015
vb.net	vb6
the technique worked in vb6 but with vb.net it still works but it s much slower than the same code running directly from the addin via a task pane as if the calls are all cross process when they shouldn t be

3868015
vsto	add-in
but i put together this vb.net vsto add-in and expose my add-in object via the requestcomaddinautomationservice function of vsto s connect object

3868149
post	get
i make an ajax post on a page that ajax post uses two hidden fields to retrieve some data send it to the action and get some json to show up

3868159
onenote	ms-office
an alternative if you have ms-office onenote 2007 you can simply print it to send to onenote 2007 printer

3868187
width	height
never had that but one difference between your width and height is that in file_item.xml you have twice wrap_content but for width you always have match_parrent

3868205
accessor	properties
you can make members of the class private with private and provide read-only accessor by using properties readonly or simply writing only a getter

3868250
polymorphism	specialization
macros tend to be hard to debug so unless you need their ability to do string concatenations which is their distinctive advantage over templates in some cases i would personally go for a template based solution using static polymorphism techniques like as you indicated the curiously recurring template pattern and or if applicable template specialization to handle custom data structures

3868262
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is it seems to work correctly on google-chrome and on firefox 3.6 - 4.0 but in the last cases only with firebug

3868273
post	get
nick helped me get the form posting in this post but it seems to have broken the other button

3868343
mouseover	mouseout
it is like on mouseover on the delete-button is treated as mouseout of the div-element representing the post

3868346
post	get
works like this - here s how i get a single post

3868346
post	get
here s how i get a mixed-bag of post

3868346
post	get
here s how i get a collection of reviews child of post

3868359
put	get
i m sure it was a bug but not if it happens on the server or on the client side when i was working to produce a project to put a support ticket while trying to reduce it to the minimum possible it happens delphi xe was released and i m under sa so i get it the last minute

3868364
subtract	add
each particle is a div and i simply add or subtract a random number from each div s top and left position each round

3868364
min	max
i read up on math.random a little and i ve tried to use a function that returns a random number from min to max inclussive

3868364
min	max
my problem is that using the min and max from above -5 5 all the particles drift up and to the left very fast

3868364
min	max
to counteract this i have to use a min and max of -1 5

3868364
min	max
why does a min and max of -5 and 5 cause an upward and leftward drift

3868370
vsto	add-in
because it uses the native .xll interface it skips all the com integration overhead that you d have with vsto or another com-based add-in approach

3868383
children	parent
you can manage your own hierarchy using parent fields or you can make the parent object listen to its children and re-dispatch events

3868399
snmp	mib
any change in behaviour due to the order of the mib variables in the request sounds like a problem in the implementation of this mib at the snmp server

3868420
postgresql	mysql
note i m putting in my 2 cents even though i am not familiar with postgresql but rather mysql and oracle

3868420
min	max
if you want a different created_at you have the option to substitute first with other functions like avg min max or last in oracle you can also try adding order by on other columns including ones that are not returned to give you a different created_at

3868449
width	height
i wonna change it change paper width and height

3868541
mouseup	mousedown
the very definition of click incorporates the mousedown and mouseup movement

3868553
post	get
is it a get post cookie value

3868569
portrait	landscape
it seems like the actionsheet gets it s orientation from the view passed into showinview and my rootviewcontroller was in portrait mode even though my current view was in landscape

3868735
min	max
this now becomes one of the most common so sql questions - retrieving rows containing some aggregate value min max

3868760
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in google-chrome but has no effect in firefox

3868793
put	get	post	get	post	put
i don t really understand the pro s and con s of using post vs get vs put requests on custom controller actions and whether to use links or forms buttons

3868797
sorting	grouping
tmp_table_size - for some complex queries particularly those using grouping by or complex sorting mysql needs to first create a temporary table containing the data and then run some operations on it in order to create the result set

3868800
opera	google-chrome
this works for me in ie7 ff3.6 opera 9.64 and google-chrome 6.0.4

3868818
width	height
on another note getting some information would help out like the original image width and height your image width and height your html markup displaying the image and your css style

3868837
post	get
remember if javascript is disabled in the browser the above statement will fall back to a get request instead of post

3868873
spaces	delimiter
i d like to process the file field by field each delimiter by a spaces or an end-of-line character

3868885
put	get
then since it s actually the edges of each section that get rounded put each cell in its own section

3868892
post	get
all the post about this issue tell me to use gem install mysql -- --with-mysql-config path but this does not seem to work with windows as i get the same error regardless

3868912
width	height
so the trick with the jquery cycle plugin is to set a specific width and height for your images

3868918
post	get
to get this you need to truncate the post before outputting it

3868920
for-loop	arrays
before when i was using a regular for-loop i was updating a wpf progress bar using dispatcher displaying the completed by dividing the current arrays index by the arrays size

3868994
move	drag
you can call dodragdrop with a data object containing or representing the control to begin a drag drop operation then handle the container s dragdrop event and move the control

3869002
typemock	moles
in .net typemock isolator and microsoft moles allow one to isolate any class property or method - be it sealed static protected or non-virtual

3869002
typemock	moles
however while i can t speak for typemock isolator i can say that using mocks in microsoft moles is extremely slow

3869046
setinterval	settimeout
i ve been using javascript settimeout and setinterval but i think they are dependant on the speed of the computer and the amount of code in the program

3869059
setinterval	settimeout
the settimeout and setinterval functions are pretty much the best you re going to get

3869116
setinterval	settimeout
you ll have to use settimeout or setinterval in your solution but it will be inaccurate for the following reasons

3869137
typedef	struct
you cannot use just key without explicitly writing struct before it inside the definition of the structure because the structure is not yet defined typedef

3869138
ubuntu	linux
i am running this on ubuntu linux with utf-8 as locale

3869144
int	chars
if i replace all long long int with chars the code works perfectly

3869151
post	get
chris i can t post a comment on your answer i get an error when i try to so i ll just post it here

3869196
google-chrome	firefox
it provides browser addons for ie firefox and google-chrome to record a web browsing sequence

3869196
google-chrome	firefox
the firefox google-chrome addons are open-source freeware

3869235
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
stick to malloc realloc free and cast the pointers

3869260
put	get
i ve put the inline errors and warnings i get in the comments

3869263
typemock	moles
in my opinion moles typemock are not really comparable to mocking frameworks and they are surely not a replacement

3869263
profiling	instrumentation	typemock	moles
typemock and moles are not mocking frameworks in the strict sense - they are some sort of profiling which use runtime instrumentation under the hood

3869263
typemock	moles
i have no concrete figures on that but from my own experience i d estimate that instrumented tests are around 100-400 slower typemock seeming to be faster than ms moles

3869263
typemock	moles
- with typemock or moles you basically can do whatever you want and this really is a bad thing and the main argument against developing with typemock or moles

3869263
typemock	moles
if you want to cover a brownfield project with tests which was not written at all with testability in mind then you have to use one of typemock or moles in my opinion typemock is the better choice

3869263
moq	moles
if you re starting a new project you re doing a greenfield project then use a mocking framework i personally like moq because of its simplicity and use ms moles as a complementary for things you can t have an interface for .net framework types

3869286
hide	show
i m using the jquery toggle effect to show or hide more information about list elements

3869321
apache	nginx
technically i think upload has not much to do with rails but rather the webserver apache nginx so as long as the server can handle concurrent requests then there not much work for rails app to do except to move the file to proper storage and to create database record to track the file

3869336
children	parent
using parent and children you can create ul and li items respectively

3869364
stdout	stderr
if you print to stdout or to stderr for a windows application you can still access the output through redirection

3869427
versioning	upgrade
but keep in mind as marek quoted success of your upgrade dependes on what are the changes customization you have applied to the 2007 versioning of the site

3869484
interpreted-language	compiled-language
but to the extent that your assumptions are valid it s because c is a compiled-language while python is an interpreted-language

3869499
google-chrome	firefox
further it may be worth the effort trying in different better webbrowsers like firefox and google-chrome

3869508
ubuntu	linux	firefox	safari
the reason you can run the precompiled binary safari on a mac or firefox on ubuntu linux is because it s been specifically built for that operating system architecture x86_64 and set of libraries

3869555
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari do well

3869555
google-chrome	safari
jsfiddle example for google-chrome and safari only 4x more particles

3869574
haskell	ocaml
i know a few people who learned ml ocaml f# first and then moved to haskell

3869598
int	chars
int value zero sometimes referred to as the ascii nul chars

3869598
int	chars
chars whose int representations are in the range from 1 through 31 except for alternate streams where these chars are allowed

3869603
subtraction	addition
that will make it easier to do operations with this value equality greater than less than addition subtraction etc...

3869637
versioning	upgrade
i have upgrade by iphone to 4.1 from 3.1.3 versioning

3869644
accessor	properties
a properties should have get and set accessor

3869658
psyco	distribute
psyco works as a plug-in for python that basically does jit compilation so even though it can speed up execution quite a lot in some cases it doesn t produce a machine-code executable you can distribute

3869704
extjs	gxt
i have a web-application whose ui is implemented in gxt extjs gwt

3869735
sql-insert	sql-update
i tried add own sql-insert and sql-update in xml files with convert but it didn t work well eg

3869752
mp3	wav
is there a class for convert wav 2 mp3 in java

3869759
int	chars
you could consider creating an int value with the element repeated 4 times since this is ansichar in delphi 7 shifted like ord element + ord element shl 8 + ord element shl 16 + ord element shl 24 then typecast the string to a pintegerarray and loop over it length str div 4 times comparing as int instead of chars

3869788
portrait	landscape
now when i am trying to rotate the view from portrait to landscape its rotating the inside view but tabbar does not rotate and it stays at the same place ie at the bottom of the portrait mode where as every other ui are rotating properly

3869819
cout	cin
if your primarily programming lang is c++ and you are doing object oriented programming then it is going to be cout cin and endl - hands down

3869819
cout	cin
in addition to that you get the perks of having cout cin work on user defined types as well -- something that is not possible with printf scanf

3869850
gif	png
img can handle only simple image formats like jpeg gif or png

3869880
hide	show
it works for one of my li actually it looks like it appends itself to only one li and as i hover other list items it displays the show and hide functions to the last list item

3869886
cout	cin
if you were to ever debug the calls to cout cin endl etc in your debugger you will find that these are surely convenient oo wrappers over the standard c library

3869886
cout	cin
most c++ programmer are also used to see cout cin endl etc instead of their c counterparts like printf scanf and so on

3869914
post	get
i would have thought that using post variables are a bit safer that get simply because a lot of mvc frameworks use the pattern

3869966
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
workaround to avoid inherited mapping remove all of subclassing and use join to map its inherited properties

3870009
children	parent
it seems that the more safe way of cascade deleting would be to remove the children objects first brothers then clear the collection of the parent sister and only after that delete it from the context as there is something inside ef itself that tries to connect the entities and removes stuff from something else

3870040
portrait	landscape
ie want to have to default style at portrait mode and black translucent at landscape mode

3870102
scriptaculous	jrails
i have also tried installing jrails and using the scriptaculous accordion but neither of them worked either so i think i am missing some vital link between javascript and rails

3870135
put	get
i tried to google a bit the matter but put is a short keyword and i didn t get anything relevant

3870165
equals	tostring
green equals a comma so if you are calling tostring on your decimal using the culture info of any of these locations you will see a comma

3870219
uilabel	uibutton
i want to customize uitableviewcell by adding uilabel and two uibutton as its subview

3870232
width	height
i php need to resize an image so that both width and height after resize should be less than or equal to the expected resized values

3870232
width	height
it can be like 299x199 or 300x200 but not greater than 300 in width and 200 in height

3870273
free	malloc
if you really want your program to keep track of its own memory usage the only portable way to do this is to avoid using malloc and free directly and instead call them through wrappers that increment decrement a counter

3870319
google-chrome	firefox
you can go through the login process by hand in your browser and check using firebug in firefox developer tools in google-chrome etc. what requests are sent to the site when you hit the ok button

3870337
memcached	apc
of course some supporting tool is necessary see apc memcached etc

3870371
qlist	qmodelindex
from there you can get a qlist of qmodelindex objects through qitemselection indexes

3870382
hex	binary
opening it in notepad and a hex editor even with a binary format looking at it parsed as text can tell you something

3870384
slider	jcarousel
one of the websites i work on has a few jcarousel slider each inside their own accordion boxes

3870479
inherited	properties
i guess one should inherited from streamreader and then add the extra method to the special class along with some properties _linelength + _bytesread

3870480
equals	gethashcode	equals	tostring	tostring	gethashcode
it returns 4 methods inherited from object tostring gethashcode gettype and equals

3870485
vb.net	vb6
i know it is easier to read xml files in vb.net but since our appl is still on vb6 i need a work around

3870497
implements	extends
as said in the comments i have to extends another class so i just implements map that s why there is so much code

3870517
getter	setter
i want to see the getter and setter of the attribute ribbongroup in the button java class but i don t want to let the user the option to see this attribute in the xml

3870590
post	get
it s definitely not something someone should avoid because i ve seen it in ms modules as well namely sharepoint 2010 sprequestmodule this blog post of mine writing a custom ihttpmodule that handles application_start event will get you all the information you need to know about this

3870689
post	get
note that your form parameters are currently open to tampering regardless of whether you submit via get or post

3870745
ssl	https
since the tcp connection might be closed between login and subsequent https requests i think this means that the ssl context must be released by the server so with the new get request the new tcp connection must be established and the new ssl tls handshake must be done new shared password for the encryption must be exchanged by both sides etc.

3870753
onchange	onsubmit
of course i can move the onchange javascript code in the onsubmit attribute of the doing something like that

3870757
post	get
the problem is that when i get this data in post from php with boxes json_decode _post data it seems to remove slashes eg

3870762
submit	submission
to submit products to gmc i need to create several thousand sub-accounts one for each user of the site i m submission

3870811
aggregate-functions	sum
first of all you are not allowed to use aggregate-functions sum in your where clause

3870817
post	get
for some reason when i use post i don t get any data returned in the responsedata div

3870817
post	get
but if i change post to get and request.form to request.querystring i get my data as i should do

3870824
width	height
you can get height and width of glsurfaceview from parameters in onsurfacechanged and store them in private fields

3870836
superclass	subclassing
your vector only allows subclassing of superclass

3870856
ssl	https
that s the ssl https layer s responsibility and that s why https ssl is nice

3870868

3871027
jsf	wicket
i want to use jsf or wicket for presentation and jpa hibernate for my persistence layer including transaction-management

3871038
hide	show
needing to show the window only to hide it immediately again should be avoided if possible

3871070
oncreate	ondestroy
their method is to start tracking activity in oncreate and then stop tracking in ondestroy

3871070
onresume	onpause
therefore i chose to do it in onresume and onpause instead but that means that new sessions gets opened when a new activity is opened

3871089

3871145
post	get
having a seperate get method and a post method with a rest.restrict post decorator

3871145
post	get
problem -- if there were validation errors then you can t redisplay the form with the data which the user entered because you have to redirect back to the get method or you have to render the template directly from the post method

3871182
post	get
if you have not already figured it out i will post the code when i get to a machine with vb6 installed

3871198
getter	setter
since it s a simple inner class and one must be readonly while the other a dumb read-write no logic in the getter or setter there really isn t much to choose between here

3871201
post	get
similarly in java servlets have dopost and doget methods to provide different behavior for get and post requests

just execute the function wherever you want for example in oncreate or in onresume onstart

3871642
post	get
however once the page that doesn t require authentication the server doesn t respond with 401 is hit terrible things happen - the zero-length post is promptly forwarded to the application and all sorts of weirdness ensues - forms don t get submitted properly files are not uploaded and so on

3871648

note if you want to show hide the element with click on the same element you need to use slidetoggle instead of show

3871678
google-chrome	firefox
i need this to work in ie 7 google-chrome and firefox

3871740

the point of using the same package is to expose protected methods variables to your test classes but not to a public api

3873548
stdout	stderr
it s one of the three file descriptors stdin stdout stderr that are always open by the os when it spawns a new process

3873635
next	except
which sounds like a classic memory leak except that if we use any tool that forces a full gc hitting the collect garbage button in jconsole or running jmap -histo live etc the old gen suddenly drops to 500mb used and our application becomes responsive again for the next several hours during which time the same pattern continues - after each full gc more and more of the old gen is full.

3873710
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i m trying this on a windows machine and it doesn t work in any browser firefox opera ie google-chrome

3873768

uiview	subviews
uiview has a subviews property returning an nsarray unfortunately the array does not reflect the view stack ordering

3873803

as far as content type inherited the properties value should persist as long as no other child content type or list template overrides your setting

3873823
cas	opensso
recently i worked with cas from jasig you can also check opensso or josso to have a sso

3873833
kde	gnome
if you started eclipse from kde gnome and kde gnome was started before you made that change then kde gnome never had the definition and therefore eclipse did not either

3873833
kde	gnome
also depending on your default shell setting you may find that kde gnome is being started through bash or something else meaning that you ll need to modify .bashrc instead of .cshrc

3874023
firefox	safari
this seems like it would be a pretty useful trick so far it works in safari and firefox

3874035
strcpy	malloc
or you can allocate memory yourself with malloc and copy characters manually or with a function like strcpy

3874035
free	malloc
this particular declaration is thus mutable and your are free to modify the content of the string which in the end is just a dynamically allocated array of characters allocated with malloc

3874050

perforce	svn
i ve setup the following system using svn sorry we can t use another repository before someone suggests switching to git or perforce or one of the myriad of other options

3874274

but it looks like that the browsers safari firefox tested are not cacheing the response

3874286
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
you will need to use a fileinputstream fileoutputstream

3874533
gif	png
when doing a patch resize to a big bunch of jpg png and gif files php drops dead quite unexpectedly with the following error message

3874548
google-chrome	firefox
the effect looks good in google-chrome or even internet explorer 8 but in current version of firefox 3.6.10 this text gets really strange greenish colour instead of nice pale gray

3874567
cassini	iis
i d also say that in 2010 with iis express coming it makes no sense investing any time nor heartache in fighting cassini

3874571
explode	implode
in the meantime i think you are looking for explode and implode

3874602
width	height
i tried then making that element a fixed width and height with a background colour however it didnt display properly in ie6 - which i have to support

3874612

3874657
floating-point	fractions
so long as your floating-point input has no fractions part then a suitably large biginteger format should be able to represent it exactly

3874667
nhibernate	queryover
linq and queryover are completely different query methods which are added to the ones that existed in nhibernate 2 criteria hql sql

3874704
int	chars
the need for the proper alignment sometimes means that when you want to create an int array in an arbitrary chars array you might have to shift the beginning of an int array forward from the beginning of the chars array

3874704
int	chars
for example if the chars array resides at 0x1001 you have no choice but to start your constructed-in-place int array from the address 0x1004 which is the chars element with the index 3

3874704
int	chars
in order to accommodate the tail portion of the shifted int array the chars array would have to be 3 bytes larger than what the evaluates to

3874715
queue	fifo
which means that the queue uses an already existing container and is just really is an interface to this container as a fifo queue

3874724
accessor	properties
since you declared your properties as retain using the properties accessor to set it automatically retains it

3874724
accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
so when you initialize you either have to take ownership and set the ivar directly or do like you re doing and use the properties accessor to set the properties and then relinquish ownership in the init method by either releasing an object you own or as you did in your second instance using the convenience constructor so that you never owned the returned instance

3874724
accessor	properties
so just remember if you ever use the properties accessor even within the class itself you will get the features you set on the properties nonatomic retain etc.

3874724
accessor	properties
you use the properties accessor whenever you do one of the following

3874757
wan	lan
however the benefits of the version control system when used locally lan is lost because of the replication process wan which doesn t know how to merge

3874770
google-chrome	safari
i am trying to get a website that runs fullscreen for all pages i have looked over here ipad webapp full screen in safari and followed that and my index page fills the screen just nicely but whenever i click a link to another page even though that page is all setup with the meta tags it pulls the google-chrome bar back in and all the alignment goes out

3874782
parent-child	one-to-many
i have a one-to-many relationship from parent-child and a many-one relationship from child-parent

3874832
spaces	delimiter
the array of people have keywords that i have already analyzed delimiter by spaces

3874851
mouseover	mouseout
hopefully i d be able to customize various parameters such as how long after the mouseover the tooltip appears how long the tooltip remains visible after mouseout and the ability to keep it open until it is explicitly closed via a close button on the tooltip popup

3874870
folder	directory
gzip doesn t do compression of folder directory only single files

3874940
put	get
is there a way i can put a text object into the design and then somehow get hold that of that object in my java program

3874956
strncmp	strlen
i would also suggest using strncmp and giving a length limit in general if you are using the c string library you should use the n version of the functions strnlen instead of strlen so that you put a bounding length on the operation this helps to protect buffer overflows and potential security holes in your code

3874964
installation	upgrade
when an upgrade installation is run the new jar is installed but the old jar also remains

3875128
for-loop	loops
in a working version of this script i cut the for-loop and just numbered each upload individually i had this piece of code without loops 10 times each with its own number

3875129
banking	payment
for instance - internet banking has a list of tabs for accounts payment tools reports

3875129
banking	payment
its not going to be making the actual payment but it will at some point integrate with a leading bank s internet banking system

3875147
uilabel	uibutton
i have an iphone app with a main view that has a uilabel and a uibutton

3875160
for-loop	loops
they are functionally identical however it can be argued that the for-loop is less error prone because all of loops functionality is right there together

3875165
post	get
get the client post data as a map

3875165
gzipinputstream	bytearrayinputstream
final gzipinputstream inputstream new gzipinputstream new bytearrayinputstream gzipped

3875177
for-loop	loops
generally the difference between a while loops and for-loop is syntax and not performance related

3875207
put	get
this is so that i can get the html.somefunction to work without having to put using at the top of all my pages

3875212
folder	directory
then i searched the original python s sqlite3 package original directory from the python s standard library location and placed it in the jython s lib folder

3875214
post	get
only if you don t maintain your summary table all the time you can get around this locking problem but a more detailed discussion of this is beyond the scope of this post

3875240
realloc	malloc
appart from all the obvious realloc and malloc answers if your using msvc you can use _expand which will attempt to resize the block without moving it

3875270
children	parent
you can do a first pass over the table to build all of the nodes build a hashtable from name to node then do another pass where you can add parent-child relationships between two nodes add parent pointer to child and add child to list of children in the parent

3875317
maven-shade-plugin	pom.xml
i was using maven-shade-plugin with true and it was removing the org.apache.commons commons-email jar dependencies in installed .m2 project a pom.xml file

3875326
move	drag
however the views and buttons don t seem to process touch and move drag events

3875326
portrait	landscape
it s as if the last 1 3 of the screen 480-320 doesn t propagate events to receivers after a rotation to landscape from portrait

3875364
fadein	fadeout
the like button fades in and out for each new image using jquery fadein fadeout again being called with externalinterface

3875419
for-loop	loops
the one notable difference between a for and while loops is that a continue statement in a while loops will branch to the top of loops while one in a for-loop will branch to the third part of the for clause the one after the condition usually used to bump variables

3875421
onclick	onchange
in my case the workaround was simple for my case it was valid to use other event instead of onchange not sure if it was onclick or onselect so i attached my code to this other event and my code worked but i m not sure if this could work for you

3875471
post	get
normal get post the statelessness

3875472
ubuntu	debian	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	debian
it is already packaged at least for debian ubuntu gentoo is os and de independent and has graphical and command line interfaces

3875495
for-loop	loops
as to when it became popular to postincriment in for loops my copy of k r 2nd edition uses i++ on page 65 the first for-loop i found while flipping through.

3875496
pem	pkcs#12
there is an option in the demo to import a certificate from the browser s keychain however it involves a manual process at the moment exporting from the browser as pkcs#12 and importing as pem

3875497
qtcpsocket	qsslsocket
for ssl tls connections u should using qsslsocket instead of qtcpsocket

3875516
for-loop	loops
if you re performing a count-based loops then a for-loop would make the most sense

3875547
client-side	server-side
ajax has solved a lot of problems by streamlining user experience and allowing the developer to control the flow server-side and client-side scripting

3875603
move	drag
and then in the drag and drop code which is the move dragger and up functions you have to make sure to deal with both the clicked on element and its associated element

3875611
width	height
for example i might start with a with a certain size possibly dependent on its contents width height auto

3875611
width	height
i ve tried copying the element s float clear position width height margins and padding but this is a little cumbersome

3875666
outputstream	inputstream
for the socket i m going to return an inputstream and outputstream that are wrapped by logging to intercept the data

3875698
serializable	deserialization
the biggest benefit is that as you build your data object over time the serializable deserialization will grow with it

3875702
inherited	properties
another approach is to have all your objects inherited from a shared base class that has a color properties

3875723
ubuntu	linux
these projects would be build on linux specifically ubuntu if that makes a difference

3875769
cvs	svn
in mercurial and unlike in svn and cvs adding a file overrides the .hgignore file so you can put this in your .hgignore

3875770
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works in ie7 and older and google-chrome safari and firefox

3875780
int	chars
however strange things happen when i enter invalid values such as values larger than the maximum storable int or chars

3875959
hash	md5
ideally you should use sha256 although md5 would work because the attacker doesn t know the hash value so collisions don t come into play

3875968
uncaughtexceptionhandler	runnable
use a modified version of mark peters solution but instead of assigning a uncaughtexceptionhandler you wrap each submitted runnable into a runnable of your own which executes calls run the real runnable inside a try-catch-block

3876058
postgresql	mysql
but in low traffic sites mysql postgresql is better

3876058
postgresql	mysql
i prefer mongodb for analytics web clicks counters logs you need a 64 bit system and mysql or postgresql for main data

3876123
explode	fgetcsv
however explode ing on | makes me think fgetcsv may work too and if that works a load data command in mysql could possibly skip php altogether

3876130
free	malloc
the memory addresses reported by mtrace are the locations where the malloc and free functions are called

3876196
hide	show
however some tools will hide some results pgadmin will only show the last and some tools have some sort of requirement to get to the next result set .net s idatareader s will not allow you to read from the second resultset until you call nextresult

3876196
union	distinct
you can also choose between union all or union distinct the default where the latter will only send rows that aren t repeats

3876215
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

3876226
addclass	removeclass
but if you need to use the method twice you might use removeclass and addclass instead so the script reads better

3876229
mouse	keyboard
just remember that user may interact with those widgets using either mouse or keyboard and even using ctrl+v to paste text

3876262
width	height
the basic idea is to determine the largest rectangular area of the source image having the same aspect width to height ratio as the thumbnail image and then trim off crop any excess around it before resizing to the thumbnail s dimensions

3876279
folder	dir
trying to have dir command that displays size of the sub folder and files

3876279
folder	dir
these soultions are great but i am looking for something resembles dir output handy and simple and that i can use anywhere in the folder structure

3876286

lxml	libxml2
libxml2 used by lxml will check for the existance of a catalog in etc xml catalog and the xml_catalog_files environment variable see libxml2 docs

3876338
vsto	add-in
this works ok but i have done two unrelated projects recently that were deployed with click once in one case and as a vsto outlook add-in in another case and that was a much nicer experience for end users mostly because of the auto-update features of clickonce

3876338
vsto	add-in
the other idea i had was to create an outlook add-in project and somehow put these classes in that project and use the vsto publishing functionality to push it out

3876382
post	get
the route that received the ipns was setup to receive get requests and not post request

3876477
websphere	ibm
update the apache-jvm is handled by either mod_jk or via ibm http server connection to websphere

3876492
stdout	stderr
i m writing a program that forks multiple child processes and i d like for all of these child processes to be able to write lines to stderr and stdout without the output being garbled

3876492
stdout	stderr
both the main process and the backgrounded one the child process share the same stdin stdout and stderr filehandles

3876558
hide	show
there was a lot of extra code to hide and show each ddl according to what the user did that is unnecessary for getting to the bottom of your problem

3876598
folder	directory
the directory i want to upload is huge so going through folder one by one is out of the question

3876633
freemarker	velocity
you could reuse jsp as view layer and switch later to freemarker velocity

3876638
super	extends
it is super light-weight with a lot of options and flexibility to extends to do almost anything you could want

3876677
hide	show
when building a report in business intelligence studio 2008 i ve noticed that the hide show details indicators default to a plus sign + if the row s are set to display when the report is initially run

3876679
google-chrome	safari
i don t have safari installed nor google-chrome but would like to know roughly how much of the browser market will behave with my site especially as i m using a lot of timers screen measurement etc

3876683
put	get
you might need to do some fine-tuning i m not at a place where i can easily put together an exact code sample but this should get you going in the right direction

3876770
pop-up	dialog
the strange thing is that the dialog window that pop-up does not implement dragmove and i m not dragging around my mainwindow either

3876797
button	checkbox
see a complete demo on jsfiddle uses a checkbox instead of radio button

3876846
disk	ram
much cheaper to add the appropriate disk space which you need anyway and ram

3876885
for-loop	arrays
then use i and al within the for-loop constructor so you are not recalculating the length of the arrays on each hit along with a var creation over and over

3876948
ubuntu	linux
the application is installed on ubuntu linux so whatever my solution it can t be some hokey windoze-only solution

3876958
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
so i guess you simply want to show a uitableview inside a uinavigationcontroller inside a uitabbarcontroller

3876962
width	height
the way i understand this which maybe incorrect is that self.navigationcontroller.view.frame was same as self.view.frame and both were equal to x 0 y 0 width 320 height 480

3877038
robocopy	xcopy
i think you can use a synhronization tool like microsoft sync toy or use xcopy with d param in postbuild options or robocopy

3877044
post	get
this meant that all data had to either be loaded at load time or you would have to bounce data along via get or post operations load page change data send data load page etc.

3877044
post	get
neither loading an entire data set into the client nor reloading the base page with each get or post request was cheap in terms of resources

3877102
subtraction	addition
you can store times as a struct timeval there are macros for doing addition subtraction with struct timeval values

3877191
versioning	upgrade
if you could be impacting multiple projects then it might be better to actually package it with the application as you can control when you upgrade to the newest versioning of the jar on a per project application basis

3877207
min	max
its fairly easy to prove for specific case of min and max but for aggregates in general its a tough case

3877210
internationalization	localization
the broad topic you re asking about is called internationalization and localization or i18n and l10n for short

3877223
superclass	subclassing	accessor	superclass
in addition to the reasons stated which can mean ub or disaster you may end up with objects reconstructing themselves and unnatural dependency cycles among subclassing that override accessor - the subclassing may have established their own dependencies although the subclassing ivars are effectively out of reach and should not be known to the superclass

3877274
hide	show
datatables is now supporting colvis which allows you to show hide columns as well as fixed header fixed columns

3877274
sorting	filtering
with the amount of data you d dealing with you could also take advantage of the sorting filtering and paging to make it a little easier for the end-user to consume

3877292
min	max	width	height
the size policies will work in combination with your min max height width settings and those of the other widgets in the layout

3877301
openssl	crypto++
i don t know the actual size increase caused by crypto++ the latest openssl dll s size that you need to deploy along with your application is around 1.5mb

3877324
post	get
yes you can post all you want even works...but you won t get a response back

3877324
post	get
this works the other domain will get the post

3877392
implements	extends
i don t fully understand your usecase but you can try to implements a custom formatter or handler or you can extends an existing one like simpleformatter filehandler

3877422
for-loop	arrays
this is nested inside another for-loop which creates an arrays of the movieclip rows

3877452
inherited	subclassing
this allows you to manipulate a large assortment of animals knowing they all have a set of common methods expecting the same arguments without creating an inherited nightmare by just subclassing

3877472
integer	unsigned
to make this a bit cleaner instead of casting the address to an unsigned integer i d consider saving the address of the callback in an array and passing its index in the array instead

3877525
webrat	cucumber
we use delayedjob to run some of our long running processes and would like to test with cucumber webrat

3877526
width	height
the inner properties name length width height are then understood as regular properties

3877526
width	height
i can serialize and deserialize a custom tbox object that has name length width and height properties

i want to display all these images at once as a cuboid with 50 alpha and navigate using keyboard or mouse

3877604
button	checkbox
the validator fires when i click the submit button and if no checkbox are checked indicates the validation has failed

3877604
button	checkbox
however if i check one of the checkbox the validation message does not go away until i click the submit button again

3877650
for-loop	loops
some languages such as ada enforce this by making the for-loop counter a constant within loops body

3877687
hide	show
show or hide comments based on the server response

3877687
hide	show

post	get
it seems that immediately after a new user registers the google crawlers are going to the same registration webpage which i send information to as a get instead of a post for reasons which i will not get into

3877826
width	height
using css you can change the width height padding etc

3877834
for-loop	arrays
then i used a for-loop to assign the one that i have fetch to the arrays

togaf	enterprise
enterprise architect usually via an enterprise architectural framework like togaf or zachman

3877841
bash	zsh
in bash zsh and others

3877843
put	get
so- i put a try catch around the problem area naturally to try and get some sort of feedback on the error

3877854
opera	google-chrome
i tested this in webkit google-chrome 6.0 ff3 opera 10.6 ie7 ie8 ie9 even ie quirks

3877867
mousemove	keydown
you could maintain a variable lastactivity which is updated on each document mousemove or document keydown

3877876
post	get
first off yes i know this is insane i m not going to get into why let s just accept for a moment that img src is not working because of security constraints but an ajax request with the proper authentication in the post will pull back the image

3877934
post	get
note you are using post and not get http method in the code you provided

3877986
median	percentile
as one good programmer can be more productive than two average programmers i vaguely remember an old ibm study concluding someone in the top percentile was 27x more productive than median it s useful to see the same programmers doing it both ways

3878003
stdout	stderr
with the php 4.3.0+ cli binary these three streams are automatically available identified with the constants stdin stdout and stderr respectively

3878004

thanks to the invaluable help of stack overflowers i have my jquery working perfectly in firefox safari google-chrome oprah

3878016
ssl	https
that s what https ssl tls is for

3878016
rsa	aes
it s a jquery plugin that will do aes encryption and can utilise an rsa public key

3878024
ssl	https
http over ssl tls https is secure enough

3878024
rsa	aes
2048-bit rsa and 256-bit aes should be secure enough

3878025
width	height
the click method should be similar to assuming a single post to save all the dropped items x y width height original object id

3878079
profiling	debugging
right way to find what cause performance problems in vim is to profiling it or check debugging output optionally - comparing with vim setup without troubles

3878087
fadein	fadeout
you can also use the fadein and fadeout methods

3878112
accessor	properties
another curve-ball for you - as you know poco s with ef mean the poco s have all the properties on the db - so i might have a postid properties with get set accessor as ef needs to get set these properties

3878135
subtraction	addition
using two s complement to represent negative values has the benefit that subtraction and addition are the same

3878137
spaces	delimiter
perhaps you should just get the line allowing n to be the delimiter and then just iterate through and tokenize the input by spaces

3878147
subnet	packets
and even if you did use the ip address associated with the default route and told the users of the other hosts about this address there s no gaurantee that a packets from their end to your host will arrive because their hosts might be on a different subnet not accessable via the default route

3878152
bufferedreader	bufferedwriter
you should be comparing bufferedreader and bufferedwriter

3878152
outputstream	inputstream
the basic reason for that is that different types of reader s and writer s may have different ways of being initialized and different ways of functioning not necessarily wrapping an inputstream or outputstream at all

3878165
children	parent
i have a parent class and a children class

3878165
children	parent
in a parent class i define a function f and want to print in it name of children class that extended parent class and name of children method that called this function

3878198
int	chars
this could be done in a variety of ways all of them boiling down to converting each chars 0 .. 9 to the corresponding int 0..9

3878243
for-loop	loops
thus you could use a for-loop only in places where you know loops will run for certain pre-determined number of times before the actual loops execution starts

3878271
for-loop	loops
when someone else comes along and decides to add modify loops if they are using a for-loop the person doing the modification can generally be confident that so long as they don t mess with items inside the for expression s they aren t going to break iteration in loops

3878293
inherited	properties
since fiction inherited from book fiction has a title and author properties

3878325
free	malloc
in a modern os all the memory gets paged out to disk if needed anyway so feel free to malloc anything up to a couple of gigabytes

3878331
realloc	malloc
prefer a temporary file if you need want it to be visible to other processes and malloc realloc if not

3878346
fgets	getline
i ve done a whole series of answers on the pitfalls of using functions on non-controlled data enter user 14860 fgets into the search box above some of which here here and here for example include a perennial favourite function of mine getline for safer user input

3878357
post	get
what we have noticed is that we get some people liking the article on our website and some liking the wall post but we d prefer to have the total number combined but i am not sure if this is at all possible because really they are two different subjects

3878363
mouseup	mousedown
the three arguments are references to the functions that handle moving dragging starting mousedown and the stopping mouseup

3878363
width	height
to make an object resizeable you would simply create a second set of drag and drop methods for the resizer and just adjust the target elements height and width based on dragging the resizer

3878382
jboss	weblogic
deploying it on other application servers turned out to be much more difficult jboss weblogic websphere but there are not many reasons for this usually we had few but dropped this after several attempts basically failed

3878421
for-loop	loops
move the for-loop the bubble_srt call outside the while loops

3878444
unix	bsd
found on bsd unix systems which

3878528
selecteditem	selectedindex
also setting selecteditem null or selectedindex -1 don t work either

3878529
udp	tcp
for tcp but not for udp kernel does not keep track of application write boundaries only of how many bytes are there to send how many have been ack-ed etc

3878530
debian	linux
i doubt the windows code will run under os x maybe not even the fedora linux rawhide under debian linux

3878534
put	get
you can just as easily put an entire application in one big honking source file but you may find that the file will get rather big leading to the compiler complaining about it or at least taking a long time to compile it

3878549
shadowing	named
this gives you greater leeway in reusing variable named without chance of collision albeit at the expense of increasing potential shadowing

3878552
post	put
from my extremely rusty recollection you sort of treat the put methods the same way you treat post methods

3878552
post	put
the main difference between them put post is in the meaning

3878552
post	put
put typically creates a new resource at the uri whereas post can append to it there are also a few other meanings to what exactly post does

3878572
uialertview	uipopovercontroller
basically the best way to do this is to implement custom uialertview subclasses that look behave how you want via custom animations and being able to click behind and disappear if you want that functionality as uipopovercontroller has it

3878590
min	max
the min and max value is set 0-20

3878614
packets	multicast
the caveat being you can only receive broadcast and multicast packets unicast packets are delivered to the first open socket

3878665
scrollable	panels
you need to make the containing panels implement scrollable and set the preferred scrollable viewport size according to the width

3878666
uiview	calayer
every uiview subclass has a calayer attached to it so you aren t restricted at all in terms of where you get your mask or maskee from

3878744

properties of book are inherited by the two derived class

3878899
width	height
so i need to calculate image and each string s position including their width height to measure the cell height and wrapping areas

3878907
phpunit	simpletest
it s all syntactic salt that saves overhead from the phpunit simpletest point of view

3878932
google-chrome	firefox
at first i thought it s bug in a browser but i tried it in firefox google-chrome and ie9 and they all behave exactly the same way

3879023
width	height
the way i m doing this is by resizing the canvas so that the height and width are the same

3879023
width	height
if the height and width are different i change the higher of the two so that it is the same as the lower 600x500 becomes 500x500

3879035
for-loop	loops
you can break down a classic for-loop into a while loops and still be equivalent

3879346
superclass	subclassing
you can however access superclass fields from subclassing so you could do something like this

3879360
superclass	subclassing
while methods defined in subclassing can look up the hierarchy to resolve fields the same is not true for classes defined higher up in the hierarchy superclass won t look down the hierarchy to resolve fields and their values

3879390
post	get
i ll post the code that i m trying to get to work

hide	show
html input element hide and show using link tag

3879625
hide	show
example yahoo mail bcc hide and show

3879779
min	max
it is best to add min and max size limits to the child pages to avoid things collapsing too small but that is a design issue

3879788
stdout	stderr
it almost seems as though stdout is captured but stderr isn t

3879798
disk	ram

3879895
gridview	sqldatasource
i require all changes such as inserts updates and deletes to a table to be auditted and i m using a simple sqldatasource and gridview with automagically generated insert update delete statements

3879895
put	get
problem is when a row is updated i want to get the id primary key and put that into the auditting table - but because the only parameters for the update query is the actual data and not the primary key i don t know how to access this information

3879955
sin	sqrt
use + - and other operators along with sqrt abs sin and other functions available in the standard library to massage the data you can create some functions of your own too

3880006
int	boolean
is a boolean expression which when used like this gets converted to an int with true becoming 1 and false becoming 0

3880009
int	boolean
when casting this boolean to an int for subtraction it will become 1 if true 0 else

3880021
int	boolean
will return a boolean true or false and that is the implicitly cast into an int 0 or 1

3880022
mouse	keyboard
from my understanding this part_ tells the parser compiler to include the default behaviour of the control template such as mouse events and keyboard presses as well as automation properties

3880207
bazaar	trac
my project does private bazaar + trac hosting

once you have built your visual you can render it to a file using an encoder .net has encoders for jpeg png bmp gif tiff and wmp

3880285
post	get
you can have a look at the following post on how to create a blurred image effect i don t think it s the best fasted method but it might get you started

3880289
filtering	grouping
filtering - grouping - content - here field which create in content type cck date must be shown...

3880296

problem 1 wants to hide a method constructor while problem 2 wants to show not only one but multiple method constructor

3880381
google-chrome	firefox
i have no problem in firefox but google-chrome and ie give me an empty responsetext while xhr.readystate equals to 3

3880384
folder	directory
yes - it does suck however you can use the assets folder and have sub directory in there and load images that way

3880393
inherited	properties
you do this by chaning the inherited properties of the page directive like this

3880433
post	get
if you post your site domain and urls that you want to get indexed

3880658
draggable	droppable
on click of this close the original element should again become draggable and should be removed from the droppable div

3880658
draggable	droppable
i have written a handler for the close anchor as follows it removes the element from the droppable but it doesn t make it draggable aggain

3880681
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
depending on how your app works you may want to create another managing viewcontroller to present specific views in a manner similar to a uitabbarcontroller or a uinavigationcontroller

3880708
width	height
but the problem is this event is fired before the form is actually resized - so when the form is maximized i get the height of the form before it was maxmized but i want the width of the form after it has been maximized

3880775
width	height
my solution is to iterate over all links all a elements grab their location top left height and width values and href and create a new a element at the same position placed in the upper layer

3880791
ftp	telnet
it s not the http library it s often made out to be but a generic data transfer library for ftp sftp scp http put smtp telnet etc

3880791
querypath	phpquery
for scraping try phpquery or querypath

3880810
hash	md5
then you can calculate md5 or other hash sum on the dump files and compare them

3880837
slideup	slidedown
the slideup and slidedown functions could also be used to achieve this

3880893
post	get
this doesn t require any generation or other trickery just a normal jquery ajax post or get whatever s needed

3880931
folder	directory
i have not specified a fixtures directory in my settings.yml so according to the docs django should be looking in my app fixtures folder

3880957
int	chars
question about int and chars in c

3880957
int	chars
i rememeber from my studies that chars are little int and viceversa and that s okay to me

3880987
boost	stl
the lesson in general is never pass stl container boost or anything of the like

3880995
int	chars
the c format parameter interprets the corresponding value as a chars not as an int

3880995
int	chars
however when you lie to printf and pass an int in what you tell it is a chars its internal manipulation of the value to get a chars back as a chars is normally passed as an int anyway with varargs happens to yield the values you see

3881168
children	parent
i need to find a parent with parameters are children id

3881168
children	parent
ex find a parent has exactly children 1 2 3

3881168
children	parent
i tried where child_id in 1 2 3 but it will return incorrect parent in case parent has children 1 2 3 4

3881172
width	height
attributes like height width and val of on content change

3881186
gif	png
i am more familar with gd so i ll suggest you check out the functions imagecreatefromjpeg png gif imagecopyresampled which can both crop and resample

3881186
width	height
you input the width height desired aspect ratio this will spit out an array that contains the corrected dimensions

3881186
width	height
it s probably best to specify the ratio by dividing desired height by desired width

3881186
width	height
you can then use that info to crop the image w imagecopyresampled at the same time you can specify to the function the destination width height

3881186
gif	png
you can then use iamgejpeg gif png to output the image as a file to a public directory on your server

3881220
children	parent
maybe add a count condition if a parent has 1 2 3 for children and 3 children it s all good

3881223
post	put
possible via urlrequest - send your desktop data to server handler with post method then put it into database there

3881225
int	chars
the ord function returns an int uniquely expressing the chars s value

3881230
opera	google-chrome
somewhere along the line the encoding got switched to a format that was screwing up in ie9b and google-chrome but not opera 10

3881280
free	malloc
now if malloc fails you do free emergencymemory and hopefully you have enough room to recover

3881289
httpresponse	request
it appears that the system.web.script.serialization.javascriptserializer class tries to obtain the httpresponse for the current request presumably to apply appropriate character encoding

3881302
solaris	aix	powerpc	i386
works on hp-ux windows solaris aix linux free-net-openbsd and with i386 amd64 ia64 parisc sparc and powerpc

3881328
ienumerable	iqueryable
after sleeping on it it dawned on me that even though i was typing my list as ienumerable it was really still an iqueryable as that s how it came out of my linq query in my repository

3881329
filesystems	ntfs
it s a windows application written in c# that could run on both ntfs and fat32 filesystems

3881340
16-bit	64bit
if you only return 16-bit or 32-bit aligned pointers an uneven pointer-address lsb equal to 1 will be at least mysterious and would create an opportunity for using my all-time favorite bogus-value 0xdeadbeef for 32-bit pointers or 0xdeadbeefbadf00d for 64bit pointers

3881352
facebook	fbconnect
i also use #import fbconnect fbconnect.h in my projects but you don t need to add the facebook ios sdk to your search paths in xcode

3881352
facebook	fbconnect
since facebook for some odd reason chose to put their header files in an additional subdirectory also named fbconnect underneath the main source directory in the facebook-iphone-sdk project you need to add the additional fbconnect when importing this file

3881359
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
i have tried executing the code in google-chrome opera and safari and they all work fine

3881368
int	chars
because printf statement returns int value ie number of chars successfully written on screen in if condition first printf returns 1 and second printf return 2

3881418
django	web2py
i am particularly interested in using ironpython to run a python web framework such as django or web2py

3881441
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this kind of ugly code and it is not only related to the component is used in order to assure a compatibilities and identical behaviors among all browsers including all ie and ie6 also firefox safari google-chrome and so on.

3881441
hide	show
eventually you can also simulate this behavior with buttons and some javascript that will hide or show different panels or using one per tab to refresh the content of a basic panel

3881449
ubuntu	linux
i have several usb mass storage flash drives connected to a ubuntu linux computer ubuntu 10.04.1 kernel 2.6.32-25-386 and i need to tell them apart programatically from bash if possible but i m not afraid of compiling either - i need to find which block device corresponds to which physical device dev sdb1 - device in usb port 1

3881454
x86	64bit
not sure if you are running a 64bit os as mine is located here c program files x86 microsoft sql server 90 com tablediff.exe

3881486
pull	push
have a second local git repository and perform cherry picks on it every time actual commit and push is performed to the working branch go to that second repository pull the changes and perform cherry pick there

3881506
for-loop	loops
its just my logic that we generally use for-loop when we know the exact count of our itterations and we use a while loops when we generally want to check a condition.then we use them according to ur requirments

3881538
entity-relationship	diagram
the cons are the need to build your own db access layer and having to produce entity-relationship diagram for future reference and updates to db

3881542
min	max
keep 3 more columns for min max and the sum of the 15 columns

3881583
set	bag
in the bag i have to set the reference begin to _begin and end to _end

3881591
cvs	svn
firstly i have migrated my cvs repository into svn repository

3881619
int	chars
when you pass an int corresponding to the c conversion specifier the int is converted to an unsigned chars and then written

3881619
int	chars
when converting an int to an unsigned chars

3881626
for-loop	loops
you can most always i can t think of an example where you can t write a for-loop as a while loops and a while loops as a for-loop but picking the one which best first the situation usually comes down to my above points

3881654
google-chrome	firefox
i m developing a cross-platform npapi+xpcom extension for firefox and google-chrome windows linux and mac

3881694
maven	pom.xml
i tried from a brandnew maven installation the following pom.xml

3881725
google-chrome	firefox
document.ready not triggered after ajax request in ie but work a charm in firefox and google-chrome

3881725
google-chrome	firefox
this works well in firefox and google-chrome

3881730
hash	md5
the only possible problem i can think of here could be if it would somehow be possible to exploit md5 collisions that two different strings can generate the same md5 hash - in that case someone could potentially log in with a password that is not correct but generates the same md5 hash

3881730
hash	md5
he wrote of the attack that w e already knew that md5 is a broken hash function and that no one should be using md5 anymore.

3881755
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
the only glaringly obvious problem i see is that the password is stored with as simple md5 hash with no salt

3881755
hash	md5
from your point of view this isn t so much of an issue but from the user s point of view it s a major security flaw since someone with access to the database can fairly easily crack sufficiently bad passwords by just googling their md5 hash

3881758
maven	pom.xml
if pom.xml a asks for 4.8 and b asks for 4.8.2 and b depends on a then maven has to make a decision

3881876
post	put
that s what post and put are for

3881953
jquery	scriptaculous
richfaces 3.3.3 comes baked in with jquery 1.3.2 and prototype and scriptaculous as well

3881957
for-loop	loops
knuth s loop-and-a-half also works better in several languages as an infinite loops with a break rather than a for-loop

3881996
web.py	bottle
in particular i d recommend bottle and web.py both of which can be used with more or less finagling with the excellent mimerender library for solid content negotiation

3882049
width	height
then when you listen for that event re-lay out your application to the new fullscreen width and height

3882058
cpython	ironpython
i haven t used ironpython extensively but the 2.6.1 release behaves almost exactly like the cpython 2.6 interpreter disregarding standard library

3882058
cpython	ironpython
a lot of the extensions for cpython don t work with ironpython

3882058
cpython	ironpython
so if you want to use django or something like that it s probably not smart to use ironpython because it isn t really cross-platform doesn t work with some frameworks and it performs worse than cpython

3882084
ssl	https
https ssl works fine

3882086
ssl	https
https ssl only solves the middle man part of what you want to achieve

3882114
ssl	https
another benefit of ssl is that it allows the use of strict transport security which not only forces https on all site activity but also prevents a man in the middle from spoofing your site to a user and making them think they are accessing your site

3882149
post	get

parsley	graniteds
as of 2.1 graniteds generates as3 service classes from your java code as local proxies and i want to use these classes in parsley

3882221
parsley	graniteds
this would be because parsley is creating instances of the service classes without actually injecting them with the relevant context to do the graniteds remoting

3882221
parsley	graniteds
i need to figure out how to give the graniteds context to the service classes which parsley instantiates

3882221
parsley	graniteds
i m familiar with graniteds but not with parsley so maybe this is the solution but applying it correctly is above my head

drop the php page into the same directory as the file and it will tell you the correct path to the folder and then just add on the filename.xxx

3882934

3883366
hide	show
the problem is that if the element appears safari hide it then show it

3883377
width	height
the way i understand this which maybe incorrect is that self.navigationcontroller.view.frame was same as self.view.frame and both were equal to x 0 y 0 width 320 height 480

3883435
hide	show
well you could make the code a lot simpler by using the jquery toggle function to show hide the element

for-loop	arrays
for an arrays of greater size a for-loop with an if comparing the 3 elements to the current one sounds fine

3883706
getter	setter
since you aren t doing anything in your getter setter you could get rid of them and just mark your arraycollection as bindable then set it as the dataprovider for the datagrid and be done

3883706
getter	setter
getting rid of the getter setter allows the arraycollection to handle dispatching that event for you

3883707

3883742

once the html is sent to the browser what the user does with your site is out of your control until his browser performs another get or post request or opens a persistent web socket connection

3883809

both on device and simulator uidatepicker and nsdateformatter are returning incorrect dates adding or substracting the difference from gmt 0 from the selected date according to the current time zone set on the device or mac

3883841

when i open the page in safari and google-chrome it s beautiful

3884109
cos	sin
as sin cos etc

3884109
cos	sin
it includes cos sin and hundreds of others

3884120
integer	unsigned
it would be used to get the signed value of the unsigned integer or one more than the maximum value of a signed integer

the uint32_t would be casting it to an unsigned integer while the -0 would be forcing it to be negative flipping the signed bit and returning the unsigned value with it flipped

3884159
nsdateformatter	uidatepicker
you need to set the timezone properties of your uidatepicker and your nsdateformatter

maven	pom.xml
with the maven eclipse plugin i can configure checkstyle or sonar configurations by adding the necessary invocations to the pom.xml and calling mvn eclipse eclipse to create the project configuration

3884192

what i want to accomplish is that people simply import maven project and they automatically get a project preconfigured with the correct checkstyle configuration which is possibly downloaded from somewhere as defined in the pom.xml without having to manually go into the project preferences and click around a lot

3884193
jar	war	jar	.war

it s very close to using bitblt or stretchblt parameter-wise except for the last parameter which is the alpha-blend structure and is very easy to understand

3884665
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
currently this works perfectly in ie and opera but it fails in google-chrome and safari

3884695
post	get
i dug into the library and it seems that the decision to use get or post is conveniently tied to whether or not data is provided in the request

3884702
portrait	landscape
it works if i launch in portrait but if i launch in landscape the screen stay black until my app start

3884703

3884737
int	chars
load and zero- or sign-extend it to fill an int -sized word depending on whether plain chars is signed or unsigned

3884737
int	chars
in order for this to work reliably c should have type and unsigned int should be strictly wider than unsigned chars

3884738
try-catch	exception-handling
i have found consistently during that time the most effective exception-handling handling process is deferring to if-then before try-catch

3884797
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
this happens only when i change the category and or suppliers both are dropdownlistfor the other fields checkbox and textbox are ok

3884821

for example with ascii if you don t have a barrel shifter you can actually change the asrbits to 4 9-5 since convertval will be + -32 depending on the toupper or tolower operation

3884855
accessor	properties
the fix is to use list to retrieve the list of steps it appears using the indexed accessor on the factory returns invalid step instances where the id is just the index of the element and all properties are null

3884860

google-chrome	safari
webkit has implemented the fegaussianblur effect but filters are unstable and are disabled in safari it may work in google-chrome 5 - should definitely work in google-chrome 6

3885227
width	height
for example wpf uses nan to represent the width and height of visual elements that do not define their own size

3885305
put	get
the echo statements are fairly simple - echo checking file... might get put in the log as che then no more output

3885345
chunked	transfer-encoding
from what research i ve been doing it seems that when iis sets the transfer-encoding to chunked when compressing dynamic content which removes the content-length header as it violates the http1.1 standard when doing that

3885393
submit	submission
the other possibility regarding this i really need to read over the jquery tools docs... is that you need to manually submit the form - that is you might be successfully binding the handler but the form s never actually submission

3885395
width	height
reduce the actual height and width of the image but hopefully in a way that will not distort it

3885415

3886393
coalesce	isnull
you can read here about isnull and coalesce

3886418
stringstream	ifstream
the author of the code wanted to use a stringstream but instead used an ifstream which is not good at all for what he wants to do especially since he tries to open a file named as the whole row just read from file

3886433
layoutparams	viewgroup
when setting the layoutparams for suggestcarrierfield don t use viewgroup but instead use absolutelayout.layoutparams

3886433

jquery s animation relies upon the element having height and width

3886467
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the plugin works in firefox google-chrome safari ie6 ie7 and ie8

3886531

the long solution is to implements your own view extends imageview which draws its own orange border in response to a click

3886585
ubuntu	linux
i was wandering how could capture video from the built-in camera of my netbook under linux ubuntu

3886597
free	malloc
if you really need this capability reliably in a real application you ll have to build a shim around malloc free that keeps a table of allocation sizes

3886634
innodb	myisam
you ll need your data in mysql and it must be in a myisam table not innodb or other.

3886683
union	distinct
however the best approach to solve my problem was to use a compound statement using union all for every distinct value in col_a

3886690
maya	blender
for unity you can create 3d model animations and import them but i am not sure if its compatible with blender but it is compatible with maya

3886723

so i made scale a double and used a typecast to convert it back to an int

3886928
post	get
have the user submit the form that the select is in so the values would be in get post

3886944
queue	fifo
if the only reason you opted to implement your own class instead of using is that you need a fifo queue well then.

3886944
queue	fifo
a instantiated using the default parameterless constructor is a fifo queue

3886960
gmail	hotmail
however it seems like many services such as gmail and hotmail are converting urls into html links

3886960
gmail	hotmail
some users access via the web hotmail yahoo gmail while others use clients outlook thunderbird

3886978
internationalization	localization
now i want to externalize the greeting perhaps to facilitate internationalization localization etc

3886993
hide	show
this may not be your ideal solution but you could show or hide your animated image just using javascript

3887014
typedef	struct
since you have already typedef it in particle.h drop the word struct from the array declaration line the line where the error is

3887016
inherited	properties
when i click the ellipsis next to the picture properties of a timage it calls an inherited method - i don t know which - to allow me to load a picture

3887022
typedef	struct
firstly in c++ you don t need to typedef your struct

3887041
inherited	properties
just leave the flavour properties out so it inherited it from iapple

3887044
inherited	properties
no you donâ t need the new keyword to inherited a properties from an interface in another interface

3887059
inherited	properties
when there seems to be a need to replace an inherited properties for the inherited make sense i generally look for one of two things

3887060
rss	feed
btw atom feed are the new standard for rss i hear

3887074
public	protected
virtual functions can have public protected or private access

3887110
ienumerable	iqueryable
evaluating a query whether ienumerable or iqueryable is a potential source of exceptions even when the query itself is not null

3887155
int	boolean
in that by default xquery support basic data-types as int float decimal boolean types

3887186
super	implements
there is quite a bit of literature out there on the subject what i described was just a super simple method you could implements in an hour or so with opencv

3887222
int	double
i want to write a conditional statement depending on whether a variable is an int or double i.e

3887238
int	double
i have no idea how x could be an int or a double without you knowing at compile time but

3887245
int	double
public void foo int x double y ...

3887246
put	get
other people say that you can put an open parenthesis before each glob and then your editor will not get grumpy about the mismatched parentheses

3887266
post	get
my experience with ajax is limited-- i ve only used them to store data to the server a-la post commands and so i really have no idea how to get data back from the server

3887273
int	double
now back to the suspected problem i expect that you need to use double somewhere not int - in your other question you talked about scaling factors

3887274
hash	md5
create an md5 hash of the string and take the first three bytes as the red green and blue components respectively

3887330
post	get
comments get their own table and relate to the respective post using a foreign key -- the post_id

3887339
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in google-chrome firefox but not in internet explorer

3887415
hash	md5
its important to point out that as long as your hash function does a decent job of being pseudo-random it doesn t matter which one you use whether it is sha1 md5 or any form of checksum --these numbers assume completely random inputs and thus you can only approach these values by using increasingly better hash functions

3887467
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox can use woff and ttf ie uses svg and eot

3887473
subscript	superscript
i am developing an application that needs some kind of subscript and superscript support to display text that refers to chemical formula if i do it in a textbox winforms and want for example show water formula it would appear as h20 rather than h subscript 2 o sorry i coudn t find how to do it here

3887474
for-loop	arrays
if you can have the data stored in parallel arrays or something like that i d just use a for-loop adding buttons textviews etc

youtube	vimeo
i m developing a web app based on videos that my client would like to upload using an online resource such as youtube or vimeo

youtube	vimeo
since youtube has a 15 mn restriction length on the videos one can upload my client has decided to use vimeo instead but moogaloop

when malloc free detect a corrupted heap the may call abort see this question

3887632
stdout	fflush
make sure you re calling fflush stdout

3887684
datatrigger	eventtrigger
i m pretty sure i should be using an eventtrigger but i couldn t get that to work so my most recent attempt is to create a datatrigger that is bound to a field in the view-model

3887685
subtract	add
on mysql 5.1.49 it wouldn t add subtract because it wasn t implicitly converting the string to a datetime data type

3887770
getter	setter
i tried to modify the code using getter setter methods now it fails saying the following

3887779
screens	tablet
tablet are not well-suited for testing cause they often have non-standard screens size and resolution

3887787
postgresql	mysql
i am mainly considering mysql and postgresql

3887795
mvp	presenter
however dnn does support webforms mvp model view presenter which allows for all of the structural testing benefits of mvc in the webforms context

3887803
try-catch	exception-handling
in java you can call option s isempty isdefined and get without any special hassle the really useful option methods such as getorelse are another matter. checking the result of the isdefined method in an if-clause should be faster than checking exception-handling in a try-catch block

3887832
width	height
the key was in realising that setting the height may affect the width and vice-versa and we were only running through this code once on application startup

3887832
width	height
set height set width set height

3887832
width	height
set width set height set width

for ex if i have row num 1 with predefined height width color and borders etc..then these same properties of row1 have to be replicated to next row i.e row2..is there anyway to do this

3888031
post	get
so i think he is trying to get the user parameter that is passed to the servlet aservlet via post

3888048
int	chars
especially in c++ concrete classes emphasize their similarity to concrete types like int and chars often by operator overloading and by having only non-virtual functions

3888143
int	double
that will not compile even though either argument could be implicitly converted to the other type int - double

3888157
nonetype	iterable
error message typeerror nonetype object is not iterable

3888164

when i click the button in google-chrome and safari the usernamerequired and passwordrequired validators fire even though the button has causesvalidation false

3888255
min	max
use local variables for computing the min and max

3888255
min	max
max and min have to get written to memory

3888289
gridview	rowdatabound
you could create a method that runs on the gridview rowdatabound event

3888301
for-loop	loops
if you need to define a counter to control your loops use a for-loop

3888328
unix	solaris
for example we have many hosts running different flavours of unix solaris linux and at different versions all with slightly different file system layouts

3888415
width	height
however the width height here is only applying to the whole container but not to image itself

3888474

3888546
google-chrome	firefox
there are versions for firefox google-chrome and ie

3888552
width	height
you should consider having just one centered div and on the body put a background-image of 1px height and large enough width and centered

3888645
typedef	struct
when you only want to expose opaque pointers you put the typedef in your header file interface and the struct declaration in your source file implementation

3888649
int	chars
all of these arrays are concatenated into a single array which is converted into an int and then a string base 126 to minimize non-printable chars length and not encounter utf8

3888653
hide	show
it would help enormously if you could show the patterns of where these x80 bytes appear in relation to the quotes and the chinese characters -- keep it readable by just showing the hex and hide your confidential data by using c1 c2 to represent two bytes which i am sure represent a chinese character

3888656
solaris	bsd
my main concern has been to have a single .profile that runs on debian red hat solaris bsd and so on

3888672
inline	inlining
inlining a function may also put undue pressure on the l2 cache - if an inline function is used an unusually large number of times the extra code size will increase the likelihood of cache misses leading to long delays and pipeline stalls as the cpu twiddles its thumbs waiting for the memory bus to do something

3888696
qpushbutton	qwidget	hide	show
qwidget 2 is a combination of qwidget s the left part is simple qpushbutton with show hide caption and the right part another widget .

warning only open this in opera or google-chrome the script is pretty heavy can hang up on slow computers don t leave the script running while you are getting coffee

3888711
opera	google-chrome
especially in opera there is much more green in the painting than in google-chrome

3888711
opera	google-chrome
note it is exactly the same script in both browsers so perhaps you could have a look at it in both google-chrome and opera

3888758
wxpython	pyqt
c if you need something more sophisticated take wxpython or pyqt

3888766
children	parent
this approach is a lot less long-winded than the surrounding abstract class and allows more flexible uses such as children that are also parent

3888787
width	height
one way i can think of is hooking into the change of the viewport size and checking if the height width ratio has changed

3888859
uiswitch	uibutton
each custom cell have an uiswitch and an uibutton

3888863
jquery	scriptaculous
i know you can do this with jquery - but i m limited to using prototype.js and scriptaculous

3888870
hide	show
when i click on the show or hide button the text input should appear or disappear

3888870
hide	show
the problem is that if the element appears safari hide it then show it

3888870
google-chrome	safari	hide	show
i tried your function it works perfectly on desktop browsers google-chrome safari but on safari for iphone it did what i described show and hide the hidden element instantly

3888876
integer	radix
then you parse the integer with radix 16

3888932
pull	push
10 of the time do a pull from master merge commit merge and push

i need to hide a detail view that is show when clicked on a tableviewitem

3889033
entity-relationship	diagram
structure you ve described is called supertype subtype with discriminator if you google for it you can find some descriptions on google books and while it s easy to draw it in entity-relationship diagram it s difficult to use in a real database

3889097
int	chars
reverse the order of the structure members such that the int precedes the chars

3889158
post	put
this allows user agents to represent other methods such as post put and delete in a special way so that the user is made aware of the fact that a possibly unsafe action is being requested

3889173
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox but quite often fails in google-chrome

3889204
put	get
use to get an object you can put in the collection

3889235
nsinteger	double
nsarray is more like a list in java into which you can add objects but not values like nsinteger bool double etc

3889251
int	double	int	chars
so first put pointers and double then int then shorts and any chars members last

3889254
vim	emacs
if it needn t be a complete ide and you re fine with text-editors you should have a look at the common ones vim emacs and so on - they also work on most os

3889282
postgresql	mysql
we have implemented the following improvements in our linqconnect linq to sql server oracle mysql postgresql sqlite

3889290
int	boolean
to disable certain items you have to override the boolean isenabled int position in this adapter and return false for every position you d like to be disabled

3889303
put	get
you can put a break point on the exception and when you get to that line you can go to the next statement assuming you know it is safe to do so and right-click and select set next statement

3889341
put	get
if you want to put this in the context of the rest dissertation if your get request has side-effects it will then break a few other constraints for example regarding the cache

3889383
width	height
a hint here is that the width height of a triangle of level x is 2 x.

3889495
free	malloc
by the way in c++ you will never use malloc free but the operators new and delete

3889502
pop-up	dialog
every time i open visual studio 2008 i get a pop-up dialog prompting for my username and password connecting to team foundation server

3889526
popupwindow	pop-up
so i resort to popupwindow but somehow videoview doesn t show up in the pop-up

3889538
pull	push
this is a task which would normally be accomplished by overriding idle in the vst world but since audiounits are pull-oriented instead of push-oriented you need to sometimes pull the information and push it to your plugin by hand

3889583
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
while it would be ideal that ie7 6 users all move to ie8 or google-chrome firefox opera they will still be around for years to come maybe ie6 will not last as long as ie7 but ie7 lacks any real javascript changes

3889634
ready	each
im rendering 2 pages each side of the page in focus so that the pdf image is ready to mask the layer before it starts drawing.pages are destroyed again when they are +2 pages away from the focused page

3889643
temp	tmp
we then found a link about the temp tmp mappings and how to fix them -which was not our issue

3889672
nunit	mstest	junit	testng
in java there s junit and testng libraries for unit testing in c# there s nunit and mstest

3889683

i found myself often trying to open a link in safari with firefox

3889703
int	double	int	chars
...for example chars int float and double are the most common scalar data types in the c programming language

3889717
google-chrome	firefox
the best library i found is lagger - support firephp extension for firefox and has own extension for google-chrome console

3889724
cldc	midp
neither the cldc nor the midp specifications prevent phone manufacturers from running several midlet suites inside the same jvm process

3889728
tabcontrol	tabitem
here is my xaml which declares the tabcontrol and 2 tabitem

3889758
google-chrome	firefox
i also need to mention that redirect works well and as expected in google-chrome firefox and ie

3889803
udp	tcp
this class is very interesting for doing socket in objective-c either udp or tcp

3889829
setinterval	settimeout
if it s not called that way -- eval.call ... settimeout eval ... setinterval eval ... and so on -- it s an indirect eval

3889875
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
malloc is a dynamic memory allocator which helps u up to assign memory to ur variables according to ur need and therefore reduces the loss of memory.it is also supported by realloc function through which u can edit the memory required which u have defined earlier through malloc or calloc

i m working on an excel 2003 addin users will upgrade to newer office but not any time soon and am wanting to use functionality to automatically check for a newer versioning and deploy it if there is one

3889899
packets	multicast
just send udp packets to for instance address 224.1.2.3 which is a multicast address

3889901
xul	xbl
if you re using the firefox plugin exclusively then you can create new xform extension components by wrapping any combination of html javascript xforms and xul widgets in xbl

3889901
xul	xbl
in your case probably the most efficient way to get this working would be to wrap the xul colour picker component in xbl then write a little bit of javascript to link the picker s onchange event back to your model

3889904
google-chrome	safari
some browsers like safari and google-chrome have a pretty good javascript engine making them more efficient

3889909
ciimage	nsimage
what i need is an image whether it be a cvimagebufferref ciimage or nsimage doesn t matter from the current frame of the h.264 sample that is given to me by the output object s call back

3890037
post	get
after reading chris answer to f# - public literal and the blog post at i don t get why the following is not working

3890044
ant	cruisecontrol
that said you can do compilation on demand quite well with ant and or cruisecontrol

3890098
avd	galaxy
i installed the add-on provided by samsung so i could create an avd that would emulate a galaxy tab but unfortunately my most important project uses the google api for using the maps external library which is not supported by the single additional target that the add-on provides

3890119
post	get
other than that post is rather similar to get except that the data is sent in the body of the request instead of the url and there are two ways to encode them multipart-form-data in addition to the urlencode that s shared with get

3890143
equals	gethashcode
one point i haven t seen mentioned is that when you override the gethashcode you should also override the equals to keep consistency and to avoid unexpected behaviour

3890151
int	boolean
public boolean oneditoraction textview view int actionid keyevent event

3890168
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately after applying the pie it seems ie8 is just does not want to look the same as google-chrome or firefox

3890186
spaces	delimiter
in the above string spaces seems to be a good delimiter between words so lets use that

3890186
strdup	strtok
if you want to store the returned values from strtok you need to copy the token to another buffer strdup p

3890188
post	get
inside the http request post data is actually formatted pretty much the same as get data

3890199
gridview	repeater
other controls like gridview or the repeater do though

3890205
innodb	myisam
edit looks like one table has engine myisam and other innodb

3890311
innodb	myisam
concerning innodb and myisam i do not know

3890335
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in my case i also so long as there s no overt restriction to the contrary include a conditional comment somewhere on the page that pops up a modal dialogue linking to various other free browsers typically google-chrome firefox safari and opera and suggesting the users might like to up-grade in order to improve their experience

3890335
google-chrome	firefox
if a client requests it then fair enough but normally explaining the cost-per-hour just to givie curvy-corners is enough of an incentive to allow for rectangular boxes in ie and curves in firefox google-chrome etc

3890375
put	get
however as far as i can determine this function doesnâ t get called if i put an alert at the start it brings nothing up

3890385
hide	show
how many events would be optimum if we were to hide show events based on the checkbox clicks - each checkbox click involves looping thru the list of events and identifying which ones need to be show and this list is rendered at once

3890428
onfocus	onblur
in onfocus onblur method just remember last focused widget

3890505

3890521
post	get
i just read so many post about installers for a java app and i d like to get some opinions as for the best choices

3890549

ah note you can pass both get and post variables in the same request

3890569
pthreads	fcntl
for pthreads systems take a look at fcntl

3890571
opera	firefox
changing the scrollbar color in firefox is not as trivial as it is in internet explorer and opera

3890580
minimum	max
a wm_getminmaxinfo is called to determine the minimum size and max size the window its called during snap so that it does not resize the window beyond its actual outlined size so if you have an application that is 500 in height and that is a constant height you dont want windows to resize it to fit the height of your screen

3890762
rss	feed
if an item in the rss feed is removed then my script needs to detect this and delete the row or insert a flag into my table to say its been deleted.

3890791
mdpi	hdpi
so in fact the drawable directory is pretty much the same as the drawable-mdpi directory and because you don t have the ldpi and hdpi versions defined the system automatically builds them out of your mdpi resources

3890798
redhat	fedora
on redhat or fedora that is apache unless you re using a different web server other flavors of linux might use www or some other user

3890959
std	ostream
std ostream is responsible for formatting but not printing itself

3890959
std	ostream
std cout combines a std ostream formatter with a std streambuf -derived object that writes to stdout

3890959
std	ostream
as std cout is just another ostream you can replace its streambuf too

3890964

it isn t sdl but glfw works on windows with haskell through cabal

3891105
hash	salt
for extra security against dictionary attacks you should also salt the hash passwords

3891120
post	get
anyway i m sure it s not a perfect idea it would require some js on client side to manage and i haven t been able to do a project yet to see how it unfolds but the post was trying to think about how to get there and back again so i figured i would give my thoughts

3891123
ilist	icollection
you can check that the object is of type icollection generic or ilist non-generic and that their isreadonly property is not set to true

3891191
writetofile	nsdata
however this only works for files that are local - if you want to copy a file from a server you should have a look at nsurlconnection to load the data and then nsdata s writetofile atomically method to save the contents to the file system found here .

3891255
firefox	safari
just go into safari open preferences then select firefox as the default browser at the top of the first tab

it won t get around to doing its normal duties which include painting the controls and responding to the mouse and keyboard

3891350
punctuation	words
and if you wanted to strip all punctuation at the beginning and end except for example the dollar-sign in front of a words you could use this

3891361
ocp	principles
a good heuristic would be to use some kind of metric like robert martin s instability and abstractness pdf or metrics for lack of cohesion to better prepare your systems for change and to have a better chance of following the ocp and all the other important principles of ood

3891446
onresume	onpause
i have some common actions fired in onpause and onresume methods

3891452
kde	gnome
you likely want to set up a program to start on kde gnome login

if you really want to get through the bottom of it then try to understand arrays and pointers through int rather than chars

3891467
hash	md5
if you are storing passwords do not store them as clear text use md5 most popular or some other hash

3891516
hide	show
in code i now wish to selectively show hide that uiscrollview

3891544

3891599
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
you want a uitabbarcontroller respectively it s view to be a subview of a uinavigationcontroller

3891617
int	chars
when doing this query the trivial way it will be horribly slow as sql server does an implicit conversion of the column value from int to chars in order to apply the wildcard every single time that query is run

3891617
int	chars
the idea would be to create an index that stores the converted to chars value of that int column so sql server can reuse that instead of reconverting millions of values every query

3891624
post	get
i ve seen several post that show using something called abstracttransactionaljunit4springcontexttests but when i convert to using it i get the following error

3891808
intersect	contains
finally intersect will only give you results that contains all your parameters

3891811
bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs
just because you have a centralized version control system if it is not sane enough for you checkin checkout style cvs very slow to do anything then install bazaar or git on your local machine and version control

3891840
next	except
easy enough except it will screw up the validation standard error that s supposed to appear next to my field and i haven t found a solution for that yet

3891841
rss	feed
if simply replacing your data with new data from the rss feed won t work for you you could run through a few steps

3891856
put	get
and don t get caught in the band-aid syndrome put any old fix in that will work

3891970
nsstring	nsdata
if you create an nsstring out of nsdata all values up to the first 0-value are taken into account

3892003
disk	ram	versioning	upgrade
more likely with later versioning of windows since they need more ram and tend to suffer when the machine was upgrade instead of wiped before the install due to disk fragmentation problems especially the paging file

3892006
button	checkbox
noteview extends linearlayout and contains two button and a checkbox

3892010
hide	show
i could dynamically create a canvas element and hide it but then again i don t want to show the image directly to the user anytime so there s no point of actually having a canvas element in the page

3892028
hide	show
inside there is a panel that i want to show hide on click of a hyperlink inside the usercontrol

3892028
hide	show
currently with my existing code if i click the hyperlink in any row it show hide the panel in the bottom row of the gridview

3892049
width	height
edittext has width as fill_parent and height as wrap_content

3892084
visualvm	jstat
visualvm is able to make a jstat connection to the process which it discovers automatically but this means i don t get access to mbeans or for example the cpu history chart

3892125
put	get
but when i put my break point on that line and press f11 the debugger says that there is no source code available so i cannot get into it deeper

3892135
children	parent
rename the first one to children and the second one to parent

3892173
hide	show
when i hover over a top level menu item how do i hide all sub-menus and show only the hovered items

3892180
put	get
get the old versions of the libs from the previous version of the package and keep them around just for your binary you could put them somewhere out of usr lib and load them just for your program with ld_library_path

3892194
equals	gethashcode
every property is virtual every mapping file is an embedded resource every composite id has its own class which overrides equals and gethashcode

there are also all sorts of really cool effects you can get for show and hide - such as fade blind and many more

3892231
google-chrome	safari
the table has border-spacing set and in google-chrome and safari the space between the header row and the rest is doubled

3892232
ffmpeg	avisynth
i ve seen both splicer and the directshow.net wrappers but i m not sure it s worth the time to bring all of the editing into our app and not just use avisynth ffmpeg mencoder to perform the actual editing after the user sets all of the above things

3892232
wmv	flv
it d be nice if it would use directshow at some level so that any codecs installed on the machine will be available as the videos could be in wmv flv divx mp4 etc

3892241
coalesce	nvl
you can t use nvl or nvl2 or coalesce which are similar here because there s no data on which these functions can operate

3892263
put	get
to use it you d normally multiply by some multiple of 10 to get the number of decimal places you want then convert to integer and put a decimal point in the right place in the result

3892266
gridview	rowdatabound
you can do this at the rowdatabound event of gridview

3892266
gridview	rowdatabound
write below code at your gridview rowdatabound event

3892289
ocp	principles
good design principles like the ocp are not add odds with good development processes like unit tests and tdd

3892379
division	multiplication
now integer overflows resulting from division are a lot more rare than say multiplication

3892379
division	multiplication
why should a multiplication overflow which is much more likely to accidentally occur be silently ignored by the hardware but a division overflow is supposed to trigger a fatal interrupt

3892405
put	get
i didn t put much research into it but this link might get you headed in the right direction

3892430
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
when you get an integer overflow with integer 2 s complement add subtract multiplying you still have a valid result - it s just missing some high order bits

3892446
salt	md5
but it doesn t just md5 s the original password but a very mixed-up password using salt and other methods

3892496
int	chars
if the range of an int is -128 to 127 use chars instead of int or unsigned chars if it s 0 to 255

3892520
16-bit	64bit
what i think you are being asked to do is take the 64bit of data you have and treat it like 4 16-bit integers

3892520
width	height
those percentages when multiplied to the image height width give you 4 coordinates

3892547
put	get
i have created site on my local machine that works fine on debug mode but when i put the site on local iis 7.5 of my machine i get

3892629
opencv	emgucv
i do not know any good signal processing libraries in .net but emgucv opencv is wrapper around opencv which can do advanced signal processing

3892680
int	chars
it can return either eof which is a negative int constant if there were no remaining chars to red or there was an error or it can return the value of the chars read as an unsigned chars and converted to a int

3892680
int	chars
in side the loop you need to be careful in the comparison of the returned value due to the way the fact that ch is the unsigned chars converted to an int

3892680
int	chars
on most platforms the simplest thing to do would be to create a chars variable for comparison purposes although you could put your chars constants throught the same unsigned chars to int conversion routine

3892699
put	get
for login versus non-login shells the one way to get complete control that i found suitable was to put my changes into something like .local_bashrc

3892714
put	get	post	get	post	put
i am trying to get the last post date of my wordpress blog for my program to show when the last date that we put important information for the user on it

3892738
post	get
gets are used for that post are used for requesting data be changed on the server or for security reasons don t use get to submit a password for example

3892808
post	get
if you use post only to replace get it will be indistinguishably

3892848
justmock	typemock
i know there is typemock and justmock but both are commercial products and quite expensive

3892859
firefox	safari
the picture displays fine in safari but firefox doesn t display anything

in the first pass you find max and min of the sample

3892918
pop-up	dialog
i m looking for a jquery-based pop-up dialog box that we will use for

3892921
lua	scheme
embed an interpreter for a language like lua scheme into your program

3892930
mouseup	mousedown
capturing the mousedown mouseup events in the textarea or a div containing the textarea and calling event.stoppropagation

3892965
integer	unsigned
c99 defines conversion from unsigned to signed integer types as follows â 6.3.1.3 signed and unsigned integers

3892965
integer	unsigned
many but not all implementations will simply interpret the unsigned values as a twos-complement representation of a signed integer

3892965
clang	llvm
clang llvm gives exactly the same result

3892965
integer	unsigned
a better solution of course would be for the c standard to pin down the behavior of conversions from unsigned to signed when the signed type is a twos-complement integer without padding thus specifying the behavior for all of the intn_t types

3892977
post	get
you can send more data with post than get but this doesn t mean they respond faster it s a separate issue

3892988
implements	extends
i have managed to create a menu using the xml and a class that extends preferenceactivity and implements onsharedpreferencechangelistener now i would like to be notified everytime the user changes a value from preferences when a user changes the username

3893001
children	parent
although the parent company will still appear in each of the ranks as it has children that are in that particular rank but the measures will only be from the children that are in that rank

3893017
ironruby	ironpython
managed javascript was also dropped however the developers were reassigned to work on chakra the ecmascript engine of ie9 which means that of the original four dlr compilers vbx managed javascript ironruby ironpython only ironpython and ironruby survived

3893017
ironruby	ironpython
well actually there s some doubt about the latter since while ms refuses to officially announce anything about ironruby they also have reassigned all developers to other projects so that there is only one half-time developer where half-time doesn t even mean half-time on ironruby but half-time on the dlr ironpython and ironruby together inside ms left

3893027
filesystems	ntfs
also if you can rely on the target filesystems being ntfs you could symlink to the 32-bit or 64-bit dll as needed

3893028
oncreate	ondestroy
you should be able to open your database in the oncreate method and close it in the ondestroy method

3893050
post	get
ok so we have a get and a post request

3893083
integer	unsigned
from a programming standpoint there s no reason that an unexpected divide overflow should be any more or less serious than an unexpected integer overflow signed or unsigned

3893100
openfire	ejabberd
xmpp based pubsub for example using any one of a number of xmpp servers openfire ejabberd ... and writing your client code including publishing trigger with smack

3893101
goto	break
it s perfectly safe assuming it has a terminating condition a break or return statement or even a goto i suppose somewhere

3893136
spaces	linefeed
linefeed some text spaces at beginning only for this post linefeed

3893138
profiling	debugging
if you re tyring to debugging a system using sql profiling and tracking the sp starting and sp completed events may help figure things out

3893140
post	get
you would use the metaweblog.getrecentposts method to get the most recent post

3893175
post	get
given the same amount of information the post message doesn t exceed the get post should technically be faster on the serverside by nano-to-picoseconds

3893175
post	get
the get stores data in the query string the post stores the info in the message body

3893175
post	get
you ll notice this if doing any ajax it s a lot easier to send a get request than post

3893175
post	get
get has the ability to outperform post requests

3893209
winpcap	wireshark
use winpcap or a separate packet sniffer such as wireshark to monitor the nic

3893228
mp4	h.264
we are attempting to use handbrake now as it has great support for h.264 and mp4 files

3893238

i d like to show hide some of the invisible elements as the back forward buttons are clicked

3893256
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the default text in my search box looks fine in google-chrome firefox and safari vertical-align middle

3893299
ubuntu	linux
simpleparse has not problem doing the same on ubuntu linux

3893357
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
by huge numbers i mean if you took a gigabyte instead of 4 8 bytes etc. and tried to add subtract multiplying divide it by some other arbitrarily large or small number

3893357
disk	ram	subtract	add
for every byte thus i can add subtract as i read the number from the disk and not risk running out of ram

3893375
domxpath	domdocument
i was able to get it domdocument and domxpath working locally after running the fetched html through php tidy but php tidy isn t installed on the server and its a shared hosting server so i have no control over that

3893448
width	height
of course you will need to adjust the width of .image and the height of the img tag this can be done through css but the rest will be done for you

3893463
rubygems	rvm
i don t use rvm and re-installing rubygems didn t resolve the issue.

3893476
opera	firefox
in firefox opera ie the ckeditor is working and looks great

3893476
google-chrome	safari
but in google-chrome and safari it is not sizing correctly and is extending past the container that it is inside

3893476
google-chrome	safari
i assume this is because google-chrome and safari are currently the most standards compliant

3893514
gson	jackson
my favorite is jackson others like gson and flex-json also work well

3893529
set	bag
for your immediate purposes in your inspector view right-click on the jpanel and select set layout - grid bag layout

3893532
x86	64bit
check out scotthanselmans article back to basics 32-bit and 64bit confusion around x86 and x64 and the .net framework and clr

3893572
min	max
the key is that the data structure must have very fast faster than o n max min insert remove and update operations

3893594
google-chrome	firefox
my most sincere apologies i some how completely missed the fact that this was a google-chrome issue and had been testing in firefox thats why i wasn t showing the same problem

3893609
getter	setter
there are two properties with the following getter and accompanying setter in scheduledthreadpoolexecutor

3893616
width	height
but i don t know is it possible to access width height from flashplayer

3893638
googletest	gmock
but my recommendation is googletest together with gmock gmock comes with a copy of googletest bundled

3893643
width	height
most fonts have a character width less than the height so assuming width height will definitely work

3893643
width	height
just make sure that the width height comparison reflects the current font size and not any hard-coded value

3893663
for-loop	arrays
the textbooks i have say that int arrays are set to zero but they also recommend that one should write a for-loop to set all values to zero just to be clearer

3893706
portrait	landscape
maybe the content size fit in portrait and not in landscape

3893706
portrait	landscape
for example if you contentsize is set to 700 900 it will fit into the scrollview when in portrait mode and not in landscape mode

3893714
kde	gnome
most also bundle desktop environments like kde or gnome

3893714
ubuntu	debian
packages like dbus are upstream and flow downstream to distributions such as debian fedora ubuntu and the like

3893734
children	parent
now you can instantiate forms set them as children to the main mdi parent and have all the window functionality you re looking for.

3893747
post	get
it would only work when javascript is on the client side but sending a post to some script every 15 seconds will get you a reasonable amount of granularity

3893765
for-loop	loops
i thought i could use modulus and a for-loop to iterate through and create an infinite loops but when i put this in it s like it executes everything all at once not iterating through fading in and out for each item

3893778
ubuntu	debian
that said i started with debian in 1994 and still use it as well as ubuntu and i ve been maintaining packages for debian since 1995 too

3893778
ubuntu	debian
when i develop on ubuntu i sometimes take a source package from debian unstable and build it locally -- which is actually pretty simple yet really useful

3893824
daemons	systemd
daemons function for uclinux systemd without mmu and fork by jamie lokier in patch format

3893831
debian	linux
either debian unstable fedora rawide or mandriva cooker versions should be good for a development environment of linux packages

3893842
google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to connect to a web page through a httpurlconnection but it s not responding the same as a regular browser firefox google-chrome

3893864
firefox	safari
firefox and safari have no big problems with it

3893902
cvs	svn
i recently did a survey of common lisp users and most of them simply manage libraries by hand by downloading project archives and checking things out of git cvs svn etc

3893902
cvs	svn
it grabs libraries from git cvs svn for you

3893924
hide	show
so to hide the grid you cane use and to show it back

3893961

put	get
if i put a breakpoint in the page_load event i see that i get in and the btnaddsave_click event is also executed

3893967
quicksort	heapsort
there are several that have this property including quicksort merge sort heapsort etc. but which one to use depends on your use case

3893974
r5rs	r6rs
this is not possible with r5rs and i m not sure about r6rs

3893975
width	height
x y width height

3893985
quicksort	heapsort
the general purpose algorithms like heapsort or quicksort are optimized for in place sorting of an array of items

3893993
inherited	subclassing
the normal reason for subclassing is to inherited behavior

3894016
getter	setter
the first thing that keeps getting suggested to me is to use the propertychanged notification but that would only work for the setter not the getter

3894038
quicksort	heapsort
in the comments and by kriss in his answer you may want to have a look at heapsort which provides a theoretically better sorting complexity than a quicksort but will won t often fare better in practical settings

3894046
ant	maven
but you can always embed ant in it if you need to using the ant plugin for maven

3894055
fast-forward	merge
pushed only if the merge on that central subrepo is a fast-forward one

3894055
fast-forward	merge
they won t be able to push back that submodule if the merge isn t a fast-forward one

3894058
ant	maven
you can get maven s dependency management by using ivy together with ant

3894059
hide	show
i need to write a jquery function that be able to capture whenever either checkbox cb1 or cb2 is clicked to hide show it s corresponding info div info1 or info2

3894074
textmate	textwrangler	vim	textmate
well i use vim in the console but subethaedit textmate and textwrangler are popular editors i know

3894079
opera	firefox
this doesn t effect opera 10.5x firefox 3.5.x or likely any other browser this is all i ve tested so far

3894079
opera	firefox
firefox opera alert hello

3894082
apache	nginx
i am using a freepascal web module designed for apache cgi-bin with nginx

3894125
hide	show
when a change occurs it traverses to the .next element sibling and calls .toggle which will show hide based on whether the checkbox was checked or not

3894254
dictionary	map
although not as flexible as using a dictionary you might be able to get by using a simple lookup table to the map box numbers to a particular box in boxes

3894300
post	get
i m using jquery s form plugin as suggested in a number of threads like this one to make an ajax post to a .net mvc controller and consume the json i get back

3894300
google-chrome	firefox
it works just fine in google-chrome but in some other browsers including firefox 3 the form submit results in a save or open this file dialog box

3894323
spaces	delimiter
but if you have just a list of words separated by spaces you can define a set of delimiter and split the string with an api function

3894422
pop-up	dialog
all are to be done on pop-up model dialog user remains on same page

3894426
folder	directory
choose all files by status and folder path . in the folder area on the left select your root directory

3894460
pop-up	dialog
in the dialog that pop-up look for the variable called selected_resource_loc

3894460
pop-up	dialog
choose it and dismiss the pop-up dialog

3894481
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately i notice in google-chrome firefox etc that after clicking on different pages my app is leaking memory

3894502
pop-up	dialog
i also am trying to to make it so when the user clicks on a day a dialog pop-up telling the user what events they have scheduled for that day

3894520
hide	show
i can get the indicator to show by adding it as a subview to tableview but i can t figure out how to hide the rows until they are ready to be displayed

3894567
ienumerable	iqueryable
only when you call a method that takes the iqueryable and produces a concrete or ienumerable result tolist and similar asenumerable etc is the tree evaluated by the linq provider linq2objects is built into the framework as is linq2sql and now the msef

3894567
ienumerable	iqueryable
any ienumerable class in the framework can be cast to an iqueryable using the asqueryable extension method and linq providers that will translate the expression tree like orms will provide an asqueryable as a jump-off point for a linq query against their data

3894567
min	max	sorting	grouping
ones that do require knowing the entire collection sorting via orderby grouping with groupby and aggregates like min and max will slurp their entire source enumerable into a list or array and work on it forcing evaluation of all elements through all higher nodes

3894572
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
my thoughts were two nested for loops the outside goes through each index of the textfile arrays and the inner for-loop compares the first letter of the desired pattern

3894581
min	max
when you hit the up and down spin buttons the value is parsed and then compared to your min and max values

3894647
factors	mean
if you mean the value that corresponds to the thumb placement uses a different conversion factors from pixel position to real value that would need to be implemented in the function you built to do that translation

3894696
background-image	background-position
e.g. background-image background-position etc

3894710
integer	fractions
lastly deal in fractions values for velocity and acceleration which will be turned into an integer position change only at the last minute when you re drawing the object s new position

3894736
folder	dir
when i go to the root folder in my browser it does load the index.php view i want to make a link to show.php which is also in my views dir

3894749
min	max
but i like to use min and max more

3894775
ienumerable	ilist
i have a virtual method that returns an ilist or rather post-answers an ienumerable and the default implementation is empty

3894780
accessor	properties
because the object returned from the get accessor is autoreleased in the current scope it remains valid if the properties value is changed

3894780
getter	setter
the performance of technique 2 is significantly better than technique 1 in situations where the getter is called much more often than the setter

3894786
ant	maven
if you really want to use hibernate use maven ant and generate your mappings and anything you want with hibernatetools in maven that would be

3894788
pull	push
after that the server will have a full copy of the repository and you will be able to push and pull to and from it

3894797
getter	setter
if you re using synthesize you don t need to care about the getter and setter implementations so long as you ve specified the property options retain copy etc. correctly

3894797
getter	setter
unless you see actual perf problems regarding the getter and setter which would be doubtful i wouldn t worry about how it s implemented internally

3894797
getter	setter
if you really want to use a specific getter or setter just implement it on your class

3894797
getter	setter
alternatively you can implement both the getter and setter and leave out the synthesize statement entirely

3894797
getter	setter	accessor	properties
or you can specify the getter or setter accessor method name in your properties declaration

3894827
portrait	landscape
here are two images of the same android phone once in portrait mode once in landscape mode

3894866
postgresql	mysql
sql server 2005 vs mysql 5 vs postgresql 8.3

3894886
nginx	lighttpd
generally speaking for a production web application you will want to put your node.js app behind a lightweight reverse proxy such as nginx or lighttpd

3894905
folder	directory
likewise he s picky about file contents most pointedly all the references in the project files must adhere to a flat directory structure between projects ie all project folder in one directory.

3894914
post	get
regardless of get vs post

3894930
for-loop	loops
so i have the following line of code that does a for-loop and subjects 12 on every loops

3894943
ready	each
just send some kind of ready event to each of the players in a given game when you deem that game to be ready like everyone touched the i m ready button or so

3894959
cos	sin
cos theta sin theta 0

3894961
postgresql	mysql
if you use innodb engine for mysql tables then you can count with fk safe transactions but a performance not as fast pretty in the same level as postgresql which is good

3894961
postgresql	mysql
but now i think you have a better panorama about postgresql and mysql

3894971
int	chars
you can convert your int to a chars then iterate through it casting each chars back to an int and adding it to a c array or as steven says an nsarray of nsnumbers

3894987
margin	text-align
furthermore set the text-align of the holder to center and the margin of the image to auto

3895002
width	height
what you do is have a div with display relative then another div within that with display absolute left 0px top 0px width 100 and height 100

3895016
didreceivememorywarning	dealloc
having in both didreceivememorywarning and dealloc might cause a double release

3895068
put	get
i can put the tk dialog into a separate app that chains onto mine i suppose but i m wondering if there s a way to kill tk and get the keyboard back without exiting my app entirely

3895077
stateless	stateful
arguably unsafeperformio reflects the compromise between the highly stateful model of the personal computer and the pure stateless model of haskell

3895149
google-chrome	firefox
this happens both on firefox 3.5 and on google-chrome

3895160
tabs	tabpanel
i am making a vertical menu using gwt menubar and selection of particular menuitem shows content on the right i am trying to make something similar to tabpanel but with tabs on left instead of being on top

3895211
sikuli	selenium
in that case you can simply integrate selenium scripts into your sikuli scripts

3895228
gif	png
the problem is that i get prompted to authenticate again if i use a png but not with the gif

3895241
google-chrome	firefox
in other words things look great in internet explorer but look crappy or don t work at all on firefox google-chrome etc

3895254
portrait	landscape
when u go to landscape portrait and get the rez do a refresh see if u get another different rez

3895258
width	height
however for this image to fit in the above css width and height i have to scale the image down to 257 x 87 and that reduces the quality of the image significantly

3895267
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
usually you want to avoid solutions from browser-vendor as they ll cater toward that specific browser but opera webkit google-chrome safari firefox devs are usually more knowledgeable in terms of cross-browser solutions and compliance with the standards than m ones

3895288
getchar	getline
you can use getchar instead of getline

3895307
gridview	repeater
this is fairly doable with a gridview but a repeater would also work as well as a simple ajax implementation returning a table structure

3895415
post	get
i m still fairly new to cakephp but i think you could use countercache to track the # of comments per post model record in a field in your post table and then use some simple conditions in your find to get what you are looking for

3895415
children	parent
countercache automatically updates the cache count field in the parent model record field when children model records are added deleted

3895428
.htaccess	httpd.conf
check that your mamp httpd.conf has allowoverride all otherwise your local .htaccess will be ignored

3895451
win64	windows
set vc_cl_dir to c program files microsoft platform sdk for windows server 2003 r2 bin win64 x86 amd64 for the amd64 cl.exe or to c program files x86 microsoft visual studio .net 2003 vc7 bin for x86 cl.exe

3895544
integer	unsigned
the only way i can see that this reasoning might fail to be valid is if and the 8-bit integer types are extended integer types with trap bits that somehow flag whether the value is signed or unsigned

3895544
int	chars
with that said i would still never use uint8_t and always explicitly use unsigned chars in case the implementation implements uint8_t as an equal-size extended int type because chars types have special privileges with respect to aliasing rules and type punning which make them more desirable

3895552
button	checkbox
for example button checkbox textfields etc

3895567
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the following script works in google-chrome safari ie and firefox 4 beta but it fails in firefox 3.6.10

3895628
int	chars
x2 is a chars which evaluates to an int when used in expressions

3895643
jboss	weblogic
we ported our application from jboss and weblogic it had to support both to tomcat openejb without major problems

3895643
jboss	glassfish
its web site is ok it s actually pretty decent for open source project but it can t compare to jboss glassfish etc

3895758
put	get
given the c++ tag the obvious possibility would be to use an std string and after you ve put all the pieces together into a complete path use its c_str member function to get access to the contents as a c-style string

3895804
unix	bsd
bsd unix

3895807
spaces	delimiter
exactly like the tags for a stackoverflow question - 5 strings spaces delimiter

3895810
rvm	bundler
rvm gem install tzinfo builder memcache-client rack rack-test rack-mount erubis mail text-format thor bundler i18n

3895847
put	get
as for usage we intend to put a small rest api and allow people to get file listing latest files and ability to get the file

3895867
hide	show
probably the biggest thing that needs to be refactored is the show hide on load i feel like i have a ton of extra crap code in there

3895877
post	get
this would be easy using get parameters but post provides additional complexity which we have decided to mitigate by by providing our in-house navigation buttons

3895917
post	get
finally if you do not get a satisfactory answer here i would suggest that you post your question on drupal.org as that is where a lot of drupal experts answer questions

3895947
implements	extends
even if you need something different and you know where to touch you could extends it to your needs inheriting all the already implements features

3895950
opera	firefox
within a cloaked site using to change the contents of a div seems to screw up the div s position in firefox and opera

3895950
opera	firefox
go to in ie firefox or opera and everything looks as it should

3895954
nsmutablestring	nsstring
i need a clarification regarding the difference between the nsstring and nsmutablestring

3896003
lisp	smalltalk
languages from before then including c++ tend to not assume garbage collection with some exceptions such as lisp smalltalk and the functional programming languages whereas languages from after that point notably java and c# do assume gc

3896023
onchange	onkeyup	onchange	onblur	onkeyup	onblur
you can then write custom logic in javascript to determine the case in which each validation control is either enabled or disabled and tie it to one of the client-side events of the text boxes onblur onchange onkeyup etc

3896027
hide	show
i didn t understand much of what you said but to add a hide show event you could do something like this

3896046
pascal	delphi
if you re a delphi pascal programmer inno setup is made for you

3896053
nsmutablestring	nsstring
just to expand on andy white s answer there may be performance benefits to using nsstring instead of nsmutablestring in your code as always test using apple s performance tools to make sure this is truly where your performance bottleneck is

3896176
int	chars
the only int constants in c are number tokens int chars constants such as a and enum constants

3896213
button	checkbox
you cannot style things like radio button checkbox scrollsbars etc. at all

3896270
firefox	safari
i m testing using firefox 3.6.10 but i ve also tried with safari 4

3896302
post	get
i have little experience with web programming and i am implementing an interface where i sent a https post request with user password receive a xml then i send another https post request with an additional passcode dependent on the xml receive a xml then i am logged in then i send a https get request and get an xml the data i actually want

3896325
hash	salt
that s why passwords should be always be hash and salt never encrypted

3896373
ddms	adb
in eclipse go to window - preferences - android - ddms - adb connection timeout.

3896381
lisp	scheme
unfortunately i dont know the how to do that in lisp but in scheme you would just use a named let

3896387
hide	show
when you click view button your div is show and view button is hide

3896438
hide	show
i would recommend rather than trying to dynamically add stuff like this to the page instead have it all setup and just hide and show the select lists depending on the input

3896438
hide	show
adding new elements to a page is very costly and the code to do something like this is going to be very complex however it would be quite easy to use the css property display none and display block instead display none will hide an element while display block will show it

3896533
bonjour	avahi
but unfortunately i do not think the windows implementation of avahi msdns bonjour supports aliases correct me if i am wrong with examples of how to support this

3896533
bonjour	avahi
my only disappointment is that the windows implementation of bonjour avahi does not support the aliases that this implementation announces it will only see the main avahi hostname normally announced ie server.local in our example above

3896601
webclient	webrequest
i am using a webclient for a basic example but i think i will require a webrequest later

3896604

3896622
google-chrome	firefox
for those users who have firefox 4 or google-chrome there is no problem

3896634
textview	imageview
right now i ve been using textview and imageview but they aren t anywhere as flexible when it comes to layout as a uilabel

3896741
post	get
maybe get and post will work for the former problem

3896746
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
oneway databinding provides support for update of ui when the object is changed which requires implementation of inotifypropertychanged and or inotifycollectionchanged on the business object

3896746
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
ui to object updates does not requires implementation of inotifycollectionchanged nor inotifypropertychanged

3896760
pop-up	dialog
if you want to stay in the ssms designer world you could also create a database diagram of your tables involved and then just drag drop your table2id column from table1 over to table2 and drop it onto the id column there - this would graphically tell ssms what you want to do and you just need to review your choices and click ok on the dialog that pop-up

3896769
google-chrome	firefox
now check test.html page on ie as well as firefox or google-chrome

3896798
width	height
through css height and width properties

3896822
typedef	struct
file is a typedef around a struct you re not supposed to explore too much like you are not supposed to play with the data behind a winapi handle unless through its dedicated api function

3896887
minimum	max
so when you add 1 to 0111 max it goes to 1000 and that s the minimum

3896927
children	parent
this because some tags can be seen as children of parent of other tags while others cannot so for example dialog tag is a concept that is also indipendent from jquery so a content with both tags jquery dialog has implicitly the relationship needed

3896949
inherited	properties
if your table structure is that all flat records represent a single properties but not all properties records refer to a flat then that s table inherited

3896949
inherited	properties
it s a way of modeling something close to object-oriented relationships in other words flat inherited from properties in a relational database

3897099
versioning	upgrade
if the applications are separate i would give each one its own library to avoid issues when you need to upgrade a library on one of the apps but don t want to have to test and update them all with that library versioning

3897118
wxpython	pygtk	wxpython	pyqt
there are numerous decent gui toolkits the most popular being pyqt pygtk wxpython and tkinter

opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
it work on firefox google-chrome but in opera it work strange

3897171
int	chars
besides the bugs of return and exit you have a bug also in the way you use int and chars

3897232
uiview	calayer
if the correct contentscalefactor is set on your uiview or calayer using code like the following

3897275
post	put
i don t have a big experience in this kind of things so i see the easiest way is sending key-value pairs as post parameters and then servlet container will parse these pairs and put to the parameters map

3897279
uiview	subviews
i have a subviews of uiview with the following code in the touchesbegan method

3897375
versioning	upgrade
we are migrating our 2005 solutions to 2010 we opened the solutions and after finishing the upgrade wizard and then changed the .net versioning to 4.0 when we say build it starts throwing 100s of errors

3897409
move	drag
in order to try it out i would like to move the marker with a drag and drop-function and then check the location

3897417
powerpc	i386

3897471
distance	polygons
now that we know which side is out we can compute lines parallel to each polygons edge at exactly the required distance

3897471
distance	polygons
multiply the normal by the distance we want the expanded polygons to be from the original

3897569
put	get
if it absolutely positively has to use dom or sax put it in res raw then use getresources .openrawresource to get an inputstream which you can wrap in an inputsource

3897571
shibboleth	opensso
you could indeed use shibboleth or perhaps opensso

3897571
shibboleth	opensso
while the spnego solution may be easier if you can control the configuration of the client machines the shibboleth opensso solution will be more flexible in that respect and the shibboleth idp could use spnego as an authentication mechanism if you want it all

3897575
pull	push
rather than the callback pull mechanism you are using audiotrack is more of a push model where you keep writing to the track presumably in a background thread using blocking calls

3897580

in pre-1917 russia poland as its part used gregorian calendar while all the rest russia used julian calendar with floating difference of 13-18 days at the same time zone 5b

3897619
filtering	grouping
through its system of filtering and hooks wordpress allows developers to extend functionality through pieces of code called functions which can be grouping into separate executables called plugins

3897647
width	height
for instance the wpf datagrid has virtualizing turned on by default but if you place the datagrid inside a stackpanel and don t provide any width height restrictions then you effectively nullify virtualization since the stackpanel allows the datagrid to grow infinitely thus having to create datagridrows for hundreds of thousands items

3897647
width	height
in winforms the hosting control propbably provides specific width height restrictions and doesn t allow the usercontrol to grow infinitely

3897647
width	height
try setting a specific width height for your usercontrol or mainwindow and see if the performance gets better.

3897653
glassfish	geronimo
i tried to download additional servers but i see only 5 versions of geronimo and a jetty server no apache and other glassfish versions

uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i m using the code in a standard uiviewcontroller but that is inside a uinavigationcontroller which might be where the problems lie

3897777
width	height
i m having a fairly strange problem with a timage component s width and height properties

3897777
width	height
as a test i draw a red dot in what is supposed to be the center of the timage component by taking the midpoint of the timage s width and height and drawing the dot there so that it is centered centerpoint2d is a tpoint

3897777
tpanel	tframe
the timage control sits on a tpanel that sits on a tgroupbox that sits on the tframe

3897790
disk	ram
it does seem excessive to need 1gb of ram to only end up with a db that is 120mb on disk does it not

3897850
pop-up	dialog
the dialog boxes pop-up but no data is being written to the file

3897912
inherited	subclassing
for all the other cases just subclassing the dao that firestorm makes and add functionality to it that you want using the inherited helper methods

3897919
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
run firebug for firefox or webkit s developer tools for safari or google-chrome to examine the ajax requests being sent and if why they are failing

3897930
hash	md5
it is better to create a hash md5 or sha1 of his email-id + any other details he provided and mail it to him

3897958
jwindow	jdialog
if you need a maximise button the best solution would be using a jwindow or a jframe instead of a jdialog

3897959
multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	division	division	multiplication
multiplication and division are much more complicated and the compiler usually produces some small helper functions to deal with these whenever you multiplying 64-bit numbers together

3897999
post	get
you can still access get and post data through the input library like this

3898015
getter	setter
the property creates two methods a getter and a in your case more important setter the retain statement which you wrote in your property declaration only applies to the setter

3898048
nsdatadetector	nsregularexpression
the nsdatadetector class available in ios 4.0 and later is a specialized subclass of nsregularexpression that has explicit support for detecting phone numbers

3898055
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that google-chrome support the event loadedmetadata in the video element while firefox don t

3898055
google-chrome	firefox
it worked well in firefox but when i tried in google-chrome the function was executed twice which is logical

3898070
bash	zsh
but if there is no bash zsh or other shell installed on a nix-system system will fail

3898082
profiling	instrumentation
first i would confirm your assumption that this really is the function that is slow - use the profiling - instrumentation - cpu sampler - to see what timing information that function shows and compare it with others as something else could be slowing things down

3898102
ant	maven
jetbrains.com - ant and maven

3898106

the time stamp counter is a 64bit register present on all x86 processors since the pentium

3898193
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
if you are definitely closing off your sqlconnection then i would also review your sqldatareader and ensure you are closing those

3898204
queue	fifo
i m working on an academic open source project and now i need to create a fast blocking fifo queue in c#

3898204
queue	fifo
this is the classic fifo queue implementation with static array we find on textbooks

3898285
width	height
note source.length is the width columns of the array and source 0 .length is the height rows

3898313
disk	ram
it does indeed emulate a disk using ram

3898314
disk	ram
all live distros mount a temporary hard disk in ram memory

3898317
gentoo	linux
use something like gentoo linux with 64 bit processors as you can compile it natively as you install

3898321
int	double
then the division takes place with a double and an int and the result will be a double in this case the expected 0.5

3898353
kde	gnome
then choose your configuration interface you have the choice of console text config ncurses style menuconfig kde style xconfig and gnome style gconfig these days and execute . make whateverconfig

3898353
disk	ram
next go to boot and use mkinitrd to create the ram disk needed to boot properly if needed

3898355
int	double
that code is not very efficient as it constantly converts between double and int

3898373
post	get
if you have the option you could use post rather than get

3898393
udp	tcp
as toby already said node can do http tcp udp and unix sockets

3898398
onclick	onchange
it call flex function by onchange event try onclick event of your button instead

3898417
hide	show
i have a menu div which show hide based on click with jquery but none of the links are active when you put them in

3898431
for-loop	loops
if you want to know which decompiler works best write all java well known statements for-loop if statement while loops with some expressions see what best represent your original code

3898447
command-pattern	memento
for my specific app i m writing a bitmap editor where i m using command-pattern and the memento pattern to allow undo and redo of edits

3898467
disk	ram
tiled maps are much faster to load and don t require much ram but multiple versions form of cache copies at multiple resolutions require much disk space

3898488
onresume	onpause
obviously you ll need to make sure you don t run into synchronization issues if you get to onresume immediately after onpause while the thread is still busy saving

width	height
just like i set width and height

3898578
.htaccess	httpd.conf
to enable multiviews edit your httpd.conf or vhost file for the directory you want to enable it for if you re on shared hosting it should still be possible providing your host allows you to do a local override in your .htaccess - options +multiviews

3898710
uiview	subviews
i have an uiview and its subviews

3898718
opennlp	lingpipe	nltk	opennlp	nltk	lingpipe
though some people here are partial to suggesting python with nltk you can get an equally good nlp library in opennlp for java or stanford s javanlp or lingpipe

3898718
lisp	prolog
one thing you don t need is a special purpose language or paradigm like prolog or lisp

3898719
jtable	jinternalframe
i m using a jinternalframe to display the jtable

3898719
jscrollpane	jinternalframe
i also tried to put a jpane inside my jinternalframe and them add the jscrollpane into it but nothing occurred also

3898745
datediff	difference
for the data that you would have however by pairing consecutive login logout pairs you could process the data to get the information that you need just using a simple datediff datepart date 1 date 2 function in cf to figure out the difference if you had already queried the data

3898755
put	get
and then to get the salt value you just can get it straight and put it the sql query like below

3898787
ostream	ostringstream
even a generic ostream object can have ostringstream functionality if given a stringbuf

3898799
hash	salt
therefore if you want to just generate a random hash with no means of recreating it since you don t know what salt was used you can just call the function with hashme message to hash

3898806
maven	pom.xml
i have a small 4 module maven project with the root pom.xml in pom.xml packaging

3898807
put	get

3898812
gson	jackson
note that jackson fixes these issues and is faster than gson

3898858

3898874
debian	linux
environment linux debian 5 lenny apache server 2.2.9-10+lenny8

3898926
ostream	ostringstream
there are a number of overloads that are members of the ostream class which is a base class of ostringstream

3898926
ostream	ostringstream
this overload is an exact match for the right-hand side a.value is an int but requires a derived-to-base conversion on the left-hand side stream is an ostringstream which is derived from ostream

3898940
hide	show
i am thinking to place these checkboxes dropdowns in a separate column and show them only for selected item s and hide them for unselected items

3898952
put	get
get rid of the second var handlesuccess ... and put in a handlefailure definition

3898982
getter	setter
if the state needs to be exposed outside of the class then there is a strong case for declaring the variables private and providing getter and setter for other classes to use

3898982
getter	setter
and if those getter and setter have been declared then you can make a weaker case that the class itself should use them

3898982
getter	setter
for those people who are concerned about the efficiency or otherwise of getter and setter in java the chances are that it will make no difference to performance

3899002
awt	swing
it looks like you re mixing awt and swing painting

3899002
awt	swing
see painting in awt and swing for details

3899031
opera	google-chrome
i wrote a facebook app from php and html that work perfect in the opera browser but doesn t work in internet explorer or google-chrome

3899052
jboss	weblogic
each vendor websphere jboss weblogic etc may provide their own means of setting a default locale for the container so you ll have to consult the documentation of your web container

3899052
websphere	ibm
having said that many application server and web container vendors provide their own extensions to the servlet jsp spec for example ibm websphere provides quite a few extensions

3899053
post	put
here is a blog post that i put together on the subject

3899140
sorting	filtering
with all the data in rows and the columns are for filtering sorting

3899190
implements	extends
by extends wrapper you don t have to implements all of the boiler plate just the few bits you want

3899192
filesystems	hfs+
the problem is due to the case-insensitive default of hfs+ filesystems

3899194
listview	gridview
you could use a gridview but you could also get away with using a listview which allows for a little more control over your markup

3899228
post	get
the bit that had to change is the creation of the consumer in both the get and post handlers

3899232
width	height
you ve explicitly set the width height of the mainpage object in mainpage.xaml

3899271
innodb	myisam
you must specify engine innodb because mysql will use myisam by default

3899297
pull	push
you re taking the wrong approach - instead of trying to push the text into the text block from the control s class you need the text block to pull the value from the control s class

3899336
jstl	taglib
jstl or my custom taglib

3899393
opera	firefox
firefox and opera were tripping due to earlier php code intended to prevent users coming in through anything other than the index page

3899414
inherited	properties
because dog inherited from animal - so dog can be treated as though it were an animal it is an animal in fact it supports the same interface - that is all properties methods on animal are guaranteed implemented by dog

3899439
post	get
you better get a package from mass email service providers because there are quite a lot of rules raymund s post has mentioned some rules that i am talking about that big shots google yahoo hotmail apply that will cause your emails to go into spam folder

3899446
mouse	keyboard
you can use sendmessage api to send mouse and keyboard messages to a window or you can use sendinput which simulates actual hardware events

3899458
vim	emacs
i want to keep my vim and emacs configurations under version control but i don t want my entire home folder there or rather i do but there should be 3 separate repositories

apache	nginx
i m currently running apache on port 8080 which serves the django stuff via mod_wsgi and i use nginx on port 80 to handle requests and proxying

3899576
touchesbegan	touchesended
this example only overrides touchesended but you can do the same for touchesbegan

3899602
int	double
my idea is to treat properties of primitive type such as int double string as xmlattributes

3899615
serializable	deserialization
when you come to a reference you need to serializable look through the references you ve already serializable - if you find it output an appropriate id or whatever so you can restore the reference appropriately on deserialization

3899634
inherited	properties
in wpf you don t have to inherited listviewitem to add your properties you can create your class with your properties and bind it to listview s or listbox s itemsource and create itemtemplate to show item as you like

3899635
groupbox	panel
you can use the groupbox or the panel control itself

3899646
lisp	scheme
it is worthwhile to learn about new standard library functions if you haven t had exposure to lisp or scheme however

3899650
lsp	principles
i wouldn t say that liskov s substitution principles is a form of covariance so much as generic covariance allows lsp to be expressed in generic relationships

3899665
button	checkbox
in my opinion your example looks a bit too complicated for such a simple task as binding to a button or a checkbox

3899695
int	double
int double is already available for you as an implicit conversion and string double looks like you might be perverting the type system

3899748
uiview	subviews
i tried creating a uiview and using it as a subviews for all the table cells but obviously this wouldn t work since entities in ib are object instances not classes or templates

3899831
debian	linux	debian	mint
linux mint so debian distro

3899907
opera	firefox
i was never able to determine what caused it the page loaded fine in ie9 + opera but gave this error in firefox

3899913
put	get	post	get	post	put
i want to create the istance of command bean managed by the post in the get method but during some tests i realized that this can be not correct beacuse if the validation process goes bad i have all errors on the input command which is different from which i m gogin to put in the returned modelandview

if you need to protect the session number as well encrypt the http connection using https ssl

3900201
gridview	detailsview
a gridview produces a table showing multiple records while a detailsview shows one at a time

3900204
division	modulo
in java the modulo is used to get the reminder after the division

3900222
codeigniter	yii
codeigniter is dead simple and yii has already built a plugin system into its framework via components and modules

3900233
portrait	landscape
i would like the app to display portrait type images when ipad device is in portrait orientation and landscape type images when ipad device is in landscape orientation

3900233
portrait	landscape
so there would be two versions of every image one cropped for portrait viewing and one cropped for landscape viewing and the app would show the version that is appropriate for the orientation the device is in

3900233
portrait	landscape
ideally the view would change over to the corresponding image staying where it is in the sequence of images when the user rotates the device so from portrait #4 to landscape #4 and vice versa for example

3900270
google-chrome	firefox
and when i enter in webrowser firefox google-chrome ie www.guardian.co.uk it s redirecting me to www.todoist.com

3900293
kerberos	ntlm
it is not of course - because if ad is not available then kerberos authentication falls back to ntlm domain account credentials are cached locally one can login with it even if ad kerberos is not available

3900316
int	double
just generate a double and scale it to the int range you require

3900334
int	double
if you have a double number from 0 to 1 you can scale it to the int

3900385
int	chars
so it s obvious that when i change unsigned chars to unsigned int

3900385
int	chars
why is conversion different for arithmetic between unsigned chars and chars apparently unsigned is converted to signed and unsigned int and int apparently signed is converter to unsigned

3900405
min	max
in my flex air application with systemchrome false showflexchrome false i am using applicationcontrolbar as the title bar with title text close max min button

3900405
min	max
my application shows close max min buttons on right title text on left

3900405
min	max
but my requirement is on windows it should be like it is on mac the title bar should show close max min buttons on left

3900417
integer	unsigned
otherwise if both operands have signed integer types or both have unsigned integer types the operand with the type of lesser integer conversion rank is converted to the type of the operand with greater rank

3900417
integer	unsigned
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand then the operand with signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type

3900417
integer	unsigned
otherwise if the type of the operand with signed integer type can represent all of the values of the type of the operand with unsigned integer type then the operand with unsigned integer type is converted to the type of the operand with signed integer type

3900417
integer	unsigned
otherwise both operands are converted to the unsigned integer type corresponding to the type of the operand with signed integer type

3900417
int	chars
first both operands are converted to int because an int can represent all values of unsigned chars

3900417
integer	unsigned
an int cannot represent all the values of an unsigned int so rule 3 is used and the signed integer is converted to an unsigned integer uint_max - 1

3900462
nsmutablestring	nsstring
in this situation i d use a normal autoreleased nsstring object however you can also use an nsmutablestring which you release yourself but then you ll have to adjust to code to make use of the nsmutablestring methods such as appendformat instead of stringbyappendingformat

3900513
post	put
well that s easy there is a nice post on that here put this in the function.php file within your theme

3900522
mouseup	mousedown
i ve seen some flash apps where some buttons work by mousedown and others by mouseup

3900522
mouse	keyboard
also consider disabling the keyboard and mouse just before sending the events and re-enabling after

3900637
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome safari - webkit inspector ctrl+shift+i to bring it up

3900676
super	extends
super extends classtype

3900690
hash	salt
use a salt hash to store passwords

3900690
hash	md5
if you need your code to be extremely portable or run on old versions of php md5 sha1 is fine too but it will make ignorant people complain that you are using a hash that has been broken .

3900696
qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsitem
i have one qgraphicsscene as the main scene with several movable qgraphicsitem s in it and another qgraphicsscene on top of the main scene as an overlay

and enable disable hide show them based on table values configuration

3900740
onresume	onpause
i close db in onpause and open it in onresume

3900772
put	get
are you supposed to iterate the search results and put an appropriate counter whenever they get searched or is there a non-intrusive mechanism by which this can be captured at a lower level than the application layer

3900775
integer	unsigned
each set is a hex representation of a unsigned integer so you can play around with the possibilities

3900798
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
everything works great with firefox 4 google-chrome 7 and safari 5

3900803
textarea	textbox
i want to do this because i will have a button to expand it but if user is allowed to enter multiple lines when the textarea is not expanded only 1 row it doesn look very nice and if i use a textbox for the not expanded state it looks weird when i replace it with the textarea and expand it with animation

3900806
packets	multicast
routers are rarely made and configured to support resending multicast packets to other networks

3900811
textarea	textbox
you can stack the elements then show the textarea first and remove the textbox right away

3900845
google-chrome	safari
internet explorer did something called remainingspace but that doesn t work in google-chrome safari

3900860
implements	extends
personally i d recommend implements your own adapter most likely in this case by extends simplecursoradapter and encapsulating the updates to distance text and compass heading rotation within that

3900868
awt	swing
i have only found answers to the swing version of this problem setprototypedisplayvalue but i have to stick with awt since this is a homework

3900886
opera	firefox
firefox 3.5+ ie9 beta opera and webkit browsers display them

3900890
typedef	struct
as you can see i ve had to redefine nodehandle_t in caching_storage_t because if i try it with the commented-out typedef line which i d prefer i get an error no type named â handle_tâ in â struct btree_node ... â -- which is obviously incorrect and the compiler knows it since the typedef works fine in btree

3900983
portrait	landscape
simple javascript code to make mobile browser display either in portrait or landscape

3901004
folder	directory
i have just one root directory with index.php in it along with two folder img and css

3901004
folder	directory
i am guessing the problem is with url being treated as directory structure and then it cant find img and css folder there

3901005
post	put
also for browsers that do not support put and delete verbs in html forms you could use the httpmethodoverride helper inside your form which will add a hidden field to the form which will instruct the runtime to invoke the proper controller action despite the fact that under the covers a post request is sent

3901020
hash	salt
if it is set hash the password with a salt

3901022
for-loop	loops
i understand the variable j itself goes out of scope when exiting the for-loop but will an integer be locally allocated n times on the stack so that the int objects pointed to by the elements in the vector remain valid outside loops

3901023
hide	show
also i d recommend having both the text in a span and the always present and just toggle them to show hide the proper ones

3901023
hide	show
you simply show hide the and on a delegate click and blur

3901024
querypath	phpquery
therefore phpquery querypath is likely the robuster approach

3901040
awt	swing
also it would be better to spend your time learning swing rather that awt since painting in swing is somewhat different and you might as well spend time learning a more current gui solution

3901058
touchesbegan	touchescancelled	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchescancelled	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchescancelled
you ll need to create a view then use touchesbegan touchesmoved touchescancelled and touchesended callbacks to implement your custom behaviour

3901071
int	chars
what you want to do is not to copy a string but to assign a single chars value which conceptually is no different from an int apart from its size

3901071
int	chars
on some platforms an int might be no larger than a chars

3901163
memcached	apc
i am trying to move from the typical combination of apc for opcode and memcached for my userdata to a purely apc based cache

3901166
equals	tostring
the proxy trait provides a useful basis for creating delegates but note that it only provides implementations of the methods in any equals hashcode and tostring

3901180
bibtex	latex
i m new to latex and bibtex so excuse my ignorance

3901211
rss	feed
there doesn t seem to be a way to control this from the flickr api however i did come up with another site which offers rss of flickr feed precisely because the flickr api is limiting

3901237
mouse	keyboard
handle its own keyboard mouse

3901237
mouse	keyboard
apis and all keyboard mouse

3901244
google-chrome	firefox
if you want to capture a sequence of comands the imacros browser macro recorder addons are very useful ie google-chrome firefox

3901249
std	ostream
for std ostream and derived classes operator is a formatted output function

3901256
min	max
i might use std numeric_limits max and min instead of computing the bytes but then i would have to switch to run-time assert

3901287
postgresql	mysql
open source databases mysql postgresql with entity framework

3901345
getter	setter
if it s a private class that only the parent class will use i usually will just put in fields instead of getter and setter

3901347
swt	swing
some modern gui toolkits like swt oder swing all have simple structured like rectangle or point where the elements are accessed directly and where the classes are part of the public api

3901347
getter	setter
so we can conclude a simple rule where its okey if and only if the class is not likely to change because it is very simple and if it is used very often so that the time gain is measurable and if the attributes are not used in bean binding so no property change event are needed when the properties change then you might omit the setter and getter

3901348
getter	setter
this way when a developer want to use any of the component you provide he won t need to wrap everything in order to access the attributes with getter setter to make it work with the framework he s using

3901364
free	malloc
write a allocator and de-allocator that use the store and only the store and call them from the rest of your program instead of calling malloc and free .

3901373
apache	nginx
your webserver also needs to support this header at least apache and nginx which i ve worked with does

3901382
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
this tutorial recommends making crossdomain.xml or clientaccesspolicy.xml files and putting them in the web root of the service

3901430
command-pattern	memento
i ve experimented with combinations of using command-pattern and the memento pattern for my undo redo system

3901471
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
something could break on the next update of ie firefox opera google-chrome safari or it could work fine

3901472
post	get
in addition to changing the concurrency mode to fixed as morteza says you have to inject the concurrency value which you read during the get before updating the entity during the post

3901561
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
is working fine in firefox safari google-chrome etc

3901590
oncreate	setcontentview
basically i am calling setcontentview r.layout.xxx in oncreate as usual so i don t really have a way to pass in references to additional textviews unless i awkwardly retrieve the view after setcontentview and then make calls on it

3901643
width	height
and even b find out the size of the popups since they are hidden normally which means width height 0 until they are shown

3901679
gson	jackson
i don t have gson but jackson another object-to-json mapper prints this

3901728
uilabel	nsstring
you ll need to use the nsstring uikit additions to compute the height you need to set on your uilabel and then adjust the other controls appropriately

3901740
ready	each
this is important for larger features because it means that one can work on a series of commits to implement a feature each commit being small and self contained for easy finding bugs by bisecting history to one own satisfaction and only when they are ready to publish them

3901740
pull	push
a variant of this approach is to have separate public repository with rebasable branch with work in progress and push or send a pull request only when branch is ready for inspection

3901813
width	height
but i want this to do from code rather than xml.i have done everything that i have done in xml like font width height font dynamically through code but not able to set background that i mentioned in xml file

3901819
user-controls	tabcontrol
the only solution i can think is a tabcontrol with invisible tabs to switch programmatically or create a custom user-controls and place it somehow..but the last solution i think sucks because the content i want to display isnt just a user control.

3901889
pop-up	dialog
select in the dialog which pop-up visual c++ - win32

3901930
svnadmin	visualsvn
i don t know exactly how to dump a visualsvn repo but once you do so you can do svnadmin load from linux

3902002
expression-blend	silverlight
in expression-blend 4 silverlight project i have a usercontrol to which i have added a clr property

3902022
int	chars
again dynamically allocates a single chars with an int value of 10

3902050
prepare	execute
you can build a string with the concat function and then use prepare and execute to run the string as a query

3902125
treeview	tabcontrol
let s say i have a tabcontrol with 2 tabs and a treeview with 2 nodes at the root

3902125
treeview	tabcontrol
i want the application to behave in the following manner if i click on node1 from the treeview the tab1 from the tabcontrol should become active

3902218
opera	google-chrome
opera on background google-chrome on foreground

3902223
stdout	stderr
granted those could largely be optimized away since stdin stdout stderr etc. etc

3902251
background-image	background-position
i m not familiar with the particular problem you describe and i don t know whether there is some specific fix for it but one workaround is using background-image background-position which is easier to fine-tune

3902286
children	parent
found so php traversing function to turn single array into nested array with children - based on parent id

3902309
hide	show
upon the user closing the dialog the view will show hide the appropriate columns i went a step further - as the user checks a column in the dialog it instantly becomes visible in the grid so that the user knows they chose the right one when displaying many tens of columns quite a few could be very similar

3902325
children	parent
whenever something derived from qobject is destroyed qt automatically deletes all its children recursively as well as long as each child was passed a parent pointer

3902398
getter	setter
in other scenarios for example when trying to have public getter and private setter i faced the same problem

3902399
int	double
i changed the int to long int and that did not change anything then i changed them to double and i get the error listed in the title

3902400
width	height
simple math you have n width height and want x y

3902408
int	double
you can t use a double with the operator you must have an int

3902411
pop-up	dialog
the issue is if the login password is wrong i can t just get a 401 status unauthorized chrome pop-up the regular authentication dialog

3902415
entity-relationship	entities
the entity-relationship model defines entities unto themselves and allow the reference of entity-to-entity table-to-table through a separate relation

3902456
width	height
height and width refer to the image dimensions

3902456
put	get	width	height
if i put height and width instead of 500 and 500 above i get an error since they are not constant values

textarea	textbox
it will probably be easier to do this if you use the basic textbox mode of the html module then you just need to set the value of a textarea rather than figure out where to insert the value in the fckeditor and the technique will be still work if the site is configured to use the telerik provider instead of the fck provider

3902495
stdout	stderr
viewing stdout and stderr

3902495
stdout	stderr

3902833
margin	height
i ve played around with height border position padding and margin but haven t been able to figure this one out

3902839
for-loop	arrays
you only need to know the number of items in the arrays if you are using the c style for-loop

3902851
keydown	keyup
you can use setinterval to run your handler every eg 400 ms then maintain a stack of pressed keys by handling keydown and keyup

3902893
post	get
but if you want to get the admin page for post to also let you add urls you need to do some tricks with inlinemodeladmin

3902899
width	height
the website page i m working on at the moment is 100 percent height and 100 width so the content should be viewed all the time

3902912
put	get
and i get the following error i put the line number 14 in the code

3902921
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
position it 50 from the window parent container and use a negative margin size that s half of the elements width height

3902935
hide	show
this will hide it if it s show and show it if it s hidden

3902961
cpu	processors
despite the fact that the cpu utilization on my quad core and on only one processors never exceeded 25 it turned out that the lack of updating was due to a processing not processors overload somewhere in the graphics handling chain

3903012
for-loop	loops
erlang is looking for-loop 0 but can t find it because your function is loops 1

3903019
vim	emacs
you write python code line by line as you would on python interactive mode in a text editor such as vim emacs etc..

3903048
division	subtraction
no class can ever have size less than one because pointer arithmetic specifically the subtraction operator can divide by the size and division by zero is undefined

3903052
x86	mips
in the context of porting native applications it usually refers to the combination of cpu isa x86 amd64 ia-64 power mips armv9 sparc hardware architecture pc chrp prep mac kernel linux nt and base libraries posix win32 core foundation

filtering	grouping
my logic here is that i have all the contacts in the contacts table from there i have a column called grouping that i use to filtering the contacts into grouping

3903077
int	double
for most modern architectures you need to align int to word boundies and long int to double word boundries

3903114
integer	unsigned
if the original value was an unsigned integer of lesser width than int it will be changed to a signed value as well

3903228
disk	ram
the loading of the images from disk to ram would ideally need to be done on a background thread try performselectoronbackgroundthread so that the i o doesn t bog down the main thread which will impact on your scrolling performance

3903265
getter	setter
the only way to do it is to create getter and setter

3903303
put	get
now the clean and methods don t sound like a nice place to put code that has side effects and i fear that checking at this moment whether the value is unique does not guarantee i won t get integrityerror s

3903319
getter	setter
core data s synthesis of attribute getter setter is a similar example of objective-c s dynamic messaging and dynamic runtime making things much easier

3903339
post	get
the app sends out a get or post request to a url

3903395
stdout	fflush
so you should include a newline in the message and still do fflush stdout

3903441
firefox	safari
i found a vertical menu but i m having some problems with it because i have some incompatibility with ie 7 8 9 and also with safari just it working for firefox

3903474
getter	setter
what i found in google to be the solution to this is to change the use of mscrollx for the public getter of view but the code also sets that variable and there are no setter available

3903506
libpcap	wireshark
libpcap libpcap is packet capture library used in tcpdump wireshark

3903507
wicket	stripes	struts	wicket	struts	stripes
you can avoid struts and have a look to some other mvc framework wicket stripes play etc

3903507
wicket	stripes
but i still suggest to check spring with spring mvc stripes wicket struts2

3903518
width	margin
if not simply stick with your one center div give it a width and position it using margin 0 auto

3903546
hash	salt
eg there s no salt or other method of protection against looking for matching hash

3903548

see the section labeled accessor method names in apple s objective-c programming language document for more details on getter and setter names for declared properties

3904029
button	checkbox
2 i have used a popup page with a edittext and add button on top and listview with checkbox below it

3904046
inherited	properties
3.also on your model surface just select the association line between the two entities and remove it your navigation properties will be gone by having inherited you don t need that

3904149
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
document.getelementbyid editor .focus works well in firefox and ie but in google-chrome safari it just selects the entire content

3904158
hex	binary
in the computer s memory that number value is usually represented in binary no matter how it s specified in your source code decimal hex whatever

3904188
gif	png
from that point i would only grab the first few bytes of data from the content and check if the image meta data existed and whether or not it was jpg png or gif

3904294
getter	setter
firstly i would create a small class holding the information about your items to make it a bit easier to work with i ve only implemented the necessary setter you ll probably want some getter and other functions as well

3904361
xlib	cairo
iâ ve a program developed using xlib and cairo

3904361
xlib	cairo
just for the reference i do mix calls between cairo and xlib although iâ m not sure if that might be the cause of the error

3904361
xlib	cairo
one is the main ui thread which makes calls to both xlib and cairo another uses it just to send a xclientmessage and third makes some xlib calls like xcopyarea and at the end send an xclientmessage those are for some animations

3904361
xlib	cairo
iâ ve also guarded all xlib calls with xlockdisplay cairo calls are also guarded with xlockdisplay

3904361
xlib	xcb
can this be a bug in xcb and is it worth trying to compile xlib without xcb

3904372
public	protected
changing the visibility to public or protected will resolve the error

3904413
folder	directory
i want to copy only the parent folder names from source and then create the folder with those names in a destination directory

3904451
keydown	keyup
i use keydown because keyup didn t work for me

3904462
namedtuple	dictionary
it then passes that to namedtuple and returns a class that s inherited from the resulting namedtuple with all appropriate methods in its dictionary

3904495
puts	gets
so from the top what this does is gets the data from every txtbox on the form puts it all into one string then stores all that information into the data variable

3904499
min	max
i tried min dob - it gives me the oldest person and when i tried max it gives me nothing

3904503
google-chrome	safari
once i had this problem using safari never tested with google-chrome maybe there was the same problem google-chrome safari both use the same rendering-engine as far as i know - don t know about the js-parts

3904503
firefox	safari
i never found a solution to work around that but because of it was a small app in a company-wide intranet it wasn t a big problem to not support safari firefox was the default-browser anyway and firefox works

3904564
int	double
first array will be pointer-to-pointer-to-pointer int - since it points to double pointers

3904567
keydown	keyup
i use keydown because keyup didn t work for me

3904618
pull	push
you can then send patches or a pull request or push to mob branch

3904702
hide	show
in that event handler hide second dialog collect the data and show it again when ready

3904702
hide	show
make sure that you create black_box only once and show hide it as appropriate

3904780
atof	setlocale	atof	strtod	strtod	setlocale
not sure following consideration applicable across standard but msdn states that strtod as long as atof react to the settings set up in a call to setlocale see lc_numeric

3904842
submit	submission
given that i m thinking you need to capture whatever curl s submission to b and submit the same request from your browser

3904871
submit	submission
also if you re relying on knowing which submit button the user pressed the above loses that because we re not submission the form using the button anymore we re cancelling that one and then submission it later with code

3904918
ubuntu	linux
running under linux ubuntu 10.10

3904937
pop-up	dialog
i m trying to add a pop-up message function in my project.and i make it run in a subthread since i need a realtime notification.but i find if the notification dialog is created in my subthread started by afxbeginthread all the elements buttons urls.... of the dialog are not shown.the message box is just a blank dialog

firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
wanted to know maximum size of session variable for different browsers firefox msie7 8 google-chrome opera safari

3904970
serializable	deserialization
i have found a tutorial on how to implement custom a serializable deserialization for java enums

3905045
getter	setter
the problem is that the interface has only getter and you try to explicitly implement it with getter and setter

3905045
getter	setter
if the interface only has getter there is no way to use the setter so it makes no sense to have a setter there

3905056
filesystems	ntfs
using ntfs with permissions for the drive s filesystems would be bypassed by anyone with applicable window s privileges

3905146
getter	setter
when one is clicked a value with a viewtate getter setter assigns this the value of the button clicked

3905208
codeigniter	pyrocms
one thing you can do is create a my_input or my_security in codeigniter 2 like the one in pyrocms and override the xss_clean method with an exact copy minus the object|embed| part of the regex

3905216
folder	directory
if you re using an ide like eclipse the working directory is by default the projects root folder

3905284
children	parent
i have widgets which have children and one parent

3905339
int	boolean
of course there are no threads and semaphores in javascript but instead of using many boolean variables you could use just one int for counting

3905366
opera	firefox
everything works just fine in firefox ie opera etc

3905375
free	malloc
you can instrument your memory allocation yourself by hooking malloc free calls and counting the number of bytes you allocate and you free each time

3905378
postgresql	mysql
i m converting a mysql table to postgresql for the first time in my life and running into the traditional newbie problem of having no auto_increment

3905397
children	parent
after wm_setredraw false is sent calls to getdc getdcex getwindowdc etc using the parent window handle and all its children will return a dc that won t draw on the screen

3905419
google-chrome	firefox
while same image is rendered correctly in google-chrome firefox

3905441
int	double
i would like to know the best solution in terms of performances for storing vectors arrays of data int or double whose dimension is not available at compile time it depends on the input from the user but once intialized they will never change their dimensions neither their values

3905443
post	put
i will use any feedback to put a more concise blog post together

3905457
children	parent
parent before children that would be quite easy

3905464
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i then tried calling it in viewdidload and later in viewwillappear methods but it never got called after the first launch

3905481
mutators	setter
the mutators setter is called

3905481
getter	setter
in my personal opinion a class that has bean properties should not have any other methods named get set or is if they are not getter or setter to make the method intents clearer

3905487
int	double
use them in lists of int double an example is shown here

3905576
hash	salt
actually drupal 6 does not use any salt to calculate the hash of the password

3905596
gif	png
is your best best but the jpg png gif bit will only work if you append the glob_brace flag on the end

3905629
width	height
increasing the border-width increases the overall width and height of the element

3905652
width	height
to increase the size an element you can use the width and height attributes

3905668
integer	fractions
the phase accumulator usually contains an integer component and a fractions component

3905715
put	get
the out put will give the itemnumber name and price.how i can get the type name i mean sweaters

3905726
implements	extends
the same way a class can only extends one other class but can implements multiple interfaces

3905950
multiplying	add
you should be able to do the interpolation with a single multiply-accumulate instruction if you re using a dsp otherwise it s a multiplying + scale + add on a general purpose cpu

3906117
min	max
random.nextint max - min + 1 + min will do the trick

3906154
width	height
in it i d use graphics2d.drawimage giving width and height of container as a parameters to it

3906154
awt	swing
the awt approach seems closer to bare metal but since jdk 6 brought a lot of improvements in swing rendering pipeline i would go the swing java2d approach

3906171
put	get
this seems to work fine but i get a httprequestvalidationexception if i put a single quote into my textbox

3906173
navigationcontroller	modalviewcontroller
whenever i present modalviewcontroller with the navigationcontroller this navigation comes below the actual navigationcontroller

3906192
submit	submission
it will depend from site to site and on many site you won t even need a submit value user pass should be sufficient and then in many other sites they may have some hidden fields in the login form so best way is to see the fields in the form you are submission either directly in html or using some tool like firebug

3906233
ubuntu	debian
for debian ubuntu the system is called apt and there s tonnes you can read about it

3906233
ubuntu	debian
for a developer such as yourself a nice introduction could probably be had by trying to package a piece of software for your distro of choice for debian ubuntu there is a nice guide

3906235
navigationcontroller	modalviewcontroller
whenever i present modalviewcontroller with the navigationcontroller this navigation comes below the actual navigationcontroller

3906240
disk	ram
i ve also searched for alternative solutions like for example a piece of software allowing to make windows believe that some defined part of the ram is a removable disk or something like that

3906266
hide	show
or just try jquery s toggle or hide show to see if that alone works out for you

3906297
post	get
using this solution your web page can now simply call the following stored procedure to get a list of filtered post for a given user within a specified period

3906378
rss	feed
rss feed are not ideal for a number of reasons

3906385
sorting	filtering
i have the sorting down pact but i can t filtering repeat the data

3906448
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
from what i see it is used by autoresetevent manualresetevent and semaphore but not by mutex

3906460
for-loop	arrays
in the for-loop however the - 1 is correct an arrays of size 10 goes from 0..9

3906558
firefox	safari
i checked this on safari for windows firefox internet explorer and it works everywhere except for the ipad

3906560
getter	setter
if you do not need a field because it is a standard getter or setter most people us auto-implemented properties

3906572
getter	setter
if your getter needs to do some validating on the value or your setter needs to fire a propertychanged event so that the ui can update then the first method is required

3906606
children	parent
i m not sure if the children elements will adapt themselfs with procentual values if their parent doesn t have a width attribute

3906702
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
oddly it works consistently in firefox google-chrome and opera

3906741
viewdidload	viewwillappear
the first kind are methods like initâ viewwillappear viewdidload or setup

3906776
freebsd	linux
most systems restrict the maximum backlog size on linux and freebsd this option is named somaxconn

3906779
jar	war
i just have my usersettings.java in a separate jar project and include it as a dependency to both war s

3906840
width	height
after going through approaches seems like if we load higher resolution images memory usage goes huge width height 4

3906897
disk	ram
but it technically would allow you to create an unlimited number of objects since you re trading ram memory for disk space

3906960
int	double
if a is a double rather than an int then it will be represented as mantissa and exponent

3906963
post	put
i figure it put from this post and after that i made a toggle comment from line 934 to 969 and it s all

3907030
pull	push
git remote show origin shows me that both fetch and pull urls are the same as i supply as argument to push

3907032
superclass	subclassing
it mostly depends on whether your subclassing needs things to happen before the superclass method or after

3907067
versioning	upgrade
i tried to upgrade it to the latest versioning but when i ran update.php it failed

3907081
nsurlconnection	nsoperation
but the nsurlconnection request is called outside the nsoperation so i had to modify it a little to suit my purposes

3907081
nsurlconnection	nsoperation
another good example that i found is the linkedimagefetcher which shows how to fetch images from a website and includes nsurlconnection request inside an nsoperation

3907120
inherited	subclassing
if you use the activerecord class both to find the subclassing and to get the static finders at least you can still tell what methods they inherited by looking at the activerecord class itself

3907220
typedef	struct
then you wrap that struct definition in a typedef which essentially tells the compiler that there s a type error that s equivalent to struct error

3907229
sorting	filtering
let s go back to the cases you are considering viz filtering followed by sorting vs

3907229
sorting	filtering
sorting followed by filtering

3907229
sorting	filtering
finding the pointer is o log 2 n so here there s both reasons to consider that filtering first will be faster the reasons given above and that sorting first will be faster that removal can be made a much faster operation than it was before

3907237
int	double
you are reading double values using the decimal int format d

3907247
typedef	struct
you defined a typedef in other words an alias for struct error named error

3907247
typedef	struct
you then created an instance of struct error named g1 using the typedef name

3907247
typedef	struct
struct names and typedef names occupy separate namespaces mdash

3907247
typedef	struct
you can combine a struct definition with a typedef definition

3907247
typedef	struct
in this case the struct type can only be referred to via the typedef

3907256
typedef	struct
this is a pretty basic use of a typedef struct in c

3907256
typedef	struct
the typedef acts as an alias renaming the struct error to just error so you can refer to items of this type by just the short name

3907257
rss	feed
is there any way of publishing this via say an rss feed via asp-net or a web service for it to be consumed into the outlook calendar

3907316
uilabel	uibutton
depending on the input data it currently returns uibutton uitextfields uilabel and my own subclass with more subclasses likely to be added later

3907356
ubuntu	linux
using eclipse version 3.5.2 and cdt 6.0.2 on ubuntu linux 10.04 lts

3907378
stdout	stderr
the main advantages of this is that you can call it in a variety of ways removing the need for specialized utilities to handle logging exceptions to stderr stdout and files

3907449
children	parent
another option would be to break these into two separate inserts one for the parent that returns the parent identity and one for the children that use that identity

3907463
hex	binary
viewing binary data in strings can sometimes be confusing especially if they re long but you can always convert it to some easier-to-read hex

3907555
hide	show
so when we say that encapsulation leads to abstraction or information hiding then it means that it gives us an idea which data to hide and which data to show to users.

3907599
post	put
i ve put together a small blog post and sample application to show how to enable digest authentication using the current rtm of openrasta

3907618
sat	np-complete
however basically it s np-complete because an efficient algorithm for the knapsack problem would also be an efficient algorithm for sat tsp and the rest

3907635
getter	setter
another way to achieve that is by making a getter and a setter for the health variable

3907659
accessor	properties
the properties accessor operators the dot and the bracket notation temporarily convert the string value to a string object for being able to access those methods

3907659
accessor	properties
and this happens because again the properties accessor on the second line above creates a new temporal object as

3907673
qdatastream	qbytearray
i would try something along the following lines let qdatastream do the work for you which can be constructed with a qbytearray let s call it yourbytearray

3907678
cassini	iis
moved my site from cassini to iis 7 - didnt work

3907711
sorting	filtering
you also need to figure out what filtering and sorting you will do

3907737
jar	manifest.mf
i m trying to find the cleanest code for the class to find out the manifest.mf file from the jar file it has been packaged into

3907855
jar	war
well if you know the jar is on the file system not inside a war and you also know that the security manager gives you the permission to access a class protection domain you can do it like this

3907888
rspec	capybara
cucumber + capybara + rails + rspec

3907900
mouseleave	mouseenter
i want it to change to visibility.visible on mouseenter on the grid and back on mouseleave

3907902
addclass	removeclass
use addclass and removeclass

3907928
rss	feed
in my iphone application i m parsing rss feed to get html and keep it

3907971
linqdatasource	detailsview
i have a page where i use two asp detailsview controls to render data from two different but related linqdatasource objects

3907971
linqdatasource	detailsview
my primary table is represented in the first detailsview linqdatasource set and i use the linqdatasource s built-in update functionality to persist changes when the detailsview is in edit mode

linqdatasource	detailsview
this is accomplished not via the linqdatasource but by handling the itemupdating event for the tags detailsview and using a datacontext to manually process the inserts and deletes

3907971
linqdatasource	detailsview
but the first detailsview uses its bound linqdatasource to do the update which has its own datacontext

3907996
textview	imageview
i am trying to create a custom cell with an imageview button textview and a label

3908026
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
it runs ok width firefox and width opera now all perfect but google-chrome i dont know why it doesnt parse it ok here the answer of the debug send for me the second line of the code

3908056
ssl	https
and in the iis manager for each page that i want https i have changed its setting by checking require secure channel ssl and require 128 bit encryption

3908063
stdout	stderr
processing the child s stdout stderr in the parent python process is not an option since i couldn t find functionality for doing it in a non-waiting way and the parent python process must do other things while the child is running

3908078
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
perhaps firefox and opera adjust the workings of parsefloat to deal with locale variation but apparently google-chrome does not

3908120
hide	show
all i had to do was to add the hide and show methods to the toolpanel div

3908135
post	get
you might be better to post that data as there s a chance that you re actually sending it as a get request which can be dangerous on a few security levels

3908157
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the following code works on ie6 8 google-chrome firefox safari

3908206
google-chrome	firefox
in that case everything works fine with firefox and google-chrome assuming that the xml var is a string headers text html sent in php to be sure

3908211
touchesbegan	touchescancelled	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchescancelled	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchescancelled
with touchesbegan touchesmoved touchesended and touchescancelled i then tried to play the audio files

3908216
sorting	grouping
i can easily quicksort any individual column using a quicksort recursive algorithm but grouping them together and then sorting those subgroups to the nth time is really messing with my head

3908228
innodb	myisam
i m having a problem with a innodb table was initally myisam but converted it to inndob awhile ago table

3908243
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	division	multiplying	subtract	division	subtract
it s a small microcontroller digital signal processor capable of 40 mips million instructions per second. it is only capable of integer math add subtract and multiplying it can do division but it takes 19 cycles. it s being used to process an osd layer at the same time and only 3-4 mips of the processing time is available for calculations so speed is critical

3908247
actionscript	mxml
the actionscript class to which data is converted must be used or referenced in the mxml file for it to be linked into the swf file and available at run time

3908249
free	malloc
a poor man s solution would be to just log every call malloc and free then comb through the logs and look for pattern

3908265
ssl	https
https is essentially http over ssl tls which secures the communication between the client and the server

3908265
starttls	smtps
similarly communications between an smtps client and an smtps server can be secured using ssl tls there are two variants smtps over ssl tls directly on a specific port or tls initiated via starttls within the smtps protocol

3908273
uiview	uitouch
you might try putting a graphic of your keyboard in a custom uiview subclass calculating the hit rectangles for all the active areas multiple rectangles for the white keys and using a uitouch handler in the view subclass to track all the touches individually including what hit rectangles they initially hit get moved across to another where they are released and etc

3908279
client-side	server-side
i think you re conflating the server-side templating paradigm with client-side javascript

3908290
mouseup	mousedown
it has some code to respond to mouseup and mousedown events

3908290
mouseup	mousedown
when i run this on a mac and i press and hold the mouse button nothing happens - but as soon as i release the mouse button i instantly see both the mousedown and mouseup events delivered

3908304
hash-collision	key
if you can get the number of hash-collision to zero your hash function generates a unique value for every key that is actually passed to it you will have a perfect hash

3908315
int	chars
make sure you choose the correct overload for print println write in order to write the int value as a byte instead of as chars or string

3908319
stdout	stderr
processing the child s stdout stderr in the parent python process is not an option since i couldn t find functionality for doing it in a non-waiting way and the parent python process must do other things while the child is running

3908329
put	get
i then just put some padding around the picture and you get the double-stroke border

3908329
width	height
setting fill_parent for both width and height does that but it also expands the background all the way to completely fill the cell resulting in a sort of letter boxing effect

3908396
google-chrome	firefox
it is working in ie but i am getting data as null in firefox and google-chrome

3908403
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in ie7+ firefox google-chrome safari and i believe opera you can place hover on any tag and in that case i would suggest you change the tag to a tag

3908414
width	height
at the moment it s working great but for pageloads time and such i m looking to restrain the normal users to a maximum of 300px images width and let s say around 500px height that are then resized in

3908418
width	height
the width or height of its superview

3908478
phpunit	simpletest
there are three that i use depending on the situation simpletest phpunit and zend_test which is really just a wrapper for phpunit to be used with the zend framework

3908492
width	height
just create a new image object with that url and check its width and height attributes after the onload event

3908495
phpunit	simpletest
but if phpunit isn t to your liking then you may want to check out simpletest a slightly different php testing framework

3908496
fgets	fread
just use fread or fgets

3908585
csv	tsv
if you need to pre-process your data do it with the above script then export back to csv tsv and use load data queries to finally import into your database

3908590
rss	feed
i am trying to read a simple twitpic rss feed but not having much luck

3908622
formview	linqdatasource
i m using a linqdatasource connected with a formview

3908639
fseek	ftell
the fseek and ftell is where my troubles begin

3908644
mvp	presenter
we re using asp.net with the mvp pattern and unity for ioc although this question is the same regardless of container. each presenter gets injected with an idatarepository that gets injected with an idataaccess which news up a linq to sql datacontext under the hood

3908669
prepare	execute
since you are basically doing the same inserts thousands of times you can prepare each insert before you start looping and then execute during the loop passing values as parameters

3908702
inherited	properties
you still need to declare the and elements in your master web.config file but any config section that inherited from configurationsection supports a configsource properties

3908717
button	checkbox
the application in question does not really rely on common controls radio button checkbox labels etc however there is the need for the user to be able to enter edit some text

3908730
int	double	int	chars
i have several variables of type chars array int and double

3908730
int	double
so when i m creating the table i need to tell it if it s varchar int double etc

3908754
int	double
so when i m creating the table i need to tell it if it s varchar int double etc

3908816
min	max
3 for each sample choose j such that min 0 p_j-1 x max 1 p_j

3908860
post	get
in order to get a better feel of why caliburn would be useful i recommend reading the series of post by rob eisenberg beginning here

3908878
wordpress	joomla
if you are just hosting files on the web and just need a cms have you considered one o the many open source projects such as wordpress joomla drupal or any of hte many others

3908914
inherited	properties
inherited properties are also enumerated

3908918
expression-blend	silverlight
so i created a layout in expression-blend 4 for my silverlight application

3908925
children	parent
i ve seen posts for children windows getting parent values but not vice versa

3908972
many-to-many	one-to-many
a many-to-many table exists at the level of design concept but is built in the db by building two one-to-many relationships

3908995
mouseout	mouseenter
as a simplified demonstration here is how to bind mouseenter and mouseout using .hover to a raphael element tested in ie 8

3909022
inherited	subclassing
for example if you want to have one widget representing your game window you should inherited it from a qwidget or it s subclassing and reimplement paintevent qpaintevent event function to perform your drawing

3909042
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
without any javascript that gets you support for ie7- safari google-chrome opera konqueror

3909108
punctuation	words
this leaves the punctuation but gets the final words

3909110
width	height
don t know what your viewmodel code looks like but try creating a set for the width and height properties and set the binding mode to twoway

3909121
instances	transient
this will work since the framework does by default guarantee that controller instances are transient

3909127
put	get
and try to put gridview into edit mode by clicking btnedit then i get the exception

3909145
vsto	add-in
i ve got a vsto 3.0 word add-in that i d like to profile using vsts profiler

3909145
vsto	add-in
when i try to run an instrumenting run with the profiler though i get a warning that it can t be instrumented because the add-in dll is signed which from what i know about vsto they have to be signed

3909163
post	get
now you should get all the featured post

3909169
post	get
when you find any bugs in j8583 please post them in the project page so i get notified and solve them

3909182
system.configuration	system.web
i did this by creating my own class vb class library adding the reference system.web system.configuration subsonic.dll and associated dlls i then added an app config with my connection string and service provider and then generated my classes i then built the class as a dll

3909194
google-chrome	firefox
however it works fine on the server that has ie 7 installed on it and when i try to view it using google-chrome firefox or ie 8 and above it kinda distorts the look of the website

3909208
listview	gridview	gridview	formview
in the page i d have formview control that will contain the edit fields for customerid and comments also i d have a nested gridview or listview that i could add line items to

3909208
gridview	formview
the formview and gridview controls would most likely be linked to independent datasource controls

3909211
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
you can code for standards compliant browsers google-chrome safari firefox etc. and then add conditional comments for internet explorer

3909214
uilabel	uitextview
i have one line of text that is too long to be displayed in one single line in a uilabel so i switched to a uitextview

3909237
stdout	stderr
but note i had to redirect stderr onto stdout so the command was

3909248
google-chrome	firefox
this behavior was only happneing from firefox ie google-chrome were normal

3909283
hide	show
when you click on the window the application show hide the title bar

3909349
loginview	detailsview
our proposed view hierarchy is loginview - uinavigationview landingview + collectionview - uisplitviewcontroller detailsview

3909351
hide	show
one way to do it is to expose the dropdown list public and in your parent control check the child controls dropdown to see if it should show or hide the panel on page load

3909394
filtering	grouping
the samples that i have found only show simple filtering grouping etc

3909398
vsto	add-in
i ve got a vsto 3.0 word add-in

3909398
vsto	add-in
if i compile the project then run word outside of the ide the add-in registry entry is of course still pointing to the network copy of the vsto dll not a local machine c drive copy and the add-in always fails to load

3909398
vsto	add-in
but i was wondering if there s any way to config vsto to be able to load an add-in from a network share directly

3909416
queue	fifo
there isn t an fifo ordered a queue of things to be done that you can fill up in this way

3909512
onclick	onchange
i suggest that you change the call to changevalidation to occur onchange instead of onclick

3909553
google-chrome	firefox
i m not really sure whats the problem here it works with google-chrome and firefox but not ie

3909553
google-chrome	firefox
for google-chrome and firefox el is div element while ie is null

3909553
google-chrome	firefox
by right newdiv.firstchild should be the div element but i dont know why firefox and google-chrome register it as a text element and clearly my responsetext is something like this

3909560
put	get
simply put you can reach it via the method get int of vector

3909584
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have a uiviewcontroller that contains a uitabbarcontroller with three tabs each tab being a uinavigationcontroller

3909588
int	double
if you try to call it with other types such as int or double its ambiguous -- the compiler doesn t know which you want as both are just a good or as bad if you prefer

3909596
union	distinct
according to at least for performance it is better to use union all since it does not actively distinct duplicates and as such is faster

3909624
jmock	unitils	jmock	powermockito	junit	jmockit	junit	jmock	junit	unitils	junit	mockito	junit	easymock	junit	powermockito	jmockit	unitils	mockito	jmockit	mockito	jmock	mockito	unitils	mockito	easymock	powermockito	jmockit	powermockito	unitils	easymock	jmockit	easymock	jmock	easymock	unitils	easymock	powermockito
the project site has a lot of information and hundreds of actual junit tests comparing several java mocking apis easymock jmock jmockit mockito powermockito unitils mock as well as an extensive feature comparison matrix

3909643
uilabel	uitextview
create a custom cell for you table and place a uilabel and a uitextview inside it

3909667
nsurlconnection	nsoperation
in the past i have used nsurlconnection and nsoperation on a separate runloop

3909675
maven	pom.xml
we have a large project which consists of a single build job maven via a pom.xml with multiple child folders etc

3909699
bitwise-and	modulo
moreover the modulo above can be optimized by the compiler into the bitwise-and operation

3909709
width	height
we re starting new project and we need 100 width 100 height is a bonus 3 column pure css layout for business ria

3909713
width	height
i d like to have width and height of the currently focussed window

3909713
width	height
the selection of the window works like a charm whereas the height and width are always returning 1

3909772
opera	firefox
please see this example page in opera 10 and another browser like firefox 3.6

3909772
opera	firefox
interestingly using the generic serif font displays exactly the same in opera and firefox

3909772
opera	firefox
and now opera and firefox match almost exactly

3909790
division	modulo
bitwise and will beat modulo division every day of the week

3909794
matplotlib	mplot3d
i m currently using matplotlib 0.99.1 but should shortly be updating to 1.0.0 - i know i ll have to update my code for the mplot3d implementation

3909833
switching	screens
however when i switching to landscape mode the listview is taller than the screens

3909833
oncreate	setcontentview
according to the docs listactivity has a default layout that consists of a single full-screen list in the center of the screen. but if you desire you can customize the screen layout by setting your own view layout with setcontentview in oncreate . so i don t think the listactivity is interfering

3909865
google-chrome	safari
my guess is that button being an inline element by default unless you overrode its display property somewhere else in code that s not here probably doesn t like the inner span being set to block thus unexpected behavior on safari windows and i d assume other webkit browsers unless there s something particularly special abt the windows version of safari over the mac version or over google-chrome

3909899
google-chrome	firefox
the following code works for firefox and google-chrome

3909917
getter	setter
in python you don t need to write getter and setter for everything because you can always add them in later if you need them

3909921
background-image	background-color
for using gradients on simple element background you should declare gradient as background-image instead of just background-color

3909921
opera	google-chrome
but remember that border image has poor support from most browsers as of now even opera and google-chrome

3909930
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i am getting it exactly the same size in all browsers at least firefox opera and google-chrome

3909945
put	get
i didn t need to get results for each individual query either so i just put them all in a single call and fired it off to a single mysql_query which you can do from your controller in codeigniter like so since it ll throw a fit if you pass that to db query

3909956
filtering	grouping
use the array of catalogitems to filtering items while counting and grouping them

3910011
nsstring	nsdata
you can only store nsnumber nsstring nsarray nsdictionary nsdata on all versions of the plist format some allow nsdate too

3910080
folder	directory
i think that this may have to do with the working directory folder being different when running within visual studio

3910097
google-chrome	firefox
it works how i want in google-chrome and even in internet explorer but in firefox when i hover the links the divs won t change their visibility

3910182
inherited	properties
ideally the control would be created in the design file with a bool properties of say simplebox to determine which kind of control to inherited

3910225
post	get
now i need an infinite fb session key to post some info on the user s wall and i am trying to get the offline_access extended permission which seems to be not working

3910248
set	bag
note that you have to set the dimensions iirc it is minimum and not preferred although i could be wrong along with the grid bag constraints weight cell which part of the cell it binds to etc

3910275
sqldependency	sqlcachedependency
sqlcachedependency uses sqldependency to integrate it with the asp caching infrastructure

3910279
min	max
2- if it isn t possible to do that i will have a parent opening the file instead of each child doing that that sends a struct with min and max limit and then the map procs will read whatever the lines they are responsible for process them and give the reduce process a result this doesn t matter for the problem now

3910311
voip	sip
sip is the most widely supported voip protocol

3910326
int	chars
my struct is 1 chars and 2 int

3910331
min	max
if all you are going to have is required min max then they should just be columns for the field last option

3910343
ready	each
each process starts by sending a byte up to the master to signal it s ready and blocking on read

3910365
put	get
montrã al.however if i put the i like this e in the code below i just get a space instead of the ã

3910368
implements	extends
in essence rather than extends either class directly create a wrapper class that extends control or something similarly low-level and implements idropdown add an idropdown field for the underlying control implementation you want to use and forward every method call of interest to the selected implementation

3910457
rss	feed
i m trying to read an rss field and add some metadata to each item in ruby outputting another valid rss feed

3910457
rss	feed
i d like to do this in one pass without reading the entire rss feed into memory for performance reasons but i ve been playing with libxml-ruby and the reader object doesn t seem to be able to print out the current element it has just read which makes it difficult to loop through an xml file and print out each element

3910458
post	get
get all the post for a particular month

3910484
int	boolean
get the value 3 with - each returns true but when you add boolean you get an int representation

3910549
powerpc	i386
my only other options are i386 various forms of powerpc and x86_64

3910603
hash	hmac
you can add an hmac hash of the querystring using a secure random key stored only on the server then verify the hash on every request

3910646
put	get
i m starting to miss google app engine storage s simple get and put interface

3910698
google-chrome	firefox
i have an ogg video which works just fine using the video tag when i run it on localhost in either google-chrome or firefox

3910720
margin	height
obviously set the bottom margin to the height of the image

3910720
margin	height
otherwise you could try setting the bottom margin of the body tag to the height of the image then set the bottom setting for the image to - height of the image

3910749
selecteditem	selectedindex
the bug was caused because setting the selected property of a list item in a drop down does not unselect other items but setting the dropdownlist s selecteditem or selectedindex property does unselect previously selected items

3910762
profiler	aqtime
aqtime is a decent profiler and leak checker

3910773
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
fine in google-chrome safari ie9 not checked 7 8 yet but firefox is setting right -6px botom -3px.

3910800
mouse	keyboard
but pre-configured devices such as mouse keyboard and cd player are available in the guest

3910813
cpython	pypy
if you are not specific to cpython implementation you should consider looking at pypy wiki for these purposes â this python dialect allows transparent code sandboxing

3910859
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
but anyway the font doesn t look good in firefox google-chrome or opera on a pc

3910861
inherited	properties
i ll still keep my answer posted as another way to emit 2 different xml tags for a commonly inherited properties but i recommend you to look into xmlattributeoverrides as well

3910861
getter	setter
this base class set should contain all the necessary getter setter logic

3910922
webkit	gecko
it works as expected in webkit engine and for some reason that i am unable to figure out and i could use some fresh eyes on this gecko and opera add 5 extra pixels to #header width and not to #footer-container making a horizontal scrollbar appear on the body

3910928
jobs	cron
cron is a system process that runs the jobs you put it these jobs give you the job by writing to it in a text file

3910931
postgresql	mysql
for entering and storing the data i would use a relational database like sqlite mysql or postgresql

3910931
postgresql	mysql
for mysql i like phpmyadmin and for postgresql phppgadmin

3910934
microchip	dspic
you can also add an ethernet controller and use microchip s free tcp ip stack with their pic18 pic24 dspic and pic32 families

3910936
superclass	subclassing
i want to receive a queryset where each object belongs to a proxy class of a common superclass so that i can run custom subclassing methods with the same name and my controller logic doesn t need to know or care about which kind of proxy model it is working with

3910974
vim	emacs
if you are familiar with emacs vim you could use that via the ssh shell for small edits or use xemacs with x-session-forwarding over ssh

3910995
oncreate	ondestroy
to get the entire time the app is up you would want to diff between oncreate and ondestroy of your foremost activity class

3910995
onresume	onpause
for just the time the app is in the foreground use onresume and onpause in each of your activity classes and sum the time from each class

3911025
wordpress	joomla
a cms drupal django joomla wordpress etc

3911031
int	chars
moreover i want to create a method match that for string will return true if the starting portion of the string matches aaa would match aaa zzz because the first three chars of both strings are aaa but int shorts etc

3911031
int	chars
when key2 is an int short or chars match behaves like wherease if key2 is a std string i want it to do a prefix match

3911103
cdr	cons
t cons car l delete a cdr l

3911122
junit	jmockit
for example here is an almost complete junit test using the jmockit expectations api a tool i created to enable such tests

3911196
post	get
while reading a post on stackoverflow which is now marked as closed i came across an answer comment in fact that said the following the two inner loops could possibly get a speed boost by using uint64 and bit shifting

3911202
post	get
ok i have been writing a proxy to take http get requests and translate them into http post requests because a lot of media players for python only support get

3911221
for-loop	loops
since the condition of the for-loop is just v and v is now 0 which is a false value loops halts

3911240
bufferedreader	printwriter
in my original program messages were sent and recieved using a printwriter and a bufferedreader

3911240
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
i am now trying to do the same thing but sending across objects rather than text with an objectoutputstream and an objectinputstream

3911288
typedef	struct
note that the typedef are needed to allow c code to refer to bg fg and colour without a prefix struct or enum

3911370
uiview	subviews
or does the uiview have another uiview subviews

3911440
qthread	qobject
you should wrap your code up in a qobject subclass instantiate it and use a qobject movetothread to move your object into the qthread context so that processing will occur in the context of that qthread

3911476
put	get
i can checkout the contribution by itself but if i try to checkout the contribution and put in the same directory on my computer as the main project i get an error message from tortoise svn stating this directory is in use for another url

3911565
min	max
these should both take a min value m and a max value m and return the list of integers from min to max exluding the max value m-1

3911606
width	height
connect fixed to size_allocate signal and in the signal handler get the fixed allocation width and height then get the drawingarea to make a size_request of the current allocation

3911606
width	height
to avoid doing a lot of extra unnecessary work in the second signal i just return if the previous height width match the new allocation

3911612
typedef	struct
inside of this first step towards a bootstrapped scheme interpreter i find the following set of typedef struct union and enum definitions

3911613
width	height
either define the height to be taller since the content is taller or don t define the width height and let it auto size

3911651
int	boolean
now an object can hold two different values a boolean or an int so the union now serves a purpose

3911678
x86	64bit
a x86 build can access 4 gb on 64bit windows so that s the theoretical upper limit for the process

3911707
opera	safari
because the function.prototype.tostring method returns an implementation-dependent representation of a function and in some implementation such older safari versions mobile opera and some blackberry browsers they don t actually return anything useful

3911719
int	boolean
also you are converting a boolean int in c into an address

children	parent
try relative on the parent and absolute for the children

3911983
ienumerable	ilist
web data-binding isn t against ilist and hence ilistview itypedlist etc but rather ienumerable

extjs	qooxdoo
this technique is often used by ria frameworks like qooxdoo extjs etc

3912016
tunnel	vpn
you need ip tunnel a basic vpn service would work but you might need multicast routing above that depending upon your configuration

3912018
equals	gethashcode
most places you ll see use the same semantic logic for overriding equals as gethashcode for memberwise equality...however they usually use different implementations

3912018
equals	gethashcode
if you re implementing memberwise equality for your type lets say for storing in a dictionary why not just override gethashcode then do something like this for equals

3912045
equals	gethashcode
so you cannot really implement equals in terms of gethashcode

3912045
equals	gethashcode
this is why you have collisions in a hash table and why a hash table lookup must involve call s to both gethashcode and equals

3912046
typedef	struct
ok guys we all know there are all lot of typedef struct questions out there but i feel this one is a bit of a mind bender

3912046
typedef	struct
i have a struct called ball_struct which i typedef as just ball

3912046
typedef	struct
the struct contains a pointer to a list of ball_structs since i couldn t use the typedef name before its own declaration that the ball considers its neighbors

3912046
typedef	struct
if not is there anyway i can add a ball to a ball_struct list so i don t have to remove the typedef and paste struct keywords all over my code

3912046
typedef	struct
the struct typedef

3912094
typedef	struct
ps you may want to consider using the same name for your struct and the typedef of the struct

inherited	properties
inherited my control from repeater it self so that i don t have to provide code for template properties

3912507
getter	setter
if you donâ t want to do it the right way by using a nscell youâ ll have to add instance variables to your nscontrol subclass to store the target and action and override the getter and setter to use them

3912507
inherited	subclassing
if youâ re using a custom cell that is not a subclassing of nsactioncell just change it so that it does inherited from nsactioncell instead of nscell

3912507
getter	setter
if you cannot do this for example because youâ re subclassing a nscell subclass you cannot change youâ ll have to add the instance variables for target and selector to your cell class and override itâ s setter and getter

3912526
tiff	bmp	mp3	wav
it s not like converting from bmp to tiff two image formats or wav to mp3 two audio formats

3913175
textarea	textbox
in php we use the following code to block the url link passing via textbox or textarea on form submit for avoid bad link

3913204
folder	directory
to create a jar right-click the project on eclipse - export - java - jar file then select the folder you want to include in the jar in your case i guess this includes the folder gen and libs libs being the folder with the httpmime apache-mime4j jars but probably neither res nor the root directory of your project with files such as androidmanifest.xml that will cause problems with the same file in the dependent projects

3913220
post	get
when trying to get all the comments using the fql query facebook is returning less than 100 comments per post

width	margin	width	text-align	margin	text-align
it appears that i need a fixed width set on the ul for margin 0 auto to work needs text-align center for ie

3913331
put	get
i think you need to put the config.properties file into a source folder when you build the project you can create a resources folder as a src folder and put the config file in it than you can get the file in the app

3913425
ant	maven
it currently supports ruby maven and ant

3913427
put	get
so you really have to put the or with the null to get the desired result

3913485
jar	manifest.mf
i should have listed the content of the wordpad output when i double clicked on the manifest.mf file in the jar i got

3913490
outputstream	inputstream
one way i could find is to use assetmanager and then with help of inputstream and outputstream i can write this file onto the device the first time it is run and then use it

3913491
google-chrome	firefox
works in google-chrome and firefox

3913515
jar	manifest.mf
you can extract the manifest.mf from the meta-inf directory of your jar file by using

3913516
xslt	schematron
so if you do need verify more complex relationship in a xml document you can use xpath and xslt to do this see schematron xml schema language comparison beyond w3c xml schema improving xml document validation with schematron advanced xml validation and using xslt as a validation language

3913526
google-chrome	firefox
the easiest way to find out what the problem is is to inspect the element in firefox or google-chrome using right-click - inspect element firebug needs to be installed in firefox for this

3913531
jar	manifest.mf
it s basically inside your jar s manifest file under meta-inf manifest.mf

3913545
jax-ws	jax-rs
jaxb is the binding layer for two web service standards jax-ws and jax-rs

3913562
post	get
but strangely i keep getting none for my csrf token and even more strange is that i am doing the post call sending the file but all i get on the server is just the following dict

3913597
implements	extends
you need not extends implements this class interface to use the values

3913599
integer	unsigned
-selectedrow returns signed integer and you re using unsigned in your code

3913623
getter	setter
for the normal property getter setter syntax

3913624
post	put
i like to keep it simple an address is a single attribute being the plaintext you must put on an item of mail for it to be delivered by the post office to the addressable entity in question

3913625
disk	ram
but i have access to large clusters with oodles of disk and lashings of ram and your platform might dictate another possibly more sophisticated approach

3913630
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
how would i get a dropdownlistfor to populate with checkbox

3913635
width	height
try this code where the pixels will adapt to the height and width of the canvas

3913640
equals	compareto
if you need a different behaviour for comparing two objects then define an equals method and or a compareto method

3913640
int	double
to compare int with double you have to implicitly or explicitly convert one of the two operands

3913745
width	height
but the curframe bitmap image even though not null has a width and height of -1 in the debugger

3913820
subobject	instances
it s an optimization because instances of the derived class take up less space than they would have if the base class subobject were required to have non-zero size

3913820
allocator	stl
i think the proliferation of allocator objects in stl templates was part of the reason - a std vector typically would be the size of 3 pointers with the empty base optimization and 4 pointers without it due to alignment

3913854
multiplying	add
it s also possible for a vector to be something else entirely for example a bounded function on the interval 0 1 is a vector because you can multiplying it by a real number and add it to another function on the interval and it will satisfy certain requirements namely the axioms of a vectorspace

3913861
children	parent
the only thing to keep in mind is that the popular parent takes care of deleting children system which qt uses is only available for qobject sub- classes

3913881
firefox	safari
similarly web browsers tend to favor these conventions ie uses r n newlining whereas safari and firefox use n

3913884
google-chrome	firefox
another problem boy this is way more interesting than i thought is that in google-chrome and firefox at least any year before 100 is treated as an abbreviation for a year in the 20th century

3913901
postgresql	mysql
this template argument is a class type derived from this base class such as sqlite postgresql and mysql

3913966
perl	tcl
i assume you re talking about a perl array which is known as a list in tcl

3913987
postgresql	mysql
it does support sqlite postgresql and mysql as well as oracle firebird and odbc

3913990
children	parent
tree nodes have parent and children just like xml elements so the mapping is easy

3914008
width	height
width to height

3914013
int	double	int	chars
i want to pass several array data types such as double chars long int etc

3914033
keydown	keyup
some browsers blur this line somewhat but the general principle is that the keyup and keydown events are there to detect any key being pressed and telling you about which key it is while keypress is for detecting an actual character being typed

3914050
profiling	debugging
better add both files - in general making test production or debugging profiling production distinction in build makes only trouble

3914107
put	get
the only way i know to do this is to get the .app file in mac put it into a folder called payload

3914130
outputstream	inputstream
one way i could find is to use assetmanager and then with help of inputstream and outputstream i can write this file onto the device the first time it is run and then use it

3914143
submit	submission
then in your other buttons when submitting...just do nothing and it ll submit normally that way this handler handles only this submit button not the other that should do a normal submission

3914217
ravendb	couchdb
there are plenty of nosql dbs for example look at couchdb mongodb or if you want something puerly net based ravendb

3914265
width	height
a line from 0 0 to 0 height of image 0 0 to width of image 0 heres the code snippet

3914349
opera	firefox
it does not work in firefox but the default action should be enough and opera where none works

3914417
int	chars
i ve seen it a few times that data in a source or destination table is different to what is expected strange chars text instead of int etc

3914443
try-catch	exception-handling
i am depending on the main method s try-catch to handle the exception-handling

3914477
jar	war
i want my jar war application to know what is the svn revision number of its source code

3914490
int	double
for those not familiar with the perl 5 internals a pvnv is a scalar structure that holds all three simple scalar types int iv double precision float nv and string pv

3914490
int	double
the flags iok nok and pok mean that the int double and string values are all in sync for some definition of in sync so any one of them may be used no conversions need to take place if you use it as an int double or string

3914496
width	height
print out your coordinates and you will see that you are plotting points outside the width and height of the image

3914518
namedtuple	dictionary
use a dictionary namedtuple or custom class to store each attribute as you come across it then append the object to a list when you reach a blank line or eof

3914535
folder	directory
i identified in my view storage directory it is creating multiple folder related to the view

3914556
client-side	server-side
anyway as everyone said php is server-side and even as cli you need to have a server on your localhost and that will just execute a php script php that don t have access to mouse mouse movement etc without a client-side language like javascript

3914579
for-loop	arrays
i have stored the images in arrays .i want to know how to display those images in uiimageview where the uiimageview should be created dynamically according to filelist count increases in for-loop

3914583
allocator	stl
a counterexample here is something like the allocator policy class in stl containers - you don t necessarily want your containers to derive from it but you want to keep it around without it taking up overhead

3914610
yslow	pagespeed
in addition to firebug and yslow mentioned by tim s van haren there s also pagespeed by google also a firebug add-on

3914690
ant	maven
now i want to use maven or ant to run the groovy file but i can t get it to work

3914702
aggregate-functions	sum
you will have to use a combination of the sum and abs aggregate-functions in sql

3914732
integer	fractions
i assume you ve already defined a single number which can be integer or real - doesn t matter you are converting everything to float anyway - and a fractions of two numbers probably something like this

3914735
google-chrome	safari
it appears a reduction in right padding for google-chrome and safari solves the issue

3914738
post	put
that will run the same post build event you defined in your project but you could put any msbuild tasks inside those target elements

3914740
for-loop	arrays
by incrementing count your for-loop tries to access an object which is not in the arrays anymore

3914760
ostringstream	std
let s specialise that though when our type is already a std string as it is pointless going through ostringstream

3914778
button	checkbox
setwidth int and setheight int since checkbox extends compoundbutton which extends button

3914809
children	parent
i want press some keys in the children windows and propagate the event in the parent

3914809
children	parent
but when i press key on the children the event is not propagate to the parent

3914829
hide	show
you could hide the footer using javascript and show it when a button is clicked

3914832
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome appear to behave better but since this is a corporate intranet application they are not really an option

3914832
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome must automatically abort the ajax request as the jquery ajax error event is fired

3914869
qstring	qobject
for example when you see qobject or qstring think c# object or string

3914920
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome it works flawlessly

3914959
getter	setter
so i started to write a pojo class created public variables and now want to get getter and setter for them folowing java naming conventions

3914959
getter	setter
which eclipse extention and in it which shourtcut will create getter and setter for me to get something like

3914975
getter	setter
or go to the source menu and select the generate getter and setter option

3914995
getter	setter
in eclipse right click on the source code and choose source - generate getter and setter

3914995
getter	setter
you can also specify either getter or setter only as well as generating javadoc comments

3915036
free	malloc
for me just adding the correct include for malloc makes your code compile warning free with

3915040
fish	bash	fish	zsh	bash	zsh
question is there a simple sh bash zsh fish .

3915042
hlsl	glsl
the normal shader languages are utilized glsl hlsl for example

you could use a profiler such as tptp netbeans or visualvm to search for it

3915219
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the strange thing is that when i use an image of 1400px wide ie8 in compatibility view firefox google-chrome safari and opera all scales this image down to 765px in the width - but not ie8

3915241
accessor	properties
using object.defineproperty you can create properties with accessor functions - so you could implement a properties like length in arrays that varies depending on the object state

3915249
nunit	mstest
i am using nunit asserts within a mstest project like as follows note this shouldn t matter see comments to dave falkner s answer

3915249
nunit	mstest
i m overriding mstest s asserts with nunit s because i like the fluent style better

3915249
nunit	mstest
lastly i m using mstest because i m having issues with nunit

3915259
crypt	hash
as i understand it dpapi uses a hash calculated from the user s actual password so you would need both an open-source implementation of the crypt functions and an explicit password from the user

3915293
jboss	glassfish
i have a web service built by java and deployed on two application servers named glassfish and jboss

3915315
metaclass	subclassing
i m trying to writing a generic metaclass for tracking subclassing

3915315
metaclass	subclassing
i tried adding the metaclass attribute later so that at least it can be applied in subclassing

3915315
metaclass	subclassing
i m looking for suggestions in order to do this either change a class metaclass at runtime in a way that it is applied to its subclassing or any other alternative

3915411
hide	show
how to set css or js make the photo show only the center 500 500 px hide the around part

3915437
pypdf	pdfminer
not exactly an answer to your exact question but you might want to have look at existing pdf parsing libraries in python for example pdfminer or pypdf

3915452
cpu	processors
when doing context switching on a single-core processors the code responsible is executed on the only cpu which takes care of switching the threads

3915460
winpcap	wireshark
however i see that on windows winpcap wireshark doesn t support ethernet capture over usb

3915498
hide	show
i would define three different listviews and either show hide them as appropriate or add remove them

3915502
crypt	hash
one thing you could do is use crypt and attempt to hash a pass with the various id types essentially probing pam or more properly probing libc s crypt which pam uses for shadowed passwords

3915525
gridview	repeater
if you are using other page for editing maybe you should use repeater instead of gridview and instead of the linkbutton just an hyperlink with url

3915588
maven	pom.xml
of course it is kind of against maven best practice one pom.xml one artifact but it is adobe flex project that produces many swf modules and it is really makes no sence to create a separate project for each module

3915640
put	get
and for bonus it would be cool if they could browse for an image that would get posted to flicker and be put in editor with the correct url as well

3915643
uitextview	uimenuitem
i have successfully been able to add a custom uimenuitem to the copy paste menu in my iphone app and even subclassed uitextview to get rid of the standard menu items

3915643
uitextview	uimenuitem
for example if the text in the uitextview is this is a test. and the person touched the word is it would add that word as a uimenuitem to the uimenucontroller

3915658
profiling	benchmarking
it s going to be hard to profiling that code with -o2 because for trivial functions the compiler will unroll the loop and you won t be able to benchmarking actual differences in compares

3915666
rss	feed
i would like to configure our mercurial server installation so the rss atom feed will publish the branch name of the changeset in addition to the standard fields title guid description author pubdate

3915686

3915808
versioning	upgrade
i have recently upgrade from cruisecontrol .net 1.4.3.x on our build machine to the latest versioning available from sourceforge which is 1.5.7256.1 and since then the xml output that is used by cradiator and cctray contain lots more information than is required as both output them straight to the screen

3915902
int	double
check out the parse tryparse methods of the int float and double types

3915905
awt	swing
don t use awt components in a swing application

3915909
mouseup	mousedown
i ve never done it but it should be possible to use the mousedown and mouseup events to select any rows that are under the cursor when you move the mouse while holding one of the buttons down

3915916
width	height
in other words if your aspect ratio is 0.5 and the sizeincreasethreshold is 10 you are going to increase the height by 10 but the width by 5 each time the command is executed

3915917
post	get
but i was wondering if anyone knows how to make a hyperlink pass some variables and use post like a form as opposed to get

3915942
mouse	keyboard
you can of course do such a thing in javascript by implementing a document-wide keyboard and or mouse listener and a periodical method with a timeout

3915963
int	chars
x y works differently for value types chars int float etc and reference types object int yourclass int ... for value types returns true if x and y are just the same value whereas for reference types returns true if x and y denote the same object - for two objects with different values the result can be false

abc	subclassing
x.equals y is by default in object.equals implemented just as x y but many subclassing override it for example for strings x.equals y checks if those strings have the same value despite if they are same objects or not so new string abc .equals new string abc is true and abc .equals abc is true

3915982
for-loop	arrays
you probably want to initialize every point in the arrays using a for-loop

3915986
bash	zsh
if you don t have readlink or realpath utilities than you can use following function which works in bash and zsh not sure about the rest

3915990
post	get
try using get_posts to get your post sorted by your custom taxonomy set up a variable that is initially an empty string called current_cat or something and with each loop of the results check the taxonomy and compare it with current_cat - if different print out a header for the new category and then the entry if the same print out an entry as usual

3916020
put	get
but if i put the z loop inside the q loop i get strange results

3916050
udp	tcp
use udp instead of tcp

3916077
width	height
for example you could print the width and height of the first screen by doing something like the following

3916089
draggable	droppable
i did a few experiments with draggable and droppable but i can t get to to work keeping them sortable

3916096
portrait	landscape
i know if you change a android phone from portrait to landscape sometimes the app relays its self out on the screen

3916097
unsigned	short
write a function that takes an unsigned short int 2 bytes and swaps the bytes

3916122
min	max	range	max	range	min
in the buildhql method i don t know how to access min and max properties of my range class to build a hqltreenode

3916129
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve added an extjs quicktip qtip to an extjs combobox and it works well in firefox google-chrome safari but not in ie7 and ie8

3916144
draggable	droppable
i recommend using jquery a javascript framework which easily allows you to make objects like divs draggable and droppable in a cross-browser compliant manner

3916150
hide	show
script runs when this specific value is chosen and dynamically changes the class of input object from hide to show hidden and visible with css display

3916191
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox but not in google-chrome

3916204
getter	setter
you now have a variable myarray which can be accessed through setter and getter synthesized by apple

3916218
ant	maven
i don t know if you use maven but if you do i d use resource filtering to inject the properties into the sql files at deploy time there are similar solutions for ant also and let spring s propertyplaceholderconfigurer use the same property files at run time

3916227
addition	multiplication
even though multiplication has precedence over addition the compiler is free to perform the calls to the functions in any order it likes and might call a or b before or after it performs the multiplication

3916281
code-signing	authenticode
authenticode -- the code-signing that signtool does -- is different which is why the exe doesn t run after the signing

3916302
post	get
i m intending to do a bunch of testing on this stuff and take another view trying to compromise the security of the page from the client end after the page has been served but unless i start throwing about the names of server objects in the page s get or post i can t see that there would be much of a problem or surely there would be issues with the standard data grids and whatnot

3916308
nant	psake
i would guess that working through things there - and especially looking at what was already done - would be much more fruitful than a single question here as the vast majority of mainstream c# users use msbuild nant psake or another .net specific tool-chain

3916311
jar	war
so i need to copy to war file in specific folder module1 jar

3916326
udp	tcp
lott points out you could instead use udp which is packet-based instead of tcp which is stream-based but then you give up the other features that tcp provides retransmission of dropped packets sequential packets and congestion control

3916379
fixed-point	fractions
this kind of problem occurs because there is no perfect fixed-point representation for your fractions 0.1 0.2 etc

3916384
put	get
put aside swing for a moment and get the web service call working on its own

3916399
width	height
i think the solution for you here is to listen to size changed callbacks and reset your idea of width and height accordingly

3916409
hide	show
when preload is complete hide preloader show image reset opacity

3916440
rss	feed
it happened when i tried to use the on a list of a few thousand rss feed urls which i tried to parse with multiple concurrent threads

3916458
uiview	subviews
do i create one uiview and then add further uiview as a subviews

3916463
getdate	dateadd
first day of the month select dateadd mm datediff mm 0 getdate 0

3916463
getdate	dateadd
last day of the month select dateadd ms -3 dateadd mm datediff m 0 getdate + 1 0

3916489
mamp	wamp
not only does this seem strange but also it works perfect in chrome when we use a localhost wamp mamp xampp etc.

3916511
audiotrack	audiorecord
or audiotrack and audiorecord

3916539
uiview	subviews
if you use uiview you would have one parent view then add your others as subviews to that if you use calayers you would add your layers as sublayers to the main view.layer

3916549
getter	setter
apple s reference for that is here but ensuring you have a setter and getter is sufficient

3916584
junit	jmock
you need to move the junit library down your classpath after jmock in the eclipse project properties

3916584
junit	jmock
junit v3 is part of android.jar so you can t use junit 4 style jmock tests

3916592
windows	wow64
strangely the 32-bit environment is called wow64 when 32-bit windows did this for 16-bit apps it was called wow16

3916592
windows	wow64
in wow64 everything looks like a 32-bit windows

3916598
pop-up	dialog
the start and end date selectors are widgets which are made up of a jspinner and a calendar dialog which pop-up if button is clicked

3916613
floating-point	fixed-point
basically perl is dealing with floating-point numbers while you are probably expecting it to use fixed-point

3916613
subtract	add
that way there is no floating point ambiguity during add and subtract operations

3916627
selecteditem	selectedindex
when i select an event it gets highlighted selectedindex selecteditem and i navigate to another pivot

3916670
folder	directory
i downloaded the .js files and placed them in my working directory folder

3916673
int	chars
depends on the database because of the bits allocated to the data type but generally varchar 4 or less takes around the same amount of space less the less number of chars as int would

3916687
width	height
when i try your code i get an exception from jcarousel stating that since no width and height is set for the elements an infinite loop will occur which if unhandled in your version would explain your too much recursion and out of memory errors

3916728
google-chrome	firefox
in ie and google-chrome i can switch back and forth between the parent and child but in firefox if i click on the parent window focus goes to the child which just flashes tauntingly

3916766
debian	linux
debian gnu linux sid

3916778
post	get
this sql query worked fine until i tried adding the case statement in but now i get syntax errors as described at the bottom of this post

3916875
folder	directory
i have many folder in a directory that contain various files

3916880
ironruby	ironpython
i was at a talk by one of the guys working on ironpython and ironruby

3916880
ironruby	ironpython
the general sentiment he seemed to express is that ironpython is not as up to the task of building modern asp.net mvc sites as ironruby or c# are

3916901
width	height
that is the widget s size request will be width by height

3916901
width	height
pygtk def set_size_request width height

3916932
for-loop	loops
this means that instead of pattern in one of the for loops given the linked question your first for-loop should contain your directory name then take this variable concatenated with the character to obtain only the files you re looking for

3916983
serializable	deserialization
there s going to be some overhead for xml serializable and deserialization in the data-service but that much

3917083
processors	hyperthreading
incidentally multiprocessing is better than threading since it can take advantage of multicore hyperthreading processors

3917087
min	max
the max value minus the min value

3917106
vbscript	vb6
the purpose of the dynamic feature is to simplify interaction of c# code with code in libraries designed to interact with dynamic languages either modern libraries like those designed for python and ruby or legacy libraries like those designed for com automation via vb6 or vbscript

3917132
portrait	landscape
my ipad application supports landscape and portrait orientations -so far so good

3917132
portrait	landscape
it is as if the uiview i m loading tries to load first in portrait mode but then it realizes it is in landscape mode and autorotates

3917152
decoder	encoder
your application can use predefined .net framework encoder and decoder fallbacks or it can create a custom encoder fallback derived from the encoderfallback and encoderfallbackbuffer classes or a custom decoder fallback derived from the decoderfallback and decoderfallbackbuffer classes

3917181
nltk	opennlp
however i think there s not a toolkit such as nltk or opennlp in perl

3917199
fadein	fadeout	google-chrome	firefox
the script works perfectly in firefox but google-chrome is not correctly displaying the fadein and fadeout effects

3917199
hide	show
it looks like chrome is just defaulting to show and hide

3917209
freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd
freebsd netbsd openbsd darwin

3917217
width	height
if there s no content in the button make sure you set the height width otherwise it won t stretch to fit the button

3917270
rational-numbers	fractions
number fractions lets you work with rational-numbers fractions instead of decimals something like this constants is imported to automatically convert strings like 11 10 into number fractions objects

3917277
post	get
i ve done similar for ping in the past perhaps you can modify it to use telnet to post a http get on 443

3917299
actionscript	haxe
this works with haxe but should be possible with actionscript 3 too

3917336
folder	directory
basically you need to copy your db file out of the assets folder into a writable application directory probably from getfilesdir or getexternalfilesdir

3917337
put	get
if i don t put the trailing nullcols in i get the column not found before end of logical record error

3917338
min	max
you can tune the threads link in my comments based on the hardware available or allow the system to best manage the min max simultaneous threads

3917418
classcastexception	runtimeexception
i had junits tests fail and actually throwing runtimeexception but i continued to run add removes on my jtable in the junit test which put the gui application in a bad state and i would see the classcastexception come up exactly as chris had described

3917425
integer	unsigned
as of now i am using unsigned 64 bit integer to store 33 bit value

3917452
fflush	gets
when the hibernate session gets fflush it will try to save the object again with the usual save method

3917496
jndi	jta
this worked since jbossas has it s jta transaction manager defined at jndi location java transactionmanager

3917511
uiview	subviews
don t be afraid of uiview as subviews as opposed to constantly using uiviewcontrollers

3917518
range	median
also i only want to perform the median on values that fall within a chosen time range and the solution can t alter the database which isn t mine

3917525
firefox	safari
i know that particular behavior works under firefox and safari

3917525
firefox	safari
check out cp 3146842.3146844.3146854 -- the like button with comments works in firefox and safari but not ie

3917528
post	get
in practice many firewalls and other network intermediaries block http verbs other than get and post

3917528
post	put
to work around this issue wcf data services and the odata standard support a technique known as verb tunneling. in this technique put delete and merge requests are submitted as a post request and an x-http-method header specifies the actual verb that the recipient should apply to the request

3917528
post	get
silverlight supports only the get and post http methods

3917528
post	get
it is important to point out that true restful service can be created conforming to all the rest principles listed above only using the get and post http methods in other words the rest architecture does not require a specific mapping to http

3917528
post	put
the following http methods overrides may be set in the header to accomplish the put and delete actions if the web services interpret the x-http-method-override header on a post

3917534
org-mode	dired	emacs	aquamacs
i have currently switched over to emacs aquamacs and am in the process of migrating my entire workflow into it one step at a time org-mode dired etc. from pathfinder notational velocity etc.

3917534
zsh	eshell
the one thing i have yet to try and seems to be the biggest obstacle thus far is the built-in emacs shell shell and or eshell here on referred to as eshell due to having zsh setup perfectly for me

3917534
zsh	tcsh	zsh	eshell	bash	tcsh	bash	zsh
i assume eshell lacks quite a bit compared to standard shells bash zsh ksh tcsh etc. otherwise it would be one of the standard shells correct me if i m wrong to think about it that way

3917534
zsh	eshell
any folks switch from zsh to eshell and feel there are aspects of zsh you critically miss

3917549
libjpeg	libpng
some of the libs rely on using libjpeg and libpng

3917564
post	get
i see a bunch of .net open source projects out there that look to be able to get at the users information but i just want a user to be able to post media that s already on facebook on my site as well

3917700
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
i am having an issue with jquery in google-chrome and safari the script is working fine in mozilla and opera

3917700
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
when you click on the button all the boxes should go down then the value in the textare comeup in the first box and same should happen as many times you click on the button this is working fine in mozilla and opera but not is google-chrome and safari also in ie6 in these browsers no new boxes come down only existing

3917702
inherited	properties
it aims at being more adaptable so you can use whatever js inherited events properties style you d like

3917710
post	get
why i am not sure why following the two examples mentioned in my post did not work i figured out how to get it to work

3917710
oncreate	onstart
i had to move the attachment of my listener to the button in the dialog s onstart method from the dialog s oncreate method

3917728
fadein	fadeout
the problem that i m running into is that when i m transitioning through pictures using the fadein and fadeout jquery functions it is fading out the links as well

3917755
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to the newer versioning of the sdk

3917786
apache	nginx
you might be able do this by using apache or nginx as the front-end proxy and writing rewrite rules to forward or reject requests depending on the username i m not sure

3917826
put	get
you should be able to get the effect you want if you put the text in a separate div from the image

3917829
inherited	properties
so you could create class nullablebeta that inherited beta while properties name and isnullable are virtual on beta entity

3917866
int	boolean
wasn t sure if this should only be used for int and boolean

3917891
integer	unsigned
if it s signed and you re passing in an unsigned integer then you may be getting an unexpected minus sign in btmpsms

3917898
uiview	subviews
it looks like ccuiviewwrapper adds their contained uiview to the root window as a subviews so essentially the order of things is everything cocos2d then any ccuiviewwrappers on top of it

3917923
sudo	passwd
i can access my mysql server on my remote ubuntu 10.04 machine downstairs local network just fine through ssh and when i sudo in to mysql monitor using the mysql passwd i can modify any of the tables

3917928
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome behaves as i want but for some reason each coretablerow isn t getting pushed down to accommodate the height of the inner coretablecell divs in ie

3918001
width	height
then depending on the height and width parameters you can decide to use different files with varying sizes for the watermark

3918021
move	drag
if i have a list of labels i would like to drag and move them around much like the icons on your desktop

3918028
sorting	grouping
currently i am grouping the data on the x-axis into tuples and sorting them before plotting.

3918086
disk	ram
on any modern system this will not be mapped to existing memory in the executable file on disk or in ram of your execution machine unless you will really access it

3918112
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works correctly in firefox google-chrome and safari

3918122
folder	directory
the fullname represents file directory so i would like to display results for certain parent folder instead of the individual files

3918165
afp	smb
my plan was to use links with the smb or afp url which includes the mount address and location of the file

3918199
put	get
so when i put a random line between this lines of code i get that error

3918236
google-chrome	firefox
i was able to get this to work in firefox and google-chrome but ie pushed the image way out to the right

3918305
folder	directory
either to copy the xml files in the temp folder or to actually serve the files from the bin directory directly not sure if this is possible

3918345
apache-poi	jxls
alternatives to apache-poi are jxls open source or aspose.cells for java proprietary

3918381
google-chrome	firefox
if i do a quick alert lastrowid i get coursesection 1 in google-chrome firefox and ie8

3918398
accessor	properties
update the set accessor on the name properties to call an objectmodified method that changes the modified and revision properties

3918399
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
this works perfect in ie and firefox but not in google-chrome or opera

3918423
public	protected
11.2p1 if a class is declared to be a base class for another class using the private access specifier the public and protected members of the base class are accessible as private members of the derived class

3918444
doublebuffered	double-buffering	inherited	properties
rather than setting the doublebuffered properties on the form the best solution i have found is to create a new class that inherited from tablelayoutpanel and in that class constructor enable double-buffering

3918451
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
firefox opera google-chrome already support google-chrome video etc..

3918502
pop-up	dialog
i have no idea why and it makes no sense to me but removing the selected attribute made it pop-up the dialog without a reload

3918526
integer	unsigned
if i undestood correctly your problem is how to convert the input which is really a signed-byte sbyte but that input is stored in a unsigned integer and then also avoid negative values by converting them to zero

3918539
move	drag
this solution mostly works but it will occasionally act glitchy when i drag the view around particularly when i move it around quickly with mouse or drag it around past the view bounds

3918549
rss	feed
then you can access the rss feed with

3918585
cgsize	cgrect
it will work out a cgsize you can use to make your cgrect etc

3918605
put	get
you only get a top bar if you put a uinavigationcontroller inside the uisplitviewcontroller in the first place

3918605
put	get
so all you need to do is to put another uinavigationcontroller inside the uinavigationcontroller and you will get another bar

3918611
udp	tcp
udp is actually expected to work better than tcp in lossy networks or congested networks

3918611
udp	tcp
tcp is far better at transferring large quantities of data but when the network fails it s more likely that udp will get through

3918611
udp	tcp
in fact i recently did a study testing this and it found that snmp over udp succeeded far better than snmp over tcp in lossy networks when the udp timeout was set properly

3918611
udp	tcp
generally tcp starts behaving poorly at about 5 packet loss and becomes completely useless at 33 ish and udp will still succeed eventually

3918611
udp	tcp
most stacks these days can actually use both tcp and udp

3918626
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
i think maybe you are implementing the onclicklistener in the wrong place - usually you should definitely implement an onitemclicklistener in your activity and set it on the listview instead or you will get problems with your events.

3918663
bash	zsh
it doesn t have its own scripting language like bash zsh etc

3918663
zsh	eshell	bash	zsh
i can t speak to zsh vs eshell but i ve mostly switched from bash to eshell

3918663
zsh	eshell
it s going to be really hard because zsh has a full scripting language whereas eshell is basically an interface to the elisp interpreter

3918663
put	get
for a silly example try message hello world | cut -f 1 -d some commands notably grep get put in emacs buffers so you can quickly jump to the results

3918679
stdout	fflush
fflush stdout

3918734
subtract	add
simply add the amount to the borrower s total and subtract amounts from the lenders who receive the payment

3918769
pull	push
trying to push or pull up to a million records of data such as describing is bound for issues of performance tying up resources bad packets data etc.

3918779
udp	tcp
also shouldn t your try and listen to udp and tcp

3918795
width	height
this method also seems to fall apart if the user resizes the page as the height and width of .ie_shadow is set explicitly and not recalculated automatically

3918830
put	get
i had to put it in a t4 template to get access to the current visual studio dte otherwise it would randomly work if i tried it outside of a t4

3918957
hide	show
show hide

3918957
hide	show
functions are there to show hide divs

3918968
integer	unsigned
up for consideration is the following function which can be used to relatively quickly factor a 64-bit unsigned integer into its prime factors

3918976
mongoid	activemodel
mongoid is built on activemodel and activemodel has a skip_callback function

3919011
rss	feed
i am migrating a site which has an rss feed component to it

3919028
stdout	stderr
default ones are stdin stdout stderr

3919029
client-side	server-side
colorbox is client-side upload server-side

3919050
devise	cancan
i m using rails 3 devise and cancan

3919075
rss	feed
my program is scraping rss feed and tucking the results into redis

3919173
onresume	onpause
use the onresume to load data so you can clean up and save memory effectively with the onpause

3919187
processors	hyperthreading
a dual-core hyperthreading processors may be able to execute 4 threads simultaneously - depending on what the thread is doing no contention on io or memory access etc

3919194
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

3919208
width	height
i m using the post thumbnail feature to show portfolio work so for example the problem is i want to show a particular width of image only which is 640 but because my pieces are website they have varying height

3919219
bufferedreader	gzipinputstream
tell the server that you support gzip and wrap a bufferedreader around gzipinputstream if the response header says the content is compressed

3919234
integer	unsigned
since you are using unsigned int and it won t fit in a single unsigned int then the compiler must use a second integer and store the last 24 bits in that last integer

3919239
width	height
you can calculate the ratio height from width

3919239
width	height
newheight height newwidth width

3919242
int	chars
the problem is that charat gives you a chars which you then convert into an int

3919325
unsigned	short
use smaller types for your bit-fields unsigned short and unsigned char and regroup the bit-fields so that they fill the allocated unit entirely - that way you should be able to pack things as tightly as possible

3919327
irc	xmpp
you can use orbited along with js.io for the browser and either xmpp or irc as the underlying system

3919330
src	attr
so i need to use an iframe i ve figured out and have tried to .wrap a link around it and specify the link as an iframe with the dimensions specified grabbing attr src for the link

3919337
jobs	cron
but i run into the deadlineexceedederror for both cron jobs and task queue

3919358
dictionary	map
i took a quick look through the dictionary and idictionary documentation and to my surprise i couldn t find any equivalent of the java map contract that two maps with equal entryset s must be equal

3919392
width	height
i am having trouble splitting a screen into 4 divs with width and height of 50

3919420
ubuntu	debian
ps i m working in debian lenny ubuntu lucid maverick

3919425
vb.net	vb6
maybe you can convert vb6 code to vb.net

3919427
innodb	myisam
in a table with 5 millions rows a would be instant in myisam but would take several seconds in innodb

3919427
innodb	myisam
why haven t they optimise count in innodb like myisam

3919433
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested this in firefox and google-chrome and if the proxy server is down it still seems to work

3919433
google-chrome	firefox
it seems that ie is not contacting sites directly if the proxy is down something which is not an issue with firefox or google-chrome

3919450
libjpeg	libpng
the reason why opencv crashes is that it cannot find libpng libjpeg dlls

3919450
libjpeg	libpng
your problems should be fixed if you include the libpng libjpeg libraries

3919478
innodb	myisam
myisam has the number of rows stored somewhere and so the query is almost instant innodb has to scan the table to get the full count

3919503
gridview	sqldatasource
i need to be able to hide or disable a multitude of items detailsviews gridview when an sqldatasource returns no rows

3919512
post	get
i have simple http get and post communication working perfectly but documentation on how to do a multipart post seems to be as rare as unicorns

3919527
hex	binary
use a hex editor and see db inside in binary mode

3919568
ati	nvidia
that ought to be a bad habit of the past that ati and nvidia have grown out of

3919588
min	max
for my c class i ve written a simple statistics program -- it calculates max min mean etc

3919643
post	put
if you put int id into your parameters for the post it should pick up the hidden form element.

3919651
portrait	landscape
the portrait view controller captures the screen dimensions before transitioning to landscape as a modal view

3919651
portrait	landscape
statement to the orientationchanged method in the portrait view controller before transitioning to the landscape modal view

3919664
hide	show
to show hide it during an ajax call i have several solutions

3919666

hide	show
to show or not to show shakespearean style the extension is purely up to the windows explorer setting to show or hide known file extensions

3921780
post	put
requestbody is for use with post and put requests where the body of the request is what you want to parse

3921872

wordpress	joomla
with that goal in mind the team delivered the fastest plone yet it trounces drupal joomla and wordpress for speed improved a lot of very important infrastructure files are now stored outside of the database it uses much less memory than it used to and scales a lot better to large number of parallel requests

3922725
inline	inlining
if the cost of a function call is bigger than its payload the compiler should be able to figure out by itself if it s convenient to inline the call and in some cases even inlining too much can slow down the code

3922741
width	height
you would better use barplot in order to represent the total mass by the area of the bins height gives the count width gives the mass

3922760

3923177
debian	linux
for example on debian linux there s start-stop-daemon

3923186
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
everything works fine in ie and opera but in google-chrome and firefox it doesn t

3923207
int	chars
now that there is enough memory allocated to the chars pointer we can safely use sprintf to write the int to the chars pointer

3923207
free	malloc
unless this is a quick and dirty program you always want to make sure to free the memory you called with malloc

3923230
int	double
there is no possible x that could be an abstraction over int float double etc

3923269

either you can have b int malloc sizeof int or instead of int b you can have chars b and then cast the malloced pointer to chars

3923347
width	height
both their height and width are variable

3923390
avr	microcontroller
it is for a library for avr microcontroller and this would save me a few precious instructions in an interrupt handler.the array that should have this property is 54 byte long out of about 80 bytes of total static memory used by the library

3923400
int	chars
or figure out a way to have all the chars represented as strings rather than have some as list of int

3923406
opera	safari
safari webkit and opera currently support a unitless number for tx and ty

3923426
free	malloc
for that reason the integrity checks are only performed when the heap gets manipulated which is in the malloc and free functions and friends

3923430
fseek	ftell
this is all untested and i haven t been careful about off-by-one errors but it gives you an idea of the usage of fseek and ftell which sounds like what you are looking for

3923453
folder	directory
you can find these libraries in the bin folder or the qt directory

3923460
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
so my solution to this is to override touchesbegan withevent and touchesmoved withevent and call them from there as follows

3923505
allocator	stl
since the author of the specialized memory allocator has more knowledge on the size of the objects allocated from the pool and how those allocator occur the allocator can use the memory more efficiently than a general purpose allocator such as the one provided by the stl

3923539
client-side	server-side
it really is not sensible to have pagination server-side and sorting client-side

3923552
wmi	managementeventwatcher
the final option is to use wmi to do the detection.you can use the managementeventwatcher

3923576
int	double
in that respect a vector works more like a regular int or double

3923610
width	height
i have tried using wrap_content for webview s width and height but that does not work

3923611
int	boolean
the class has some properties like int strings or boolean but could also have more complex ones

3923617

if you use https which is essentially http over ssl tls all the http traffic will be encrypted from the moment the ssl tls connection is established provided you re using the appropriate cipher suites that it before any http communication

3923752
setcontentview	findviewbyid
you can then reference your view in your code after you called setcontentview with findviewbyid r.id.myview

3923769
int	chars
using chars rather than int and writing a value -128 to 127 to b should fix it

3923775

it all appears to be working seamlessly on firefox opera google-chrome etc

3923791

3923822
goto	break
it s perfectly valid to use break - as others have pointed out it s nowhere in the same league as goto

3923832
allocator	stl
if the stl allocator meets your needs use it it s designed by some very smart people who know what they are doing - however it is for the generic case and if you know how your objects are allocated you could make the above perform faster

3923832
free	malloc
the simple allocator i describe above isn t re-entrant of course you could wrap it with a mutex to provide a bit of cover and even then i would hazard that the simple allocator would perform orders of magnitude faster than normal malloc free

3923913
temp	tmp
that s why the process freeze it is trying to run a tmp file c temp nse305.tmp ns306.tmp

3923923

rss	feed
when you request the rss feed it s dispatched to retrieve it and stores the feed into its global all-user cache identified by url

3923941
rss	feed
i m not sure what the cache invalidation mechanisms are but the crawler definitely doesn t revisit the feed strictly as often as the response s cache-control mechanisms would indicate that s probably a good thing as many generated rss feed send no-cache although they don t change too often

3923941
rss	feed
these are the hypotheses i formulated some time ago from my rss feed access logs

3923956
graphics2d	bufferedimage
anyway your graphics2d is backed by a bufferedimage so that s probably what s slowing you down

3924042

wrap the checkbox and its text in an element and show hide that instead

3924059
public	protected
provide a public virtual destructor or a protected non-virtual destructor

3924080
draggable	droppable
so if the user drags another draggable and drops it the previous dropped element must get removed from the droppable and the currently dragged element must replace it in the droppable

3924120

3924497
jobs	cron
i had worked on php and java-based projects for the past few years and speaking from experience java and given the open source libraries to achieve scheduling orm aop etc. is usually a good choice - and of course you don t always need a container as different tiers and services can be written with different languages integrated together with other processes such as cron jobs

3924513
google-chrome	firefox
if i try on google-chrome or firefox they don t get the background

3924525
profiler	aqtime

createelement	domdocument
i think that the main problem is that the tags which i m creating with domdocument createelement ss data should be closed with whereas domdocument is outputting

3924915
uiview	subviews
i would probably use the uiviewcontroller for the main view to load the subviews and add them to the main view not load the subviews directly in the main uiview itself

ant	maven
page maven 1.x originated in 2003 inside the jakarta turbine as an attempt to simplify the ant builds of apache projects and their maintenance

3924922
maven	pom.xml
based on the concept of a project object model pom.xml maven can manage a project s build reporting and documentation from a central piece of information

3924947
post	get
which differs with its input parameter in the get compared to the post so we have

3924953
viewdidload	viewwillappear
here s how i deal with it instead of putting in viewdidload i put it in viewwillappear

3924953
profiling	instrumentation
if for some reason the table is taking a long time to load and it shows a blank table before showing your data i would look into profiling your data loading functions using instrumentation perhaps the real issue is that you need to optimize the function so that it takes less time

3924977
folder	directory
i do have a directory in the path that contains 16000 folder - for every commit

3925021
for-loop	loops
edit sorry had an error in the code the middle loops needed to be -10 the first for-loop moves all the pixels right the second moves them back to the origin and then to the left the third loops then moves them back to the origin

3925048
mouseover	mouseleave
i figured out how to make the content change with mouseover but i need help to return the original content with mouseleave

3925051
apache	lighttpd
i have run it behind apache behind lighttpd and by itself

3925061
google-chrome	firefox
it was leaking with ie firefox and google-chrome

3925065
folder	directory
i have an application windows service that is installed into a directory in the program files folder

3925082
maven	pom.xml
from what i understand maven 1 does not have pom.xml file

3925082
maven	pom.xml
maven 1.x had a project object model pom.xml too it was just not called pom.xml but project.xml

3925194
for-loop	loops
it s just a syntactic sugar since the standard says that it s equivalent to a loops with iterators edit this means it doesn t provide any additional information to the compiler compared to the equivalent for-loop mdash

3925329
ubuntu	linux
i have a subversion repository running svn 1.6.6 on an ubuntu linux server and i m trying to create a branch using the tortoisesvn gui

fadein	fadeout
how to get this fadein or fadeout effect without blackscreen

3925381
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this is a problem across all major browsers firefox safari google-chrome ie but strangely it doesn t always do it

3925404
apache	nginx
i ve never used nginx but in apache it s just a directive

3925427
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
here is my complete list of fixes that makes the button element look the same in firefox safari google-chrome opera internet explorer ie9 ie8 ie7 haven t tested ie6

3925489
hash	md5
most payment mechanisms are verified in this manner usually with an md5 or sha1 hash you can find more info on the following links

3925491
centos	linux
on linux centos 5.4 java says

3925497
implements	sealed
inheriting from such a class definition would force the inheritor to implements the abstract member but scope it privately to consumers of the class though it would have to be defined as protected so unless the class was marked as sealed further inheritors would have access

3925510
hide	show
it looks like what you re trying to do is show one div and hide a bunch of others when other elements are clicked mdash

3925510
hide	show
but you can also easily relate the divs to show hide the panels and the divs that you click on the tabs by giving them some information in common

3925521
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
objectinputstream only works on data written by objectoutputstream

3925528
integer	unsigned
in x86 assembly the overflow flag is set when an add or sub operation on a signed integer overflows and the carry flag is set when an operation on an unsigned integer overflows

3925613
put	get
once you get things fixed put your perl libraries into source control so you can always roll back an installation

3925621
int	chars
the list and set interfaces are a part of the collections framework which only allow for adding removing iterating objects like chars or int not primitives like chars or int

3925658
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
but they can also be solved by simply sending an automated keypress at the os level that simulates the enter key works for firefox a little harder on some versions of google-chrome and safari

3925662
post	get
however i don t quite understand why you re trying to get the post content inside the section of the page

3925664
freemarker	velocity
if you need to do a lot of this templating you may be interested in apache velocity or freemarker

3925756
folder	directory
the assemblies that perform these translations live in a folder in my application directory

3925794
layoutparams	viewgroup
i ve got a schedule class which is simply a custom viewgroup with custom onmeasure and onlayout which enables me to place childs events with layoutparams for column row start and column row end

3925799
int	boolean
obj.amethod byval arg1 as int byval arg2 as int byval arg3 as boolean

3925849
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
ie including #9 opera 10 safari 5 and google-chrome 6 all do maintain a global

3925852
libusb	pyusb
personally what i ve done so far is use a python wrapper called pyusb to do some quick experimentation with libusb as i don t have to do ide setup or library include file setup with python

3925879
width	height
i want to limit the height and width of the image to a maximum of 80 of the window s so that there won t be a need for a scroll bar at any normal size

3925879
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works exactly how i want it to work in google-chrome and safari and firefox acknowledges the max-width as well

3925990
min	max
grouping or aggregates use the builtin min max or itertools.groupby

3926012
folder	directory
iis configuration mappings right-click the virtual folder - properties - virtual directory tab - configuration - mappings tab

3926042
children	parent
the generated resource entity will have navigation properties like resources and resources1 which i renamed parent and children

3926073
post	get
this works for a get request but when the a post is made i does a 302 redirect and therefore the script doesn t get the post variables

3926082
freemarker	velocity
you d better use some templating technology like freemarker or velocity for your email templates

3926129
freemarker	velocity
there are other technologies out there better suited for what you want like velocity and freemarker

3926130
ati	nvidia
most implementations are trade secret so you will never know how ati nvidia implemented anything except what you can infer by the results produced by interacting with their implementations

3926168
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
i ve found the following code to work in ie7 ff3 opera 10 safari 4 and google-chrome and quite likely other versions of those browsers which i simply haven t tested

3926173
google-chrome	firefox
so i do not see any issues with cross domain this code works perfectly in firefox google-chrome any other normal browser

3926197
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
and the problem is it works for some browsers opera google-chrome but it doesn t work for internet explorer and firefox

3926207
disk	ram
this provides a way to manage objects on disk and ram

3926229
for-loop	loops
most of the dangers associated with using break or continue in a for-loop are negated if you write tidy easily-readable loops

3926282
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
see the documentation for nscalendar and nsdatecomponents

3926293
setlocale	strftime
if you want to change this setting project wide i would do so in config projectconfiguration.class.php using setlocale and then use strftime rather than date

3926328
interpreted-language	compiled-language
it is almost a half-way between an interpreted-language and a compiled-language gaining the benefits of both

3926377
mouseup	mousedown
luckily while playing around with a little test program we made it was discovered that if you override the the mousedown method of the nsslider and call the super of that method it does not return until the mouse button is released so you can just put whatever code should be in mouseup inside the mousedown method after the call to super

3926398
scheme	rebol
i currently use programmer s notepad with the rebol syntax scheme

3926429
strlen	strcpy
strlen and strcpy need to know where the strings start so that they can access all of their elements not just the first

3926462
strlen	strcpy
thus what strcpy is exactly doing is to copy strlen line bytes of memory starting from the address line into corresponding locations starting from the address of pointer

3926462
strlen	strcpy
if you pass and strcpy will have access to only the first char and not the rest of strlen line -1

3926517
freebsd	linux	freebsd	netbsd
linux is one of the more popular ones today whose programs can be run by linux itself netbsd or freebsd

3926536
post	get
there are multiple parts to the request the dns lookup and the get or post to the site

3926563
fileinputstream	objectinputstream
if there is no data in a stream but you are trying to read...eg read methods of chain streams like datainputstream objectinputstream randomaccessfile throw eofexception if they are trying to read from fileinputstream but the fileinputstream is empty

3926572
width	height
i have fixed height and width and have 4 divs for row

3926585
pop-up	dialog
the way i did it was that i had a stack of dialog pop-up objects that i drew to the screen every time my redraw function was called so before i loaded the textures i added a dialog with the loading message redrew the screen then started loading and then replaced modified the dialog with the done

3926614
google-chrome	firefox
i tested in ie8 firefox 3.6.10 and the latest google-chrome

3926623
versioning	upgrade
define these versioning explicitly in your references so that if you upgrade the .net versioning it will continue to use the old versioning and not the new

3926635
filtering	grouping
i have a report in access that we want split and exported to .rtf based on a grouping id filtering

3926648
ubuntu	linux
i have been developing a project app to learn about android i can upload my app to my htc desire on my desktop using linux ubuntu and eclipse i have the same setup on my laptop but i cannot upload apps to my phone

3926667
width	height
of course you have to subtract the border-width from your fixed height and width

3926702
inherited	subclassing
however zend framework provides better alternatives to subclassing inherited controllers

3926702
inherited	properties
it becomes hard to manage inherited properties as it is harder to visualize what inherited functionality is being utilized by each controller action

3926710
content-disposition	content-type
these are needed to add the content-disposition and content-type headers if the media is streamed over http responses

3926726
allegro	sdl
i have experience with sdl and allegro

3926726
allegro	sdl
i think that sdl is a bit slow allegro isn t good idea for this kind of thing

3926748
for-loop	arrays
the clean way of iterating through an arrays is using length and an incrementing for-loop

3926750
hide	show
the css inside the noscript tag will then hide all of your page content and instead display whatever no js message you want to show

3926778
floating-point	integer
a data type simply tells you how to interpret a sequence of bytes as an integer a floating-point number a data structure etc

3926819
fgets	strlen
also by not checking result you are doing an strlen on line which could have uninitialized data because fgets failed

3926819
calloc	malloc
so perhaps using calloc instead of malloc or at least initializing all structure pointer members to null would have been a better idea

3926843
int	chars
actually back in the 80 s the formatting string standard was printf with format strings such as d for int or s for strings and obscure format modifiers such as 06d which draws an int and pads it to the left with zeros until it reaches six chars

3926863
maven	pom.xml
i m using maven and it would seem that there could be some way to have a hook that looks at the meta-inf maven directory and pulls the dependency list from the pom.xml and goes and fetches the required libs probably from a local repo

3926898
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and opera work with my code just fine yet my new update to linux firefox gave the same error -- nsresult â 0x80570009 ns_error_xpc_bad_convert_js

3926952
stdout	stderr
however when it fails subprocess shows that nothing was printed to stderr or stdout

3926952
stdout	stderr
their toolkit redirects all stdout stderr into their logging subsystem

3926966
post	get
right now i m writing forms that store the post data in a session and then populate the database row at the end but as soon as i introduce conditional logic from page to page the sessions break and don t get sent

3926974
folder	directory
ability to loop through many many separate text files contained in a folder directory but output to just one single csv text file

3927024
put	get
despite what it looks like in a debug build you can still generally put a breakpoint on an empty c# control block or semicolon and it will get hit correctly

3927032
stdout	stderr
since the error message really isn t coming in on either stdout nor stderr my best guess is that the program is using windows equivalent of opening dev tty whatever that is

3927040
post	get
you would basically need to proxy all get s and post s between your server and the destination site

3927053
hide	show
your most difficult logic goes into building the page with the proper number of questions and making sure the divs are effectively titled to work with your show hide script

3927053
hide	show
in my case i use jquery s show hide functionality

3927111
dictionary	map
a safer approach would be to create a private map between a label and myobject using a dictionary instance

3927112
keydown	keyup
keydown and keyup could also be used but please note that these will only fire once even if the user holds down the key so that multiple characters are added

3927126
profiling	debugging
when i m working in vs.net 2010 then start debugging seems like a new window profiling or something like that kicks in and rearranges hides windows that i had open previously

3927142
int	chars
the above dynamically allocates and deallocates one memory slot that is initialized with the int value 10 equivalent to the chars value n

3927241
datatrigger	eventtrigger
h2 good solution- h2 eventtrigger on your three buttons seem to work better and doesn t have the problems that the datatrigger encounters plus you don t even need the dependency property x anymore

3927249
width	height
for example if you want your object to be 1 4 of the screen then it s width is screenwidth 4 and height is screenheight 4

3927249
width	height
ie width height aspectratio

3927250
google-chrome	firefox
i have tried this in google-chrome 6.0 and also firefox 3.6.3 and get the same result in both

3927260
hide	show
since i have multi-selection there is no need to display the selected value like you would do in a combo box so the drop-down appears to be a button to show hide the list

3927260
button	checkbox	hide	show
the columnclick event handles when they click on what looks like the show hide list button and the itemchecked event lets me handle anything that needs to respond to a change in the checkbox

3927301
inherited	properties
instead every contract inherited a nullable properties from the generic

3927322
bindingsource	dataview
i was using a typed dataset and put its typed table into a dataview and use that dataview as the datasource for a bindingsource which was then the datasource for the grid

3927352
multiplying	subtract
subtract the integer from the original number now multiplying by 10 stepwise and find the digits after the decimal point

3927359
integer	fractions
if m is greater than or equal to 10 -3 but less than 10 7 then it is represented as the integer part of m in decimal form with no leading zeroes followed by . . followed by one or more decimal digits representing the fractions part of m

3927359
integer	fractions
the magnitude is then represented as the integer part of a as a single decimal digit followed by . . followed by decimal digits representing the fractions part of a followed by the letter e e followed by a representation of n as a decimal integer as produced by the method integer.tostring int

3927376
profiling	benchmarking
for benchmarking and profiling you can use xdebug and memory_get_usage and memory_get_peak_usage

3927390
cpython	ironpython
both the cpython and the ironpython pickle modules have the same functionality except one is implemented in c and the other in c#

3927397
hide	show
if you re inclined to go with the insert at the end approach i d recommend bpeterson76 s idea of using js to show hide sections on a singler phisical form - just make sure you ve got control of the user s back button otherwise the user could loose all of their answers

3927403
integer	radix
for integer types number of non-sign bits radix base digits in the representation

3927403
min	max
there are other methods such as min max and the like

3927404
min	max
edit actually it s not giving you any information about the standard however you can get the min and max value on compile time for certain types

3927415
width	height
try setting the width height of the stackpanel instead.

3927465
stdout	stderr
can you try this subprocess.check_output with stderr redirecting to stdout

3927465
stdout	stderr
if out_err gets both the output and error you ll probably need to redirect stdout and stderr to file objects and later read from those file objects because windows do not have unix-like pipes

3927595
stdout	stderr
i m using the jython 2.51 implementation of python to write a script that repeatedly invokes another process via subprocess.popen and uses pipe to pipe stdout and stderr to the parent process and stdin to the child process

3927596
google-chrome	firefox
but all works fine on his end with google-chrome and firefox

3927596
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i also have tried it in ie8 firefox safari and google-chrome and they all work fine

3927612
width	height
i know with silverlight you can control the width and height of the silverlight section within the web page

3927615
ant	maven
it s a massive tool with a myriad of accompanying tools such as maven ant junit etc

3927622
post	get
if still no luck please post the errors you get

3927629
subtract	add
update thinking a little further i don t think the add subtract method would be good because it would kill sorting

3927650
gif	png
read image formats jpg gif png with transparency

3927650
mouse	keyboard
monitor mouse and keyboard input to this form

3927658
google-chrome	firefox
now i am trying to build a little ui-library here is a demo to a simple list note use your arrow keys google-chrome firefox only

3927667
post	get
as it stands i just get all the content of the last 200 post into a string and split them into words then sort by which words are used the most

3927702
children	parent
if you only need a reference to the parent and not to its children then rather than creating the child elements dynamically create the parent dynamically and then set its innerhtml for the content

3927711
children	parent
the problem is i can t figure out how to prevent some of the children categories being treated as parent

3927713
int	chars
no c++ only allows int types ex int long unsigned int size_t chars as indexes

3927720
disk	ram
if it can be stored in ram it s 203 mb so subsequent runs will probably hit the disk cache then the problem goes away entirely as the fsb speed typically differs from the processor speed by a factor less than the fsb width in bytes â the fsb can transfer more than one prime per cycle

3927727
tunnel	vpn
if so you ll need to use a web service and ensure that there is a network path from wherever customers will create orders public internet extranet to your nav web service - likely using a vpn tunnel etc

3927729
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the script works fine in all other browsers firefox google-chrome and safari

3927768
vim	emacs
i usually work fullscreen with vim and emacs on a 30 monitor which means i tend to have a lot of splits

3927768
vim	emacs
the active pane s modeline changes background in vim and emacs but sometimes that s not an easy to see indicator of the active pane

3927768
vim	emacs
either vim or emacs solution would be fine

3927781
implements	extends
for example some of the type gymnastics present in the collections library make the collections a joy to use but perplexing to implements or extends

3927901
post	get
i get why it s doing this as the request is a post however this is not the desired or expected result as the control was not in anyway involved in the user action

3927918
pull	push
or just push pull from a local truecrypt archive and rsync it to a remote location

3927942
post	get
renderaction uses a post renderpartial uses a get

3927969
printf	fgets
the printf doesn t have a n because the newline character is retained from the fgets see the manpage

3927998
fgets	fread
implement fread as string collecting loop with fgets with eventual seeking if only a specific size was requested and fgets read too far until the next n line break

3928025
mri	rubinius	jruby	mri	jruby	rubinius	ironruby	rubinius
jruby is just yet another ruby execution engine just like mri yarv ironruby rubinius macruby maglev smallruby ruby.net xruby rubygolightly tinyrb hotruby blueruby red sun and all the others

3928025
jruby	mri
in fact on windows jruby passes more rubyspec tests than ruby meaning mri or yarv itself

3928025
jruby	mri
and with the new c extension support in jruby 1.6 they can even use a large subset of mri and yarv c extensions like mongrel for example

3928025
jruby	mri
tooling whenever someone writes a new tool for yarv or mri like memprof it turns out that jruby already had a tool 5 years ago which does the same thing only better

3928025
jar	war
deployment assuming that your target system already has a jvm installed deploying a jruby app and i m not just talking about rails i also mean desktop mobile other kinds of servers is literally just copying one jar or war and a double-click

3928025
mri	rubinius	jruby	mri	jruby	rubinius
in practice this means that deploying a rails app to jruby is a good idea as is running your integration tests but for developer unit tests and scripts mri yarv or rubinius are better choices

3928025
jruby	mri
note that many rails developers simply develop and unit test on mri and integration test and deploy on jruby

3928025
mri	rubinius
unfortunately neither mri nor yarv nor rubinius run threads concurrently so there s still some broken multithreaded ruby code out there that doesn t know it s broken because obviously concurrency bugs can only show up if there s actual concurrency.

3928057
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
it s like class inherited in oop where subclassing inherited variables methods etc from their superclass automatically

3928071
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
i m sure i want to call onclicklistener and not onitemclicklistener

3928083
hide	show
the only thing that worked is a show hide but that s not an option for me

3928118
profiling	debugging
profiling the application with a tool set some stopwatches or debugging the app and see what the bottleneck is

3928157
int	chars
a key should also be small - an int of 4 bytes is perfect a two-letter chars 2 column just the same

3928163
post	get
my server is expecting to get post parameters that look something like this

3928164
firefox	safari
the following behaves exactly as i expect it to in firefox and safari but the solution for internet explorer eludes me

3928276
division	modulo
i m not sure if gcc or msvc or whatever compiler you are using is clever enough to change the workingnum 2 expression but odds are it s doing the division and looking at the modulo in edx.

3928280
flask	django	flask	pylons
as the lead developer of nagare i really encourage you to try it in real on your product which is the best way to see how nagare is truely different than the others frameworks like django pylons or flask

3928283
sorting	filtering
we would use a domain service for this so filtering sorting paging could be handled on the server and only a certain number of objects would be returned

3928283
sorting	filtering
serialize and pass the report object back to the client letting silverlight handle paging sorting filtering

3928283
hide	show
however this would give us the flexibility to choose which columns need to be sent to the browser in the hide show columns scenario which would lower the overall payload going across the line

3928288
post	get
what you d want to to go here is get a handle to the text value of the editor in javascript and post that server side to save either as a file or in a db

3928325
put	get
get mysql_insert_id foreach or exist word_id if word_value already there and then put in the new table like

3928335
google-chrome	firefox
i tested it in google-chrome 6 and firefox 3.6 both on the mac

3928348
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
nscalendar and nsdatecomponents can probably do everything you need

3928370
debian	linux
currently i am targeting an amd opteron 6168 compiling with gcc on debian linux i ve tried to find documentation for this but i am in unfamiliar waters

3928382
folder	directory
one option is to svn export http path to repo to a local directory and copy the files and folder manually

3928393
mouseover	mouseleave
if you need to catch only mouseover and mouseleave events maybe you should simply try to use only css and hover selector on image or div if target browsers let it

3928403
mouseleave	mouseenter	hide	show
the single function will get fired for both mouseenter and mouseleave and toggle will show when otherwise will hide

3928419
hide	show
i wouldn t use the show and hide methods because they re a bit slow particularly if you re using a lot of animation on the page

3928432
folder	dir
btw - my home dir in this case for me is my user folder for my login so i was able to find it there

3928433
getter	setter
i use this option in eclipse java to import getter setter methods to access class variables

3928443
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
declare variables for the fileinputstream and fileoutputstream and invoke close on each in a finally block

3928444
switching	screens
when i did that the preference screens started to act wierdly â the two custom preferences switching locations constantly as i drag the seek bar

3928448
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i have a uinavigationcontroller with two uiviewcontroller on it a and b

3928451
folder	directory	copying	overwrite
we frequently have multiple people working on each project and sometimes they copy files overwrite changes made by others who were working on the same file at the same time copied the file from a network share to their local hd made the changes then copied back to the network keep old versions in the same directory as the working file lose track of who has what file where like people copying the file out of the shared project directory and into their personal shared folder making changes and moving it back and forth

3928453
rss	feed
i wanna write a simple rss feed reader in c++

3928453
rss	feed
and the protocol or commands to interact with a rss feed socket

3928465
getter	setter
it s a plain private property with getter and setter

3928504
min	max
mode both min and max jruby runtimes are set to 1 in your trinidad.yml configuration file

3928545
rss	feed
to get started just go to which is an rss feed for stackoverflow c++ question

sproutcore	cappuccino
i am evaluating sproutcore and cappuccino for use in my current project

3933231
sproutcore	cappuccino
on the other hand all the cappuccino samples seem very responsive despite that fact that they are more full blown applications than the sproutcore samples

sharepoint	splist	spweb	splist
is possible to inherit from sharepoint classes such like spweb splist etc

3933301
sharepoint	splist	spweb	splist
spweb and splist are sealed in sharepoint 2007 see

3933329
filesystems	ntfs
the size of the directory is less interesting than the fact that you re going through the entire filesystems stack 250 000 times everything from ntfs the kernel and your grandmother s favorite anti-virus filter all have to get a chance to play

3933467
backgroundworker	dispatchertimer
i have a kinda awkward problem i m working with c# and wpf in .net 4.0 and what i need is a timer that will create only one thread but it will need to work in the background so not in the main thread the problem is using system.windows.forms.timer or dispatchertimer will automatically force it to work on the main thread and be influenced by the ui on the other side using system.timers.timer or system.threading.timer will create a new thread for every cycle that overpasses the time interval this will happen since the code in the elapsed timer event is a bit big although part of it is sent further to a backgroundworker

3933563
post	get
the problem i am having is that if the user clicks the save button when one of the text boxes has focus the blur event gets triggered at the same time as the button click event and two ajax post get called simultaneously

3933573
put	get
since we don t have access to the satellite system we can t prove this is the issue but it appears they get the packets just don t put them back together in the correct sequence

3933590
for-loop	loops
and this loops can be optmized by putting large increment on this for-loop

3933590
width	height
for example if you know that you have no such object whose width or height is smaller than 50 pixel then you will put 50 as the increment in the nested loop either on width or height or both.

because the server-side is performing your paging and the client-side runs jquery you can t directly access the information you need

3933687
jboss	weblogic
i am new to weblogic and am porting over a series of web applications from jboss

3933698
getter	setter
you provide dummy public setter and getter

3933698

typedef	struct
you have a typedef d anonymous struct but refer to a non-existent tagged struct inside

3933792
udp	tcp
the daemonization code in twistd doesn t care if you re serving up udp or tcp

3933792
udp	tcp
the way you daemonize a udp server is identical to the way you daemonize a tcp server

3933792
udp	tcp
you should be able to use the tcp echo server as an example to write a .tac file for your udp server

3933808
freebsd	linux
for students in computer science major learning programming on linux freebsd is much better than doing these on windows

3933823
post	get
i can get all the post via metaweblog.getrecentposts and extract ids but i didn t exactly know the count of the post in blog

3933830
min	max
picking those min max values is tough though

3933918
listview	gridview
i tend to use the listview with a gridview layout to replace it in simple cases

3933928
wav	ogg	mp3	ogg	mp3	wav
obviously you ll need to provide your own wav ogg or mp3 to try this yourself

3933943
int	chars
a chars literal such as a will be treated as an int literal such as 97 or 0x61

3933991
n-gram	words
i was thinking about simply making a list of 2-5 long words n-gram and finding the probability but that doesn t take order into account which could be helpful

3933998
apache	nginx
stop start runserver apache or nginx

3934002
hex	binary
if you open a binary in a hex editor copy a portion of data and paste in a disassembler you will very probably not copy a complete instruction

versioning	upgrade
the solution is to upgrade your jdbc driver to versioning 11.2

3934092
google-chrome	firefox
tested in firefox 3.6 google-chrome 6.0

3934129
multiplying	add
well depending on the size of your integers you may want to multiplying the first coordinate by the max possible coordinate and add the second

3934139
google-chrome	safari
anyways tested and it works in google-chrome and safari

3934220
multiplying	subtract
the point of choosing 31 as your prime is being able to multiplying using a bit shift and a subtract

3934220
multiplying	subtract
the point of choosing 31 as your prime is being able to multiplying using a bit shift and a single subtract operation

3934220
multiplying	subtraction
note that bitshifting by 5 is equivalent to multiplying by 32 and the subtraction makes this equivalent to multiplying by 31

3934231
bash	tcsh
make sure you are in bash shell not c or tcsh

3934266
ubuntu	linux
sqlalchemy is throwing me error messages in french on my french-configured linux ubuntu lappy

3934284
getter	setter
when i copy the method declarations for a boolean type using the technique suggested by jim correia the getter and setter are typed as

3934284
getter	setter
the setter and getter methods store and retrieve your property using - id primitivevalueforkey nsstring key

3934295
width	height
create a message that has input storage key output storage key width height - and add to queue

3934307
children	parent
as the hit rect is in the parent coordinate space the parent first needs to layout its children which it hasn t done yet during oncreate

3934312
gridview	rowdatabound
then in the rowdatabound event handler for your gridview add

3934326
getter	setter
a backing variable complete with getter and setter methods are created for you by the compiler but you would not see them in your standard code

3934352
int	chars
read it into a chars buffer and use atoi to convert the string into a int

3934355
int	chars
you can use the read function but you have to be careful to consume sizeof int chars from the socket and then you have to worry about endianess

3934379
width	height
the image rectangle s width and height

3934379
width	height
from the width and height members of

3934417
persistent	transient
some preliminary hacking with using a persistent property instead of transient and no other changes seems to work just fine so this looks to be a bug

3934441
aptana	radrails
i went to the extreme though and decided to use vim as my editor rather than relying on an ide radrails aptana etc

3934441
rails.vim	fuzzyfinder	nerdtree	rails.vim	nerdtree	fuzzyfinder
if you go the same route i did you ll need to learn about vim and it s many plugins like rails.vim fuzzyfinder snippets nerdtree

3934484
put	get
dataadapter.fill datatable gets only the first result set and put it on a datatable as that result is empty you get an empty datatable

3934502
mediarecorder	audiorecord
i ve got an application which records audio from the microphone and then performs some post-processing on the audio in realtime so i must use the audiorecord class instead of the standard mediarecorder

3934514
google-chrome	firefox
i tried it in firefox 3.6.10 and google-chrome 7.0.517.36

3934518
pull	push
i created 2 uibutton one to pull an uiimageview from the top of the screen and the other to push it back

3934518
pull	push
i have the code for the action but i dont know how to relate it to an if-statement if button1 pressed then pull view else button2 pressed then push view back

3934519
int	chars
not only the system but also int argc chars argv return exit etc

3934529
put	get
i thought i would try some of the other refactorings like adding a parameter to a method but i get the following error when i put the cursor over a private method

3934540
postgresql	mysql
my conclusion was basically to stick with what i know php and mysql postgresql

3934540
postgresql	mysql
yeah mongo or another nosql might be a better fit for the data but it d take me time to learn how to install and use them and frankly unless you have a massive amount of traffic mysql postgresql will not cause performance issues

3934573
classname	inherited
in this case tr.classname mean that every tr elment with class classname will inherited the css

3934591
inherited	properties
i am facing problem while serializing values of enabled visible properties that are inherited from system.windows.forms.control class

3934603
put	get
i can t figure out how to get a mercurial revision id put into my maven build ideally i would like it in the manifest of my jars and war

3934612
switching	screens
if i put the table in edit mode switching to another screens of my app and then go back to the table i can set the table to don t be anymore in edit mode but the button persist in the edit state while i would like it to show me agin the edit label so to be consistent with the table state let s say

3934646
folder	directory
it turns out though that startupprojectb and startupprojectc all live in the same directory as startupprojecta on the local machine so on the pc i m using i have a generalsolution folder which contains a startupprojecta folder a startupprojectb folder a startupprojectc folder and a folder a b folder and a c folder

viewdidload	dealloc
if you re having problems on presentation of the vc or on its release check memory management in the init viewdidload and dealloc of the graphcontroller

3934745
hid	keyboard
the question is that i have some hid devices that act as a keyboard msr barcode scaner rfid reader and i want to be able to read their input in my wpf application without the necessity for this to happen in say a text field in the application

3934757
getter	setter	public	protected
if one expects that the source code for a base class will be available to anyone who is inheriting from it and expects that the base class will never change typically this means that the reason for using the base class is to allow public members and properties of the base-class to be used interchangeably with derived classes rather than to reduce the amount of code needed for the derived classes and if all public methods are virtual or tie directly into virtual methods there s not much disadvantage to using protected fields rather than protected virtual getter setter

3934757
getter	setter
if one expects that derived classes may be created in situations where the classes above them in the hierarchy are not completely known or are not immutable then it may be more appropriate to have protected getter setter but that responsibility could be left with whoever creates the opaque layers in the hierarchy

3934757
getter	setter
addendum the only thing gained by adding protected virtual getter and setter will be the ability for derived classes to change how the base class code accesses the fields properties

3934769
int	double
should be int instead of double

3934771
post	get
i m trying to get a post response from a url and i can not get the response to print to my html page instead it just redirects me to the url in the action with the response

3934789
sikuli	selenium
you can extend the selenium server so it will be able to execute sikuli scripts see this on how to call them from java

3934794
public	protected
i consider any other use of protected as conceptually equivalent to public

3934794
public	protected
in the sense that if you write a non virtual protected method write it as if it was public

3934794
public	protected
if the field would break something if it was public it will also break something if it s protected

3934811
portrait	landscape
i want these to be one above the other when the device is in portrait orientation and i want these to be next to each other when the device orientation changes to landscape

3934821
put	get
for a named scope you d need to put it into a lambda so it does get evaluated every time this sounds like the question you re actually asking

3934841
button	checkbox
one workaround i have found is to replace radio button with checkbox and use rules to simulate the exclusive behavior of radio button

3934871
post	get
jmeter will not execute javascript at run time - it can only post get http requests

3934927
post	get
there isn t an xml-rpc method to get all post mostly because that could lead to significant performance issues imaging a blog with 5 000 post and high traffic .

3934927
post	get
pull all the code together into a custom plug-in place it in your site activate it and you can now get a count of published post or a list of published post ids via xml-rpc

3934969
int	chars
your chars return probably works because chars can be easily converted to an int

3934997
hide	show
then it hide form2 and then show it as a modal box

3935098
int	double	int	chars
it is probably because chars will implicitly cast to an int however double won t as there would be data loss

3935102
accelerometer	gyroscope
drift from the accelerometer and gyroscope are understood

3935102
accelerometer	gyroscope
i m interested if anyone has been able to develop a 6dof with only the accelerometer and gyroscope that works reliably for 5-10 seconds with little drift in both translation and orientation

3935158
ostream	istream
you could make that a function taking istream instr and ostream outstr

3935158
spaces	delimiter
suppose now we want to change that to read multiple lines each with numbers delimiter by spaces or tab

3935158
variance	kurtosis
we could calculate the variance skewness and kurtosis at the same time if we want whilst iterating

3935161
post	get
also - it may have been accidental but post parameters dont go up in the url like get they are behind the scenes invisible to the user and also capable of being far larger

3935182
onresume	onpause
when i click home button and then come back to to my application it doesn t show the last values on the listview or any other view it just look same with when i started the application.i believe it is can be done with onresume and onpause but i couldn t find how

3935185
implements	extends
class gameview extends surfaceview implements surfaceholder.callback

3935196
jobs	cron
make the cron jobs look for a flag file under var run then write an initscript that sets or resets that flag

3935207
onresume	onpause
you can store all values in sharedpreferences in onpause and then load them again in onresume and populate your views using that data

3935221
hash	salt
the password will be salt and hash in sha-256 then stored in either the registry or a file

3935262
equinox	knopflerfish
there are existing open-source offerings that you can build-upon equinox and virgo apache felix and karaf knopflerfish concierge glassfish 3 etc comparison

3935304
integer	unsigned
i can easily convert the bytes to an unsigned integer 1876166208

3935309
prototypejs	mootools
you could use better ajax techniques like the available javascript libraries out there jquery dojo prototypejs mootools

3935346
integer	unsigned
if the lower 31 bits represent a one s complement integer that is a sign bit followed by 30 bits representing an unsigned magnitude then you need to convert it into two s complement so that java extracts the value properly

3935365
min	max	range	max	range	min
because i am bounding the sample size to the range of values from max to min i am selecting a different prime number that stays static as long as the same initial seed is given

3935365
min	max
i do this because i want the same sequence given the same seed and the same min max bounds for repeatability of testing

3935367
coalesce	isnull
some articles i found on the internet compared isnull with coalesce so i think my question is a little different

3935407
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
opera google-chrome flock firefox and maxthon

3935408
post	get
set the session variable before you redirect - the post is lost as the redirect is essentially a regular get request

3935430
hide	show
and let the css do the dirty work to hide most of the body and show alternate content

3935433
ant	maven
if i use ant directly the file is uploaded but if i call the ant task via maven using the maven-antrun-plugin i get the following error

3935460
mouseup	mousedown
i have not checked to see if the jquery library has fixed this since i asked the question what i did instead was use the mousedown and mouseup events to disable and enable

3935462
post	get
jmeter and most other load testing tools are designed to operate at the protocol-level http get http post etc

3935513
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i tested this in google-chrome 6.0.472.63 firefox 3.6 3 and 2 ie 8 7 and opera 10.62

3935538
jobs	cron	daemon	cron
edit typically there would be a daemon running all the time that listens to the queue at my work i have a worker daemon that uses beanstalk client and beanstalkd for its job queue but if you have jobs being added only infrequently then a cron job is a good first implementation

3935543
profiling	benchmarking
if you are wanting to optimize then profiling and benchmarking don t guess

3935605
google-chrome	firefox
these results are consistent across firefox and google-chrome strangely it works correctly in ie so i have to assume i m doing something wrong but i don t know what

3935648
g++	gcc
notice that even though i set cc gcc the output is always g++

3935655
hide	show
the better way do show hide where you don t have to worry about what the default display value might be is to define a class

3935658
settings.bundle	plist
i went through the process of creating a settings.bundle in the project root settings the root.plist to display as an iphone settings plist etc

3935674
google-chrome	firefox
there seems to be some bug while using google-chrome because in firefox this works

3935719
postgresql	mysql
i am using postgresql and due to a bit laziness and fear of breaking something i don t want to use mysql so i just add a gem postgresql in our gemfile

3935729
webrat	cucumber
i ve also tried using webrat for the secondary sessions but can t convince cucumber to switch drivers for a single step in a scenario although it does switch between scenarios

3935865
rss	feed
within a site i am working on the previous developer put together a very rudementary function to re-create the rss feed at the click of a button

3935865
rss	feed
i need to be able to have the rss feed continuously up-to-date without clicking on the button and running the function

3935893
int	double	int	boolean
must allow values to be many different types int strings double boolean lists of those

3935894
rss	feed
write your own .net rss feed in c#

3935907
apache	nginx
you could run nginx on a different port 8080 and then use apache s mod_proxy to send requests to nginx

3935914
comparator	comparable
alternatively you can use a treeset to sort on insertion using this comparator or make the employee a comparable object to sort using collections or a sortedset

3935963
hide	show
it seems to me if you need such message you have to continue to use div placed over the grid body and hide show it inside of loadcomplete event handle

3935974
graphics2d	bufferedimage
i think you are better off keeping one bufferedimage and graphics2d per thread in threadlocal variables and drawing over the previous captcha whenever you create a new one

3935982
clang	llvm
â the llvm clang static analyzer can typically find memory management problems even before you run your program

3935985
translation	localization
most localization solutions i ve run across involve using the same controller and action method names but specifying a culture parameter in the route which dictates which translation version of the view is presented

3935995
coalesce	isnull
my goal was to simulate the functionality of isnull or coalesce but linq doesn t like it

3936026
calloc	malloc
it is really more like calloc than malloc because the call

3936027
execl	fork	vfork	execl
if so how would the wrapper invoke the java program - fork clone vfork execl

3936040
min	max
it can really always be avoided you can even use foreach but ignore the values and use the key almost forgetting that its a foreach instead of for but avoiding any gaps in your keys and automatically have your bounds taken care of without length min max functions or anything

3936069
textarea	textbox
add select for dropdowns and textarea for multiline textbox

3936071
ssl	https
i have a small confusion on ssl handshake between browser and server in a typical https web scenario

3936079
filewriter	bufferedwriter
you can use java s scanner class to parse words of a file and process them in your application and then use a bufferedwriter or filewriter to write back to the file applying the changes

3936080
google-chrome	firefox
again firefox google-chrome ie8 ie9 all work properly

3936111
strcpy	strncpy
note that you should consider using the strncpy method instead of strcpy and check the return value to ensure that the buffers do not overrun

3936114
spaces	delimiter
so you hold tags keywords categories as a spaces delimiter string in your posts table

3936121
free	strdup
note you ll also need to free all of the strings you create with strdup .

3936155
comparator	comparable
implement comparable by creating a comparator employee method

3936161
versioning	upgrade
you may need to upgrade the versioning of php

3936181
hash	md5	hash	hmac	hmac	md5
authentication code hmac versions of both md5 and sha-1 hash

3936183
spaces	delimiter
i tried the search function but only found questions regarding reading in comma spaces delimiter files

3936207
button	checkbox
i also have a group component that deals with a group of checkbox or radio button

3936214
salt	md5	crypt	salt	crypt	md5
glibc s crypt uses a md5 based algorhytm if salt starts with 1

3936242
post	get
the ofxhttputils addon does not have any method for remembering the cookie from a post so the response i get back is just the login page

3936265
hide	show
your controller will stay within your existing navigation-controller hierarchy unlike fluchtpunkt s solution and the tab bar will automatically hide and show itself when your player controller appears and disappears

3936288
filtering	grouping
because it filtering users from the second grouping

3936321
google-chrome	firefox
works fine in firefox and ie but google-chrome freaks out

3936326
userid	usergroups
what doesn t make sense to me is why there is no join between users and usergroups on userid

3936340
google-chrome	firefox
this seems to only happen in firefox mac i can t replicate the issue in google-chrome

3936364
post	put
both put and post are used for creates and updates it s not about if you re creating or updating it s about whether you already know the uri or you need the server to assign it for you

3936421
filtering	grouping
you are always returning every row from users ignore email filtering for now once for every row in usergroups because you have no join no matter what grouping they belong to

3936423
folder	directory
it s also possible but not likely that the media folder is only writable by the camera app in which case you d want to specify a different desired destination in the extra_output extra of the intent which invokes the camera so that the file will be written into your app s directory

3936469
glsurfaceview	viewanimator
i have a viewanimator setup to go through a few normal views buttons text etc and then to a glsurfaceview

3936469
glsurfaceview	viewanimator
beyond that i just use shownext and showprevious off the viewanimator and it works great until i try and switch to that glsurfaceview

3936496
post	get
i want to get the post only from the band not others from a facebook page wall its a band so no private profile and publish it on my own site

3936496
post	get
i hoped to get the post as xml or json and then parse them

3936497
super	self
if self super init

3936499
gridview	rowdatabound
alternatively you could bind the data to the child gridview programmatically via the parent gridview s rowdatabound event handler

3936500
post	put
while for post you are always adding another item to the systems-state with put the action is the same even if multiple times performed because you are adressing an item

3936543
.nettiers	codesmith
also the codesmith team is about to start working on an official set of ef templates but for now they offer several different orm options including linq to sql nhibernate .nettiers clsa etc

3936559
action-filter	onactionexecuting
u can subclass action-filter attribute and override onactionexecuting method

3936561

the harder way is to implement text on path for both svg and vml for a raphael .text

3936605
boost	allocator

google-chrome	firefox
enable it to catch http traffic ie google-chrome does it by default firefox - enable it through the add on it installs

3936634
comparator	comparable
if i say that my class implements comparable then i need to define a comparator function

3936674
ant	maven
yes but maven and the maven-antrun-plugin is not using your local ant install

3936680
implements	extends
given a guice type literal and a class class c implements or extends t construct a type type t which is equivalent to c with all type variables instantiated so as to be compatible with template

3936712
innodb	myisam
unlike myisam innodb may have problems on nfs

3936714
rss	feed
here is my hacky workaround for reading google news rss feed

3936719
versioning	upgrade
i suggest to upgrade to a more recent versioning of h2

3936732
rss	feed
i m working on some code that creates a local database and table retrieves an rss feed parses it and adds information from each entry to the database

3936732
rss	feed
the insert query is inserting data but it uses the same data the last item in the rss feed every iteration

3936734
uiview	subviews
so far i have added a uiview as subviews to my main view and set it s frame

3936760
fgets	fread
specifically you re looking for fopen fgets fread etc

3936922
ant	maven
as pascal has mentioned the maven-antrun-plugin is not using the ant specified by your ant_home environment variable and the configuration that he s mentioned is probably the best way to do it consistently from a pure maven perspective

3936922
ant	maven
the only potential benefit that you may derive from this approach is that the ant script may be runnable from maven and ant

3937019
children	parent
the parent should should have an abstract method like dosomething to be implemented by the children whatever was in _dosomethingwithchild1 should be in child1.dosomething etc

3937719
client-side	server-side
the main advantage of ria services is that they handles validation by using data annotations on server-side classes and do it in a smart way they automatically generate client side-classes with the same data-annotations and validate them by implementing automatically inotifydataerror on the client-side class

3937719
client-side	server-side	post	put
if one uses custom attributes and put the.shared.cs or .vb extension those attribute definitions are copied in the silverlight client and used in the client-side validation otherwise they are used only to perform server-side validation......for more information pls see my blog post

3938726
des	aes
the design of the aes benefited from 25 years of insights and research on des

3938726
des	aes
the original des designers were genius but one could say that the aggregate effort of cryptographers for the aes has been far greater

3938769
getter	setter
it will generate the getter setter you only need to declare the fields

3938770
getter	setter
most ides eg eclipse or netbeans include tools for automatically creating getter and setter methods for a class s fields

3939965
int	double
your function zeroit reaches an int through double indirection

3939983
addition	multiplication
the best way is to simply use normal 1-dimensional arrays and compute the index yourself with multiplication and addition but in c99 you can also use vla semantics to have the compiler treat it like a real 2d array

3939984
int	double
cell 10 contains a pointer to cell 20 and cell 11 contains a pointer to 30 this is called double indirection - array is a sequential word width sequence of pointers to arrays of int there is no need to calculate just dereference two pointers

3940010
int	chars
what s happening is that scanf stops reading an int when it sees the . chars and leaves it in the input buffer

on the server the client-side sid went into another hashing function a few times to get the server-side sid which was the primary key in a remote mysql database

3943045
post	get
you ll need to consume the service via get requests post requests or soap requests

3943045
post	get
another way that would work for get post or soap requests is using xmlhttp if you go the soap route you ll need to make your own soap envelope in the xml

3943045
post	get
this gives you options to expose get and post endpoints for your services

3943068

gnome kde or similar desktop interface get notified of this via d-bus that a new device has been installed and mounted i m not 100 about the exact steps here

3945186
daemons	systemd	kde	gnome
you could try altering your udev rules or the script that mounts new drives to do this for you or write a new daemons that gets notified the way that desktop management systemd like gnome or kde get notified to run it but there is no facility that i know if that already does this

3945199

i have answered a question on the different collection mappings before list vs set vs bag in nhibernate personally i find that i use the set strategy a lot

3945234
put	get
this works for a test case if i resize the browser window so the coordinates are on the edge - i get the width as it would be if i put the div at those coordinates

3945255
getter	setter
say you have a property p what you will have to do is write a getter and a setter for it

3945332
ceil	floor
e.g. cast minutes to a float divide by 15 use either the floor ceil function for decrement increment then multiply by 15 again

3945340
min	max
however two successive calls to randomnumber int min int max will give the same five results if they are called within the same time slice

mouse	keyboard
our current web application has standard hover menus but this really slows down our data entry clerks who are accustomed to desktop apps where there s a keyboard accessible menu and no need to use a mouse

3945510
subtraction	addition
using volatile keeps the compiler from optimizing away the test because it thinks that sum may have changed between the addition and the subtraction

3945510
subtraction	addition
using gcc 4.4.3 for x86_64 the assembly for this code does do the addition the subtraction and the test though it stores everything on the stack and of unneeded stack operations

3945526
cpu	processors
with modern multi-core processors it s often difficult to max out the cpu but keep an eye on it anyway

3945532
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
please see the following website in firefox google-chrome safari

3945537
uiview	subviews
generally speaking uiviewcontrollers are intended to host full-screen views and if you re adding the view as a subviews you should ask yourself if the view should just be a uiview subclass and move the logic into the parent view controller

3945587
getter	setter
i had set the value of connfd to 7 using the setter and then when i was using the getter i was getting the value 65534

3945626
hash	md5
usually md5 hash hash in general are represented as hexadecimal strings instead of base64 which then only contain a-f0-9

3945640
hash	md5
you might want to consider using the hexadecimal representation of your md5 hash instead since this is a fairly standard way of representing those as a string

3945659
folder	directory
generally it s not good practise to write to the program files directory i usually write log file to the appdata folder which you can get at by using

do i need to have hard values for the width and height of the grid

3945827
.htaccess	httpd.conf
the other option instead of using .htaccess although wordpress is built around modifying that file you can take the contents of the .htaccess and add them to a directive in your httpd.conf or virtual host config file

3945841
getter	setter
a small debate flared up in a question about protected member variables regarding the use of getter setter

3945841
getter	setter
there are lots of questions already over whether getter setter are evil however one particular argument against them which was posed by two separate individuals with much higher reputation than myself struck me

3945841
getter	setter
one said that getter setter made the code only 0.01 less brittle and the other stated that adding 10 lines of code where one would do makes the code more brittle

3945854
children	parent
what is wrong is that after you want the children to be responsible of selecting what implementation should the parent factory method return

3945854
children	parent
it s wrong in terms of design because you are delegating to all children what can be simply pushed up and centralized into the abstract superclass and also it shows you are mixing together patterns that are used in different contexts abstract factory parent decide what family of classes clients are going to get and factory method children factories select what the clients will get

3945854
children	parent
more test friendly and extension friendly solution is simply to have children that are not singleton but packaged into some internal package that you will document as private and abstract parent that can expose the singleton mimiking static getinstance and will cache the children instances enforcing that clients always get the same service instance

3945957
labwindows	cvi
last time i used it labwindows cvi suite by national instruments was a c only compiler

gridview	sqldatasource	gridview	entitydatasource	sqldatasource	entitydatasource
if i go through the configure gridview and configure datasource wizard for any datasource sqldatasource object entitydatasource when i use multiple tables i cannot use the where parameters in the wizard and therefore need to have the selecting code in the code-behind but i m unsure where exactly to put this

3946036
post	get
what i d love to do is get question #1 and update it based on the post data

3946070
post	get
if you ve ever seen when you hit a back button and you get that dialog do you want to resubmit this query that s because the results of the previous page are from a post not a get

3946085
.htaccess	httpd.conf
i have dealt with this problem before and it was the result of a hidden .htaccess i know you said you have checked for one but possibly try checking your htdocs folder because if you documentroot is set to htdocs in your httpd.conf then any folders inside that will inherit your .htaccess setup

3946108
prepare	execute
therefore the following code should prepare the statement once and execute it 10 times

3946109
for-loop	arrays
so i ve placed each curve as an arrays in a cell index y this allows me to index through arrays of different sizes inside a for-loop

3946109
for-loop	arrays
i use hold all below to enable each iteration of the for-loop to plot each new arrays in the cell arrays y inside the same plot

3946124

3946172
google-chrome	safari
in safari and google-chrome the visited links lack the bottom border though although all other styles are applied

3946190
versioning	upgrade
i think it boils to just installing a newer versioning of pydev this is the solution for many bugs - add as an update site and then upgrade to the latest versioning

3946240
treeviewitem	listboxitem
my workaround is to use an attached behavior that utilizes the preview events to intercept the focus before it happens and set the underlying item accordingly which works great when i ve hard-coded treeviewitem or listboxitem etc. but i don t want to hard-code the type since the control shouldn t really care

3946270
ati	nvidia
wikipedia has tables of headline figures for ati cards here and for nvidia cards here

3946282
postgresql	mysql
for development often sqlite is sufficient and ideal because it just uses an easily transportable file rather than having to create dump load and manage user access to something like mysql or postgresql

3946289
mouseover	mouseout
handle the mouseover mouseout events for the parent element instead

3946317
mouseleave	mouseenter
use mouseenter and mouseleave instead

3946317
mouseleave	mouseenter
that won t happen with mouseenter mouseleave

3946363
dbf	dbase
that being said the dbase formatted files dbf are still used

3946396
post	get
in this case whenever you access the post property of an already loaded user the data will get loaded from the db

3946415
pull	push
note since you are using a dvcs which introduces publication push pull which is orthogonal to branching you might want to fetch the same branch2 from the remote and merge it in your local branch2

3946435
google-chrome	firefox
setting the span to display inline seems to work in google-chrome and firefox

3946490
int	double
seems like all your issues stem from reading in matrix values as int rather than double

3946490
int	double
everything works fine if you change temp in read_mat to an int then cast it to a double when you re putting it in the matrix

3946514
sorting	filtering
i have full control over columns sorting filtering style etc via the jquery configuration script which is rather straightforward

3946541
pull	push
i want to push and pull things off of a stack in an atomic way using ruby and mongodb

3946549
stdout	stderr
if you don t want wget s stderr output emailed either you can also add a after the dev null which further redirects stderr to stdout which is now going to dev null

3946550
public	protected
i think there s a fair reason for a standard collection not to support a public cloning method but only a protected one it s possible that a class which derives from a collection might break severely if cloned and if base class cloning method is public there s no way to prevent an object of a derived class from being given to code that expects to clone it

3946610
nsstring	nsobject
isequalto is an nsobject method which should be extended overriden by subclasses like nsstring isequaltostring basically it compares an object with another object in a way you would expect it to with the contents

3946642
width	height
the problem is that the defined in the skin draws some line that go outside the bounds of the skin s width height

3946642
width	height
unless i explicitly set the width and height from outside

3946642
width	height
i can only draw the path after i know the width and height of the component..

3946665
uiview	subviews
when i add a subviews to a uiview or when i resize an existing subviews i would expect and to reflect that change

3946672
mouseout	mouseenter
however when moving from the image to the button which is over the image the mouseout mouseenter is triggered so the buttons fade out then fade back in the buttons have the same class as the image otherwise they just stay faded out

3946711
webkit	gecko
one can get consistent behaviour at least between webkit and gecko by giving the outer element some width

3946740
for-loop	while-loop
i m not really sure of what you are trying to do here but generally continue will break out of an if-block or go to the next iteration of a for-loop while-loop etc

3946771
hide	show	sorting	filtering
our data is tabular so we send it via ajax to datatables this allows for good ui formatting sorting filtering and show hide of columns

3946773
mouseover	mouseout
put the image and the button in the same div then put the mouseover mouseout events on the div

3946781
comparator	comparable
i would use a comparator instead of comparable if you are going to change the way you sort

3946800
jar	war
building a war or a jar is similar for different projects and you can predict where to find information this is as opposed to the free-form style provided by ant where targets can be written and organized in a lot of different ways

3946819
int	double
arithmetic operations in java whose operands are all int s will result in int s so you re actually assigning an int result to a double variable

3946820
int	double
by casting score to a double you are dividing a floating-point value with an int and you get a floating-point value back

3946839
routedevent	frameworkelement
i want to invoke all registered routedevent handlers of a frameworkelement a mouseleftbuttonup or a mousemove of a contentcontrol canvas ...

3946855
getter	setter
i m assuming you actually have getter and setter for the properties you want to use

3946868
apache	lighttpd
since you ve switched to lighttpd the webserver itself is going to use fewer resources than apache would but apache is rarely the bottleneck unless you ve run out of ram or seriously misconfigured it

3946875
onmouseover	mouseout
hover on a span doesn t work in ie6 so if you need to make that browser hover-highlight you would have to have onmouseover mouseout code to add or remove a .hover classname.

3946892
cos	sin
i understand what sin and cos and some other trigonometric functions means but i don t really get what kind of problems they solve

3946908
getter	setter
i ll agree that changes in c# are nice closures delegates etc. but anyone who s writing java without an ide that easily generates all the getter setter you need automatically is crazy

3946922
getter	setter
it s all about getter setter

3946946
uiview	subviews
if you want any other functionality such as resizing a view to fit its subviews you should subclass uiview and override -sizethatfits

3946956
getter	setter
it s just shorthand syntax for the type of getter setter methods you write in java

3946970
gridview	rowdatabound
i ve done this often by creating divs underneath in a rowdatabound event for gridview

3947022
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome opera and previous firefox had no problem with the the essentially null function while the new version did

3947034
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended
when second button is pressed the press event may be entered on touchesbegan touchesmoved or touchesended you have to check touches count at these places

3947042
getter	setter
the getter setter say there is a method to set something called foo and a method to get something called foo but what s implied is there is a property called foo of type int. i think having language support to intuitively define exactly what you mean is a good thing

3947045
cos	sin
if you have a basic understanding of sin and cos you should be able to use them to make the clock drawing pretty easy

3947045
cos	sin
if that doesn t give you your answer try to draw it without sin and cos

3947049
post	get
not sure how i would get the post count with this

3947077
getter	setter
particularly i prefer to use properties in c# instead on c++ or java setter and getter which are merely functions with special usage

3947086
getter	setter
i also want to have getter and setter methods for each field

3947103
put	get
some programmers might argue it s better to put the conditions throughough the logic not just inside the loop header and to employ break statements to get out at appropriate places

3947114
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
viewdidappear bool animated only gets called when the view is shown by uinavigationcontroller or uitabbarcontroller

3947126
tolower	toupper
i also don t want to use toupper tolower for performance reasons

3947139
strdup	malloc
as i am using the heap through strdup which calls malloc i do not understand why minurltime is not null until the thread is exited but then it is null

3947139
strdup	malloc
once pthread_exit is called although minurltime is a global variable that was allocated through strdup which calls malloc it appears to be null

3947145
put	get
i can t seem to find what event i need to put my code in to read the screen and get the left top

3947160
folder	directory
if i visit folder such as css and com which are folder in the web root it displays a 404 error page and adds the to the end of the url because it s treating it as a directory

3947160
folder	directory
if someone types in a folder name that happens to exist it will redirect the user to the path with the at the end of the url signifying that it s a directory

3947160
folder	directory
for the pictures directory explained above the user does not have permission to access that folder so it is redirecting them to a 403 access denied page rather than simply showing the page that is supposed to be displayed there via the rewriterule above

3947172
udp	tcp
basically i would like to use boost asio s sockets like linux socket descriptors whether the underlying socket is udp or tcp it doesn t matter you can call read write sendto etc.

3947203
kde	gnome
i mean the basic building block or principle they used to draw visual components on the screen like kde gnome etc

3947211
udp	tcp
you need to use a particular type of socket like boost asio ip tcp socket which is a stream-based tcp socket or boost asio ip udp socket which is for datagrams

3947229
fadein	hide	hide	show
show the image on mousedown using show or fadein or whatever tickles your fancy then hide it inside your success callback

3947268
rss	feed
you might want to take a look at the .net wcf syndication framework makes creating serving rss atom feed relatively simple

3947291
post	get
finally this blog post by google at long last real-time stock quotes are here claims to offer free data on certain stocks but in google finance s pages i can t find anything about it nor at their api pages and again who knows what delay i get from the realtime data

3947296
int	double
in the case of the position class one would assume that the attributes are all primitive types int or double and therefore a deep versus shallow copying is moot

3947296
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
if the objects in the array are serializable then you can copy them by using objectoutputstream and objectinputstream serialize and then deserialize the array

3947301
folder	directory
all i want to do is change directory to this folder

3947374
hide	show
rest assured when you use it right it s quite easy to create multiple windows and to hide and show them at will

3947388
put	get
as and when development teams get shippable products put in the shelf the operations kanaban team can do the deployment and release branching etc tasks as per the release plan

3947401
width	height
where and will be the entire width and height of the top image

3947409
onfocus	onblur
for a start for accessibility reasons you might want to use onfocus and onblur to take into account the fact that someone might not be using the mouse

3947424
cos	sin
but sin and cos aren t guaranteed to return positive numbers

3947428
put	get
then in my controller i get this list and put it into the viewdata

3947435
cpu	processors
as a rule of thumb if the processors can t forecast a memory access and prefetch it the retrieval process can take 90 nanoseconds or 250 clock cycles from the cpu knowing the address to the cpu receiving data

3947444
folder	directory
i select the folder on the remote directory specify the into folder of the local directory hit finish and nothing ever gets synced

3947456
addclass	removeclass
jquery-ui addclass removeclass

3947476
min	max
i think imageviews don t really have the funcionality to zoom most likely you ll want to slap down a uiscrollview and then insert the imageview as a subview at that point you ll be able to set the max min zoom scale on the scrollview

3947595
width	height
given the required dimensions in logical inches and the font information the code first fits the text to the required width by inserting line breaks then breaks it into correctly-size blocks based on the text height

3947595
width	height
this should all work out since i m converting the extents back to inches and then comparing them against required width and height in inches

3947615
children	parent
i m implementing a classical map-reduce program in which i have a parent that spwans n children maps + 1 reduce

3947615
children	parent
the parent sends info through unnamed pipes to each one of the n children

3947615
children	parent
and in the parent after creating pipes and children i have something like this

3947618
maven	pom.xml
it seems like this would be a great tool a la maven but for bundles - and i don t mean simply specifying them in a pom.xml file like used by the provision task of the maven-pax-plugin

3947628
min	max
my min max heap is 1024m and min and max permgen space is defined as 768m

3947660
mouse	keyboard
in directx the keyboard mouse events are special

3947695
pull	push
for git changes are also committed locally which is very fast you only push pull from the internet when you want to

3947716
children	parent
the user would select the relevant children to associate with the parent

3947752
photoshop	paint.net
use a tool like photoshop or paint.net and you can include 16x16 32x32 48x48 and 64x64 in a single .ico file and the operating system will display the best one to show depending on the view of the directory details list large icon etc

3947765
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
basically i know i need to do something with nscalendar nsdate and nstimeinterval and perhaps nsdatecomponents but i can t seem to come up with the simplest approach to this that will allow me to calculate scheduling nsdates for ios local notifications

3947780
ftp	telnet
ftp telnet rlogin etc

3947814
width	height
because this is an iphone the window height 480 and width 320 remain constant regardless of rotation

3947838
int	double
and in your get int method rather than returning a string or a double the return statement looks like

3947854
ienumerable	ienumerator
for a complete example showing the implementation of ienumerable and a separate class implementing ienumerator you can look at the documentation for ienumerable

3947871
equals	gethashcode
implement equals and gethashcode for your student class

3947874
ienumerable	ienumerator
the ienumerable and ienumerator should generally be separate classes and except in the case of enumerators that always return empty or always return the same item the getenumerator method must always return a new instance of an ienumerator

3947874
ienumerable	ienumerator
for-each loops don t use it and consumers of an ienumerable ienumerator can t use it unless they know what the enumerable type is in which case they could use the actual type rather than the interface

3947967
int	chars
ilink32 error error unresolved external cryptopp simplekeyinginterface setkey const unsigned chars unsigned int cryptopp namevaluepairs referenced from e test debug file1.obj

3947991
rss	feed
fandango provides a number of rss feed that you may be able to use to accomplish your task

3948012
public	protected
the only real consequence besides writing sloppy code which you re fixing that i can see is not being able to specify access modifiers to properties not declared some where in the class public private protected

3948031
arcgis	proj
so imo i believe you re referencing a similar assembly in your proj that has localized resources possibly the silverlight assemblies or the arcgis assemblies never worked with either

3948050
google-chrome	firefox
this should keep the hacks at a minimum since css that works in ie8 usually also works for google-chrome firefox and the other decent browser

3948068
facade	mediator
design patterns are not generally specific to one language so i would suggest you google specific design patterns such as the mediator pattern facade pattern etc.

3948072
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
note that this will only work in select modern browsers namely current versions of firefox google-chrome safari opera and ie9

3948113
post	get
a bit later i ll post the tuples generator show that they are 7680 and some funny results about the distribution of the possible results of the operations in fact for the 1 2 3 4 set you can only get 230 different results

3948157

the results show that common unmodified unix applications can enjoy the benefits of exokernels applications either perform comparably on xok exos and the bsd unixes or perform significantly better

3952296
interpreted-language	compiled-language
calculations seems to allude to compute-intensive kernels for which i think is required a compiled-language or a fast interpreted-language with native array operators like apl or modern variant such as j a+ or k potentially at least i do not know if they are taking advantage of modern hardware

3952314
children	parent
if you mean that given a node n that belongs to a tree t it has the same parent and same children you will clarify us if the transformation you apply to the t to get the simplified one t1 outcomes a different tree or an homomorphic tree

3952337
width	height
the only other thing i needed to do was ensure that the height and width parameters passed to the function which are measured in inches got converted to pixels correctly

3952337
width	height
i couldn t use vb6 s existing inches-to-pixels conversion function since it takes the current dpi into account which would create inconsistent results since the text height and width is normalized to 96dpi so instead i just multiplied the height and width by 96 which converts them to what their pixel measurements would be at 96 dpi

3952357
min	max	width	height
in any case you should be able to override this behavior by setting min max height width as needed

3952376

setuptools	yolk
yolk is a python command-line tool and library for obtaining information about packages installed by setuptools easy_install and distutils and it can also query pypi packages

3952604
keydown	keyup
now i could work around that and fake it by sending that event first then looking at the e.handled before sending the actual keydown message which makes sense but then i hit another wall with the previewkeyup and keyup events since thanks to setting e.handled above i never get the real key up events to know when to send the fake ones

3952610
width	font-size
after it loads query the element s width and scale the font-size up by windowwidth spanwidth to avoid rounding issues multiply the default font size by windowwidth then divide the result by spanwidth or doing everything using floating-point arithmetic

drawimage	putimagedata
why is putimagedata so slow compared to redrawing the canvas although redrawing the canvas involves filling nearly the entire canvas with drawimage and then again filling roughly 50 of the canvas with polygons using lineto stroke and fill

3952856
drawimage	putimagedata
because drawimage seems to be so much faster then putimagedata after all the drawimage part of redrawing the canvas takes less than 30 ms

3953540
versioning	upgrade
this may not be the case any longer but that your error message states that the cuda toolkit versioning you re using doesn t support the v100 compiler would suggest that you may need to upgrade your cuda toolkit

3953953
int	chars
yes using an int instead of a chars will often result in a noticeable performance freebie

3953953
x86	mips
also try at a minimum x86 and arm perhaps mips gcc 3.x 4.x and llvm

3953953
int	chars
in particular notice how a single chars mixed in with a list of int in a line of declarations may cause the int that follow to not be aligned which is fine for x86 from an address standpoint but will cost in performance on an x86 even with a cache

3953953
int	chars
use simple habits like use unsigned int for everything unless you have a specific reason put your larger aligned variables and structures first in a list of declarations and the unaligned stuff last shorts then chars

3953953
int	chars
it is much better to multiply two chars instead of two int for example if the numbers support it so if you do happen to know the int are really 7 bit or 5 bit or whatever quantities typecast them down for the multiply and allow a hardware multiply to happen instead of a soft multiply

3953991

lift	scalatra
there are also other scala-based frameworks available such as scalatra and pinky for web development though not as well-known as lift

3954232
free	malloc
malloc can not rearrange already allocated memory so it can t make a continuous free block of 20 byte

3954261
mouseover	mouseout
when you click a button you will trigger a mouseover a mouseout event if you don t wish to trigger the mouseout event after the click event then you should remove the mouseout event listener in the click event listener

3954261
mouseover	mouseout
this means that in order to be sure that you have a mouseout listener when you mouseover you should add your mouseout listener in the mouseover listener

3954688
inherited	subclassing
as i ve read every class in objective-c should be inherited from nsobject or it s subclassing

3954689
jruby	mri	versioning	upgrade
i highly recommend you install a separate ruby anyway whether or not it is mri ruby because if you use the built-in netbeans versioning of jruby which is often not the latest and then upgrade netbeans you ll lose all the gems you ve installed

3954691
jboss	weblogic	jboss	glassfish	glassfish	weblogic
jboss is an example of an application server glassfish and weblogic are two very common others which provides the full j2ee specification

3954704
post	get
it seems that you are calling dynamic forms is in fact an effort to convert anchor links into forms so that you can post instead of get

3954795
pop-up	dialog
if you want it to open inline inside the browser without any pop-up dialog you could try setting the content-disposition http header on the server

3954895

from what i gather the updatewindow handle command calls inititates the wm_paint message but no matter where i put this command currently in the game loop i cant get it to call the message

3954945
disk	ram
the hardware specifications of both the hard disk and ram

3954945
disk	ram
honestly if you re storing 16gb of data then redis is most likely not the correct database program to be using simply because it is so heavy on ram and disk space by design

3954968
int	chars
in the first struct the surrounding chars s one byte each cause the compiler to push the int down so that it can be accessed as a full word four bytes

3955012
width	height
which all the boxes have the same width and height accept one of them i need to change its height to 500px for certain occasions

3955028

this works fine in safari 5 on the mac but doesn t seem to do anything in google-chrome or firefox

3955109
for-loop	arrays
this is a question about incrementing one value of a matlab arrays multiple times in the same statement without having to use a for-loop

3955126
int	double
primitive variables bytes double int etc. are not references in java

3955144
jmx	sigar
it will be fairly straight forward to create a jmx mbean that uses sigar to expose this data

3955205
google-chrome	safari
the code itself works fine and the drop down works in safari but for some reason it won t open in google-chrome

3955212
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
second your viewwillappear viewdidappear will get called when you write the code to call them from your mainviewcontroller

3955212
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
without knowing anything else about your design it s not really possible to advise on when you should call them but if the sub-controllers views are to be always visible when the main view is visible then it probably makes sense to call them from the viewwillappear viewdidappear methods of your mainviewcontroller

3955243
wordpress	joomla
it s a place where you can find many pre-built force.com apps think about them like plugins to wordpress joomla oscommerce...

3955245
hash	md5
one option is to make your stored hash include an algorithm version number - so you start with algorithm 0 md5 and store

3955245
versioning	upgrade
then when you upgrade to sha-1 you bump the versioning number to 1

3955260
decoder	encoder
you can use closure library google to make a cross browser json encoder decoder

3955271
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
so the problem is that viewwillappear viewdidappear get called when the view is added to the window not to one of it s subview

3955291
nunit	mstest
many of them run different unit tests some mstest some nunit

3955293
children	parent
suppose container is your parent movieclip and it has many children then now your target and currenttarget property depends on which object the listener is attached and how much you have nested your movieclips

3955293
children	parent
in my case the container is your parent movieclip having two or more children

3955302
postgresql	mysql
i know i could just store them in mysql or postgresql oracle and ms sql server are out for this but some other open source data store may be fine and just put the haversine formula in there where clause but i don t think that is going to yield efficient results

3955309
pbkdf2	hash	scrypt	pbkdf2
so if your existing hash are straight md5s and you plan on moving to some form of pbkdf2 or bcrypt or scrypt then change your password hash to

3955309
pbkdf2	md5
you already have the md5 in your database so all you do is apply pbkdf2 to it

3955309
hash	md5
the reason this works well is that the weaknesses of md5 vs other hash sha- don t affect password use

3955309
hash	md5
compared to longer hash md5 reduces the hash search-space somewhat with its 128-bit output but this is insignificant compared to the password search space itself which is much much smaller

3955309
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5	pbkdf2	hash	pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	md5
what makes a password hash strong is slowing down achieved in pbkdf2 by iterations and a random long-enough salt - the initial md5 doesn t adversely affect either of them

3955330
postgresql	mysql
to clarify the data will be stored in mysql postgresql but indexed by and searched via sphinx

3955333
width	height
then you can just get the width of your view the screen size you can just use an if else statement to get the height of status bar

3955359
pull	push
getting a handle of how to structure repositories with common functionality but customizations in each can be a little tricky but if you structure things right you can do all of your intra-repo migrations using using push pull and merge and never have to fix a bug twice have the same code in different changesets or re-do a repository s customization

3955363
comparator	comparable
your comparator implementation will cast class to comparable and use its compare method

3955376
width	height
i tried width 100 and height 100 that also didn t workout

3955390
temp	tmp

google-chrome	firefox
firefox 3.6.10 google-chrome 6.0.4.

3955445
lisp	smalltalk
oo and byte code compilation goes back to the 70s with smalltalk and i m sure someone will say lisp as early as the 50s 60s

3955506
uilabel	uibutton
create a xib file with a set of uibutton s for #s 1-9 a uilabel to show the currently entered number and a call button

3955541
rodbc	rjdbc
yes this is possible using eg mysql linked to r with the rmysql and dbi package or via the rodbc or rjdbc package

3955614
eiffel	ada
note that as well as c++ and objective c eiffel ada 9x vala and go are oo languages of varying vintage that are compiled straight to native code

3955616
capitalization	uppercase
well there are a number of ways to look at this if you want client-side capitalization then something like the jquery capitalizer would automatically convert text into uppercase during typing if hooked into say the keyup event

3955678
listbox	icollectionview
in the case of selection changed events it s better to use wpf built-in support for that create an icollectionview that wraps your collection bind it to an itemscontrol listbox etc. and the icollectionview will have its currentitem automatically synchronized to the current selection

3955692
int	chars
i know how to convert hexadecimals to int when i only have one hexadecimal chars

3955706
width	height
and the code after i switch to it totalwidth being the width of the parent viewheight half the height of the parent

3955727
equals	icomparable
note that if you implement icomparable you must override equals along with the

3955727
comparator	icomparer
but the correct answer is to implement icomparer instead of comparator if your objects are mutable and pass an instance of the icomparer to sorting functions when necessary

3955727
equals	gethashcode
furthermore it doesn t require or even suggest using equals gethashcode or - you re free to define it in any way you please

3955727
comparator	icomparer
in short use comparator for value types and icomparer for reference types

3955732
fgetc	strtok	fgets	strtok	fgets	fgetc
you re probably better off using fgets and strtok or writing a little loop around fgetc to do what you want

3955760
put	get
i can t figure out how to format the insert into sql string so it will get the data from mysite2.com and put it in mysite1.com

3955808
spaces	delimiter
because the wildcard gets replaced with spaces delimiter filenames you ll have to post-process argv after optionparser has run against it or programmatically glob the directory and build the list that way

3955839
debian	linux
i am familiar with debian linux mostly and originally found this post when i got started

3955884
width	height
using the function above you can test the height width of the uploaded image and resize if necessary

3955888
put	get
to get this rolling for the first time you ll want to put 0 in last_position.temp so there s no errors or hard feelings

3955890
stdout	fflush
when running gdb through a terminal stdout is line buffered which means that it will be fflush every time a newline is read resulting in the behavior i was expecting

3955890
stdout	fflush
eclipse cdt runs gdb with stdout in block buffered mode which means it will only fflush stdout when it reaches a certain size or if it is manually fflush

3955890
stdout	fflush
is so short the buffer for stdout will never be fflush unless a call to fflush is made

3955890
stdout	fflush
i managed to fix this problem by adding fflush stdout

3955937
width	height
i am not sure what you want exactly but by using the following settings you can make sure either the width or the height of the image is 228px

3955937
width	height
if width height width will be 228px

3955967
phpdoc	codesniffer
we currently use phpdoc to generate all of our documentation and have a strict php codesniffer standard that ensures documentation is complete and consistent

first of all anything you pass to printf except the first parameter undergoes default promotions which means among other things that chars and short are both promoted to int before being passed

3959702
int	chars
so even if what you were passing really did have type chars by the time it got to printf it would have type int

int	chars
in your case you re using a chars literal which already has type int anyway

second even without default promotions chars literals in c already have type int anyway â 6.4.4.4 10

3959702
int	chars
an int chars constant has type int

...what printf receives would be of type int not type chars anyway

versioning	upgrade
i would like to upgrade my eclipse setup from whatever versioning it is now to a versioning that supports all the above

3960188
int	chars
changesudo chars list list - int int chars - chars list list

3960212
wmv	flv
it can t find the duration of an mp4 file or f4v file avi wmv and flv has no problem

3960234
bazaar	git
just for the us too factor this is doable in mercurial as it is in bazaar and git

3960234
pull	push
don t shame them for having a branchy history -- good dvcs use involves a lot of pull merge push cycles

3960234
pull	push
if you make them use rebase or collapse to turn 30 changesets with 15 merges into one changeset per feature bug then they re incentivized to keep thing local until they re ready to pull merge push the whole thing at once

3960234
rss	feed
nothing draconian and silly like ranking developers by lines of code but something that can be noticed whether it s an aggregate rss feed from all the repo rss feed or a commits email alias that gets a quick x pushed changeset y into repo z message whenever someone pushes

3960255
put	get
in other words if you put in a char list list and a tuple you ll get out a char list list with the char at the given position replaced so it works exactly like you want

3960363
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
here is an answer to my own question i came up with today after playing with ie8 firefox google-chrome and safari

3960363
hide	show
could be an inline error message box that you want to show and hide nicely on the page

3960363
margin	height
you can t rely on them especially when margin padding border are set to something other than 0 and when the css height is something other than default when actually folding unfolding the element

3960394
vmware	virtualbox
for maemo you could start with the sdk virtual image to use in virtualbox or vmware

3960405
openfeint	scoreloop
scoreloop and openfeint the two i am currently considering for my own android game both offer android apis that make it fairly straight-forward for posting and retrieving high-scores in addition to other game-related features such as challenges and social network integration

3960455
cfstring	nsstring
it means that you re sending an objectatindex messages to an object of type nsstring or possibly cfstring

3960539
clang	llvm
clang llvm has a bug in the ios 4.1 sdk that causes compilation errors when targeting the simulator but not the device

3960540
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
viewwillappear and viewdidappear of the covered view controller always get called

3960554
put	get
the idea is simply that if you need say 5 numbers between 0 and 20 you can simply put 4 limits between 0 and 20 and you get a partition of the 0 20 interval

3960558
serializable	deserialization
classes that require special handling during the serializable and deserialization process must implement special methods with these exact signatures

3960558
superclass	subclassing
the method does not need to concern itself with the state belonging to its superclass or subclassing

3960573
min	max
i would like to have that block somewhere and provide it to the min max function

3960613
portrait	landscape
as a personal design decision - i would have two images and switch them as the rotation changes from portrait to landscape

3960626
cruisecontrol	teamcity
i work on a medium-sized rails team that just switched to teamcity from cruisecontrol and we love it

3960734
bazaar	svn
i actually prefer bzr-svn because instead it stores the bazaar revid in the remote svn revision using the svn revision properties feature instead which means no local revision rewrite

3960734
bazaar	svn
it also has the property desired that two independent pulls of the same svn branch will result in identical and interoperable bazaar branches

3960747
arpack	lapack
the most popular open source libraries for eigenvalue computation are lapack and eispack and arpack

3960775
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is the top-most image also appears underneath the background-color of the div beneath it in google-chrome firefox and ie

3960820
google-chrome	firefox
although firefox and google-chrome working fine it does not appear on ie

3960821
gridview	sqldatasource
if you are not binding your gridview to sqldatasource and you are setting its allowsorting to true you need to do sorting manually

3960832
elementtree	beautifulsoup
no need to install beautifulsoup python includes the elementtree parser in its standard library

3960847
ssl	https
https can be quite slow over a 3g connection as the overhead in terms of number of packets to setup an ssl connection is higher than a plain tcp connection.

3960882
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
which works fine in firefox its input into the table however in google-chrome and safari i get datatables warning json data from server failed to load or be parsed

3961353
post	get
how can i create http s post get request on server with tcpclient

3961373
put	get
that s a lot of questions i put in here i m not looking for a specific answer for every single point just wanted to get you thinking about the kind of information i am digging for

3961396
post	get
the get post etc

3961422
hide	show
i wanted that upon clicking on a button a certain field would hide and on clicking on another yes another one would hide too but of course it had to make the other show otherwise we would end up with nothing and the purpose was to present different fields depending on what the user clicked on a radio button so in a childish way i made my code and it worked

3961452
inherited	properties
i think this is because div#b is a child element so div#a - being the parent - will not inherited properties from div#b

3961468
versioning	upgrade
i am aware that i cannot actually distribute an app that is not compile with the latest versioning but i cannot upgrade my mac now for some driver compatibility issue

3961515
int	chars
the primary difference in the requirements now is that the source xml can include forms with all alpha chars in the form_name or all int

3961519
expression-blend	silverlight
i have a solution that needs to build silverlight projects on a computer that doesn t have standard editing tools like vs or expression-blend

3961525
onresume	onpause
one way for you to do what you re after would be to develop a bit of code that keeps track of when the first of your activities sees an onresume and when the last of them sees an onpause and uses those conditions to perform your tasks

3961600
client-side	server-side
server-side javascript doesn t have the restrictions on file access that client-side javascript has

i saw there is an ogg and a wmv video

3961666
mktime	strtotime
date strtotime mktime to get a timestamp

3961710
getter	setter
a property has a getter and a setter and looks something like this

3961710
put	get
strictly speaking you could put absolutely any block of code that returns a string in the get block and you can put anything at all in the set block including nothing though that s not a good idea

3961818
addition	multiplication	subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication
one example might be a simple list of numbers addition and subtraction are pairwise in haskell + zipwith + and multiplication by a real multiplies every item in the list by the same amount

3961830
nl2br	htmlspecialchars
if you use nl2br before htmlspecialchars you ll wind up encoding the tags as well

3961833
hide	show
now you show hide only if the value is 3 both the hiding and showing happens if the value of the .one is 3

3961835
put	get
that takes a lot of time longer then the service control manager is willing to put up with for a service to get started 30 seconds i think

3961860

3961885
min	max
if you have an array of duo object you can then use the min max and sort functions without having to define the comparison operator

3961887
innodb	myisam
as for mixing innodb myisam - mysql fully supports mixing matching table types in queries

3961887
innodb	myisam
you can select join update insert delete alter in any order you want just remember that doing anything to a myisam table within an innodb transaction will not make myisam magically transaction aware

3961887
innodb	myisam
the myisam portions will execute commit immediately and if you roll back the innodb side of things myisam will not roll back as well

3961902
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
you can put you code inside the method â tabbarcontroller didselectviewcontroller of the uitabbarcontroller delegate or maybe inside the uiviewcontroller s - viewwillappear animated method

3962220
folder	directory
to keep some system in your package directory structure i think it s recommendable to have your apps inside an apps folder within your project root while keeping other third party apps that you do not touch somewhere else on your pythonpath

3962235
folder	dir
there might probably be some reason for the freebase.rb file which is placed in the lib folder but what about the translation model which is in the same dir

3962243
hide	show
where i am having trouble is properly adding the show hide to the dom i think

3962243
hide	show
everything starts hidden and then when i click a name the variables for that name show up but the next click doesn t hide the values from the former

3962269
width	height
however if you remove the width and height parameters some browsers will open in a new tab if user preferences haven t overridden this behavior

rss	feed
need to add some logic in my java code to initially recognize the atom feed and convert it into rss feed

3962520
post	get
so i tried to recreate the same in vb.net but i don t think it s working as i post to the service and just get errors back

3962556
portrait	landscape
the problem i m having is that when the splitviewcontroller is first displayed it overwrites the current screen orientation it forces portrait mode even if i m holding the device in landscape

3962569
mamp	wamp
setup a local web server with mamp wamp xampp and just start building designing whatever kind of pages you want to

3962572
put	get
ug i put a bounty on this and didn t get any answers and a few hours after the bounty expired i figured out the answer

3962587
maven	pom.xml
from what i have read after adding the relevant maven repositories maven should automatically download the necessary jars to satisfy dependencies in the pom.xml file

3962615
pull	push
the buffer will store a boost shared_ptr to the accessor objects and generate a callback to there functions that will push or pull data to from the buffer

3962633
profiling	debugging
xdebug is a php extension for profiling interactive debugging and gathering code coverage information

3962645
webkit	gecko
on webkit it preserved the last dom state but on gecko and ie it does not

3962664
maven	m2e
these jars will be automatically used when you compile you project with maven or m2e

3962674
stdout	stderr
to capture a command s stderr and stdout together

3962674
stdout	stderr
to capture a command s stdout but discard its stderr

3962674
stdout	stderr
to capture a command s stderr but discard its stdout ordering is important here

3962674
stdout	stderr
to exchange a command s stdout and stderr in order to capture the stderr but leave its stdout to come out the old stderr

3962674
stdout	stderr
i know that 0 1 and 2 symbolize stdin stdout and stderr

3962714
m2e	pom.xml	maven	m2e	maven	pom.xml
your eclipse project has a valid pom.xml and all dependencies are available you should see errors on maven console in the problems or markers view or when opening pom.xml in m2e s pom.xml editor

3962714
maven	pom.xml
project configuration is in sync with pom.xml you can use maven update project configuration from the project popup menu

3962722
button	checkbox
i m looking to create a listview screen similar to the sound setting screen in the built in settings app see image below i.e i want some rows to have text + checkbox other rows to have text + pop up button some rows should have text only etc

3962761
division	modulo
the division and modulo should run in shorter and more consistent time than the loop on any machine that has hardware division which many do

3962761
next	except
another way to do this which is functionally similar to what you have would be to have the last step of processing each timer event be to queue up the next timer event note that no one else should send timer events except for the first one if this is the way you choose to implement the game

3962767
stdout	stderr
the ordering matters so it gets rid of the original stdout then it moves stderr to stdout

3962785
stdout	stderr
3 only stdout is normally caught by a basic redirect so the original stdout must be discarded and stderr must be send to stdout

3962788
floating-point	integer
first off you say that youâ re using an integer but the number is actually a floating-point number not an integer

3962788
floating-point	integer
because as i said youâ re trying to assign a floating-point number to an integer

3962800
stdout	stderr
reopen stdout to point to where stderr currently points

3962800
stdout	stderr
reopen stderr to point to where fd 3 currently points which is where stdout pointed before the previous step was completed

3962800
stdout	stderr
now stdout and stderr have been succesfully swapped

3962843
width	height
although if the height was different to the width of each tile which could happen you would need to calculate them individually

3962869
jlist	jtable
usually when i try to do something the jlist can t do i just switch to jtable without a second thought

3962871
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried different plugins and different browsers firefox opera and google-chrome

3962871

3962882
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
it works in all the major browsers - mozilla firefox 1.5+ opera 9+ safari and ie6+

3962936
strncmp	memcmp
if you were to write your own version of a string prefix comparing function essentially memcmp or strncmp then you would have separated the job of matching the length of the string from looking deeper into the string and probably would not have made such a mistake

3962956
arpack	lapack
it wraps several libraries such as lapack arpack and superlu and it gives you a nice python interface to work with

3962984
children	parent
a station entity the parent contains a collection of observations objects the children

3962984
children	parent
in this case i m not interested in the collection of children observations related to the parent stations being fully fetched before the collection of parent is returned

3963026
ada	algol
wikipedia also mentions ada and algol

3963033
folder	directory
then look for it in your current directory probably your bin folder

3963041
serializable	deserialization
in a couple of cases where an improperly serializable object wasn t really exceptional and to prevent exception overhead in c# for very common failures i would use boolean return values to signify whether a deserialization operation was successfull

3963047
nsurlconnection	nsoperation
hint look into nsurlconnection and nsoperation

3963087
int	double
in my application i have numerical double or int viewmodel properties that are bound to textboxes

3963112
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in proper browsers like google-chrome and firefox

3963114
spaces	delimiter
when we write code in c# and other languages we don t write code putting all custom properties in one property as a spaces delimiter string and end up having to parse that string every time we need to access or write to it

3963164
actionscript	mxml
remember that mxml is parsed to actionscript by mxmlc

3963176
width	height
this way you can have the inside div wrapping the elements it contains while not specifying any height value while the outer div invisible just with width keeps it centered

3963178
switching	screens
what i m trying to do is when tapped on certain place popviewcontrolleranimated no the actual view controller leaving the leaves view behind on top and trying to do the page turn without having to tap again on the screens and keeping things as if no switching ever happened

3963193
udp	mtu
to your example - the large messages are larger then normal ethernet mtu of 1500 minus eight bytes of udp header unless you are using jumbo frames and thus will be fragmented by the sender

3963212
ant	maven
it is simple to achieve with ant or maven build

3963215
children	parent
and even better even if you injected the parent root-flagged process the children wouldn t inherit that new environment until they naturally are shut down and the root parent forks a fresh child

3963218
inherited	properties
and if you have specific properties that you want to set before the usercontrol gets rendered then make them inherited a custom usercontrol class

3963226
implements	extends
these implements the list and set interfaces respectively but do not extends arraylist or hashset or any typical concrete collection

3963227
hide	show
you would just modify the column1 name to be whatever column you want to show hide and link the event to the proper checkbox es

3963230
int	double
if the condition is true input.equals q then it just does not nothing because instead of the int double it will use a string q to calculate the distance

3963236
width	height
- basically this returns height and width in one

3963236
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the javascript engine in ie 8 is not as fast a firefox 3.6+ safari or google-chrome

3963236
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
opera has made improvements to their scripting engine but still not as fast as firefox safari or google-chrome

3963260
inherited	properties
what this means is that if someone inherited from your class and overrides a method or properties that is accessed in your constructor - then the overriding implementation will be hit before the constructor for the inherited class has run

3963276
vsto	add-in
i m trying to create a word 2010 2007 vsto add-in and have run into a couple of questions

3963343
innodb	myisam	readonly	temporary
some engines can work with a readonly data directory myisam archive others may require a read write data directory innodb but that could be a temporary area or ramdisc

3963350
chown	chmod
i ve also chmod d and chown d the entire directory but no luck

3963376

i recently installed eclipse 3.6.1 and the m2e plugin to use with my existing maven build but im running into a lot of problems trying to get it working

3963439
maven	m2e
but for some reason eclipse or m2e is unable to tell maven the right settings

3963467
int	double
since we pass a simple pointer to int we can t use a double subscript in myfunc

3963491
folder	directory
when i run the service i get a directory listing in ie of the folder that the service is in

3963498
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
i have an nhibernate object that is a superclass let s call it super and a subclassing that inherited from it let s say it s called sub

profiling	debugging
after using the nhibernate profiling and debugging my code it looks like nhibernate is trying to instantiate an object whose type is the subclass

3963556
sequence	permutation
i am interested in some clojure code which will allow me to specify the transformations of x permutation rotations under which the value of a function f x is invariant so that i can efficiently generate a sequence of x s that satisfy r f x

3963578
pop-up	dialog
i ve created an htmlhelper that helps me show a jquery modal dialog i set a message in controller s tempdata and if the message is not null the helper writes an jquery + html code to make pop-up apears after postback

3963619
children	parent
however i think you can fake it if you have an object that is parent to all of the laser beams and java3d will let anchor a texture to the parent and let the children inherit it

3963638
sorting	filtering
jide software provides jide grids set of extensions for jtable like a tree-table cell-spanning sorting and filtering

3963653
google-chrome	firefox
it seems to work fine in ie 7 ie 8 firefox and google-chrome

3963754
getter	setter
i would say add the generate getter and setter plugin except i just did and it doesn t work for me

3963764
versioning	upgrade
apparently i should upgrade my clients to a newer versioning of access

3963774
post	get
if you can t get the above working can you post an example of what you re trying

3963783
opera	firefox
also is it currently supported on any of the alternative browsers for android like firefox or opera mini

3963788
pop-up	dialog
if the component that s opening a dialog isn t a user facing component and you re trying to strangle the pop-up in the ui then you need a bit of rework to ensure that the component notifies the ui of it s need for a file name and the ui can choose how to get it

3963803
mouseover	mouseenter
if you have an element that has an animation to move it around the mouseover and mouseenter events aren t fired unless the mouse is moved by the user

3963816
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
i can t seem to find exactly what i m looking for and svn bazaar and git are too complicated

3963824
post	get
ios wp7 wm6x android etc all support soap json etc because they allow you to execute standard http post and get requests which are required by most web services

3963832
width	height
now on another note you should not use px if you must use a numeric value for height or width use dip or dp it will adapt to diferent screens px will not

3963874
getter	setter
is the code more readable with getter and setter that emphasize the fact we are reading writing a property or with properties that at first sight can be confused with parameterless methods

3963877
hash	salt
i had been previously considering adding a per user row salt to my users password hash

practically both approaches will eventually do the same thing with the only difference that properties look much neater than getter setter

3963973
getter	setter
getter and setter are only there in java because it doesn t have properties

3963973
getter	setter
and then if you need a getter or a setter you can build it into the property but you don t have to litter the accessing code with a bunch of function calls

3963986
box-sizing	border-box
i reset the box-sizing style of div s to border-box

3963987
ssl	https
i am simply trying to ignore an unsigned ssl certificate and am i am directly following examples i found online of how to override two delegate methods of nsurlconnection as follows to allow my app to use an https connection to a server which has a self-signed certificate

3963990
wordpress	joomla
wordpress is also good but i have seen some people have a harder learning curve with it than with joomla

3964007
getter	setter
for pascal like programmers it s very clear if you re reading or writing a value so i think the code is more readable if you do not use getter and setter in the java-like way where you write getxxx or setxxx in every sentence of your program

3964007
getter	setter
for me and i assume for the majority of pascal programmers the code is more readable if you just put the name of the property you re reading writing and we all know a getter or setter method will be called if necessary

3964030
nl2br	htmlspecialchars
as i answered in your previous question encode your output with htmlspecialchars and then use nl2br to convert new lines to tags

3964147
serializable	deserialization
i m interested in finding a code generation tool that given a set of xsd files will generate a set of clos classes from xsd generate deserialization routines from xml to clos and generate the corresponding serializable routines

3964150
subtraction	addition
no addition or subtraction is involved so you needn t worry about leaving the representable range

3964156
scrollable	panels
i think the scrollable panels will help you out

3964174
min	max
this will return true if num is between min and max but is not equal to either of them

3964174
min	max	range	max	range	min
if you need it to include min and max in the range check use

3964225
winpcap	pcap.net
it s pcap.net - .net wrapper for winpcap

3964255
folder	directory

3964434
inherited	properties
becuase i can inherited the properties by using parent object id without marked parent object as abstract true

3964443
for-loop	loops
a for-loop can be done with two recursive rules one is the base case and it doesn t depends upon itself to keepon while the other does what you intend to do inside loops and follows itself

3964451
cldc	midp
another one the one this question is mostly about tries to use fileinputstream and datainputstream so that the very same data could be at least theoretically be read on midp 2.0 cldc 1.1 java configuration which doesn t have randomaccessfile

3964459

3964504
google-chrome	firefox
a lot of reasons for example the mobile browser every day more popular don t have the memory to spare as desktop browsers like firefox google-chrome and ie and they might not display toy content correctly

3964514
ubuntu	linux
the man page on ubuntu 10.04 had a great example of how to use getifaddrs and using it as a reference helped me figure out code that worked on both mac and linux

3964545
int	boolean
it appears to me that spring mvc cannot bind properties of primitive wrapper types int boolean etc

3964545
getter	setter
as soon as i changed the type of the assigned property getter setter and instance variable from boolean to boolean it worked fine

3964561
folder	dir
if you type dir you should see a list of files located within the folder one of which is hierarchyviewer.exe

3964603
getter	setter
you may need to fiddle around with your apis to subvert spring s helpful insistence that the getter and setter types parameter result types match

3964631

can inherited the properties by using

3964731
nsstring	nsdata

3964810
post	get
my problem however is that i can t think of the best way to map each action to its appropriate http method get post etc...

post	get
though the headers seem to me to be fine there is no response body to either a get post or anything else i can throw at this via jquery

3964888

i m guessing i could have a global mousedown keydown handler but i want it to work on any website

3964933
equals	gethashcode	equals	tostring	tostring	gethashcode	tostring	referenceequals	referenceequals	gethashcode
in the datatypes object which all other objects in the class library have been inherited from i have suppressed the equals referenceequals gethashcode tostring and gettype functions so these functions are not browsable in the visual studio editor

3964935
width	height
setting height and width is wrong.

3964951
serializable	deserialization
i watched a spring 3 presentation recently that said that beans such as userdao shown below are loaded by a proxy which doesn t serializable the bean but stores only the name and re-obtains the reference on deserialization

3965028
nunit	moq
i use nunit moq for the unit tests themselves

3965064
ati	nvidia

3965216
android-maven-plugin	proguard
you could also use proguard with the android-maven-plugin if you are building your app with maven

typedef	struct
if you really can t stand typing the struct keyword typedef struct foo foo

3965326
equals	gethashcode

3965692
button	checkbox
if the checkbox is not checked the link button will be in disabled mode

3965718
free	malloc
as an aside you should first call free on that memory before losing the pointer otherwise you l have a memory leak and this is assuming you have a good reason to use c-style malloc free instead of the more kosher c++ new delete

3965720
allocator	stl
you can even use the stl to handle your memory allocator for you

3965796
button	checkbox
checkbox being children of button you can just give your checkbox a background image with several states as described here under button style

min	max
xlim ylim or zlim to retrieve min and max value or

3965886

you can adjust the button s padding to add space around the text and you may want to place your buttons in a tablelayoutpanel or something to stop them from overlapping when they resize

3965895
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsitem
i want to draw a triangular object in qgraphicsview by using qgraphicsitem

3965896

i was looking at jquery s website and the ones i found are drag related meaning you have to click on the div and move it yourself

3966018
superclass	subclassing
if you are only ever likely to catch or discriminate in some other way the more general superclass exceptions then having lots of more specific subclassing exceptions doesn t achieve much

3966052
google-chrome	firefox
i can confirm this doesn t work in firefox 4 and google-chrome

i have looked around and there is no reference to such a mechanism but i thought i d ask just in case someone knew a handy trick by the way i m working in vhdl but i should be able to translate any verilog

3966577
inherited	properties
since you don t know exactly which properties will exist for a given derived class until the pertinent inherited takes effect but since you may also wish to have consistent methods that consume the above enums in your base or interface it s a perfectly-valid design to expect to be able to define that the enum will exist in the base interface but define exactly what members it has in a specific context in any derived classes

3966585
post	get
sometimes in html forms a post can contain multiple values for the same key that we get with self.request.get_all key

the big problem is a post could have multiple quotes and therefore multiple usernames so i need to get each name into an array and my regex skills are poor

3967257
textview	imageview
if you need to freely position imageview and textview you should use a relativelayout

3967377
union	distinct
my reasoning behind getting the colors this way is that i need to get various other distinct values from the same union select datasource so would just do one db call cache the results and then just used this cached datasource to retrieve all my distinct values

3967415
unsigned	short
testmethod cannot convert parameter 1 from char 5 to unsigned short

3967422
int	double
with the trivial situation that you have size 2 and store two int 1 2 you have an average of 1.5 so its reasonable to set the return type of your filter method to double

3967755
int	chars
no reason to include a decimal and parse it to an int if you are only taking one chars of the string anyway

3967776
int	chars
your code takes the last chars of a string that i presume is always a number and cast it to an int

3967787
openssl	crypto++
but i need to decrypt a string on openssl that was previously encrypted via crypto++

3968177
svg	vml
if all you want to do is draw shapes then you d be better off using either canvas svg or vml depending on exactly what you want to do and the browser support you need

3968177
svg	vml
svg and vml are vector graphic languages

3968177
svg	vml
they perform roughly the same task but vml is specific to internet explorer while most other browsers support svg

3968177
svg	vml
again you can work with these using javascript and the best way to do it in a cross-browser way is to use the raphael libraray which gives you an api to create your graphics and then translates it to vml or svg behind the scenes according to the browser

3968196
getter	setter
this property getter and setter also resides inside the managed .net wrapper

getter	setter
there is sooo much more to properties than they r just wrappers for the getter and setter methods

3968621
getter	setter
with the index keyword delphi will pass a constant value as an argument to the getter setter methods

3968621
post	get
there are still some topics to cover implementing interfaces stored values rtti design time properties etc but this post started to get a bit long.

3968703
google-chrome	firefox
this will require a modern browser supporting these apis for instance google-chrome ie9 firefox 4 etc...

3968722
post	get
i overload the get post methods and add an attribute to the one that receives the data

3968732
expression-blend	silverlight
for my point of view you get the really good tooling support and backend using silverlight vs2010 expression-blend c# compared to flash development

3968737
bndtools	maven-bundle-plugin	bnd	maven-bundle-plugin
use bnd for this automated by bndtools or maven-bundle-plugin

3968748
children	parent
thus you can do something like go up to the parent of your text node and get its contents that way then from that set of children you can find yourself and determine immediate neighbors etc

3968768
integer	fractions
if you want to perform fractions division you can convert from any integral type using fromintegral or frominteger to convert only from integer specifically

3968768
integer	fractions
and finally on the off chance that you actually wanted integer division instead of fractions division with rounding afterwards there s the div and quot functions depending on what truncation behavior you want

3968776
getter	setter	put	get
user should not be using getter to get stuff about the object and then put stuff back the object should know how to perform the action on itself this is why i hate getter setter as they break encapsulation

3968783
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
you can configure apache to act as a reverse proxy to your django application although a number of people seem to prefer using nginx or lighttpd for this scenario

3968792
apache	nginx
you need to configure apache or nginx or whatever to serve these and when you do so you ll be able to set up gzip compression there rather than in django

3968797
ceil	floor
ceil and floor allow you to round up and down respectively

3968805
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
everything works fine with firefox but while doing it in google-chrome or opera it always return false

3968820
mouseleave	mouseenter
since mouseenter and mouseleave are routedevents they are possibly handled by other elements

3968848
mouse	keyboard
for keyboard input and for mouse input using the scroll wheel however the change event doesn t fire until focus is lost

3968848
mouse	keyboard
i get around this by using the keyup event for keyboard changes and ignoring the mouse wheel problem but find my code is littered with a lot of stuff like this

3968874
awt	swing
all the code that involves swing or awt components classes should be run in the edt ie

3968887
versioning	upgrade
and there s no reason why you can t roll your own versioning of join that takes an if you feel that you need it and you re unable to upgrade to .net 4

3968896
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
and that div isn t show with opera and google-chrome but it s show with firefox

3968904
disk	ram
you may want to resize them to the size of your display area when you initially load them up so that you aren t using 2 gigs of ram or waiting to read off the disk depending on how you implement it

3968906
spaces	delimiter
however the principle is the same -- tokenize the line you read based on whatever delimiter you want spaces in your case then add each token to the columns of a row

3968936
superclass	subclassing
for what it s worth you don t actually need to cast a subclassing to a superclass reference second solution listed only the other way around

3968936
superclass	subclassing
when casting a superclass to a subclassing it s generally preferred verify its type with instanceof prior to the cast rather than making assumptions

3968943
superclass	subclassing
there is absolutely no need to upcast the returned value to superclass - a superclass reference can always point to a subclassing object

3968944
superclass	subclassing
anything you could do with the superclass reference you can do with the subclassing reference in almost all cases a parameter to an overloaded method is the only exception i know of

3968952
for-loop	loops
when i insert one more record to database the for-loop also loops extra one time

3968966
mbunit	nunit
in nunit mbunit you simply put the initalize cleanup methods with the respective attributes in the base class then inherit from it

3968971
cos	sin
a in sin and cos will be an angle in radians and you will probably want degrees here

3968986
post	get
and in the future when you post a question about something that doesn t work please include the exact information about what errors you get what the tool outputs etc

robotlegs	puremvc
instead of converting everything over to robotlegs i want to create a new module using robotlegs and plug it into the puremvc shell

3969109
robotlegs	puremvc
inititally i thought it was because my module needed a puremvc mediator to call the puremvc startupcommand to get things hooked up and then create the robotlegs context

3969114
multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	division	division	multiplication
multiplication and division are always accurate you lose at most one bit of precision in performing a multiplying or divide

3969136
for-loop	loops
i want to change the value of a variable within a for-loop but then have the new preserved variable changed when loops finishes

3969136
for-loop	loops
if it finds a match within loops i want it to change the variable to that so that s what s printed if it doesn t find a match in the for-loop i want it to print the empty_row a string defined earlier

textview	imageview
now if you really need to put a textview over an imageview and that really needs to be an imageview you can do it by putting the textview and the imageview together in a framelayout like this

3969321
sequence	permutation
as part of a bigger problem of enumerating a set i need to write an ocaml function choose which takes a list and outputs as the list of all possible sequence of size k made up of elements of that list without repeating sequence which can be obtained from each other by permutation

3969338
viewdidload	viewdidappear
the user needs to give the application permission to get the location and the pop up may not become available if you place the code in viewdidload i recommend placing the code in viewdidappear

google-chrome	firefox
update this works in firefox but does not work on google-chrome 6 still investigating

3969527
inherited	properties
try setting this value to the properties in the constructor of the inherited combobox too to the value you set with defaultvalue

3969534
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
appears that neither safari google-chrome or firefox do that

3969552
tpanel	tframe
there must be some difference between themes on a tpanel or tcustompanel neither worked and themes on a tframe

3969560
int	chars
you could use tcombobox.items.addobject instead of a separate lookup table but you d have to create a wrapper class to store a chars as a tobject or use chr to convert it to an int then cast it to tobject but a the above is simpler in my opinion

3969690
post	get
i ll post the answer to the link above after i get the results

3969695
google-chrome	firefox
also note that if is called multiple times on the same page perhaps as a result of button click or similar in ie 7 8 your data will not be updated because ie caches ajax requests by default google-chrome and firefox don t do that

3969769
post	get
php has an otherwise nice feature whenever it finds an input parameter get post cookie... with square brackets on its name it ll build an array from it

3969778
width	height
the problem is that the iframe takes the size of the parent of class note-content which takes the full size width 100 height 100 of its parent note1

3969786
perforce	svn
if you have the money ericgorr is right perforce is much nicer to work with then svn

3969787
minimum	max
i have a random amount of divs minimum 1 max of 10

3969826
post	get
however if you re sending the request as get instead of post then the limit will depend on the webbrowser and webserver used

3969826
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
as to the webbrowsers the practical limit is in firefox about 8kb in opera about 4kb and in ie and safari about 2kb

rsa	dsa
switch to an rsa key instead of a dsa key

3969840
portrait	landscape
my application uses the camera in preview and must work in landscape and in portrait starting from android 1.5

3969840
portrait	landscape
the only way to fix it on all phones consists in forcing the application to stay in landscape android screenorientation landscape in the androidmanifest.xml and to manage to apply a rotation of 90â to each displayed element so that the ui will be in portrait from the user point of view

3969855
versioning	upgrade
i am fairly certain that it is possible to have both versioning installed and it s not that 3.5 upgrade 3.1 even though it is obviously a newer versioning

rss	feed
the client will provide us with the locations names through the rss feed

3969873
cvs	svn
i am in the process of moving my team from tfs to git in the very near future but before i do so i want to know about any pitfalls that others may have experienced when moving a team from a centralized source control such as cvs svn tfs etc to a distributed source control system like git or mercurial

3969888
getter	setter
in fact you don t even need to be writing your own getter setter for primatives or objects but instead should be using declared properties

3969895
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
note that i changed this from a for in loops you should use a normal index for-loop when iterating over an arrays not enumerating cms has a great answer here explaining this in more detail

3969918
scatter	graphing
scatter is generally used to represent data where you can t use a line graphing where each x might have many different y values so you can t convert directly to an area graph--it would be meaningless

sure use a custom uiview or uiviewcontroller class and subviews all your views or view controllers from that

3970434
google-chrome	firefox
when i run the copied block from the console in google-chrome or firefox after the page loads it works fine

3970457
squash	branch
release is the branch into which i squash commits ready for publishing

3970457
squash	branch
i rebase these commits into the release branch squash them into logical feature-oriented commits -- often a single commit

3970457
pull	push
i never ever merge or rebase this branch into any other never push it or pull into it never merge anything in here

3970457
fast-forward	merge
note that when i merge the remote master into my master the merge should be a fast-forward

3970495
post	get
in a certain very simple request i get different behaviour for get and post which should not be the case

3970495
post	get
in essence nginx somewhere loses the response if i use post not so if i use get

3970555
post	get
as far as i know what get can do the same can be achieved by post

3970574
post	get
a post request isn t really bookmarkable like that which is why get is useful

3970574
post	get
get is for geting post is for posting

3970576
post	get
furthermore semantically post and get serve different purposes

3970576
post	get
these semantics have practical implications but they also have theoretical design implications that speak to the quality of your application s design an application that doesn t handle get differently from post probably has a great deal of security problems and workflow bugs

3970583
inherited	properties
a textblock does not actually inherited from control so it does not have properties that you would generally associate with a control

3970596
puts	gets
likewise we use http correctly gets posts puts deletes etc rather than dumbly posts only because these verbs offer an additional layer of abstraction and therefore convenience and conforming implementations

3970602
inherited	properties
i was able to correct this by adding an autocompletemode and autocompletesource properties to the inherited combobox but also had to add in a line to set the base dropdownstyle because of the order in which the designer sets the properties

3970610
put	get
the methods get head put and delete share this property

3970624
put	get	post	get	post	put
however if you wish to leverage http for the features and benefits that it provides beyond simple message transport then you should read the rfc and learn the rest of the http protocol including get put post delete and all of the headers cache management and result codes

3970657
pop-up	dialog
on running our application on xp machines with just 4.0 and msvc++ 2010 and 2008 an error dialog will pop-up with the message

for-loop	arrays
for this to happen i needed to create an arrays which i would fill in the for-loop above

3970745
filtering	grouping	sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping
if you ve written a slow linq query that filtering a large list into a small list or that does sorting and grouping it may be wise to call tolist on the result of the query in order to avoid enumerating multiple times which actually executes the query multiple times

3970754
public	protected
once you ve made sufficient progress you ll start to see that some utility methods you ve extracted belong in their own class in which case they d have to be public anyway while others can be made private protected and tested indirectly by testing methods that depend on them

3970787
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the website displays properly when viewed on every desktop browser i ve tried safari google-chrome firefox ie however on the iphone ipad there is a tiny gap space between the content div and header and footer

java.util.calendar	java.util.date
so in my jpa model object i changed all java.util.date into java.util.calendar

3970827
post	get
after the post to the server successfunc get s called and then afterrestore gets called

3970838
getter	setter
a property is a pair of methods - a getter and setter - that are used behind the scenes when the property is used or written to by other code

3970838
getter	setter
the advantage of a property over explicitly defining getter and setter methods is that you can use the property as if it were a field a simple publicly-visible member variable

3970838
accessor	properties
you can choose to define only one accessor making a read-only or write-only properties or you can define more limited visibility for one function or the other

3970838
getter	setter	public	protected
for instance you can make the getter public but the setter protected so everyone can examine the property s value but only the class s other members and derived types can set its value

3970838
getter	setter
if you didn t define the code bodies of the getter and setter the compiler would generate a basic implementation using a backing field

3970848
width	height
specifically if a canvas has an explicit height and width and is a child of a panel that has a scrollbar the scrollbar can hide a part of the canvas

3970867
short	base
the short answer is yes you can do exactly what you want -- create a base class with fields common to subclasses

3970892
post	get
if you want only specific share buttons or with default style justy type social_name share button and you will get the js to include on your site here are the 3 you mentioned in post

3970952
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the backviewtabbarviewcontroller nib has a uitabbarcontroller with a uinavigationcontroller for each tab

3970954
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
also you do want to think about the table implementation if you do decide to use inherited single table with null cols for the subtype attribs separate table or single table for superclass and separate tables for subclassing

3970965
mouse	keyboard
if full keyboard access can t navigate your app correctly then neither can anybody who can t use the mouse

3970971
multiplying	add
the basic laws of mathematics state that add multiplying ops are interchangeable etc

3971012
google-chrome	safari
while using safari and google-chrome on windows on my local machine on my django runserver some views were randomly not returning a response to ajax post requests

3971029
int	chars
the field is a chars 1 that contains either a y or n i d rather use a bool int 1 but i can t change that unfortunately

3971029
put	get
the query works if i manually put a y or n into the statement but when using bindparam i get the following error

3971029
bindparam	pdostatement
when using pdostatement bindparam an

3971046
allocator	stl
implement a custom stl allocator that does the reservations for memory upfront

3971173
vbscript	vba
since vba is pretty similar to vbscript and the code below uses file system and excel object model stuff that should be available to vbscript perhaps it will be useful to you

3971184
int	chars
re your query it s an attempt by the implementer to use less memory for their bitfields chars as opposed to unsigned int

3971212
getter	setter
i am working with several spring mvc web applications and i use the getter setter dependency injection and configure all my beans in my app-servlet.xml file

3971212
getter	setter
and in my class i would have the getter setter for this injected value

3971217
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
so in my jpa model object i changed all java.util.date into java.util.calendar

3971222
mef	caliburn	mef	prism	caliburn	prism
spend some time and understand either prism mef caliburn and use that create your application

3971222
mef	caliburn	mef	prism	caliburn	prism
with prism mef caliburn not only testing is easy and also your development will be truly modular

3971249
bmp	pcx
has anyone dealt with converting a bmp to pcx in the .net compact framework

3971249
bmp	pcx
i need to convert a signature from a bmp to a pcx to be printed on a zebra rw420 bluetooth printer

3971263
int	chars
chars bit fields work in the same way as int just the base type is 8-bit wide not 32-bit

3971311
filtering	grouping
i need to implement a feature that would allow users to filtering table data in excel like style dropdown menu in column headers with list of checkboxes or checkboxes grouping hierarchicaly

3971334
integer	unsigned
a bit-field is interpreted as a signed or unsigned integer type consisting of the specified number of bits

3971370
getter	setter
some getter and setter

a wide variety of web servers support webrick mongrel thin passenger etc

3971530
squash	merge	squash	branch
i work in a branch develop and when ready to merge with master use interactive rebase to squash all my little commits into one feature-encompassing commit which i gets applied on top of master

3971547
int	double
that loop is prone to problems use just a int value and compute the double value inside the loop

3971557
mouse	keyboard
your big problem arises from the fact that getkeystate is not supposed to return a value for mouse buttons only keyboard buttons

3971580
ienumerable	iqueryable
now consider what implementing ienumerable iqueryable or idisposable tells you about an object and that s without knowing anything about the implementation itself

3971603
min	max	range	max	range	min
i m trying to create a validation rule for a year range min 1970 and max current calendar year

migrate	upgrade
yesterday i migrate our ssis project from 2005 to 2008 and though the upgrade said it worked i cannot get it to read an excel file

3971623
tabcontrol	tabitem
in those tabs for which the datagrid only displays a few rows the tabcontrol tabitem only stretch to contain the usergrid leaving the statusbar visible at the bottom of the page

3971632
centos	linux
errno 13 might be due to selinux in case you are using a linux server distro for example redhat enterprise linux or centos

3971639
hide	show
then you can hide all the divs in your starting with a specified id and show only the one with clicked element s id + _div ending

3971665
filtering	grouping
or in a grouping sort filtering expression

3971678
viewmodel	caliburn
as i see it the only complication with more pages would be memory consumption since caliburn in its out-of-the-box behavior initializes all pages screens viewmodel and keeps them in memory

3971695
getter	setter
getter and setter methods are used in object-oriented programming to keep variables encapsulated and provide an interface to make those variable accessable by other classes

3971697
getter	setter
using getter setter methods will prevent the direct access to an instance variable

3971707
mouseover	mouseout
however due to what i would consider a bug in how .delegate works off mouseover mouseout which fires when entering a child i d steer clear it it for now and bind directly like this

3971714
getter	setter
the getter setter if done correctly allow you to access this data and change values creating data classes like this is useful when creating multiples so in your case if you just declared these variable within the main class it would be very hard and akward to created multiple dies this way though you can create multiple instances of die

3971753
getter	setter
it might become tedious because most of the time getter and setter will just get set the value without any checks or side effects

3971892
prepare	execute
unfortunately when i execute a mvn release prepare on my laptop to perform a release say 1.5 the two commits that occur changing 1.5-snapshot to 1.5 then 1.5 to 1.6-snapshot are pushed together into my git repo - and hudson obviously builds the most recent one ie 1.6-snapshot - and completely ignores the 1.5 release

3972001
portrait	landscape
without the first line which sets the status bar orientation the alert view appears in portrait even though the rest of the interface is in landscape left

3972023
stdout	stderr
when this program is run the stderr line is displayed before the stdout line

3972023
stdout	stderr
i thought dup2 would make stderr and stdout use the same file descriptor so there should be no problem with buffering

3972027
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have a uinavigationcontroller loading in the first tab of a uitabbarcontroller

3972084
next	document.write
document.write happens as soon as the code is encountered so on the next line after document.write the text has already been added into the document

3972120
stdout	stderr
the two streams stdout and stderr may be using the same file descriptor but before a file stream writes any data to its underlying file descriptor the data is stored in the stream s buffer

3972120
stdout	stderr
the buffers in stdout and stderr don t become the same just because the two streams are connected to the same file descriptor

3972132
min	max
if the lowest start number is relatively large compared to the maximum end number you could change the connect by subquery to generate the numbers from min startnumber to max endnumber rather than from 1 to max endnumber which should be more efficient

3972138
stdout	stderr
there is a difference between the s stdout and stderr and the file descriptors 1 and 2

3972138
stdout	fflush
you could call fflush stdout

3972138
stdout	stderr
in your example the stdout buffer was holding the string stdout while the stderr was being written to the screen

3972138
stdout	fflush
then upon exiting the program all of the open are fflush so stdout then got printed

3972161
google-chrome	safari
unlike google-chrome which provides a special api for events like window and tab changes you can still do it with safari extensions

3972171
do-while	break
like for while and do-while have a break statement jquerys .each supports the return false to break the loop

3972186
ssl	https
the biggest problem with modern cryptography is when people want to roll their own use ssl tls or https

in my case my image was grayed greyed out in firebug due to the image having its height and width to 0 px so effectively it was hidden on the screen

3972423
prepare	execute
i use pdo prepare execute close cursor etc

3972500
post	get
as far as i was concerned i was filtering my requests based on post or get attributes

3972542
post	get
from request you should be able to get post parameters

3972590
post	get
make a url connection to that url and create a get or post request that conforms to their api

3972597
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
it definitely works in ie6 google-chrome 8 firefox 4 and opera 11

3972599
int	double
you can have one column which is int and another which is double its much more common for an entire column to have the same data type rather than having the same data type for a whole row

3972615
prepare	pdostatement
as alan says the problem is probably that prepare is returning false rather than a pdostatement

3972672
printwriter	bufferedwriter
i ve tried using a bufferedwriter in front of the printwriter as well as changing the buffer size both for reading the file and for the bufferedwriter in various ways with no improvement

3972683
maven	pom.xml
as of maven 2.2.0 see mng-3401 goals invoked directly from the command line can be configured in the pom.xml separately from other plugin invocations using a special executionid called default-cli

3972697
width	height
width height

3972741
tweepy	python-twitter
i just switched from python-twitter to tweepy

3972754
accessor	ivar
it has a location ivar + accessor

3972805

use the eclipse wtp support and either the maven eclipse plugin or m2e to import your project as a dynamic project

3972999
width	margin
increase the width of the container by the width of the sidebar and add a right margin to the content block by the same amount

3973101
flask	web2py
web2py is not as freeform as flask there is a one right way to do things

3973104
put	get
if you put table columns in the select clause and the columns are not part of an index oracle will do the index lookup then get the row from the table which may be totally useless depending on the query

3973187
for-loop	arrays
now if you are concerened with performance i d recomend just using a normal for-loop as there is significant overhead incurred when calling functionas that will add up very quickly with larger arrays

3973204
getter	setter
i know i can generate setter and getter for fields in the eclipse source menu but i m very surprised it doesn t offer to replace the direct field accessors with calls to the newly created methods

3973233
uninstall	upgrade
i don t care about future upgrade uninstall

3973261
rss	feed
in addition to both providing a plethora of ui components - buttons treeviews grids even charts and rss feed viewers out-of-the-box - they also provide module systems to encapsulate and organize code

3973269
put	get
note this will put dtbcsv in the scope of the entire get block instead of just in your if statement

3973326
boost	stl
boost uses header-only libraries a lot because like the stl it s mostly built using class and function templates which are almost always header-only

3973329
getter	setter
the encapsulate field dialog-box will create getter setter for you if they don t exist and will change field-access to go through the getter setter

3973329
getter	setter
the dialog automatically detects existing getter setter so for the requirements that you had mentioned that would do the trick

3973331
explode	implode
between the explode and implode lines you should be mysql_real_escape_string -ing each of the values in

3973361
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
but i am running into issues that i think are related to the clientaccesspolicy.xml and crossdomain.xml files

3973373
implements	extends
you would need a more generalized interface without method2 and perhaps an extends interface which contains method to but which is not implements by b

3973392
width	height
say you have a max width x height of 250x200 facebook is optimizing the use of this

3973412
webrat	cucumber
a quick google search also brought up the following article on php testing with cucumber webrat and selenium which looks pretty useful

3973435

the fix was to ensure the case of the inherited properties was the same as the class it was referencing -- i didn t realize it was case sensitive

3973456
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
tested in firefox 3.6.10 google-chrome 6.0.472.63 safari 5.0.2

3973466
dictionary	map
map s are dictionary

dlsym	dlopen
dlopen dlsym dlclose are also close but will not work for -lmylib referenced libraries reference count never gets to 0

3973579
quicksort	mergesort
it would work better with a stable sort like a mergesort instead of .net s built-in quicksort but it provides you with readable multi-field ordering ability similar to sql as close as a method chain can get anyway

3973579
predicate	icomparable
you can extend this to accomodate members that aren t icomparable by defining overloads that take a comparison lambda instead of creating it based on a predicate

3973605
children	parent
you ll want to bg background and disown the process because nix uses a process tree such that if the parent of a process terminates all of its children terminate too unless the parent disown s the child

3973640
hide	show
this basically show if it s hidden and hide if it s not displayed

3973655
onreadystatechange	onload
looks like ie doesn t support onload but does support onreadystatechange

3973670
super	extends
3 use wildcards as you are trying but you ll run into the pecs restrictions i linked earlier you can add or remove elements but not both super vs extends

3973685
multiplying	add
this is where i m hitting a brick wall i need to multiplying the leftmost digit in the initial number by its initial base and then add the next digit to the right and then repeat until i hit the rightmost digit

3973685
multiplying	add
i m not sure how i would multiplying the first number and then add the next nor do i understand how to let the program know when to stop performing this operation

3973765
profiling	debugging
i assume to provide a better user experience and better response time in order to debugging your approval you need to log into your market profiling and change the test response option

3973790
multiplying	add
i need to multiplying the leftmost digit in the initial number by its innitial base and then add the next digit to the right and then repeat until i hit the rightmost digit

3973796
komodo	aptana
however i m going to check out aptana and komodo on the pc---they both look like they could be very good

3973801
width	height
all you need to know is the x y position of the object as well as its width and height

3973813
int	boolean
i think it s because there was no actual boolean type in those days or a separate logical not operator so to make the int not operator work with both true and false they used values 0 and -1

3973837
maven	pom.xml
so now im hacking away till something works with no hope of going back to yesterday when everthing worked without issues i created the project with maven used pom.xml files to do everything and eclipse went along

3973863
client-side	server-side
it allows for a more optimized server-side and client-side caching of the resources

3973876
textwrangler	bbedit
assuming bbedit is similar to textwrangler you could use the built in find dialogue

3973876
textwrangler	bbedit
this isn t a regex but since you said you re using bbedit which is made by bare bones and supposedly shares a lot with textwrangler it should work

3973956
degrafa	flex
degrafa supported flex 3 and fxg supported flex 4

3973983
xml-rpc	json-rpc
encode the binary data in base64 then use json-rpc or xml-rpc for transport

3974008
int	chars
your best bet is to represent it as an array of int representing each chars

3974016
put	get
i believe i should just have to put an xml file in the one war that needs to not read the jboss spring jars but i can t quite get it right

3974047
cos	sine
mike s note that there are two possible solutions for cos x made me realise that i would need to resolve the phase ambiguity of the sine wave

3974054
let	curry
there is a pair of functions in the prelude named curry and uncurry that let you convert between functions written in this style and functions that take two arguments directly as a pair

3974062
16-bit	64bit
if i use this version i get every second character of the string into my char aits d for macintosh hd . i am assuming that this is something to do with being on a 64bit platform and jna mapping the value to a 32-bit wchar_t but then chopping off the high 16-bit on each wchar_t on copying them back

3974103
required	placeholder
in practice this is going to save a lot of typing and cognitive load as we often only care about a few values in practice and the rest can be mere placeholder to get the database to shut up about missing required fields and so on

3974113
apache	nginx
a good approach here is to use streaming by a front-end web server through x send file addons see nginx xsendfile or apache mod_xsendfile and in rails you ll have an action such as

3974113
apache	nginx
and that sets an http header x-accel-redirect which gets sent to apache nginx from your app server which once you ve got the module s linkd to above installed whill tell the webserver to stream the file directly to the client but the url for them stays the same as a normal request to your app users id avatar or whatever because there s no redirect

3974136
button	checkbox
for select boxes checkbox and radio button the event is fired immediately when the user makes a selection with the mouse but for the other element types the event is deferred until the element loses focus

3974154
goto	break
it s not a huge deal but statements like continue break and return are all essentially goto statements that have been dressed up a little

3974168
int	chars
i m sure he is referring to operator overloading for types such as chars int float etc in iostream and the types themselves

3974244
mouseleave	mouseenter
.hover is the more efficient way of doing mouseenter mouseleave

3974262
stdout	stderr
with its own stdout and stderr

3974268
octal	decimal
the value in decimal is 1 583 054 206 in octal it s 013626676576

3974289
post	get
you didn t post the actual error message you get so i have to resort to reading your mind but you are also missing an import for multivaluedmap

3974313
client-side	server-side
you will have to do it twice once using javascript at the client-side and then using php at the server-side

3974340
mouseover	mousedown
also if you are looking for different images on mouseover and mousedown then using custombutton is a better option

3974347

where somedictionary contained a variety of objects like a nsstring photo and nsurl

3974392
postgresql	mysql
in postgresql you d use pg_dump but i don t know how in mysql

3974416
next	except
that solved it except now if there is blank tab next to each other a newline gets printed for both

printf	strlen
it probably made this mention explicitly because php is written in c and provides a lot of identically named wrappers for c functions strlen printf etc

3974469
vb.net	vb6
my company recently approved project to be written in c# so we have a lot of vb.net programmers however we have some legacy app developers as well that are in vb6

3974594
ienumerable	ienumerator
the ienumerable and ienumerator

3974625
vb.net	vb6
developers may be lulled into a false sense of familiarity with vb.net - treating resources like they did in vb6 without understanding the full concepts

3974642
post	get
just noticed the php tag i think a good way of doing api encapsulation is restricting access through post get web operations for web applications and validating input from such queries.

3974691
g++	gcc
caveat emptor i m still stuck using the outdated gcc g++ 3.4.4 4.0.1

3974691
inherited	subclassing
you might also get some mileage out of subclassing as copy constructors and operator are not inherited and new implicit versions are created

3974691
unsigned	short	int	double
between double long-double float and int short long etc and signed unsigned and etc

3974712
int	double
you can also do operations between int and floats double without the need of casting python already handles that for you

3974736
draggable	droppable	move	drag
my work flow is first i have some div_info elements which draggable and dynamic created with create button and then i create a droppable_div with droppable and sortable enabled and then i can drag and drop div_info inside droppable_div .and the div_info which inside droppable_div could move up and down .but i got an error in this code

int	chars
you can therefore store your unicode values as int egers and use an algorithm to transform those int to an utf-8 multibyte chars

3975764
inherited	properties
the constructor in the multi-interface class could create instances of each of the classes that are being inherited and link them to a private properties say _ext

3975764
inherited	properties
__get and __set could be used to locate internal properties or if your an expert with references you could make the properties of the child class and the inherited classes be references to the same data

3975769
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome and safari however using number inputs displays spin buttons at the right side of the field which looks like crap in my design

3975863
post	get
if you still get the same default error page you might find the solution in this post

3975867
accessor	properties
the error you are encountering means that the underlying class has not properly implemented the accessor for that properties belongsto so it would seem something went afoul in your initialization code

firefox	safari
in firefox it works as expected but in ie8 and safari the vertical alignment gets screwed up

firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it should work at least in ie 8 firefox 3.6 google-chrome 7 safari 5 and opera 10.63

3977712
nullpointerexception	illegalstateexception
if an exception occurs such as illegalstateexception which i throw or nullpointerexception then jboss keeps logging the exception and also keeps retrying to deliver the same message again spamming the logs then it sends the message to dlq and again calls onmessage which again fails.

3977758
bluetooth	usb
note that i m searching for a solution that works with the phone connected via usb not via bluetooth wi-fi

3977787
post	get
is it possible to ensure that get post requests to a particular url of my appengine app ajax or not can only be made from within the app and not from outside ie all requests from other domains have to be rejected

3977843
keydown	keyup
keyup and keydown give you information about the physical key that

3977860
implements	extends
in doing this a concrete implementation only needs to implements interfacea which seems like a good thing but it doesn t add any value by extends which seems wasteful

3977872
public	protected
solution make the method public or protected

3977881
implements	extends
both of these classes extends selectablechannel and also implements bytechannel and i wish to call methods from both

3977881
implements	extends
extends selectablechannel implements bytechannel bytechannel

3977898
ant	maven
i have just translated an ant project into maven however since maven does not really deal with deployment i introduce some antrun into the build

3977914
width	height
also note that your copy constructor is incomplete since the height and width members aren t being copied

3977938
client-side	server-side
at the very least all asp.net developers must understand the difference between client-side code javascript and server-side code c# and how the postback model works

3977992
many-to-one	one-to-many
so to give an example suppose there s a model author with a one-to-many relationship with books and a many-to-one relationship with publisher

3977996
getter	setter
in other words a field on a groovy class is a bean property by default you get the getter setter for free

3978021
vsto	add-in
when i try to compile my vsto outlook add-in i get this error

3978039
maven	pom.xml
so if you run the command mvn deploy when the maven lifecycle reaches the deploy phase it will run the plugin execution the second one in your pom.xml

3978054
jobs	cron
i am doing something similar too but i am steering clear of cron jobs

3978096
jstl	taglib
this project do not use a presentation framework and jstl seems to be the only taglib i could use

3978147
post	get
the request method is always post here so the switch comand ignores the get -part

3978158
post	get
post is meant for those times when you are changing some state on the server making a purchase you wouldn t want it to get accidentally executed twice

3978164
draggable	droppable
an item needs to be draggable so that you can drop it on your droppable area

3978257
keydown	keyup
keyup and keydown give you information about the physical key that was pressed

3978314
idictionary	ilist
one way i would propose is to have a generic method that would give you the value from a idictionary or ilist etc. and use this method to wrap around your expression s

3978323
equals	icomparable
if you want to check if one result is equals to the other you should implement icomparable on it and for each of its members do the same

3978331
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this wonâ t work in ie 8 and below not sure about 9 though nor in older versions of firefox safari google-chrome and opera

3978357
public	protected
since you essentially have to treat protected the same as public the answer would be no from a strictly object-oriented point of view

3978387
subtract	add
one callback would add 1 to the x and the other subtract

3978400
put	get
the thinking there is that you can put access objects in a library file still an mdb or mde file or any of the new access file types and then by just adding a reference to the file in your vbe project you get that functionality made available to you

3978412
versioning	upgrade
it might have been upgrade to a newer versioning

3978433
width	height
when you highlight text in a typical text editor the highlight will be the full height of the font and the width of each individual character

3978433
width	height
this highlight is made by getting the fontbbox height and each character s width from the widths array and transforming those values to match the current font s attributes size etc.

3978438
nfa	dfa
i am looking for a non-technical explanation of the difference between dfa vs nfa engines based on their capabilities and limitations

3978441
actionscript	mxml
how would convert the mxml to actionscript to override this

3978448
width	height
you explicitly define top right bottom and left which are relative to the screen instead of defining x y width and height

3978533
post	put
another solution can be to only allow post and also have some js logic or similar to block out spam bots but that s much more work than robots.txt so only put time into it if it becomes a problem

3978537
public	protected
and in working effectively with legacy code michael feathers discusses several such techniques pointing out that making things protected for testing can be better than making them public although it s not necessarily the best way to do things

3978537
public	protected
i think it depends what sort of code it is - if it s a public api where people are likely to take protected access to mean it s designed to be overridden it s probably a bad idea but on a typical business app where it s pretty obviously not meant to be overridden i don t think it s a problem

3978546
post	get
you shouldn t accept a get request for any action that modifies data voting editing a post etc.

3978552
public	protected
public overloaded non-virtuals call protected non-overloaded virtuals

3978552
put	get
if you forgot to put the using declaration in the derived class or to redefine the second overload you could get in trouble in the scenario below

3978648
dictionary	map
use a dictionary to map input to functions

3978650
jobs	cron
that s what i use to run cron jobs or just execute symfony stuff via cli

3978661
implements	extends
i have interface ia interface ib extends ia and class a implements ia

3978661
implements	extends
now i want to create an anonymous class which extends from a and implements ib

3978665
spaces	delimiter
if you have trouble with that because it s spaces delimiter you can use tr to replace spaces with newlines

3978756
floating-point	integer
the only thing i can think of is to store the floating-point value in a scaled integer

3978793
uiview	subviews
i have a custom uibutton added as subviews to a uiview subclass

3978835
put	get
i d like for the variable name to be default and just put example com 33 and then the php would get r 33

3978836
children	parent
the itemclick event will take of the children and the click will take care of the toplevel menubar items parent

3978875
hash	salt
when zend_form validates it needs to recreate the hash from session data then compare to what s submitted and if it s applying a different salt that would cause tokens to not match

3978887
post	get
the only way to get a postback when javascript is disabled is with a usercontrol which gets rendered to the client as an since that causes the browser to post the form

3978889
qpushbutton	qwidget
btw i tried something similar with regular qwidget subclasses instead of qpushbutton subclasses and there is no problem

3978952
udp	tcp
i know that udp would be much faster but it needs to be reliable at the same time hence i m looking for tcp

3978954
onclicklistener	ontouch
try impelementing ontouchlistener in your activity instead of onclicklistener and change onclick to ontouch

3979000
width	height
in good browsers i could wrap the iframe in a div with the quoted css style and set the height width of the iframe to 100

3979003
width	height
according to msdn in silverlight images are hit testable over their image media display areas basically their height and width

3979037
profiling	benchmarking
an alternative approach is to design first code from the design and then profiling benchmarking the resulting code to see which parts should be optimized

3979076
folder	directory
that s only true if we either force our developers to use or they re in the folder with the phpunit.xml so that phpunit pulls it out of the current working directory when it is executed

3979086
serializable	deserialization
my best guess right now is that something is happening to corrupt the data in binarycontent.content when during serializable or deserialization

3979126
hide	show
so i have a bit of script at the bottom of my page retainer current that is supposed to hide and show content based on what menu item the user selects in the maincontent area

3979127
min	max
the following attributes can be used in conjunction with the number attribute to specify number formatting decimals div max min mult and percentage

3979145
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
that works perfectly in firefox opera safari chrome.

3979170
getter	setter
i also haven t written dynamic getter setter much so my approach might be wrong

3979235
daemons	systemd
i m aware of authorization services and the possibility of creating a daemons which deals specifically with modifying privileged files what i m curious about is if either of my listed goals are even possible before diving too deep into another systemd

3979246
xpo	openaccess
if you are a part of an organization you might have some of the heavy duty and expensive orms like the telerik openaccess or devexpress xpo

3979268
folder	directory
and by looking at the examples in the syntax directory of the runtime folder

3979283
folder	directory
iis_iusr has read execute list folder contents and read rights to the directory where files are uploaded to

3979298
oncreate	ondestroy
embargadero qc#1767 tframe misses oncreate ondestroy onshow

3979300
nfa	dfa
while this book is generally considered the regex bible there appears some controversy as to whether the distinction made here between dfa and nfa is actually correct

3979310
int	double
its as simple as useing mysql_real_escape on strings and typecasting on digits int double

3979341
post	get
i remember seeing a blog post about how to fix the visual studio 2010 bug where the find dialog grows in width every time you bring it up but i didn t get around to following it and now i don t remember where i saw it

3979347
children	parent
after all the children of my parent are my siblings

3979349
children	parent
if you want to find .vote-count at any level under the parent and look for immediate children of them that are span.number do this instead

3979366
put	get
in order to get it to work i need to know which name the request parameter name would be and put a setter in my action called setemployee of an object type employee or it could be a map too

3979375
ant	maven
maven has support for ant builds and most libraries are in the central maven repository

3979377
put	get
i declared latitude and longitude but now i need the function of gps to put it inside a button i created get longitude and latitude values and save them

3979390
wicket	stripes
the workaround was to stripes the wicket namespaced tags from the page as outlined here

3979468
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
tested in ie firefox google-chrome safari

3979473
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome s web inspector allows inspection of that data yes

3979491
h.264	webm
encoding wise i think h.264 and webm is a wise choice

3979521
hex	binary
perhaps the following then your calculator can use arbitrary number base hex binary base 7

3979533
google-chrome	firefox
with ie js on or off the buttons post back with their respective submittype value however with google-chrome and firefox submittype is null when js is on it s fine when js is off

3979546
getter	setter
this is the equivalent of what in java would be a private member field variable with a public getter and setter method

3979546
getter	setter
remember that declaring a property in flex is like declaring a private class-level variable and public getter and setter

3979546
getter	setter
so you are giving customadvancedpanel a private array called states and public getter and setter to get set that array

3979546
getter	setter
these getter and setter will override the ones from advancedpanel

3979552
src	attr
attr src files originals 01.jpg

3979552
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
now this works perfectly in firefox safari and even ie but not in google-chrome when i use large images resolutions greater than 1900x1200

3979586
printf	atoi
think simple fsm . most printf implementations avoid buffering anything internally and even for numbers use the char by char conversion to decimal not even atoi

3979612
put	get
to get an idea of how an application behaves under load you need to put it under load on production-grade hardware in a reproducible way

3979612
profiling	benchmarking
you may want to look at tools like oprofile which is designed for profiling not benchmarking

3979625
sorting	filtering
i m trying to filtering my posts to only show the ones with that have a custom value for the field model while sorting the posts by another custom field called price.

3979629
ssl	https
i am trying to access a webservices over https i have the ssl certificates in place

3979646
inherited	properties
each class task that inherited the base could have its own properties that are unique to each class but at the same time share the same common base class properties

3979654
nfa	dfa
if we express combinations of states in an nfa as states themselves we ve got a dfa with a lot more states than the nfa but which does the same thing

3979687
portrait	landscape
one each for the landscape and portrait orientations

3979711
onkeyup	onkeydown
there aren t any page body form-level scripts that are listening for onkeydown onkeyup

3979729
ravendb	couchdb
i would recommend looking at ravendb redis mongodb couchdb for starters

3979744
google-chrome	firefox
opening this file in google-chrome or firefox displays an html button not in ie

3979805
versioning	upgrade
upgrade versioning

3979852
width	height
i am programatically building a listview that does fill_parent for width and wrap_content for height then centering it in its parent view

3979895
lxml	elementtree
note to keep the example simpler i ve used the development version of lxml in older versions there is no for etree.tostring only a c14n method on the elementtree that writes to a file-like object

3979974
put	get
when you put the main thread to sleep no events will get processed so you are truly throttling the multi-threading to one thread

3980014
public	protected
public default constructors in abstract classes are frowned upon by stylecop which is why i made the viewmodelbase one protected

3980046
dictionary	map
i ve been using object as a way to have a generic associative array map dictionary since as3 flex seems to be very limited in this regard

3980049
stdout	stderr
i can always get the stdout lines but sometimes not the stderr lines

3980075
folder	directory
you can put the code into the same directory ie folder as your code

3980126
width	height
your expected text including height width and the index text is placed in a capture group by the opening and closing parentheses

3980126
width	height
a named capture group that alternates between width and height to capture both

3980126
width	height
next we check the named group of type and check whether we are dealing with a width or a height

3980195
uiview	subviews
i have a viewcontroller which creates programmatically a certain number of uiview added as subviews

3980225
post	get
when you re making a web app you frequently need different things to happen at a given url for http post requests than happen for http get requests

3980226
getter	setter
creates the getter and setter methods for you presumably in an optimized way

3980237
put	get
if you want to get really crazy put use autodie

3980242
getter	setter
it simply tells the compiler to write the setter and getter for you using the attributes you ve specified in property

3980252
google-chrome	firefox
crap the previous developer had placed the beginform tags in invalid places start of form tag in the middle of a div end of form tag in an entirely seperate div and whilst vs didn t throw any errors it resulted in an invalid markup which caused firefox and google-chrome to ignore and not return the submit value

3980276
mouse	keyboard
the focus is used in a limited way by the ios and handicapped users who don t use a mouse but use a keyboard to navigate

3980286
put	get
i can t repro the behavior you ve described but i get close if i put a breakpoint on the writeline in release mode i doesn t even exist in that case

3980298
put	get
i get what is going on in the larger picture but i m lost on how to put it all together

3980302
accessor	properties
you do need to release the retained object before setting another object or nil in your properties var but this is done by the accessor if you like this

3980309
width	height
therefore it s width and height will be very small

3980322
public	protected
see this reference for the difference between private protected and public in c++

3980411
getter	setter
i used netbeans new web service client wizard to generate the source code for the resource classes that represent the entities when they get sent by the web service â these resources have the same fields as the entity classes getter and setter for those fields and certain annotations from javax.xml.bind.annotation xmlaccessortype xmltype xmlelement but they lack the other methods etc

3980430
swt	swing
swing and swt are nice libraries for creating desktop windows application

3980475
borderless	panel
it is also a neat and simple way of allowing users to move borderless forms by giving them a label of panel that looks like a caption

3980508
chunked	transfer-encoding
firefox was still being a brat though maybe it doesn t like the chunked encoding all shoutcast servers respond with a http 1.0 version response which hadn t defined transfer-encoding chunked yet

3980508
chunked	transfer-encoding
try sending a transfer-encoding identity response header with the ogg stream to disable chunked and firefox might work

3980554
ready	each
while these are not production ready they do include more fixes and html5 standard implementations with each release

3980580
boost	allocator
you might be able to get a boost by converting to c c++ and rewriting it to suit those platforms less oo stack allocator instead of heap etc but otherwise none of the other languages in general usage are close to java in speed

3980612
inherited	subclassing
in languages that allow subclassing without subtyping like the cz language the rule favor object composition over inherited is not as important as in languages like java or c#

3980616
google-chrome	firefox
using both bridged and nat mode i can successfully access this site using either google-chrome or firefox installed on the windows virtual machine through however ie6 just returns page not found

3980620
children	parent
the application creates math and reading quizzes and is marketed to parent of school-aged children

3980631
switching	screens
two switching between the screens or activities i am using the following code

3980634
firefox	safari
if that does not help use firebug in firefox or web inspector in safari to double check the headers in the response on your initial page hit

3980639
post	get
i get a build failure due to a post build event failure when building notepad++ in vs 2010

3980642
google-chrome	firefox
the problem which exists in both firefox and google-chrome is that i have a canvas with a solid background and a div with a solid background color image

3980643
openbsd	freebsd
the old nasty behavior can be seen in the bsd tools that are provided by default on freebsd and openbsd

3980649
folder	directory
i have made a file folder structure in the directory i am working on to help organize my sources

3980672
cloudant	couchdb

3980759
autodesk	3ds
see autodesk 3ds max help precision and drawing aids helpers standard helper objects grid helper in the user help

put	get
i need users to get authenficated before the can t see any of my .pdf but i don t know how and i can t put my pdf in my database

3980921
onkeydown	onfocus
you could play around with onkeydown events or onfocus and reset the scrol in javascript but that would be nonsense

3980940
zoo	xts
assuming your data.frame contains only numeric data this is one way to do it using zoo xts

3980947
public	protected	inherited	subclassing
since the current existing version of the code has child subclassing base via protected inherited the public functions in base become protected in child so worker can not access them via child object

3980992
public	protected
obviously flipping the method to public will make mocking available but protected feels like the more appropriate accessibility level

3980995
invokelater	invokeandwait
one way to do this is to alter your code to call via invokelater or invokeandwait

3981006
getter	setter
getter and setter belong to the sad

3981168
post	get
to create a wcf service that responds to http get or http post requests

versioning	upgrade
only to downgrade to the previous versioning and then upgrade again

3981328
post	get
thinking that the best thing to do in order to update the time in a ui textbox would be to create what i thought would be a simple thread to get the time and post it back to the ui control

3981369
mongodb	bson
mongodb uses bson i believe and i can t remember what the others use

3981402
cos	sin
i m also having issues with sin and tan however they are similarly written to cos which seems to have been done in many languages

3981445
hash	md5
if hash output is 128 bits md5 the complexity is 2 64 well within reach with current computing power

3981446
opensuse	linux
today i moved my code to linux system opensuse 64 bit

3981479

what i want to do is create a switch statement that accepts either google-chrome safari firefox msie etc that is pulled from a regular expression

3981598
actionscript	haxe
it is reasonable to begin with something familiar like haxe or actionscript since you already know javascript in order to learn about game development techniques and design patterns

3981630
serializable	deserialization
if you use the phoneapplicationservice.state serializable happens when you tombstone and deserialization when the application is re-activated though i m not sure if this is tied to the phoneapplicationservice.activated event or not

3981659
hash	md5
most basic hash it with md5 or sha1

3981659
hash	salt
you can salt the hash with extra data so if they are compromised it s value cannot be found try googling some simple hash words

3981666
g++	gcc
gprof is pretty standard for gnu built gcc g++ programs

3981694
crypt	salt
use crypt with some salt

3981701
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it seems to work fine in google-chrome safari firefox etc

3981714
hash	salt
one thing to make it a little more secure is to add a salt to the hash and run the hash function again

3981714
hash	salt
this makes it more difficult to generate a password hash maliciously since the salt value is handled server-side only

3981748
mouseleave	mouseenter
i would look at hoverintent instead of mouseenter and mouseleave

3981786
apache	nginx
and modified the nginx configuration to direct two sites to the same apache server

3981786
apache	nginx
as i had nginx in front of apache i did not need to change the http.conf configuration

3981804
lisp	scheme
when learning common lisp i used exercises from the structure and interpretation of computer programs which is in scheme

3981804
lisp	scheme
this meant i was exposed to the differences between scheme and common lisp early on

3981843
inherited	properties
the row properties is inherited from tcustomgrid via tdrawgrid and tcustomdrawgrid where it is defined as

3981905
cpu	processors
it seems apparent that each core of the gpu could allow for handling of a request rather than one main processors the system s cpu handling all requests

3981920
lisp	scheme
this may be useful a comparison of common lisp scheme clojure and emacs lisp

3981965
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
as jaroslav moravec said if you set the content-type in the header of the stream to application x-javascript it works in safari google-chrome and firefox

3981972
gentoo	linux
i used to run my gentoo linux with a per-process file limit of 250 with exceptions for programs that needed a lot more

3981985
awt	swing
if you are doing a desktop project with awt swing - you can java.awt.dimension although it is not an interface

3981990
setinterval	settimeout
i ve read that to get around this you can use either the settimeout or setinterval commands to essentially reset the counter that ie uses to determine if a script is long-running

3982131
post	get
this works for get post ajax any type of request

3982136
versioning	upgrade
or make sure the versioning of tomcat you are using with eclipse matches the server you are going to deploy on although it s probably easier to upgrade the tomcat versioning on the server than trying to setup eclipse with an older versioning

3982193
hex	binary
keep in mind that sha1 will return hex encoding of the binary value

3982214
hide	show
then you can use this to show and hide it

3982325
oursql	mysql-python
mysql-python or oursql and pyodbc both have the same interface db-api 2 only you don t have to deal with odbc s issues if you use the former

3982325
oursql	mysql-python
i strongly recommend you consider using mysql-python or oursql instead

3982363
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
as far as i know this is not expected behavior all other browsers google-chrome firefox safari tested work ok

3982471
postgresql	mysql
however given how drupal 6 handles its database abstraction this will require that the secondary database be the same type as the main drupal database eg either both are mysql or both are postgresql

3982493
pull	push
to resolve this i used locationmatch for both the pull and push

3982493
pull	push
this means you have to authenticate to pull and push

3982501

if you are not ready to upgrade to vs2010 then you ll need the 0.6.0 versioning as documented on the landing page

3982545
spaces	delimiter
paths are delimiter by whitespace so any paths with spaces in them need to be properly quoted

3982580
put	get
at any rate you should put only the access inside your try..except and call it outside since otherwise a keyerror caused within one of the field methods could get misunderstood

3982619
google-chrome	safari
you should see it in google-chrome and safari very soon it s already in the google-chrome dev channel but it s a bit buggy

3982619
opera	firefox
if your script is standalone and your customers use ie or new versions of firefox use this allows rendering to continue in parallel to script downloading for ie and the newest html5 browsers but causes pre-html5 browsers including all versions of opera to block

3982619
webkit	gecko
again this allows rendering to continue in parallel to script downloading in ie and html5-aware gecko webkit but older browsers and opera will suffer

3982619
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
if your audience includes many opera or old firefox safari users the following snippet will execute the script after parsing the document on most pre-html5 browsers ie webkit need to test old firefox while the newest html5-aware browsers start downloading immediately but won t block to execute the script because of the async attribute

3982679

3982789
autoresize	scrollbar
i ve set our settings to autoresize and implemented the correct fb js call to do the resizing of the height to avoid unwanted scrollbar but it doesn t seem to be working

3982807
width	height
more text should increase the size of a textview if the width height is set to wrap_content

3982821

i would have expected the hex numbers to match up to offsets in the binary

3982851
hide	show
sort function hide div#2 and show div#3

3982851
hide	show
initially as i was not able to see any divs being show hide i assumed that it was happening too fast for me to notice

3982851
hide	show
once this was done it was quite apparent that show and hide actions were being done at the very end

3982851
hide	show
then and only then was the browser able to hide show divs as i wanted

3982858
post	get
the closest you can get in c is using an inline function for each data type imaginable or a decently complex macro see previous macro issues and previous post

3982894
mouse	keyboard
it recommends using ctr cmd + 1 to use the keyboard this is much better than having to use the mouse but i m still looking for a just do the right thing most of the time automatic solution

3982908
folder	directory
the maximum number of directory entries in a fat32 folder is is 65.534

3982910
mouse	keyboard
you can poll the mouse and keyboard for their state without accessing the event queue

3982910
mouse	keyboard
you could use pygame.time to wait on a timer instead of waiting on the event queue and then pass control to the game objects which poll the mouse and keyboard as per above but you are still looping but bound by a timer instead of the event queue

3982916
folder	dir
now recursively remove the .svn folder from the problem dir and copy it back into the target location

3982981

3983048
put	get
am i right to say that the only way i can get to that file is by removing it from my android test project and put it in my actual android project or am i missing something that will let me load the file from my android test project

for example if i have 50 child div s inside divwiz i want to show 25 and hide the rest

3983196
getter	setter
i suppose that using getter and setter is a good idea for the sake of consistency you always know that you can call setfoo to alter the foo attribute without having to look up whether or not you can do it directly

3983196
getter	setter
personally i think having to use getter and setter is clumsy-looking

3983209
children	parent
parlanse offers explicit teams set of computational grains as an abstraction with exceptions propagating out of functions to the top of a computational grain java defines this to be undefined which is stupid to the team parent back to all the other team children as an asynchronous abort-exception catchable in a try clause allowing the other children to clean up

3983218
hide	show
or as your tabs need javascript to work you can hide them at start and show the first one when ready just don t forget your noscript tag

3983232
hide	show
all you need to do is have onclick handlers that show hide either firsthalf secondhalf or both

3983238
hide	show
if you need better performance wrap those packs of 25 div s into common parents and show hide those parents should be 25 times faster

3983353
webclient	httpwebrequest
some framework elements have this built in for you such as webclient vs httpwebrequest to save you the trouble of writing dispatcher code but using this can lead to ui performance degradation if you re doing a heavy amount of work because you have more code than you need executing on the ui thread

3983397
codeigniter	kohana
most of the sites i build run off kohana - a branch from codeigniter

3983397
codeigniter	kohana
i would say you could learn a lot from a framework like kohana - and even codeigniter - since both have decent security methods that are not hard to follow

i can obtain and parse shorter rss feed without a problem but it seems after a certain length it just refuses to gather all the data

3983619
rss	feed
i ve gone through a lot of rss readers in the android market and not seen any others cut the feed short so that makes me believe it s an issue in my code and not the device running out of memory

3983619
rss	feed
this is further evidenced by the fact that my code will easily read a 119kb xml file but will fail on the google rss feed which is only 32kb

3983626

versioning	upgrade
when i upgrade our solution and dependent projects to 4.0 i get the sys is not defined error which tells me it is not loading the correct versioning of the above files

3990916
move	drag
when you drag any window around does it render as a dotted outline or is the whole window re-drawn as you move it

3990939
put	get
i know that a good general rule of thumb is to remove the target dom element make the necessary changes and then put it back into the dom so you only get hit twice with the re-render but i wasn t sure if you only replace the inner text of an element if you incur the same hit

3990957
hash	md5
the passwords were hash using md5 into the database so the user table records looks more or less like this

3990957

lambda	first-class-functions
for instance the strategy pattern implementation seems to be more relevant and complex in languages that lack lambda first-class-functions compare the java vs

3991265
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to a higher versioning excel you are using excel 2003 or earlier

3991297
cpu	processors
this is especially true if dealing with multiple processors or even multiple cores as the cpu cache lines need to be invalidated after a thread writes in order for a separate thread to read a value

3991311
put	get
it makes sense because threada put a x lock on that row so that thread b can not get the x lock until thread a release the lock

3991323
mvp	presenter
ps some people claim of having success implementing a mvp model-view- presenter architecture above asp.net webforms

3991340
width	height
try setting the width height

3991366
r-tree	quadtree
a far better way to deal with indexing this space is to use a data structure like a quadtree or an r-tree

3991401
width	height
then the function will loop for every image and checks its width and height

3991401
width	height
if its width or height is larger than your max values then it will be resized by keeping the aspect ratio

3991420
ostream	istream
i have thought of writing some sort of termination sequence to the istream object which in this case is cin by creating an ostream object from istream rdbuf

3991424
gridview	linqdatasource
what i am trying to do unsuccessfully is to implement a gridview search using a linqdatasource wherein the search returns order results where any of the orderproduct.manufacturer columns contain a search query

3991434
width	height
i generally don t use linearlayouts without having either height or width set to 0 and using the weight attribute to make everything the same size

3991468
put	get
so i defined a persistent pojo on the server-side to get it put in the datastore via the persistencemanager as shown in the gwt rpc tuts

3991502

versioning	upgrade
just increment the versioning 1.1 or 1.01 doesn t matter and release it as an upgrade

3991587
google-chrome	firefox
this actually seems to work in firefox and google-chrome but not ie

3991607
keydown	keyup
keydown and keyup can be used similarly if keychar presents implementation issues

3991629
keydown	keyup
keypress is supposedly not very reliable you should try switching to keydown or keyup

3991631
firefox	safari
on mac firefox and safari everytyhing works fine on windows both ie and firefox put flash on top of my div

3991634

rss	feed
i am desperately looking for an online service for buffering rss feed items

3991651

3991651
rss	feed
i would like to have access to a buffered rss feed that would for example expose the latest 250 items

3991657
post	get
you will probably get better results if you post your question to peter s yahoo forum

3991661
filtering	grouping
i can add grouping one-by-one individually but i haven t found a filtering something like my grouping that would give me srs for all my grouping

3991691
rss	feed
and as a bonus it ll lessen the amount of http hits your site does if you re displaying to the user from db instead of on load from the rss feed site

3991770
oncreate	setcontentview
i got around this with setcontentview by pre-inflating the view in my oncreate method but the asynctask s onpreexecute still fails on progressdialog.show as it fails to find android s own progress_dialog.xml

this one is interesting - it works on google-chrome and other using webkit and safari

3991876
jquery	simplemodal
i just noticed a problem today within ie7 while using the jquery plugin simplemodal

3991894

3991909
post	get
where request.querystring is for the get request.form is for the form post variables

3991925
directx	gdi
directx is in general much faster than gdi due to the fact that it has full acceleration on most video cards

3991925
directx	gdi
gdi may have some acceleration on windows 7 and xp but not vista but directx is still the way to go

3991936
jar	manifest.mf
i tried opening the jar file with an archive opener and inside it are the main.class file and a meta-inf folder containing a file named manifest.mf

3991940
post	get
starting in mvc2 jsonresult also throws an exception if the user is making an http get request as opposed to say a post

3991941
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
it is faster than objectoutputstream and objectinputstream in most cases which use binary format

3991942
jquery	simplemodal
according to the simplemodal code.google page jquery 1.4.3 breaks simplemodal in ie7

3992128
width	height
now you can divide or multiply both width and height to scale

3992156
profiling	benchmarking
profiling before you benchmarking and only worry about these sorts of things when you ve run out of real problems to solve

3992162
children	parent
i can save the parent and it will automatically save the children objects but problem is when doing a select on the parent class

i noticed that if i leave only one ajax request the safari windows is doing it right but that its not what is happening to the safari mac and google-chrome windows

3992270
folder	directory
code below takes a directory and creates an array of folder names appearing under the directory

3992292

3992330
debian	linux
merging mp3 files in linux debian using php

3992331
minimum	max
since you are looking for the minimum double your initial comparison variable should start at the max

3992331
division	subtraction
removed the comparison by subtraction because you weren t using it later replaced it with the division

3992336
for-loop	arrays
i have an extjs grid and one of the column renderer function has a for-loop which goes through an arrays of numbers and compares them with the value for every cell for the column in consideration

3992336
for-loop	loops
so i was thinking since the renderer already loops for each row and now i have for-loop runner for each row

3992336
for-loop	arrays
the question is should just let it run or should i change the arrays and user string.match instead of for-loop

3992347
implements	extends
i have a custom swing component called navigationlink which extends jlabel and implements a key event listener like so

3992350
yslow	pagespeed
i don t really want to do multiple tags because pagespeed and yslow complain about so many stylesheets although i know it is actually more efficient than import

3992361
sorting	filtering
this way you will have more option when your sorting and filtering your data

3992370
perforce	svn
i m using perforce not svn but i think it works the same way with any version control plugin

3992384
win64	windows
on win64 if you run a 32-bit process windows will remap the c windows system32 directory to actually point to c windows syswow64

3992398
jobs	cron
so i am searching for a library like quartz in java just a small sweet library for executing cron like jobs

3992534
uiview	subviews
in each cell add a uiview be it a uitextview uiimageview or whatever in fact you can add plenty of additional subviews to it

3992539
getter	setter
i don t really have a solid understanding of setter and getter for objective-c

3992604
keyevent	keyrelease
you could try checking the source of the keyevent in the keyrelease method by calling getsource

3992632
xslt	xquery
both xslt 1.0 or 2.0 and xquery have these features

3992640
firefox	safari
looks like firefox and safari don t wait longer

3992694
crypt	salt
but crypt effectively does the same thing as hashing 1 way it just saves the salt with the output

3992704
post	get
i am using indy v10 components to do the get post operations so i am wondering if there is a way to do this using them and being able to do a callback and not use the pin authentication method

3992707
accessor	properties
i know that automatic properties must define a get and set accessor method i also know that it is possible for either of these accessor to be made invisible by means of an access modifier

3992707
accessor	properties
if the compiler can generate that is there a reason that it can t omit the set accessor function based on the presence or lack thereof of a setter in the properties declaration

3992714
post	get
also i ve been rtfm ing all day and looking at various blogs post stackoverflow questions etc and i still don t get it i obviously need it spelled out step by step for my situation

3992749
accessor	properties
leaving one of the accessor out would mean that the properties would either be read-only or write-only even within the constructor of the class struct

3992797
getter	setter
i have a boolean field called showlabels in a bean class and i want to provide getter and setter methods for it

3992835

3992915
fadein	fadeout
i ve got some hover effects on the thumbnails and onclick they fadeout the larger image swap src load then fadein again

3992996
move	drag
because paste seems to be more a kind of drag drop move operation not a clipboard one even if the shellapi specifies that it s a bit the same...they are using special structures not used anywhere else.

3992997
inline	inlining
gcc for example can disable inlining completely -o0 or it can inline anything that it deems worth inlining like -o3

3993068
strncmp	strcmp
as tom mention s you should be using strcmp or strncmp with strings

3993101
folder	directory
as i m sure you ve become accustomed to by default asp.net mvc is very much dependent on directory structure controllers need to be in controllers folder views in views etc. this is just more of the same

3993134
put	get
put it all together and we get

3993150
versioning	upgrade
but it should be easy for you to talk most of your potential customers into wanting to buy the plugin from you instead of using a forked versioning - you can offer benefits such as support upgrade etc etc which probably won t be available for a cracked versioning

3993157
int	double
another thing to note your functions are declared to return double but they declare scanf and return int

3993157
int	double
its not a huge problem as the int will get automatically changed into double

3993163
for-loop	arrays
the arrays is used in a for-loop as

3993164
width	height
for each sale we need to capture the customer s choice of width height colours and a bunch of other technical stuff

3993168
range	minimum
alternatively you can use the nextint method which takes as input a cap exclusive in the range on the size and then offset to account for it returning 0 the inclusive minimum

3993172
getter	setter
within these properties i use the factory to get a convertor and convert the utc value each way in the getter and setter

3993184
google-chrome	firefox
the above code is not working in ie its working fine in firefox and google-chrome may i know what is the problem or any alternative

3993376
ubuntu	linux
i have a ubuntu linux server running with rackspace cloud

3993393
implements	extends
for this i am extends the default datagriddragdroptarget and i need to override and implements the following method

3993401
postgresql	mysql
it supports oracle sql server sybase mysql postgresql and others

3993435
versioning	upgrade
so it looks like your only options are 1 upgrade to 10.6 or 2 custom compile a versioning of gcc

3993444
gridview	repeater
update this has been solved here itemcommand not firing on first click in repeater or gridview

3993502
post	get
i could i suppose parse the raw get string from getquerystring or parse the raw post string from getinputstream but instead i think i will add another hidden parameter and then use getparametervalues string to get its order

3993545
getter	setter
this has been fine but i find myself writing numerous setter and getter that only get used on init

3993685
gif	png
images in jpg gif and png provider image

3993707
strcpy	strncpy
for that use only functions that check boundaries like strncpy instead of strcpy

3993709
post	get
i don t know if maybe this is too simple but i can t get it right and can t seem to find the right answer on other post

3993732
post	get
i am using http get and post methods for http connection

3993821
hide	show
pure css might be an option but i think i d handle the show hide with jquery so that i could have total access over each element

3993821
hide	show
this way i could potentially conditionally show hide elements based on login session etc

3993839
fast-forward	merge
my guess with #2 is that the pull request there actually was a fast-forward and thus no merge commit was necessary whereas #1 and #3 were not fast-forward even if they did merge without conflicts they weren t direct descendants of the your head

3993839
fast-forward	merge
if you want a slightly more length explanation of the differences between fast-forward and merge here s someone else s words

3993907
integer	unsigned
1 a valid array index is any unsigned 32-bit integer in the range of 0 to 2 32 -1

3993915

a simple use case to get queries executed from source db in batch executor enrich in batch and put into another db executor you would want to execute queries only as fast as they are being put into another db

3993919
division	modulo
if you re looking for another solution that doesn t involve float division here s one that uses the modulo

3993932
snmp	mib
one requirement is that snmp support must be comformable with alarm mib rfc 3877

3993932
snmp	mib
another requirement is snmp support must be comformable with alarm reporting control mib rfc 3878

3993938
width	height
set the textfield width height

3993958
hash	md5
the common approach for passwords is to hash them with something like md5 and then store the hash

3993967
hash	md5
md5 is a one-way cryptographic hash though its use is not recommended because it is cryptographically weak

3993967
hash	salt
for your needs you probably want to store the hash of the password better with salt probably using sha-256 or better

3993972
hash	md5
md5 is a hash function which means it is one-way and cannot be decrypted

3993977
filtering	grouping
not directly you can create a second list that maps users to grouping use me filtering on that list and use connection to filtering the sr list using this list you will still need to click on each grouping name to change the filtering to that list

3993988
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox but not working in google-chrome

3993991
ubuntu	linux
if you are on linux say ubuntu then it is probably because you did not run

3993992
int	double
you may work with int instead of int double instead of double etc

3993995
int	double
the examples you gave int array double these are all primitives and there are no sub-types of them

3994007
setinterval	settimeout
first of all you should use the settimeout instead of setinterval in my opinion

3994019
hash	md5
best practice is to store the password hash using md5 as you are now or even better sha256

3994058
punctuation	words
you can strip off punctuation from your phrase then do split on it so that all words are individual

3994060
put	get
i want to use below lines to get the current domain name but i dont know where will i put it

3994063
rdiscount	coderay
i am converting the markdown to html with rdiscount then parsing the html code blocks with coderay to add syntax highlighting

i think your specific question concerns the java primitive wrapper classes which are classes that represent the primitive types int double boolean byte and so on as classes

3994126
min	max
backgrounddetect filename sil min max analysistime

3994126
min	max
during the playback of the file audio is monitored in the receive direction and if a period of non-silence which is greater than min ms yet less than max ms is followed by silence for at least sil ms which occurs during the first analysistime ms then the audio playback is aborted and processing jumps to the talk extension if available

3994137
int	double
there are primitive types such as int double float etc

3994147
webclient	httpwebrequest

3994165
solaris	aix
i also see solaris as a supported guest os but i don t see aix

uitableview	uipickerview
but i would just use nssets nsarrays to populate uitableview and uipickerview

3994197
uipickerviewdelegate	uipickerviewdatasource
meanwhile i would subclass uiviewcontroller for your view that shows worked objects and job objects - and have that class implement uitableviewdelegate uitableviewdatasource uipickerviewdelegate and uipickerviewdatasource

3994207
gdi	direct2d
microsoft has a page comparing gdi vs direct2d hardware acceleration

3994207
bitblt	gdi
gdi always has been an accelerated api of course it was always left up to the actual gdi driver implementation to decide which bits of the gdi ddi to actually accelerate so its usually been the bitblt stretch blit operations that have been accelerated and all the line drawing and other effects are done by cpu

3994217
rss	feed
i used threads to collect update some rss feed into my database for a website i was hosting with godaddy

3994235
int	chars
it s common for chars to be 1-byte aligned short to be 2-byte aligned and 4-byte types int float and pointers on 32-bit systems to be 4-byte aligned

3994244
stateless	stateful
while searching i could only find stateful and stateless webservices

3994280
pull	push
this isn t cvs conflict resolution isn t terrible - git will auto-resolve 95 of conflicts for you without you having to do a thing so whether you git pull before or after you make your changes doesn t really matter - you just need to pull before you push and you ll be fine

3994280
pull	push
just tell your developers if your push is rejected as being non-fast-forward do a git pull then try pushing again and everything will work

3994287
stateless	stateful
in general stateless describes any process that does not have a memory of past events and stateful describes any process that does have such a memory and uses it to make decisions.

3994321
width	height
i m tracing javascript code and see that width and height of this element are returned as 0

3994321
firefox	safari

vbscript	vba
that done both dll and exe rtd servers work with excel and vba and vbscript and c# clients

3994702

another possibility is to use the get verb instead of post which will automatically append it to the query string but in this case you should use a different action name because you cannot have two actions with the same name and same verb

3994719
int	double
casting from double float int to long should preserve the sign if not the actual value.

3994736

3994786
rspec	capybara
after installing cucumber with capybara for some reason rspec also switched to using it

profiling	debugging
you could switch the profiling much easier by setting different profiling for different build modes debugging distribution whatever

3994873
maven	cargo
build the web app in our case an ear and deploy it we are using the jboss maven plugin but it could be cargo or others in your case

also take a look at the likes of glfw or sdl for windowing os event management and input handling

3994984
glfw	sdl
i ve used sdl for a multi-platform port of tetris but have since switched to glfw for a version of asteroids i m writing

3995047
folder	directory
find all the folder in the directory fss fin

3995047
folder	directory
move the folder in another directory fs fi which is located on the server s11003232sz.net

3995047
folder	directory
on user requests it should untar the folder and move them back to the orignal directory fss fin

3995068
inherited	properties
a few more memory is needed inherited properties and some default values like the class type and the vmt

3995117
equals	compareto
use the compareto or equals method of one of your strings passing the other string as argument

3995141
ubuntu	debian
on a debian ubuntu system you must install the postgresql-contrib-8.4 package then the file will be under usr share postgresql 8.4 contrib _int.sql version numbers may be different

google-chrome	firefox
i must note that this issue does not occur in firefox google-chrome and all images render correctly

3995611
getter	setter
i want to store the values at a single place using data structure.presently i am using setter and getter methods for retrieving values which is making my code large

3995638
hash	md5
you could create an extra field which would be the hash of a url md5 and make that hash field unique

3995641
instances	transient
if i make viewmodel transient then i can easily end up in a situation of having several different instances when i actually expect same instances injected

3995651
hide	show
i want to make a div clickable to show hide children divs

3995674
getter	setter
getter and setter on an object have the advantage of type safety

3995674
getter	setter
so although it might make your code long getter and setter are good

3995674
getter	setter
this is more general - you can insert whatever key you like - and is less code however it doesn t give you the static analysis benefits of getter and setter

3995674
getter	setter
there would also be performance differences between using getter setter and a map however i imagine in 99 of applications they would be irrelevant so it s not worth pointing out here

3995681
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox opera google-chrome but ie reports object doesn t support this property or method when i try launch fadein

3995717
inherited	properties
now the inherited form has access to the control you ll have no trouble overriding properties and assigning an event handler from the designer

3995735
getter	setter
for example getter and setter omitted for brevity

3995752
viewdidload	viewdidappear
another way is to perform the loading in viewdidappear which gets invoked when the view is displayed while viewdidload gets invoked when the view got loaded from the nib file

3995780
public	protected
so communication between the public space and the protected one is permitted only through particular channels with particular requests to particular ips and protocols

3995786
x86	64bit
i have developed a 32-bit application build for x86 which will later be deployed on a 64bit machine

3995792
profiling	benchmarking
as for benchmarking well you can always use even phpmyadmin to see how much time are takign certain queries and or use a build in application benchmakring profiling tool even created from you php code to bench the performance

3995827
width	height
i understand that if i pass 0 to width height and bits when calling sdl_setvideomode that sdl takes the current modes values however these seem to be wrong in my case

3995827
width	height
when i specify width and height with sdl_setvideomode i get an error

3995841
folder	directory
the project-template folder under the resources directory contains a valid project

3995871
jsf	seam
here is the solution - use richfaces progressbar call the seam asynchronous method to run long-process and pass the progressbean with parameters to async-method it should be accessible from yuor conversation bean which you use in jsf and periodically update progress-status in long-running task

3995912
google-chrome	firefox
this javascript works fine in google-chrome and firefox but not in ie8

3995942
boost	stl
i m aware that the stl and boost libraries already provide support from many fp concepts--this may well be a more practical approach

3995982
width	height
you can set minimumsize to current size and maximumsize to well maximum size with height equal as in minimumsize and width 800 or some other really big number

3996038
post	get
would i have to start looking at ajax or jquery or can it be done using the built in get and post techniques

3996100
getter	setter
for example activerecord uses method_missing to define getter and setter methods that correspond to data base columns

3996104
width	height
to get it work you also have to set the height or width depending on your orientation to 0px

3996155
uialertview	uiapplication
uialertview uses uiapplication s statusbarorientation property to choose alert s orientation

3996155
uiviewcontroller	uiwindow	uiapplication	uiwindow
if you start portrait which is consistent with uiwindow s default orientation and use shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation and let uiviewcontroller to handle rotation it changes uiapplication s statusbarorientation on each device orientation change

3996158
globalization	localization
they are mainly used for managing resources for multiple regions support globalization and localization for asp.net apps but you can also use it for managing text resources

3996191
switching	screens
my problem is that i don t know what is write in the switching case s to make the screens display the next last item in the list

3996251
post	get
you would have 2 actions for your view a get and a post your search form should be a simple viewmodel with the fields you d search sort on that also includes your pagination

3996262
inherited	properties
you could create two classes that inherited from a base class defining all properties except the primary key then each of these two classes would define their primary key as assigned or generated

3996302
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
i might also suggest mercurial or git or bazaar rather than svn

3996337
jquery	anythingslider
it gives me an error jquery #portfolioslide .data anythingslider is null

3996397
serializable	deserialization
having never used the json serializable but having a slight clue about how wcf does its deserialization i would say you can t have stringbuilder as a parameter

3996397
serializable	deserialization
wcf wants to do the serializable and deserialization itself so let it

3996449
ubuntu	debian
i am working with ubuntu 10.04 monodevelop 2.2.1 mono version 2.4.4 debian 2.4.4 svn151842-1ubuntu4 nlog nlog2.mono2-beta1

3996531
for-loop	loops
i m trying to insert multiple data using a query i ve tried the implode function the while loops for-loop but still can t be done

3996561
backgrounding	multitasking
if you do not want to add multitasking running in backgrounding just add it

3996740
hide	show
you can check the .length and use .toggle to show hide based on how many are checked like this should work

3996779
division	subtraction
btw i tried to replace division with subtraction with - and in that case the column relative_duration is not 0

3996802
ant	maven
i m new to maven coming from the ant world

3996806
getter	setter
but a property indicates that you are getting or setting properties member variables of an object and that these getter setter are not time consuming function that f.e

3996850
width	height
so now i want to measure the surfaceview canva s width and height so that i can launch the images in proper proportion rather than hard coded values

3996850
width	height
but i am unable to retrieve the height and width so please help me

3996885
put	get
so the solution would be to get the p id when the p is persisted and then to put it manually in the personid column

3996959
put	get
put the parent-objects into an array or list then get related data through navigation properties

3997004
mouse	keyboard
after you click record it keeps track of all mouse and maybe eventually keyboard activity

3997020
udp	tcp
i wrote a program that creates a tcp and udp socket in c and starts both servers up

3997020
udp	tcp
the goal of the application is to monitor requests over the tcp socket as to what udp packets to send it monitor for something like 0x01 0x02 and if i see it then have the udp server parse the payload and forward it over to the tcp server for processing

3997020
pthreads	fork
i looked into pthreads with semaphores and or mutex not sure all the socket operations are thread safe though and if this is the right way to approach it as well as fork pipe

3997020
udp	tcp
forking the udp server off as a child process seems easy enough but i don t see exactly how i would be passing the kind of data i need among both servers need request data from tcp and payload data from the udp

3997021
multiplying	add
when you press a digit button multiplying this value by 10 and add the value of the button to it

background-color	transparency
as soon as i change the background-color to anything else besides transparency it works 100

3997127
pop-up	dialog
and when i click close on the dialog inkscape pop-up with a new blank document

3997181
google-chrome	firefox
however today i noticed that facebook no longer have this # if you use a modern browser - like google-chrome or firefox

3997181
google-chrome	firefox
judging from the coverage in google-chrome 8 dev and firefox 4 beta i wonder that could be related to html5-era apis but the code in facebook is not of my capacity to debug to find out what they did

3997197
std	ostream
std ostream is a typedef

3997234
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
â viewwillappear â viewdidappear â viewwilldisappear â viewdiddisappear

3997246
put	get
you could put the necessary locks on your side but there is pretty much nothing you could do to get the internal plumbing of the control to do the same

3997264
inherited	properties
that view inherited from my buisness object with properties login password email etc

3997280
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
then it loops through arrays parsing its content and pushing values to another arrays and finally printing them to file in another for-loop

3997295
children	parent
then for every node it should have the number of children its parent has minus the left-to-right ordering among its immediate siblings ie not looking at its parent s siblings children

3997300
config	ini
you can create an ini config file for your project and the parse it using php parse_ini_file function

3997306
children	parent
i have tried removing the videoplayerview control from its current parent clearing the mainpage.layoutroot s children collection and adding the videoplayerview to the mainpage s layoutroot - but for some reason the videoplayerview only showed in the top 1 4 of the screen

3997318
folder	directory
each installation directory will have a library folder

3997391
viewdidload	viewwillappear
the uiviewcontroller lifecycle methods viewdidload viewwillappear etc

3997452
mp3	ogg
mp3 and ogg files there is no reason

3997452
mp3	ogg
from mp3 to ogg there are several

3997452
flac	speex
as flac and speex

3997452
mp3	ogg
i imagine it s theoretically possible to embed mp3 in ogg though i m not sure why anyone would want to

3997452
mp3	ogg
all that said if you still want to convert from mp3 to ogg vorbis you could a try the freshmeat link above b look at the other answers or c look at ffmpeg

3997456
hide	show
alternatively all you are really need to replicate the gmail functionality is a couple of lines of javascript to hide and show a div

3997479
keystore	jks
i have been given a clear text password and a jks file that contains both the keystore and the truststore

3997489
hide	show
you just need to show and hide divs take a look at this

3997491
ready	each
i was thinking i could add as many fields with link_to and ajax but i guess it s a lot easier for the user to have the six fields printed out and ready instead of clicking a link each time in order to add a field

3997501
addclass	removeclass
use .add css or addclass and removeclass

3997509
post	put
the code required to implement all of this is more than i can put in a post

3997520
pop-up	dialog
i currently pop-up a custom dialog with an edittext in it

3997531
put	get
put each full pathname into a set and use the difference method to get the files and folders that are different

3997542
distance	altitude
this returns the distance in meters between the 2 cllocations but does not account for any difference in altitude

3997585
for-loop	loops
they are usually swallowed by the for-loop but in this case we made the generator raise an exception so loops doesn t notice them

3997620
getter	setter
the field part of a property allows you to access a value just like a field would do though allowing you to trick this getter function and setter procedure if i may say

3997626
button	checkbox
the problem is when someone submits the form and goes to the following page then clicks the back button the checkbox remain checked but the div color reverts

3997671
umask	mkdir
you take the initial permission given to mkdir and subtract the umask to get the actual permission

3997671
umask	mkdir
see the php doco for umask and mkdir for more details

3997718
put	get
i have a simple stub web service with which users can put a blob of json content which is persisted somewhere and then an equivalent get call to read it back

3997735
udp	tcp
if you don t want to use asp.net or php or any other web server program then as i mentioned you can write a little tcp ip or udp ip server daemon using c# c c++ python ruby whatever you want implementing your own simple protocol to trigger actions on the windows machine

3997759
minimum	max
button options to pay off max minimum or your own input

3997759
min	max
in general we agree that your max and min amount should be shown on the screen somewhere it s annoying to go look for your bill when the site can show amount owed

3997770
mouseup	mousedown
and if i want to drag in another direction i must do mouseup and mousedown again

3997795
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
my question is whether there is a generic way to get notified when user browses to urls i want to support at least ie and firefox google-chrome and safari is nice to have

3997823
post	get
after you get the token for each service you will just save it in a database or something and reuse it each time you need to make a new post

3997838
hide	show
i added an empty rule to the field and set not to my senior developer group which does not hide the tab but disables and show no information in the text box

3997841
erlang	ocaml
other languages that implement these paradigms are caml ocaml erlang

3997856
try-catch	exception-handling
since this is supposed to happen in the main ui thread i expect the exception-handling to be propagated up to application.run ... which i surrounded with a try-catch block

3997860
implements	extends
why i can t extends more than one class but can implements more than one interface

3997875
alloca	malloc
if you want stack allocation you can use alloca to allocate on the stack instead of malloc all usual warnings apply

3997875
allocator	stl
if you want to a friendlier interface you can implement a custom stl allocator based on alloca and use a std vector with this you should read up before implementing

3997892
margin	height
take a look at this post css 100 height with padding margin

3997900
touchesbegan	touchesended
you ll want to use touchesbegan and touchesended methods of uiresponder

3997908

i ll multiplying the key matrix with the matrix of 2 characters then modulo the result on 26 as this equation

3997918
min	max
i d give them all options though including max min and custom

3997928
post	get
but i can get round this by editing the post twice once to create the new category which automagically associates it with the post and then a second time to select some additional existing categories from the menu - like i said this is not a big deal because it all works really well otherwise and my users can adapt to these limits

3997953
kerberos	ldap
as for security we use spring security with a few default authentication mechanisms including a straight forms auth provider ldap and kerberos

3998006
children	parent
if they do you need to compare the parent and the z-index of the children is irrelevant

3998006
children	parent
so the z-index decides how the element is placed compared to other children of its stacking parent the closest ancestor with a z-index set and a position of relative absolute or fixed but it doesn t matter when comparing to other elements

3998019
google-chrome	safari
in safari google-chrome

3998027
firefox	safari
in safari and firefox it works and gives me a number depending on the amount of text in the element

3998037
soql	apex
i am running a dynamic soql query in my apex test code and the limit clause is not working

3998119
post	get
first thing is you have to do a get not a post

3998126
folder	directory
i think it makes sense to have a src folder for your source and a tests folder for your tests and the the directory structure under test should match the directory structure under source

3998129
bitarray	bitset
apart from this bitset wraps your bitarray in a nice object representation with many useful operations

3998148
onclick	onchange
if i click yes i can retrieve an onchange or onclick event state and make something happen

3998148
hide	show
what i need to be able to do is show hide an element on the page depending on what choice they ve made in this radio set

3998161
getter	setter
i d like to add as a con for using properties that serialization understands the concept of properties and uses them while it does not know anything about getter setter methods

3998207
vb.net	vb6
this can be done in c++ c# or vb.net or vb6 and lots of 3rd party options

3998214
packets	multicast
i have a service on android that listens and responds to packets it receives via multicast

3998223
google-chrome	firefox
for some reason it renders fine in firefox however in google-chrome it adds an extra pixel of padding on the bottom which covers up bottom border see image below

3998274
pull	push
i haven t tested this but i think i d do force your commits to be published to github thus re-writing the history again have your friend pull your changes rebase his changes then push his changes up

3998278
put	get
extract open the file get the rows of data and put them in a queue to be handled by the transform layer

3998285
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
if you have everything setup correctly there is nothing to do the uitabbarcontroller will show your view an your uiviewcontroller will receive a viewwillappear message where you can do your update

3998287
vsto	add-in
i just had the same problem when trying to add a vsto add-in project reference to a wix setup project

3998287
vsto	add-in
not sure what is different about the vsto add-in projects that prevents them from being shown in the add references dialog

3998292
try-catch	exception-handling
generally crashes in .net applications are caused by an unhandled exception-handling - an exception-handling in a thread in that application that was not caught in a try-catch block of some sort

3998311
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
ie google-chrome firefox and even safari you can try that

3998339
profiling	instrumentation
the best way for a developer is instrumentation s time profiling instrumentation

3998385
linefeed	delimiter
that is because the file i configure flat file connection with at design time has linefeed as a row delimiter

3998385
linefeed	delimiter
had i point to a file that have cr linefeed row delimiter then columndelimiter of the last column would be x000d _x000a_ and these are not overriten with values from config file

3998385
linefeed	delimiter
in my case if i desinged package with file that have cr linefeed as a row delimiter than at run time file that have linefeed delimiter is not being loaded into a table at all obviosly because it is unable to find cr linefeed which indicates the end of the row

3998385
linefeed	delimiter
however if i design package poining to the file fith linefeed delimiter then at run time file with cr linefeed delimiter gets processed but cr is appended to the last field of the file

3998385
linefeed	delimiter
solution i end up poining at design time to the file with linefeed delimiter and adding derived column transfomation task after flat file source with expression to remove cr in case when file at run time has cr linefeed delimiter

3998439
children	parent
right now it is possible in our add children form just using vanilla nested attributes to add the same user as a child multiple times for parent

3998439
children	parent
i am sure i could also enforce uniqueness constraints in the userscontroller update method but would prefer to avoid changing that code right now it doesn t reference parent children at all thanks to nested attributes in the form model if possible

3998443
pthreads	epoll
note you can use pthreads aio with epoll there s signalfd 2 it creates a file descriptor that you can then use to be notified of signals in an epoll based loop

3998450
filtering	grouping
filtering data to grouping from the xml by x node where x node is equals a y z

3998487
stdout	stderr
soon after your program starts use the dup 2 call to make duplicate file descriptors for fd 1 stdout and 2 stderr

3998487
stdout	stderr
now whenever your program printf 2 to stdout or nslogs to stderr the data will be written to your slave fds

3998487
stdout	stderr
do the dup 2 in the correct order so stdout uses fd 1 and stderr uses fd 2

3998487
stdout	stderr
now anything written to stdout and stderr will go to the original fds

3998490
junit	testng
it serves the same purpose as junit or testng does in the java world and is one of many in the xunit family

3998496
pop-up	dialog
that will allow me to link text in a dialog pop-up to an href that a function specifies

3998706
centos	linux
and still a defunct process appears at my centos 5.5 linux vm and then goes away

3998726
client-side	server-side
there is no need to use the server-side geocoding services as this can be done entirely on the client-side in javascript

3998732
addition	multiplication
this is best illustrated with an example which is probably somewhat silly in mathematics we can say that a semiring is a set that is a commutative monoid under one operation which we ll call addition identity 0 and a monoid under another which we ll call multiplication along with the requirements that multiplication distributes over addition and that 0 annihilates all elements under multiplication

3998733
width	height
does anyone know an existing way to find out the png s true height width is an extra

3998746
windows	wow64
please note that if you run 64 bit windows there s a shadow entry as well in the wow64 section

3998755
getter	setter
if you properly encapsulate your data using getter and setter methods you could put such code in these methods or override these methods in a subclass

3998755
getter	setter
to solve this problem i would write my own class loader perhaps using the asm framework and replace each get-field set-field instructions with proper calls to getter setter methods

3998770
foldable	traversable
if the traversable and foldable instances for x were in the library and i suppose i must take some blame for their absence .

3998773
getter	setter
as you said use getter and setter

3998818

merge a topic branch into the current branch which resulted in a fast-forward

3998925
spaces	delimiter
have a look at the documentation to get the correct syntax if you use tab or spaces delimiter etc

3998941
post	get
the thing is my web.config features the default values for the provider but at runtime those default are only being read in initialize the first time provider is instantiated that happens for instance when i request the register view via get but when i fill in the form and post to the controller the initialize on the provider class doesn t get called and all the provider settings are null or default value types value

3998957
mouseleave	mouseenter
you can use the .delegate method to create a mouseenter and a mouseleave event handler to manage your hover effect

3999811
children	parent
now if you want to simply capture the last user to update or insert a particular item table row and that could be in multiple tables then you could use a pattern of inheritance where you have a parent table and multiple children tables

3999833
chown	chmod
probably a little chown chmod love will help

3999853

post	get
in this case information about visited pages can be stored on server side and will be retrieved by session id which is stored in user s cookies get post variables

4000115
cvs	svn
coming from cvs svn i expected ideas handy diffing tool to pop up

4000115
cvs	svn
if you re working on a decade old project recently migrated to git with jar files checked into the scm previously checked into cvs svn where log4j-1.0.jar is in branch-2-0 and the mainline has log4j-9.0.jar proceed with caution if you want to checkout version 2.0 of your project

4000115
cvs	svn
you cannot have the same working tree in both git and cvs svn though the ui may seem to imply so

4000122
pull	push
you could either push the items through an event receiver or pull the items through a job definition

4000127

firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
your best bet is to write code focused on the standards-compliant browsers google-chrome safari opera and firefox if you re not doing any super-crazy html5 you ll find all these browsers act pretty much the same

4000165
daemons	launchd
cron is a common name for a gnu linux daemons that periodically launchd scripts according to a schedule you set

4000165
daemons	launchd
you add your script into a crontab or place a symlink to it into a special directory and the daemons handles the job of launchd it in the background

4000276
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
i have added viewwillappear viewwilldissapear viewdidappear and viewdiddissapear to the white view class and none of those methods ever get called which is weird because i would assume the appear ones would be called when the view is first initialized

4000278
implements	extends
you can extends and implements def apply bar

4000280
ddms	hprof	jhat	hprof
unfortunately the ddms hprof file seems incompatible with my version of jhat and i m not an eclipse user so i do not have ready access to mat

4000425
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
when i open a openfiledialog or a savefiledialog before i do the sqlite call

4000471
hash	salt
the salt should not be hash as you need the original value to combine with the password before hashing it

4000474
hash	salt
if you hash the salt all you are effectively doing is changing the salt

4000531
next	except
this hides everything except the first 980px then your slider slides in the next when the user scrolls

4000564

from min to max

4000576
calendar	gcal
gcal s list of calendar where the number of columns is not known until run time

4000611
put	get
one easy way around it is to just put the offending ddls in an update panel so they properly get refreshed on updates and don t get stuck

4000624
hide	show
if i change the display none to display block.it will work with jqtrasnform.but i want to hide the div in the page load and show only when the buttonclicked function is invoked

4000699

so i m just tinkering around with c and wanted to see if i could assign a binary value to an integer and use the printf function to output either a signed or unsigned value

4000760
openlayers	proj4js
openlayers can also transform between coordinate systems and projections using the proj4js library

4000781
google-chrome	safari
there are mechanisms for safari google-chrome and other webbrowsers that you could use to achieve this same behavior with varying degrees of difficulty

4000801
inherited	properties
if my class is mostly immutatble except for a collections properties when i m implementing the copywithzone method through nscopy inherited do i need to do the version where i m returning a self that had a retain called on it like this

4000816
filesystems	ntfs
if your server is using ntfs for its volume filesystems you aren t limited to any number of files per directory per se but more in that you are limited to some number of files directories per volume

4000816
filesystems	ntfs
technically speaking the ntfs filesystems uses a global mft that keeps track of all the files directories are files and are mostly used for logical representation to the end user so every time you modify the volume that change is reflected in the mft

4000818
width	height
i want to use a 4 3 video as a background on a site but setting the width and height to 100

4000825
octal	hex
for a standard way of specifying bit patterns like that use octal number begins with a zero or hex number begins with a zero and x formats

4000825
integer	unsigned
second almost all computers have the same binary representation for a positive integer and its unsigned equivalent so there will be no difference

4000891
voip	sip
sip vs h.323 voip story comes into my mind

4000891
voip	sip
sip is very simplified easy to build while h.323 like a typical telecom standard tried to envisage every issue on the planet about voip and provide a solution for it

4000946
width	height
... in the same way as the img element â if you only set one of width and height the other dimension is automatically adjusted appropriately so that the video retains its aspect ratio

4000946
width	height
however â unlike the img element â if you set width and height to something that doesn t match the aspect ratio of the video the video is not stretched to fill the box

4000975
awt	swing
it s an object you can use to draw graphics primitives on a swing awt program

4000976
width	height
however since a view s bounds property is defined in terms of its own coordinates that height and width should reflect the current orientation of the view

4001001
awt	swing
in most awt and swing components you can override the paint graphics g method to implement your own drawing method

4001010
hash	salt
you must not hash the salt since hash are one way

4001010
hash	salt
if all salt are the same it s obvious to the cracker who can see your hash values which accounts have the same password

4001010
hash	salt
you should assume that the cracker will gain both the salt and the hash value so the hash algorithm must be secure

4001010
hash	salt
having any salt at all prevents using existing precomputed rainbow tables to crack your hash value and having a unique salt for each account removes the desire for your cracker to precompute their own rainbow tables using your salt

4001011
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried setting the border bottom of the tr but this seems to do nothing in google-chrome and firefox at least

4001014
int	chars
int is an alias for int32 byte is an alias for byte chars is an alias for chars and so on and so forth

4001066
hash	salt
no you must not hash the salt

4001066
hash	salt
the salt is in clear text and it is needed to you to recompute the password and check it with the one stored in the hash password file

4001066
hash	salt
in this manne a dictionary attack is not possible because for every word into the dictionary and for every salt into the password file the attacker needs to compute the hash

4001068
put	get
the way to do it would be to put together any sort of app with the namespace com.thecompany.theapp and get it uploaded

4001139
try-catch	exception-handling
you should handle this exception-handling using try-catch and attempt to connect n number of times again in the catch block

4001140
hash	salt
as the salt needs to be saved along with the hash or at least must be retrievable along with the hash an attacker could possibly get both the salt and the hash password

4001140
hash	salt
my reasoning was that storing the salt unencrypted along with the hash password would make it easier to crack the passwords as a hacker that would be able to retrieve the password table and would know or make an assumption about the hash algorithm would be able to find matches between hash of well known words dictionary attack by hashing each word in the dictionary and then salting with the salt he also has access to

4001212
min	max
the min and max values for colors in the #aabbcc format is #000000...#ffffff or 0...16777215 in decimal

4001230

i know the more popular ones drupal joomla wordpress have various image galleries storage systems you can add in some allowing multiple simultaneous file uploads which is not the easiest thing to implement from scratch

4001246
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox but in google-chrome the order is wacky and it ends with the submit button

4001260
hide	show
id text1 and when i click the button the text changes to an editable field maybe something like and then but in between i need to give the field the value of the text and then when i click the button save i should hide the input field and just show the text with the new value

4001262
google-chrome	firefox
my current tools google-chrome inspector firebug httpfox firefox sniffer extension was useful to pinpoint the bad request

4001274
put	get
so get it from the text area save it in a temp variable and put it in the textfield

4001275
flot	protovis
i ve used flot for this but for something really shiny there s protovis which is something i might use next time

4001283
post	put
practice makes one better - but if i don t see a solution to a problem i put it aside and let it brew for a while discuss it with coworkers or even post it on so

4001296
hide	show
this simple jquery will copy the text from the paragraph hide it and show the input with the text from the paragraph

4001299
factors	mean
however this doesn t mean that your use of automapper shouldn t factors into the thought process behind your domain objects

4001316
tiff	png
while i could save as tiff or png eps is best for manipulating figures in illustrator i can ungroup objects move the legend text etc

4001319
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
so far i ve found this post link opens in google-chrome opera and safari

4001320
spaces	delimiter
each of these delimiter can have any amount of white spaces on either side of the delimiter but each item can contain a valid spaces

4001327
google-chrome	firefox
i say use firefox google-chrome and the web developer toolbar which allows you to view generated source

4001332
pull	push
i have just setup git-http-backend on a ws2008 machine using apache and basic auth for pull and push

4001336
width	height
basically you can listen for mouse-down mouse-up and mouse-move events which would allow you to adjust the width and height of it programmatically

4001396
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
so not only do you need conversion routines to convert to the internal representation you then need the routines that add subtract multiplying those numbers

4001399
crypt	hash
store passwords using a strong hash like bcrypt see crypt documentation

4001415
google-chrome	firefox

4001547
cefsharp	awesomium
we tried hit a hurdle couldn t change the code to work the way we wanted so we went the open source route with cef and cefsharp being able to see the code made the work so much easier and less voodoo ffs awesomium even obfuscate their code so i couldn t understand what i m doing wrong

4001547
cefsharp	cefglue
we gave cefglue a 5 minute try it didn t work immediately so we moved to cefsharp which immediately worked this is the great and terrible thing about two competing open source frameworks

4001558
gtk	cairo
i believe the gtk toolkit and moonlight browser plugin use cairo for all their drawing

4001575
rss	feed
this allows quick sorting of http_accept headers which is useful for automatic alternating between rss and atom feed formats

4001620
hide	show
i m using that trick where you render 30-40 item rows in the html and allow the user to show or hide more or less using jquery

4001647
int	chars
when a chars is used as an operand with the operator it is promoted to int still -128

4001653
post	put
when you re constructing the form put the current uri in a hidden input field then you have the information available to you when you want to perform the redirect after the post data has been submitted

4001670
int	chars
when is applied to a chars value it is promoted to int and the sign is preserved

4001681
jruby	mri
then because of a many gems are not available for jruby and b most of the rails webshosts don t support jruby i decided to use ruby mri

4001690
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	iqueryable	ilist	iqueryable
in general i d rather not have paging and sorting parameters or options on my repository instead i d rather return an iqueryable and let callers compose those types of operations into the query as long as you are iqueryable a technology like ef or nhibernate can translate those operators into sql - if you fall back to ilist or ienumerable it s all in memory operations

4001724
apache	nginx
this probably don t really answer your question but there are evented web servers that are ruby friendly you can use instead of apache or nginx

also a class can only extends one abstract class but can implements many interfaces

4001781
comparator	comparable
i suggest you to have a have a look into comparator and comparable interfaces

4001796
exif	jfif
the two you are most likely to encounter are jfif and exif

4001796
exif	jfif
the above code covers jfif but doesn t handle exif

4001796
exif	jfif
do some reading on the two formats jfif and exif

4001816
zlib	libpng
i ve heard you need to get libpng zlib to get to work first but i am unsure how to set this up

4001817
width	height
the second pair of arguments to glviewport are width and height not the ending x y position

4001817
width	height
your second glviewport should be glviewport width 2 0 width 2 height

4001832
int	double
is the same thing as math.pow 2 n except it is way faster and better in general as well as returning int not double

4001856
versioning	upgrade
would it be safe to use in project although not prevented i am curious on security performance and ease of upgrade to release versioning

4001892
ubuntu	linux	kubuntu	gnome	kde	kubuntu	kde	gnome

return width and height of the image

4002002
width	height
it does return the width and height of the image

4002002
width	height
get header ffc0 save width and height

4002002
width	height
locate header save width and height

4002002
width	height
locate header save width and height

4002002
width	height
return width and height of the image

4002002
width	height
their code also returns the width and height of the image but they do it in a different way that is several magnitudes times faster than the code that team a wrote only the beginning of the file is loaded into memory and the dimensions is taken from the header without decoding the image

4002043
multibyte	substr
mrclay also pointed out something very important it may be a better idea to use mb_substr multibyte substr literally instead of substr

4002090
post	get
you need to check the get variable qqfile and if it is set it contains your file name while the file is in the post data

4002094
viewmodel	caliburn
not sure about autofac or caliburn might still apply but when it comers to the unity container i will only register the viewmodel if.

4002113
width	height
now i wish to expand the height with 230 and the width with 700 when you click on the next button inside the fancybox

4002141
int	chars
what i think if the base type of the pointer were of int type then it would have retrieved 4 bytes from the location it s pointing.then the o p would have been 1000.but as i changed the base type to chars then it would retrieve 1 byte from location it s pointing when i dereference it.but how the answer is -24

4002148
width	height
i am setting a width and height in css for the control

4002154
int	chars
the core of your problem is that you attempted to print a chars as an int d

4002166
photoshop	coreldraw
graphics applications such as acdsee photoshop coreldraw simply ignores units xdensity and ydensity members when displaying jpg files on the screen but graphics applications consider the value of those members when printing jpg files if they exist

4002240
width	height
their width is given by width and their height is known by the function

4002330
implements	extends
furthermore a java class may implements and an interface may extends any number of interfaces

4002330
implements	extends
a class can extends only one class but can implements multiple interfaces

4002364
width	height
it works fine if you are using height and width for the textbox

4002364
width	height
when you use width height the control is pushing these details as height and width in style

4002364
width	height
when you ignore setting the height and width it simply doesn t add width and height to your control

4002375
google-chrome	firefox
these things seem relatively standard and in fact ssl works completely fine in both firefox and in google-chrome while it does not in ie

4002381
hex	binary
the key is in hex - if you look at the java page you pasted you can see that easily by decoding the binary values for the key in the detailed output

4002419
int	chars
dereferencing a chars pointer got you the first character-sized chunk of the internal representation of 1000 as an int

4002419
int	chars
that chars was then promoted to a int as per the rules for varidac arguments and interpreted as int

4002419
int	double	int	chars
in any case when you dereferenced the it interpreted that memory as float which has a rather more complex internal structure than a chars or even a 2s-complement int and promoted it to a double those rules for varidac arguments again then an attempt was made interpret that representation as an int and if the float did fit in an int the double probably doesn t so you re interpreting part of the double as an int

4002434
viewdidload	viewwillappear
if you are using a tab bar and option could be to move all the game-reset instruction in the method viewwillappear instead on viewdidload

google-chrome	firefox
this is somewhat surprising also considering firefox google-chrome and others don t complain

4002495
decimal	ieee
note that some modern cpus ibm ppc have ieee 754 2008 decimal floating point arithmetic built-in

4002552
moq	fakeiteasy
concerning the comparison between moq and fakeiteasy the two frameworks are largely the same from a conceptual point of view - the differences are only in the api and in the terminology .

4002562
division	subtraction
2 if you are doing this yourself you can avoid having to do division by using doubling and subtraction

4002563
post	get
when i post the data to my php script i get the all clear

4002591
accessor	properties
but it happens that if i don t implement a get accessor in myproperty and try to bind something to it i get a cannot bind to the properties myproperty on the target control

4002591
put	get
it just happens that i get the error only when i comment out the get accessor and stop getting it when i put it back

4002609
interpolation	splines
i need to use natural cubic splines interpolation in an iphone app

4002667
hide	show

folder	directory
i checked the apps directory and the script folder is in there

4002796
min	max
i need to get the min max value for each position in tuple

4002815
entities	entitymanager
if you want your entities to be auto-discovered use entitymanager jpa

4002838
getter	setter
it generates an entity class for each table that wraps the base entity and has property setter getter corresponding to each column name

4002870
folder	directory
copy the folder of data files myd etc to your local data directory but skip the mysql folder too version specific and might not be right for the local setup

4002871
centos	linux
it works ok but uses 20m per httpd-child at my centos 5 linux machine

4002872
preorder	inorder
but if inorder and preorder traversals are same then the trees are equal

4002884
for-loop	arrays
a for-loop can be used to iterate over the elements of an arrays but it cannot be used to iterate over the properties of an object unless you can use ecmascript 5 s object.keys which could be used to implement the above example as follows

4002919
superclass	subclassing
i have heard that when you have a subclassing you are supposed to initialize the superclass with the same init function from within the subclassing s init

4002938
superclass	subclassing
you can choose to init your subclassing with whatever you want provided that you call an init method of the superclass

4002942
super	implements
if the -init in super is implements as

4002976
jinternalframe	jeditorpane
my program will then pop up a jinternalframe with a jeditorpane in it as the console capturing any console output from the user s program

4002980
stdout	stderr
it has a method for starting the logging on file as well which uses freopen 3 to redirect some stream stderr and stdout atm to a file in append mode

4003048
hash	salt
i was thinking of sharing a small class between the applications so that the password can be passed already hash but i would also have to pass the salt so it still seems like a small security risk

4003055
webclient	httpwebrequest
you can use webclient or httpwebrequest to download asynchronously and parse the response

4003096
width	height
if you want to have a triangle that has exactly the value of the first texel of your 2 d texture then you need to pass the coordinates 0.5 width 0.5 height to each of the vertices

4003101
textarea	textbox
a multiline textbox is actually a html textarea tag

4003105
superclass	subclassing
when you create a subclassing if you implement an initializer then you must be sure to call the superclass s designated initializer s and you must provide at least one designated initializer of your own though this can just be your override of the superclass s

4003105
superclass	subclassing
as part of initializing your subclassing you must call one of the superclass s designated initializers

4003107
uiview	subviews
you can even have uiview if not coreanimation as grimless suggested animations that move the current tableview to the left setframe and the next tableview from the right setframe offscreen before animation and then in place in the beginanimation-commitanimation clause but make sure you add the tableviews in a container view the bubble interior that clips its subviews

4003164
didreceivememorywarning	dealloc
to test whether this is the case you could either do an nslog call inside the didreceivememorywarning message or you could subclass uiimage and extend its dealloc and put an nslog message inside it saying something like image being dealloced and then check what gets written to the console

4003179
superclass	subclassing
i have heard that when you have a subclassing you are supposed to initialize the superclass with the same init function from within the subclassing s init

4003179
superclass	subclassing
once it s in a superclass interface it s there and you re able to make bad choices where the compiler can t help you - you re expected to determine the visibility graph for initializers and write your subclassing accordingly

4003188
hash	salt
passing the salt in clear is no problem the salt is usually stored in clear the purpose of the salt is avoiding the same password hashing to the same hash always so users with the same password would have the same hash and rainbow tables would only need a single hash for each possible password

4003201
int	chars
if as seemingly in your case chars is a signed type you are assigning the int constant 128 to a type that is only guaranteed to hold values up to 127

4003202
hide	show
i want these layers to be retrievable so i can delete hide show layers on command

4003210
versioning	upgrade
it is a free gpl product which offers a brand new approach to database development and deployment by connecting versioning information with a sql generation engine which could automatically compute any upgrade script you need to upgrade any versioning of your database into another

4003210
postgresql	mysql
it currently supports oracle mysql and postgresql

4003210
versioning	upgrade
you can publish your updates by simple synchronization during development and you can generate exportable database deliveries which you will be able to execute on any targetted database through a standalone installer which validates the versioning performs structural checks and applies the upgrade scripts

4003241
integer	fractions
here is a c function that handles positive or negative integer or fractions values for both operands

4003306
width	height
if you know that the target table is the only one with that width and height you can use a more specific xpath

4003324
prepare	execute
considering the fact that nsql is actually implemented using prepare execute fetchrow_arrayref

4003366
hash	salt
on client side hash password then add salt concatenate session_id string then hash again

this makes use of the other http methods other than get and post

4003437
algol	smalltalk
fortran matlab pascal algol smalltalk and many many others

4003462
int	chars
a union is essentially a way to access same data in different ways for example you can access interpret 4 bytes of memory as 1 int or as 4 chars

4003465
jar	manifest.mf
then generated manifest.mf in the jar file will look like this

4003521
post	get
get resources new -- post resources -- redirect get resources new_id

4003521
put	get
get resources id edit -- put resources id -- redirect get resources id

4003521
post	get
they could press reload over and over and as long as our controller checked the new action for a post vs a get it would just continue to error or reload the blank form

4003521
post	get
on success we d move on with get post get pattern

4003521
post	put
secondary question how should could we handle getting information about a resource before a post or put if practicing true rest which touts itself as great because there is no broadcast contract of schema as per say soap

4003526
mouse	keyboard
mouse is very slow and keyboard stops responding shortly

4003539

4003648
maven	pom.xml
i downloaded the guice 2.0 source from but when i looked at the pom.xml i saw the version was was marked as 1.0-rc2 and the target jar that was build by maven was named guice-1.0-rc2.jar

4003701
put	get
if i put the adview into the settings.xml like you would with a normal layout i get a class cast exception

4003702
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
if not you might have hit a windows is case-insensitive java is case-sensitive issue where a resource is found even if was with the old spelling

i had to rename cplayerhostingview to cpgraphhostingview to get this to work after upgrading to the latest versioning of core plot along with ios 4 and the upgrade of xcode

4003768
put	get	post	get	post	put
just think about whether your urls provide meaningful operations for get post put and delete requests

4003786
portrait	landscape
i m having 5 view controllers in my navigation based application i need to support both landscape portrait mode in only a one view following items displaying in the view

4003802
move	drag
i want to give user a option to move up and down file name using up down button and using drag and drop

4003829
portrait	landscape
you should use shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation in your view controller and return yes for view controllers that should support both landscape portrait

4003842
union	distinct
union is a set operation - it returns distinct values

4003842
union	distinct
you can think of union as concat followed by distinct

4003844
portrait	landscape
if you have your portrait layout main.xml in res layout and your landscape layout main.xml in res layout-land and your onconfigurationchanged looks like this

4003852
shadowbox	lightbox
could be a lightbox shadowbox like script

4003867
children	parent
the method .removechild only applies to parent nodes and its direct children

4003867
google-chrome	firefox
the existing code worked in ie8 and google-chrome but failed in firefox

4003873
consistency	acid
if your connections are the problem certainly then just deal with the connection problem and implement connection pooling java and sybase have libraries for that rather than reducing the quality and performance of your app as well as the consistency that s the c in acid of the database

4003894
multiplying	addition
is it a multiplying or addition or is something else

4003898
onresume	onpause
you probably want to register you listener onresume and unregister it onpause though rather than oncreate

4003905
wav	caf	wav	aiff	aiff	caf	mp3	aiff	mp3	wav
i tried different formats like wav mp3 aac aiff caf but it seems that attaching the soundmanager eats the same size of memory

4003928
int	double	multiplying	add
it can add registers multiplying registers with the constants 2 4 and 8 for address calculations of words int and double

4003934
int	chars
a chars works just like an int

4003946
filesystems	ntfs
filesystems determine performance and 200 000 images without indexing will slow down performance in ext2 or ntfs

4004081
put	get
i also guess that you may get desired output from the list if you put node to the list by value not by const reference but it still is undefined behaviour

4004114
post	get
but this is post the moment that we switch times which happens on 01 00 utc so when you convert time to local timezone you get march 30 04 00

4004166
nsscanner	nsstring
you can solve the problem using methods on nsstring or a class named nsscanner both have been available since iphone os 2.0 and long before that since before mac os x 10.0 actually

4004168
int	double
from a usability standpoint while reading the second is akin to a table layout and it helps you scan it vertically to quickly see that there re two int and one double but it s also slightly harder to connect the horizontal extremes to see that bar is 1

4004168
int	double
the first one makes the individual rows take focus and is easier to scan horizontally to see that bar is 1 but it s harder to quickly see that there re two int and one double

4004170
folder	directory
i was wondering if it was possible to maintain a directory structure within the application folder in side webapps folder i have created a folder called itc357 which acts as my application folder which carries all my files so the directory path is as follows

4004227
opera	google-chrome
opera and google-chrome have built-in consoles too

4004240
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
however for regular filesystems fat ntfs extx etc. there s no need to be shrinkable as they were designed to occupy space dedicated for them on hard disk

4004255
width	height
note how i switched the width and the height

4004475
folder	dir
you may see it as log.txt in your graphical folder viewer as opposed to the cli dir command simply because it hides the known file extensions

4004523
ocl	uml
now uml includes an imperative action language not to be confused with ocl that allows a precise definition of the behaviour of class methods

4004545
for-loop	loops
and that reference does take a bit of memory but the real danger is usually the overhead when calling function in a loops just having a single function call inside a large for-loop could add a lot of processing time

4004590
move	drag
try this code to move items up and down with drag and drop within the listbox

4004624
modula-2	oberon	ada	pascal
the entire wirthian line of languages including pascal object pascal modula-2 modula-3 oberon oberon-2 and ada plus a few others i ve probably overlooked allow arrays to be indexed from whatever point you like including obviously 1

4004627
postgresql	mysql
the database can be sql server mysql postgresql xml etc

4004637
ocaml	sml
to transpose the matrix you can either translate this ocaml code to sml or simply use your poslist function for all indices from 0 to 8

4004766
width	height
yes or argumentexception when gdi+ randomly decides that the width or height you pass is too large instead of throwing oom

4004805
getter	setter
and this property has only a getter but no setter

4004831
hide	show
what i want to do is basically create calayerref s or cglayerref s or whatever push them into my layers variable and then when i need them fetch use their context and finally draw hide show delete them

4004849
explode	implode
or a combination of explode and implode

4004920
ant	maven
to be frank i think that your current mindset maps much better to ant than to maven and i would suggest starting with that

4004936
jobs	cron
instead of using cron jobs i was thinking of using asynchronous calls

4004964
post	get
some of these cpts require a custom write panel which basically means that it has a set of custom meta boxes rather than the bog-standard edit box you get with your post or pages

4004991
int	double
essentially i have a methods that manipulates data taken from a table to create a new object zexpert. zexpert has parameters int id int domain and double zexpert

4005035
octal	hex
i was expacting only 92 because this would be the converted value from 222 octal to hex 92

4005055
multiplication	exponent
if the exponent is 0.5 you should use sqrt and if the exponent is a small integer 2 3 4 expressing the formula with multiplication is faster but less readable

4005073
width	height
i have a control for which i need to enforce a certain width or height depending on a property called orientation which obviously can be vertical or horizontal

4005075
int	boolean
| and are available for boolean and int types and don t short-circuit

4005084
post	get
bedroom width bedroom num_windows bedroom bed_type etc you would store an array within the post_meta table so when you get the post meta for the bedroom of a house it would return an array of arrays the first level represnting the rooms the second representing the attributes of a room

4005092
melt	reshape
here i manually loop over the data and build a narrow result dataframe that i could turn into my desired result using melt reshape

4005092
plot	heatmap
now i can take the highest scores and plot a heatmap style graph

4005103
screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi	mdpi	hdpi
when i download the images from gowalla i m already scaling them down based on the screens size 48x48 for hdpi so 32x32 for mdpi etc. so these aren t huge images but i m still forced to choose between potentially crashing my app or having the icons flicker in and out

4005139
directx	directdraw
i have been going through the code and reading through directx documentation trying to find a place to optimize the code so that rendering is as smooth of directx as it is on directdraw

4005155
width	height
if it is a custom control then you could write the orientation property such that the set method checks value which would be either vertical or horizontal and then quietly sets width height accordingly

4005159
folder	directory
the problem is if i copy a big file into this directory such that it takes about 30 seconds to copy this method is called as soon as the first byte is written to the folder and tries to move a file which is being used by another process so fails

4005162
installation	upgrade
i m building an installation upgrade package with wix

4005162
installation	upgrade
what i want to do is to have a fully automated installation no wizard when performing a major upgrade of the installed product

4005166
google-chrome	firefox
- it works fine on google-chrome and firefox

4005166
width	height
when i keep prototype with jquery altogether with my noconflicted gallery viewer there seems to be errors with the width and height returned by jquery accessors

4005180
post	get
version of the question cross-posted on parallel python forums i ll post an answer here if i get something there about this from a non so user

4005184
getter	setter
and even better if you use synthesize to generate your getter and setter than you need not even worry about the memory model of cocoa at all with the exception of releasing your ivars in dealloc

4005205
implements	extends
class panel extends surfaceview implements surfaceholder.callback

4005227
nsscanner	nsstring
you could use nsstring and nsscanner but i generally find it easier just to use c apis directly for pure ascii files

4005236
width	height
i once posted a question and answered myself regarding width and height and animation without jquery

4005262
hide	show
for example if i know that i will always have to hide div elements this hide and show method is pretty ok

4005291
int	double
xdate int year int month int day int hour int minute double second

4005329
toolchain	binutils
there s no way to specify what toolchain to use i have to spot the variable names for all binutils hoping not to forget any

4005336
for-loop	arrays
but later when i try to make a for-loop with a if statement that ignores null values and prints the arrays address as the ascii value for the character the number of times the character occured and the percentage that character appears of the total characters

4005337
put	get	post	get	post	put
you should read this article on the differences between get and post get is when you put your parameters in the url and post is when you put your parameters in the form

4005355
implements	extends
i ve got class a wrapped with method foo implements using extends

4005359
width	height
make sure you have set the width height of the canvas absolutely

4005363
inherited	properties
properties is inherited from another

4005366
post	get
i m trying to get will paginate to link to my nested route instead of the regular post variable

4005385
yacc	bison
you can use yacc bison for this

4005471
button	checkbox
note that this is particularly useful for checkbox if you use radio button it might be a better idea to remove the part then php will automaticly retrieve the value that was chosen if any

4005496
post	get
you can use http post parameters instead of get parameters in the request

4005523
pop-up	dialog
a small dialog window pop-up - select ok

4005524
for-loop	arrays
you can use a for-loop but it s not an arrays that s returned it s a nodelist for example

4005532
for-loop	arrays
but the behave like arrays so you can use a normal for-loop to traverse it

4005559
nfa	dfa
let s suppose i have a class which implements a nfa dfa whose transitions are stored in a .net dictionary structure and which takes an input word and recognizes a set of words derivable in some way from the input

4005560
int	chars
isdigit accepts number1 of type chars and not int

4005568
post	get
i am trying get all commments relateed to my current post i am doing it as following

4005577
integer	unsigned
note that it have unsigned type and result will be integer

4005585
nfa	dfa
please see the following implementation which takes an nfa and converts it to a dfa and then to a graph using a dictionary just like yourself

4005585
nfa	dfa
nfa to dfa

4005606
folder	directory
with media being the folder in the base directory that contains the static files

4005610
ubuntu	linux
i have seen plenty of people mention some of the cool new features in perl 5.12 but my preferred flavor of linux ubuntu only comes with 5.10.1

4005641
ubuntu	debian
on the other hand itools at first glance appears to be maintained but there does not appear to be an ubuntu debian package available and so would be difficult to deploy and maintain

4005694
width	height
see height and width on iphone ipad

4005710
content-length	content-type
the problem is i keep getting an error saying http 1.1 400 bad request content-type text html date sat 23 oct 2010 18 42 20 gmt connection close content-length 42

4005710
post	get
basically the first line is different the host name is different and it says i m sending my info with a get variable instead of a post variable even though i set curlopt_post to true

4005826
hash	salt
so the way around it is to combine the hash with a unique salt

4005826
hash	salt
because the theory would be that he tries every permutation + the salt hash and compare the outcome with the password hash

4005843
hash	salt
the primary advantage of a salt chosen at random is that even if two people use the same password the hash will be different because the salt will be different

4005843
hash	salt
this means that the attacker can t precompute the hash of common passwords because there are too many different salt values

4005855
int	double
for example it lets you add two numbers regardless of whether those happen to be of type short int long float double long double etc

4005919
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i assume this can be easily achieved with activex technology but want to make sure firefox safari google-chrome browsers let alone linux mac os don t get left behind

4005934
hash	salt
for example if you add a 32-bit salt to each pass-phrase the attacker has to hash and re-hash each input in the dictionary 4 billion times and store the results from all of those to have a successful attack

4005954
ubuntu	linux
i am running ubuntu linux version 10.04.1 i am using as version 2.20.1 and the problem is that it creates the file but the file is always empty

4005974
pop-up	dialog
i was looking at the net send to send something but it doesn t seem to work for me as well as it seems to pop-up a dialog box for every text you send

4006006
goto	break
one problem is that a goto break a for-loop

4006006
goto	break
the goto break always and all nested loops even if the label of the goto is in the same block and the for-variables are lost immediately after the jump

4006013
pull	push
as components as finishinged i will push my changes to the centrally hosted git repo private git hub account usually or pull them to dev i setup dev as a repo and pull from ssh

4006023
objectcontext	transactionscope
if you use transactionscope with multiple objectcontext instances the transaction will be promoted to distributed and whole operation somemethod will be handled still as atomic

4006094
integer	unsigned
one possible explanation is that you have undefined behaviour because you are using a format specification for a signed integer d but passing an unsigned int parameter

4006107
maven	pom.xml
the problem is that dependency versions specified in pom.xml definition are the libraries i need to use they have sources javadoc available etc. but maven puts all the available library versions on classpath so that if i ctrl+shift+t or step into some class which belongs to that dependency it might be the one without sources javadoc the one not declared in pom.xml definition but in local maven repo

4006109
content-disposition	content-type	outputstream	inputstream
if the resource is dynamic create a servlet which obtains an inputstream of the content somehow new fileinputstream resultset.getbinarystream etc..etc.. and writes it to the outputstream of the response along at least the content-type and content-disposition response headers

4006116
put	get
what i understand is that you can put the long macbeth story into the hash function and get a x long hash out of it

4006116
put	get
then you can put in the beowulf story to get another hash out of it again x long

4006121
x86	64bit
64bit systems c program files x86 reference assemblies microsoft framework .netframework v4.0 profile

4006121
folder	directory
the mono folder in the zip should be directly under the profile directory

4006121
versioning	upgrade
if you ve upgrade your monodevelop install to the latest versioning as of today anyway this visual studio solution project file will open with no problem - no changes required at all

4006152
memcached	apc
cons if access archiving versioning is not an issue then sql makes a good config store if combined with apc or memcached for efficient access

4006163
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
add subview to navgiationbar with the following code inside inside viewwillappear or viewdidappear

4006185
width	height
the frame property has an x y width and height attribute

4006212
lxml	elementtree
another option if you really don t want to build a tree is to use the target parser interface which is like sax for lxml elementtree but easier

4006228

a couple of years back dutch researchers demonstrated weaknesses in md5 by publishing a hash of their prediction for the us presidential election

4006271
kate	komodo	komodo	notepad++
i write everything in kate linux komodo editor mac or notepad++ windows

4006282
put	get
if not how do i get around this problem of put creation with nhibernate

4006314
int	chars
p n where p is a pointer and n is an int is equivalent to p+n therefore it s like accessing 100 chars away from what your p points to

4006319
int	double
by convention java objects have capitalized first-letter names string while primitives have lower case names int float double etc.

4006333
ssl	https
in order to prevent that you should enable tls ssl on your server and serve the page over https

4006337
subtract	add
since by definition your site is just doing simple calculations i would recommend creating a single controller with a variety of actions add subtract divide etc

4006346

any message whether published persistent or transient on a durable or non-durable queue may get persistent to disk

4006348
freebsd	linux
i am porting from linux to freebsd and have run into mknod failing with errno

4006352
spaces	delimiter
if you have data that looks properly formatted with delimiter that you can identify eg in your case tabs spaces there is no need to use regex

4006353
mousemove	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mousemove
the problem is that ie handles mouseover differently because it behaves like mouseenter and mousemove combined on an element

4006366
post	get
this way you will get the comments for the specific post and all associated to the comments data

4006366
post	get
this way you will get the post and all data associated to it

4006374
getter	setter
the other option is to use automatic getter and setter in the controller and then in the block use

4006374
getter	setter
using the getter and setter can occasionally get confusing as it may look like you are accessing the data through the orm rather than a temporary session variable so you might make a coding-style consistency decision to use mage registry for those types of variables

4006376
pdfbox	itext
if you want to parse pdfs you ll probably want to investigate something like itext or pdfbox although be warned the pdf file format wasn t designed for easy extraction of text - many a phd student has burnt out whilst trying.

4006381
maven	pom.xml
the problem is that dependency versions specified in pom.xml definition are the libraries i need to use they have sources javadoc available etc. but maven puts all the available library versions on classpath ...

4006381
maven	pom.xml
... so that if i ctrl+shift+t or step into some class which belongs to that dependency it might be the one without sources javadoc the one not declared in pom.xml definition but in local maven repo

4006381
maven	m2e
and this is not really a maven or m2e specific issue

4006386
mvp	presenter
also i am working on a project using mvp and i find it very tedious to make the view connect to the data base.i mean i have to update my presenter service serviceasync servicimpl facades in order to make connection to database

4006418
width	height
layouting of elements computing their preferred height and width thus no need to deal with coordinates and dimensions

4006430
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
i have windows 7 here and the navigator.appversion returns a string containing nt 6.1 in these browsers google-chrome opera safari ie9 beta

4006462
uiview	uiwindow
i ve looked into adding a uiwindow on top of the current status bar as in this question add uiview above all other views including statusbar

4006463
mockito	easymock
whereas unit tests create a dummy implementation or use mockito easymock etc. and thus don t require any ui components

4006469
google-chrome	firefox
i have attempted to use firefox google-chrome and ie and nothing will let me connect in debug mode

4006491
flex	robotlegs
i need to upload a group of images using flex with robotlegs

4006568
thin	webrick
i get the following error when i run with thin webrick works fine

4006603
std	ostream
and some where else i have overloaded ostream of std vector

4006615
post	get
another possibility is to use post instead of get for your login form

4006651
serializable	deserialization
i don t think i would have to write explicit serializable deserialization code

4006662
hash	hmac
another approach and does not require server-side session state the first time you see a fb cookie for a user hmac the cookie using a secret only your servers have and store that resulting hash in a cookie

4006674
width	height
i don t want to increase the width and height of image itself

4006694
getter	setter
in groovy properties with package access well i should call that attributes or instance variables perhaps get automatically setter and getter methods compiled into the class file

4006694
getter	setter
the groovy compiler will generate a setter and a getter

4006807
put	get
you actually do get a guaranty that is the same thing as so depending on what you put at the address of x - 1 then you do have a sort of guaranty

4006822
post	get
when i get to the last requiredtext field i want to submit the form using post or whatever

4006903
int	chars
if your int are nonzero and small enough to fit in unsigned chars or wchar_t a convenient way to do this is something like

4006903
octal	decimal
keep in mind those are octal values not decimal

4006908
getter	setter
set values on the model using the magic getter setter you get these in objects that inherit from varien_object or setdata etc

4006914
children	parent
the previous answer also only gets you one direction - categories know about their parent but not about their children

4006914
children	parent
if you want to go a step further and call them parent and children you can

4006936
width	height
for some reason the width always 640 and height always 480

4006936
portrait	landscape
no matter whether it is portrait or landscape

4006936
width	height
i really confused on that i thought in portraint it should be width 320 and height is 480 while in landscape mode width should be 480 and height should be 320

4006936
width	height
how do i get correct width and height of the image

4006956
ncover	dotcover
as of now i think dotcover and resharper combined are less expensive than ncover

4006958
snmp	mib
i have our own mib files and i know in many cases i have to write snmp agent to support my own mib

4006958
snmp	mib
but this time i think if i can make jboss snmp adapter jbosssnmpadapter to support my mib it will be much easier

4006988
google-chrome	firefox
it works in ie tested 8 and 9 - but after the slide up it reappears for a very short time then disappears annoying - and it doesn t work in both google-chrome and firefox

4007050
post	get
i m trying to post a create but i get this error message

4007071
google-chrome	firefox
wil do one thing try to do the same sample in a separate brand new page and try the code in the firefox and google-chrome and check if it is working.the same code you have in jsfiddle

4007136
rubygems	rvm
i suspect you might not be in the correct rvm name that has the gems you re trying to install so thats why i d suggest reinstalling rubygems and building you re core gems from the beginning in your global rvm gemset name

4007155
uiview	subviews
on iphone uiview have a subviews nsarray

4007155
uiview	calayer
in addition there is a second hierarchy each uiview has a calayer array

4007167
uiapplication	uiwindow
oh you could muck around in the uiapplication s uiwindow list to find the keyboard window and move it but then apple wouldn t accept your app.

4007169
fadein	fadeout
from the api i found extjs provide some basic animation for exmaple the fadein fadeout and etc

4007263
hash	md5
one way would be to generate an md5 hash of the user info provided to use as the password

4007263
hash	md5
because the md5 function will always create the same output from a given input it s theoretically possible that someone who knew you were registering what fields were required and what you d most likely put in them they could guess the md5 hash that would be sent to you

4007291
post	get
in my webapp i m using http location headers for redirect post redirect get

4007323
awt	swing
this only affects swing awt but nonetheless

4007339
icmp	tcp
this enumeration lets the program source refer to names like icmp and tcp rather than numbers

4007341
folder	directory
however it actually searches directory like library application support plugins missing the myapp folder

4007378
put	get
so to get ourselves out of this access solution we need to put some time in going over every single report

4007397
int	chars
the int probably has a four-byte alignment requirement so in the first case both of the chars elements need to have three padding bytes appended to them but in the second case you only need two padding bytes after the second chars element because a chars element has an alignment of one byte

4007420
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
if you are trying to measure how long time something takes you should know that the resolution of the time is only about 15ms in ie where it is 1ms in firefox google-chrome and opera

4007432
setinterval	settimeout
in fact most of the time settimeout it s preferred for a reason settimeout will wait the execution of your script setinterval will execute in every interval without waiting

4007451
getter	setter
ever since i read about the anemic domain model something i was doing all the time i have really been trying to get away from creating domain objects that were just buckets of getter and setter and return to my oo roots

4007452
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
this class has touchesmoved and touchesbegan defined

4007452
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
but i need to add more code to each of these classes to the same touchesmoved and touchesbegan methods without overriding the code that is already on its class

4007471
serializable	deserialization
is comparatively easy and requires writing a small wrapper around websockets so that serializable and deserialization happens opaquely to the application

4007559
mouseup	mousedown
i don t recall the details but if you change click to mousedown or mouseup you should have better results

4007605
post	put
http put isn t entirely cross browser so rails i m using rails 3 supports using post and passing the _method query param

4007610
hash	md5
i m trying to generate a signature using md5 or sha1 hash on a linux system

4007666
qpushbutton	qlistwidgetitem
that s because qpushbutton is taking focus away and doesn t pass click event down to qlistwidgetitem

4007694
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu try this

4007696
cpu	processors
the intel amd processors are much cheaper and faster than what you can get with these until they go in every cpu everywhere

4007703
folder	directory
creates a folder systemtempdir index-dir or tmp index-dir if no propertyentry for a temporary directory has been found

4007728
setinterval	clearinterval
to reset automatic calls you could use the clearinterval function on the id returned by the setinterval

4007776
tunnel	vpn
of course the easy way to do this would just be an ssh or vpn tunnel

4007838
portrait	landscape
i display a video using mpmovieplayerviewcontroller in a tabbar application the video plays fine in portrait mode but doesn t rotate in landscape mode

4007843
yacc	bison
you can write a small c++ parser by combining flex or lex and bison or yacc

4007859
clang	llvm
another option is finding a parser using clang llvm

4007880
min	max
i want to get the max min value from each list element in each position

4007908
ant	maven
without using ant maven etc

4007922
width	height
i did this with a custom class where i override the onmeasure call to get width and height

4007922
width	height
in onmeasure you get the width and height for your image so that it fits your view

4007951
submit	submission
you can however add the submit name value pair like a normal form submission from that button would if you re submission from a button for example

4007961
put	get	post	get	post	put
for post requests this was happening just fine but when i wanted to do a put request or a delete request this wouldn t get called somehow or it was being ignored

4007988
postgresql	mysql
usage of existing mysql postgresql instance

4007996
gif	png
the thing is that you put the .+ at the beginning in the wrong order and should not have encapsulated jpg gif png and the point in

4008051
versioning	upgrade
yes the winforms wrapper did get the upgrade and shows the vista versioning

4008115
folder	directory
so the trunk is in the root folder of the svn directory

4008133
for-loop	loops
your for-loop confusion stems from having more loops than you need

4008133
multiplication	modulo	division	multiplication	division	modulo
it works very similarly except you d be using division and modulo arithmetic instead of multiplication in the offset above

4008150
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
this works fine in firefox opera safari and chromium

4008162
width	height
when you set the width and height attribute of an image it resizes the image to fill that area

4008162
width	height
i need to take an arbitrary width and height value and stretch a div containing text to those dimensions

4008162
google-chrome	firefox
oh and i would preferably not like to use html5 because it is a requisite that i need compatibility with ie7+ and firefox google-chrome

4008167
off-by-one	equivalent
they re almost equivalent except the latter version is both more easily readable and more resistant to off-by-one

4008216
subtract	add
if you add a second row_number sorting desc rather than asc you can calculate the total number of records by adding the two rowcounts together and subtract one

4008273
width	height
commenting out width and height assignments i see the tiles but with distorted proportions

4008341
post	get
if it is then a link is the right choice but you should change the js so it makes a get request instead of a post request otherwise you should be looking at using a form instead

4008344
post	get
see this post get an object attributes list in objective-c

4008354
width	height
if i have a given rectangle with the width w height h and angle r

4008390
google-chrome	firefox
i have one but it works only with ie - not with firefox or google-chrome

4008422
int	double
a simple solution is to store the cents in an int as opposed to the dollars in a double

4008425
sorting	grouping
at least i got rid of the sorting grouping in my client code

4008435
persistent	transient
if you annotate a field with transient it will not be persistent

4008449
pop-up	dialog
i expect this line to pop-up the save as dialog box but nothing happens

4008455
dictionary	map
you could use a plain dictionary or create a similar map suited for your needs it will be an array in which you place elements according to an hashvalue you calculate on your 4 values but you ll need to care about collisions

4008546
int	chars
string s an int n and a chars c and returns

4008557
xml-rpc	json-rpc
would you choose an existing one soap xml-rpc json-rpc java rmi amf rpyc corba or an entirely new one

4008581
setinterval	settimeout
i did this with settimeout instead of setinterval because it s a little safer

4008634
rspec	capybara
i use capybara rspec cucumber and pickle in concert to minimize the actual amount of step definitions i have to write and generally it gets the job done

4008669
width	height
so it accepts raw image data xml containing parameters and image width height and then return processed image and some xml report

4008713
post	get
btw this works if you use a get but fails as a post

4008713
post	get
changing post to get o s value is 9 14 2010 12 00 00 am

4008780
turing	decidable
basically decidable is the language for which one can construct an algorithm turing machine that will halt for any finite input with accepting or rejecting the input

4008813
groovy	gsp
in a gsp groovy server page i m using to update a after the server-side call

4008863
maven	pom.xml
if you are using maven s jetty plugin you will need to specify ssl keystore details in your pom.xml file

4008864
getter	setter
this is most likely telling you that some el expression is failing because spring cannot figure out what the type of the name property is based on the getter setter signatures

4008864
getter	setter
if you showed us the declaration of all of the getter and setter for name maybe we can be more specific

4008908
getter	setter
in fact the getter and setter in the bean need to match the contents of the xml

4008913
move	drag
i have some e-mails in my inbox i want them to move to my user defined folders by using drag and drop functionality by using java script

4008947
post	get
it is supposed to intercept a post request and convert it to a get request with the parameters appended to the query string

4008977
width	margin
blocks take up the whole of their parent s width by default minus margin border and padding widths so the 100 doesn t really do anything

4008987
post	get
.ajax gives you a bit flexibility you can choose post or get and you can leave .post in current case

4009020
mp4	webm
according to flash supports flv and mp4 as well as webm eventually

4009020
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome opera firefox support webm

4009020
google-chrome	firefox
for codecs h.264 is supported by flash and google-chrome i think firefox supports theora etc

4009034
mockups	balsamiq
i use balsamiq mockups to draw up the screens then i write a up a page for each screen explaining behaviors

4009038
post	get
in any case you don t have to stop using post to get the benefits of your returned script s variables being global

4009059
post	put
if this is within android which is the tag that is on the post you can put a hook in the oncreate method in which you save what activity you are in to the database table

4009082
put	get	post	get	post	put
because rails validates http verbs get post put .. and webdav uses http extensions like propfind that do not validate throwing the following exception

4009114
rss	feed
i m kind of new to rss feed but i m able to create a feed dynamically using php and it works great

4009183
getter	setter
my personal guess is that the getter is defined in the super class of myobject and only the setter is re-defined or overriden in the myobject class

4009202
min	max
looks like you have defined a macro or maybe a function called min and max in your own code

4009202
min	max
the #include for vector apparently also defines a macro for min and max and the compiler is getting confused

4009202
min	max
change the name of your min and max macros

4009203
int	chars
strcat takes 2 pointers to chars you re supplying a pointer to chars and an int wrongly cast to pointer to chars

4009209
rss	feed
the easiest way to do this a way that does not require client side programming might be setting up an rss feed in php

4009209
rss	feed
there are dozens if not hundreds rss feed readers out there for every conceivable platform

4009209
rss	feed
if i remember correctly windows vista and or 7 have a built-in sidebar widget to display rss feed

4009218
sum	coalesce
the coalesce is to catch the first row which has a sum of null

4009235
post	put
data-size xml very verbose but usually not an issue when using compression and thinking that the write access case through post or put is much more rare as read-access in many cases it is 3 of all traffic

4009273
postgresql	mysql
but i have only tested this on sqlite which don t actually have the alter_table at all so i don t know if it will actually work on mysql postgresql

4009292
udp	tcp
these could communicate over tcpip tcp or udp microsoft networking named pipes mailslots or whatever you have

4009292
udp	tcp
you d probably get to a result more quickly picking one development tool set and using whatever it offers for tcp or udp sockets

4009297
width	height
i imagine i need to set the string to the longest string and then create the button allowing the ui to size it properly then get its height width and set the height width such that it doesn t resize when the button text is changed to the shorter string

4009320
width	height
i am trying to set the width and height of a mask behind a modal window

4009326
tcplistener	tcpclient
if you need bi-directional communication with a custom protocol i would use wcf or the tcplistener and tcpclient classes to create your own socket server and client

4009360
portrait	landscape
i have been able to create portrait pages and landscape pages in separate documents but now require to do this in one document

4009369
ctime	posix
apparently the ctime creation or change time metadata attribute of a file is system dependent as some systems windows store the time that a file was created its birth date and others posix systems linux track the time that it was last updated

4009375
hide	show
i need to hide it in the first load then when hovering it will show

4009381
getter	setter
using synthesize will actually only create a setter and a getter method

4009407
capitalize	uppercase
i would be normalising the surnames before storing them - either all lowercase all uppercase or all capitalize

4009414
fseek	ftell
alternatively before using ftell to get l use fseek to move to the start of the file

4009446
sequence	permutation
generate a random permutation over log_2 n bits at the beginning of sequence using the above method and then swap the bits in the result above

4009514
uiview	subviews
what i implemented already works when the uiscrollview is normal zoom scale but when you zoom in you cannot drag the image to the trashcan because well the trashcan is a subviews of the controller s view itself this was so that it wouldn t zoom with the uiview and of course is not in the right coordinates of the screen for the uiscrollview

4009520
public	protected
when you use private inheritance all public and protected members of the base class become private in the derived class

4009525
public	protected
if you want to access private attributes of a superclas you should do so via public or a protected accessors

4009566
pygtk	pycairo
it seems installing activepython the installing gtk runtime pycairo pyobject pygtk as administrator with compatibility mode for windows xp service pack 2 solved the problem

4009584
actionscript	mxml
either as an attribute on the mxml or in actionscript

4009635
minimum	max
if the minimum length is 17 and the max length is 18 then you guys are looking at this at the wrong way

4009637
ampl	mathprog
another important advantage of ampl is that despite the fact that it is commercial you can avoid the vendor lock-in because there is an open source alternative - gnu mathprog

4009647
mouse	keyboard
classic signs of having a problem like this is the ui thread freezing not getting around to painting and responding to mouse and keyboard events because it is completely overwhelmed by invoke requests

4009679
onenote	ms-office
there is a comprehensive summary of onenote programmability options with code samples for various ms-office versions here

4009687
getter	setter
in java you would need to have a virtual lookup table for fields to support this or alternatively automatically generated getter setter

4009709
qlistwidget	qabstractitemview
after your qlistwidget is created call setselectionmode with one of the multiple selection types passed in probably qabstractitemview extendedselection is the one you want

4009733
client-side	server-side
html5 has built-in support for generic types and client-side regex verification but few browsers support it and you have to assert it server-side anyway

4009789
min	max
i have been able to use this same code to find out the min max and average for the other performance counters but this one keeps giving me the wrong average

4009789
min	max
type last average min max

4009789
min	max
type last average min max

4009793
folder	directory
just don t forget to delete .eclipse folder in your home directory that s where all settings are

4009894
hide	show
i usually need to hide this element but on one page i need to show it

4009896

strlen doesn t account for the null-terminator that strcpy adds you ll need to malloc strlen buffer +1

4009908
sorting	filtering
i had to issue that command because i did some changes on the sorting filtering

4009952
versioning	upgrade
we upgrade the mysql-server on remote1 to 5.1.51 since the problem existed on the previous versioning too

4009982
struts	wicket
jsps work with action-oriented web frameworks struts or spring mvc or pure servlet development wicket is a component oriented framework which works with html and java only

spaces	delimiter
for example lets says we have in our text file which is all separated by the tab delimiter for shortness i just used spaces

4010181
asp.net-mvc	openrasta
and speaking of web asp.net-mvc .net frameworks like asp.net asp.net-mvc castle monorail or openrasta they also normally allow

4010188
post	get
thanks to this post i was able to get this to work

4010194
put	get
just put some numbers down on paper based on a few use cases with different models for the data and get a good gut feeling about how much works is required

4010201
actionscript	mxml
it can also be used to refer to the flex compiler which will turn actionscript and mxml code into a flash application

4010206
httpresponse	request
easiest way to do this is printing out your request object and examining it in the cases in which the function doesn t return an httpresponse object

4010257
queue	fifo
queue - fifo structure - fifo

inherited	subclassing
instead of subclassing array your class instances could delegate to one for the desired methods so that you don t inherited the overridden inspect method

4010620

my advice learn vba if you need it but only learn vb6 if you have a maintenance project that requires it

4014707
int	double
single objects like you do declare a local int or double or myclass temp1

4014730
prepare	execute
and if you want to control a computer from a web browser be prepare to require installing some kind of custom plugin - since browsers can t touch arbitrary files on the local filesystem execute local applications or do other things that are flagrant security risks

4014738
lisp	smalltalk
languages like smalltalk lisp cobol etc

4014738
vb.net	vb6
the chief difference between vb6 and the other languages i mentioned is that the newer version of vb vb.net has been declared by microsoft to replace vb6

4014744

seems when a form submission is cancelled from a beforeunload prompt all forms on the page become unsubmittable the submit event still fires but the submission does not navigate until any form field on the page is changed

4014761
firefox	safari
but in firefox and safari it displays still on right side

4014806
ksort	asort
if your sorting needs are more complex than asort or ksort as previously suggested then write a function to plug into uasort

4014808
hide	show
the problem i m having is that the samples login employee admin don t use the navigationservice to change states within the application - they simply hide show controls when needed

vb.net	vb6
no vb6 s and and or don t short-circuit which is the reason why the short-circuit versions are called andalso and orelse in vb.net â backward compatibility

4014929
int	chars
to add to phimueme s answer above if your string is always two chars then you can build a 16-bit int out of the two 8-bit chars - and switch on that to avoid nested switch case statements

4014990
post	get
in general you ll want to open an httpurlconnection set it up for a post or get to the appropriate url and then send the request and read the response

4015107
post	put
you re giving the webbrowser the html of the form the post data is a serialised format of the names and values of the form fields which is what you need to put in your navigate method

4015109
post	get
not regarding to the calendar specifically but this is what i use to get future post

4015136

mdpi	hdpi
i ve done simple test removed ldpi and mdpi density images launched my app on mdpi skin and it scaled hdpi images nicely

4015178
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
my guess is that there is no easy approach for this except add tons of code to touchesbegan touchesmoved and touchesend in the custom view and map location of the string to the offset in the view

4015193
g++	gcc
edit then you have to link using g++ or with gcc -lstdc++

4015194
children	parent
what i want to made is a kind of boolean expression parser such that on parent nodes i have operator and its operands as children

4015200
folder	directory
i was just wondering if i can put my application files in the jython directory create a batch file with java -jar jython.jar myapp.py and distribute the entire folder

4015245
sorting	filtering
_databaseview is iqueryable object on which all my sorting and filtering logic is done

4015324

i can do get request but have no idea how to make a post

4015346
post	get
there are several ways to perform http get and post requests

4015447
versioning	upgrade
it might be worth pointing out that the installer is performing and upgrade from a previous versioning of the product to a newer versioning

4015447
pop-up	dialog
the first dialog that pop-up is the extracting msi dialog followed by the welcome to upgrade dialog

4015487

remove the quotes around your height and width values

4015526
opera	google-chrome
this is the working javascript code tested in google-chrome opera ie and mozilla

4015532
interpolation	splines
really depend on your definition of smooth however most algorithm of smooth motion use splines to interpolation between 2 or more data points

4015557
hide	show
it is working properly on my iphone but when i am testing it in the ipad i am getting some very strange behavior when you get to the end of a line the keyboard hide for a millisecond and then show itself again immediately

4015557
hide	show
also i have found that removing the lines in the function makes the uitextview grow properly and also doesn t show and hide the keyboard but unfortunately then the uitableviewcell doesn t grow to the proper height

4015570
put	get
then get the custom-pager module also requires token it should let you put together something

4015582
post	get
this may seem too simple but you should always validate your get or post variable before doing anything with them

4015608
google-chrome	firefox
maybe there is something related with this issue firefox and google-chrome slow on localhost

4015610
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
bind is supported by ie9 firefox 4 and newer versions of google-chrome and safari and it allows you to lock a function to a particular context

4015615
erd	diagram
entity relation diagram erd

4015615
entity-relationship	diagram
but if they were on the ball they would ask for either a data model unlikely for an interview or a entity-relationship diagram likely

4015615
entity-relationship	diagram
if you talked pointer and index at the entity-relationship diagram stage in an interview with me i would be showing you the door

4015639
int	double
in colection of objects can contain differnt items string int double etc

4015675
post	put
otherwise will put together a list of the templates myself and post them on the public domain somewhere

4015688
profiling	debugging
i suggest take a look at objectquery.totracestring method by writing the below code before going to profiling and then debugging through your code and examine the value of sql variable

4015792
post	get
session_start creates a session or resumes the current one based on a session identifier passed via a get or post request or passed via a cookie

4015800
width	height
the issue i believe is that webkit for iphone does not provide a native way to scroll content inside a fixed size width height div

4015816
google-chrome	firefox
except firefox and google-chrome will throw a 404 error on the .woff file

4015830
serializable	deserialization
since this is a whole concern in and by itself well you need to design a generic serializable deserialization mechanism on top of your json xml whatever parser you choose that is flexible enough to sustain the potential differences between your 2 data models

4015831
expression-blend	silverlight
in addition since you mention silverlight tim heuer has a blog which covers silverlight and at times touches on expression-blend

4015844
button	checkbox
and the other 2 replace checkbox and radio button respectivly

4015856
ssl	https
thus they are as secure as the https connection which depends on a lot of ssl tls parameters like cipher strength or length of the public key

4015876
mp3	flv
i m currently writing a program that converts a flv video into mp3

4015892

the pushviewcontroller should just push a new viewcontroller into the navigationcontroller that is calling it

4015900
int	double
i d like to get an int or double from that event

4015941
mdpi	hdpi
for example if you put them in the drawable-ldpi folder with the size you want and then test on a emulator runing mdpi setting or hdpi settings the image will be bigger you have to decide properly where to store them acording to your desing

4016059
saas	iaas
iaas is also cloud but not saas

4016059

on the topmost right hand corner a click on the quick guide link to show a quick guide and b click it again to hide it

4016116
listview	gridview
either listview or gridview in asp.net page

4016116
listview	gridview
result to listview or gridview

4016118
int	double
when you enter a double it can not parse neither store the parsed data at the x variable because double uses 64 bits on 32 bits machines and int just 32 bits raising a seg

4016142
h.264	webm
if one hosts his own video files h.264 webm or ogg and flash for each video you can put it on your html5 pages by this and many other method

4016142
h.264	webm
if you don t host and want h.264 or webm codec with flash fallback from your youtube hosted videos you can use this method

4016142
h.264	webm	webkit	gecko
however i am using modernizer and would like to embed my youtube videos without using the iframe but just with direct links to the h.264 webkit and webm gecko file

4016152
post	get
you should look into externals - there s also a post here on how to get started

4016165
children	parent
if child had a previous parent then that parent s children collection no longer contains child

4016186
width	height
width height div

4016217
folder	directory
i want to create a folder in our app local directory .

4016217
folder	directory
current date year month date the root directory of this structure is year inside that current month inside that current date folder

4016227
inherited	properties
every entity inherited from the abstract class entitybase which holds the properties company

4016238
pop-up	dialog
ie introduced restrictions on them dialog unadorned is not available to web pages and createpopup pop-up can no longer obscure other windows which are not going to go away and other browsers never implemented them at all

4016301
accessor	properties
simply you can write the logic of adding the child to the parent collection in the set accessor of the parent properties

4016323
post	get
i tend to route all ajax calls that need to do any crud operations to send a get or post request to a function in the controller and let it handle communicating w the model

4016323
post	get
this is how html css views process data getting it from the model via the controller and sending get post requests to the controller and since js is client-side it shouldn t be treated any differently

4016336
client-side	server-side
are you merely changing properties in javascript representations of the objects client-side or are you somehow invoking server-side methods from the javascript calling into servlets to change the data

4016343
actualheight	actualwidth
please check your code use used value instead you should bind it to actualheight and actualwidth of the stacky

4016369
width	height
i set the autoreszingmask to flexible width and height however on rotate the width changes am assuming because self.view s width changes and its set with a width relative to self.view but the height of it doesn t change to fit the content again

4016369
uiview	subviews
the uilabels are subviews of uiview heirarchies used as headers for sections in my uitableview

4016378
width	height
each of these images will have the same width but potentially differing height they are resized on upload to maintain aspect ratio to meet standard width requirements

4016378
width	height
this however appears to assume any image is of standard height and width

4016378
width	height
we have a predefined width that things will fit into however each image may have a different height

4016379
accessor	properties
i am using binding isasync properties to keep ui responsive and loading data from the get accessor of the properties and proved to be a good option while using mvvm

4016412
int	double
and like this also double int etc .

4016441
hash	salt
one approach which will provide good security if the only people who will need to use the key for any purpose can be trusted absolutely with it is to store the key encrypted with another key a copy of which is stored for each user encrypted with a hash of that user s password salt differently from the one stored for password validation

4016449
folder	directory
the way it is now will look for a localhost folder in the current directory

4016477
put	get
i want to get a single order record with all the comments put together in one field

4016506
guava	lambdaj
i don t think such a library exists but if you want to reimplement it with very few code you can use lambda oriented libraries such as guava or lambdaj

4016508
width	height
the best approach is usually to first set the maximum width and current height then send sizetofit then adjust the width again if necessary

4016518
django	turbogears	pylons	turbogears
if you are planning on writing a larger web app maybe you should look into turbogears pylons or django

4016521
width	height
you ll still need to know the size of the thumbnail image as you ll still need to supply height and width for the div - since you re displaying the thumbnail as a background image you won t be able to have the box scale to the right size automatically

4016521
width	height
but at least now your code can set the values for height and width without worrying about the shape of the play button getting distorted

4016524
prepare	execute
where else do you expect to execute the batch prepare under sybase other than under sybase

4016524
prepare	execute
do vs prepare execute are quite different

4016524
prepare	execute
prepare execute for sybase works just fine in millions of programs

4016524
prepare	execute
execute execute the prepare batch supplies the go and sends the batch to the server and captures whatever is returned according to whatever array variables you have set

4016524
prepare	execute
if you get rid of them and think in terms of execute whatever you have prepare in the batch it might help you to understand the problem better

4016597
getter	setter
i looked up in john resig s article javascript getter and setter but his prototype example didn t work for me

4016597
google-chrome	firefox
worked for me in google-chrome and firefox

4016631
codeigniter	cakephp
codeigniter for example has database migrations and cakephp has scaffolding as well as migrations

4016650
devil	libpng
instead of using libpng directly you might want to consider using devil

4016650
tiff	png
it s intended specifically for the kind of job you seem to be trying to do so it ll generally make it quite a bit easier to do and next month when somebody decides you should display a jpeg or maybe a tiff instead of a png it ll handle that without any major rewrite either

4016678
erlang	lisp
a strong foundation in theory allows you to pick up a very different language like lisp or erlang and know what s going on

4016680
comparator	comparable
difference between comparator and comparable interfaces

4016724
folder	directory
if documentclass.as in in a folder called classes that is in the same directory of your .fla the class filed in your properties panel will be classes.documentclass and your .as package header will be package classes instead of just package

4016767
children	parent
when using nhibernate to retrieve a given parent with children from sql it works fine if there are no children or if there are children with dates that match the where condition

4016767
children	parent
if there are children that do not match the where clause the parent is null

4016767
children	parent
i want to have the parent initialized with an empty list of children

4016875
hash	md5
joux 3 noted that 2-collisions lead to n-collisions if it is feasible to find two messages with the same md5 hash it is effectively no more difficult to find as many messages as the attacker desires with identical md5 hash

4016945
disk	ram
if you use ram to store part of the range of integer value counters you could technically lower the amt of disk access even more

4016961
width	height
more precisely the width of an alert view s frame is 284 points and the height is 141 points

4016971
maven	m2e
you can try updating to the latest version of m2e and maven 3

4016971
maven	m2e
there is a new maven plugin api that tells m2e what files been affected by the maven plugin

4016993
post	get
you can use get instead of post but it sounds like the url will get pretty messy

4017023
inherited	properties
but the problem is they are not giving right results in case of inherted types inherited properties are coming last and the sequence of the data supplied in the form of a | -separated string is not working

4017027
post	get
to view the page you need to login first with post form get session id and proceed to the page

4017089
viewdidload	dealloc
here is viewdidload below followed by the dealloc and the header

4017094
tinyint	boolean
it wasn t my idea to use tinyint column as boolean

4017112
google-chrome	firefox
you d need a prerelease build of firefox minefield or google-chrome canary to run it in

4017120
hide	show
you could reduce your code a bit by simplifying your if else structure since anything besides 1 is the same show hide result and also just call the handler you re binding when the page first loads like this

4017127
hide	show
then the handler just grabs the entry based on that field value and hide show as directed

4017142
hide	show
a quick fix is to hide the div by default and then show it if married is the selected item

4017163
hash	md5
this is not a property of all hash functions but a weakness of the merkleâ damgã rd construction which md5 and sha-1 are based on known as length extension

4017176
serializable	deserialization
you will need to do something like get the list of property names sort them and use the same sorting for serializable and deserialization

4017179
put	get
you must put files directly on the c drive as long pathnames will make the external program not receiving all command line parameters if they get to long

4017182
width	height
you are setting the img src and then immediately trying to get its width and height attributes

4017186
put	get
when i put that import and remove jar files from my app lib it still get me the error

4017187
rss	feed
in the 1st view i load items from a rss feed

4017192
implements	extends
i don t also get why everyone uses things like implements extends interface or others which i find more confusing than putting everything into a single class with public and private visibility or just using functions

4017226
integer	radix
it s used to parse strings and you should use it to convert huepixel i to an integer note that i specify the radix explicitly to avoid numbers being parsed as octal

4017237
multiplying	division
if i were dividing by a constant i would let the compiler strength reduce that specific division likely turning it into a multiplying and some shifts

4017246
width	height
i am not a asp.net guy but jquery has width and height methods not properties like you are using in your code

4017268
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome firefox safari the total height of the table is kept at 500px

4017280
multiplying	add	multiplying	division
so now each division is by a constant which compilers will typically reduce to a series of multiplying shift add instructions as the question mentioned

4017322
rss	feed
firefox doesn t handle the rss feed correctly if its compressed

4017328
versioning	upgrade
for applications that have been developed using recent versioning of java there s no solution other than having users upgrade their java runtime to the minimum versioning required to run the applications

4017369
width	height
if your happy with the use of absolute positioning of div s you could make use of css s support for top left right bottom width and height being specified in centimetres within a print style sheet

4017376
terminate	timeout
the default action for sigalrm is for the kernel to terminate the process so if usleep is implemented in a manner that does not use sigalrm using nanosleep or one of the polling functions with a timeout for instance then usleep would not have registered a handler or otherwise changed the default disposition of the signal

4017382
allocator	stl
my answer though is predicated on your code base using the standard stl allocator which throws on a failed memory allocator

4017392
inline	inlining
some say that inlining should be left to the compiler completely and we shouldn t even bother marking functions as inline

4017412
verilog	hdl
error 10170 verilog hdl syntax error at counter.v 7 near text

4017421
rss	feed
i want to read rss feed with 3 different field title description-1 and description-2

4017479
folder	directory
however the default working directory is my users folder so i need to navigate to my code folder every time i load a new project

4017479
folder	directory
i am wondering if there is a one-line command to set the working directory to the solution folder

4017489
submit	submission
to your submit or click handler to prevent the browser from submission the form and reloading the page

4017512
children	parent
however they want a drill down menu which only shows the parent and the children of the parent so they don t overwhelm the user

4017512
children	parent
i think that what i basically need to do is get the parent id of the child so i can call up just those children

4017540
multiplication	modulo	division	multiplication	division	modulo
you can replace integer division by a constant by multiplication modulo wordsize with a magic number and a shift

4017540
division	multiplication
a good compiler can compute the magic numbers and replace integer division by multiplication and shift if the divisor is constant at compile time

4017557
inline	inlining
will result in significantly more instruction cycles as a function call than as an inline and such functions are best suited to inlining

4017580
google-chrome	firefox
it would be extremely helpful for developing firefox extensions if i could see the source of google-chrome browser content browser.xul with overlays applied

4017616
tcpdf	fpdf
there are extensions and php classes that allow you to directly create a pdf cpdf fpdf tcpdf

4017635
put	get	post	get	post	put

on rotation - to and fro landscape portrait everything works fine

4017787
portrait	landscape
when portrait viewcontroller searchbar with keyboard active -- taps search -- portrait webviewcontroller -- change device orientation to landscape -- landscape webviewcontroller changes to landscape --- heres the problem user taps back to uiviewcontroller landscape

4017801
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended
i m implementing touchesmoved touchesbegan and touchesended on a few uibuttons so that i can slide my fingers over them and have them call the appropriate actions

4017835
put	get	post	get	post	put
use ssl and if you can put your request parameters in a post instead of get

4017836
min	max	range	max	range	min
a - inside a regex is special and is used as range operator if it s not escaped and is surrounded by characters which participate as min and max in the range

4017860
fast-forward	merge
hypothetically yes it is okay to do because git will detect that foo has already merge to master and will fast-forward foo to the state master is in

4017873
viewdidload	viewwillappear
you need to check orientation in viewwillappear or call viewdidload prior to returning from tap on back and then call the proper layout for the chosen orientation

4017903
post	get
i have read a lot of post about it but can t get one to work

4017936
google-chrome	firefox
you can do this by passing the selenium ide google-chrome xul to the -chrome argument accepted by the firefox executable

4017941
client-side	server-side
i know that client-side technologies like flash can detect file sizes before upload but we need a server-side workaround because we re wanting to target platforms that have no flash java activex silverlight support

4017967
post	get
wsgi web process which handles get post processing

4018037
public	protected	inherited	properties
an inherited class inherited all public and protected members methods and properties

using the sealed modifiers with make it non-overridable but still accessible to your inherited class

4018038
portrait	landscape
if the keyboard is open in portrait and i rotate to landscape the keyboard appears in landscape

4018099
pop-up	dialog
i know it s not impossible to get the keyboard cursor caret coordinates in these applications because when i use the yahoo keykey ime in them it pop-up a dialog right where the keyboard cursor is positioned

4018113
salt	md5
it s likely safe enough to tack on an md5 of the url parameters along with some salt

4018120
public	protected
for example when you define an interface a factory and a protected class that implements it in a library you might want to compare the class against other instances of the base interface rather than of the class itself which is not public

4018139
tlbimp	atl
i suggest you write your dlls in c++ expose their public classes to com using atl or similar then have tlbimp generate a thin c# wrapper around the com interfaces

4018185
folder	directory
from the standard directory structure we can see that forms aren t in the model folder nor in the view folder because zend_form is a specific class that tie many resources and layers together

4018205
submit	submission
firebug may not appear to update the value of a hidden field under special circumstances i ve witnessed this but been unable to find a reliable test case to submit a bug - get a 2nd verification from javascript or submission the page

4018257
children	parent
i guess this is not really about human parent and children but

4018257
children	parent
when parent is an aggregate root for children i would implement adding a new child to a parent like this

4018263
invokerequired	begininvoke
also please note that invoke begininvoke invokerequired are not available from my component-derived class since component doesn t provide them

4018266
pull	push
i know it sounds like too-good-to-be-true snake oil but your folks can just hg pull and hg merge and hg push when they re through and without anyone having to think about branch names or who has what clone or anything you ll have a coordinated center with disconnected work

4018270
vim	gedit
most graphical editors have some plugins available to do that like vim gedit or eclipse

4018287
printf	strcpy	printf	strdup	strcpy	strdup
in c they are the same a string is a char array and you have a lot of standard methods to handle them like printf strcat strcpy strdup strchr strstr.

set your plugin control to be 100 height and width then use a div around it to control its size

4019192
width	height
forget about controlling a div and use htmlpage.plugin from your managed code this avoids the javascript bridge and gives you access to the plugin container itself then you can just set the width height like this

4019198

rsa	aes
the solution is to use good strong aes encryption in combination with public-key crypto rsa

4020659
client-side	server-side
the wikipedia page on web development gives a very broad overview of how things like server-side client-side etc fit together - so broad as to not be particularly useful for those wanting to achieve anything in particular but suitable for people coming across web development from not knowing the difference between an application and a programming language

hash	salt
store both the salt and hash password in the database

4021065
hash	salt
one response says that the user s salt should be retrieved appended to their inputted password hash and then compared to the stored hash but doesn t this raise some issues

4021065
hash	salt
if someone wanted to brute-force a certain account s password wouldn t they be able to retrieve the salt that was sent back from the server to hash the inputted password thereby eliminating the security that having a salt adds

4021085
filesystems	hfs+
except for hfs+ unix filesystems are completely oblivious to character encoding although sensible people use utf-8 of course.

4021086
hash	salt
security introduced by salt is that you obtain hash for something much bigger and non-standard than the plain password

4021086
hash	salt
it s also reccomended to take hash several times recursively maybe readding the salt at each iterations so that brute force will take much longer

4021096
postgresql	mysql
i understand that in django the orm doesn t support the enum type in mysql or postgresql as this was originally a mysql extension and not portable across other db types

4021112
hash	salt
keep in mind the purpose of the salt to make it harder for someone to precalculate hash codes and therefore be able to look up passwords in the case of the database being compromised

4021112
hash	salt
an 8 bit salt makes the hash space 256 times bigger making precalculation that much harder

width	height
you compare the aspect ratio of the image and the browserwindow look at the difference and then resize the width or height based on how the aspect ratio s are comparing

4021948
width	height
i also gave it percentual width height although that might not be neccesary wanted

4021952
vim	emacs
however if you re just looking for an editor that will show you changes you just made in the last few minutes vim and emacs both have the concept of undo trees that let you visualize the undos and rewrites you ve made in the course of a session

width	height
i tried setting width and height of relativelayout to be bigger than screen size - it works but only partially if the image is positioned completely off-screen it does not work and if the image is partially visible it is not cropped but that works only for right and bottom sides

4021967
vim	emacs
yes both emacs and vim can do this

4021967
vim	emacs
however i agree with the other answers a version control system would be more appropriate and easier to learn assuming you don t already know emacs or vim

4022042
int	chars
int my_func const chars key

4022092
hash	md5
you are currently using an md5 hash as a sort of fingerprint but this is unsuitable in this case because slight differences in the input of a good cryptographic hashing function produce very large differences in the hash

4022092
hash	md5
this will mean that two very similar frames will have a totally different md5 hash so from the hash you d never know they were similar

4022184
width	height
i have set in css the height of an image to a certain value and the width modifies automatically so that the aspect ratio is preserved

4022184
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and internet explorer this works great but in google-chrome and safari the width returned is always 0 for each image

4022206
public	protected
although you can use structures in place of classes but structures lacks the ability to implement access identifiers such as private public protected

4022206
public	protected
if you are using classes just for holding variables you can use structures as well but if your class contains some private protected or public methods or variables properties you can not use structures

4022223
put	get	post	get	post	put
there s nothing wrong with using the same url for different request methods get post put delete head etc

4022257
children	parent
once you have track of parent and children you can force their unloading

4022258
getter	setter
the fact that you currently have only getter and setter doesn t mean anything

4022260
apache	nginx
so my best option is to detect check if server supports x-accel-redirect in case of nginx x-sendfile in case of apache

4022299
config	ini
the format of the config file is free it can be ini xml and so on but the more human-friendly the better

4022300
put	get
it supports sftp and allows synchronize keepuptodate get put and delete on folders and files

4022303
inherited	properties
if you did not explicitly set the control s itemsource properties this exception may be caused by a change in the value of the inherited regionmanager attached properties

4022313
public	protected
if the child s property is protected or public all works fine but if the child s property is private it fails without error just nothing happens

4022313
inherited	properties
usually a private properties should never be accessible from outside so i implemented throwing __set- and __get-methods in my ultimate base class from which all classes inherited

4022326
thin	unicorn	apache	nginx	passenger	unicorn	passenger	thin
but it s more advice to use a web-server apache nginx lighthttp and rack compiliant server passenger thin unicorn

4022352
inherited	properties
private methods and properties cannot be inherited or reached

4022354
maven	pom.xml
the hudson jobs are configured from the maven pom.xml files and the dependency appears on hudson as downstream upstream project

4022359
public	protected
1 do not define public or protected internal protected friend in visual basic constructors in abstract types

4022369
mef	prism
i have mef prism 4 project for which i can resolve imports via the importingconstructor but not via field imports in the same class

4022373
post	get
i rather interpret this sentence that it should not be possible that a get request on the same url does not cause the same as a post request

4022387
ubuntu	linux
we have a linux module developed by a 3rd party now the module runs correctly on a fedora system but on ubuntu the same fails

4022394
public	protected
i believe rule 1 is about public and protected internal rule 2 is about protected and internal

4022409
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested it on windows and osx with ie firefox safari and google-chrome

4022434
integer	unsigned
not a valid unsigned integer

4022495
scheme	racket
but the executable i m trying to sign is produced using racket a scheme implementation which assembles a standalone executable from racket scheme code by cloning the real racket executable and editing the mach-o file directly

4022501
int	chars
match the number and convert to int then to chars

4022542
cvs	svn
the first option would be a simple api on top of svn or cvs and use a db backend to track tags uploader comments etc

4022575
width	height
what i want to do is change the size of the popup so it shows my whole calendar but i can t manage to change it... i ve tried using height width minheight minwidth.

4022577
config	ini
perl has modules for many different formats of config file including json and ini

4022589
gridview	sqldatasource
i ve bound a number of gridview to sqldatasource which execute a stored procedure

4022600
stdout	stderr
every process has 3 fd stdin stdout stderr

4022611
width	height
at the moment i have a label being sized correctly using astring sizewithfont constrainedtosize linebreakmode but i ve introduced rotation into my device and with a flexible width and height this results in my uilabel stretching width ways because its set relative to the main view but not then contracting height-wise to compensate for the extra space

4022658
jquery	jqmodal
i m trying to get the jquery jqmodal extension to work as a confirm box as per the example given on the jqmodal website and incoprate this function into a dotnet usercontrol so i can re-use it over the website

4022666
folder	directory
for asp.net application the working directory is the system folder c windows system32

4022775
post	get
i am having a nightmare trying to get this working and have looked at other post but am still having an issue

4022807
post	get
i m not sure with post requests but in get requests you usually use square bracket notation for multi-dimension arrays

4022860
width	height
1 create a view that is 2 screen width 1 screen height

4022871
gif	png
after they select the folder i would like to scan that folder and list all the images jpg png and gif in my windows form application

4022939
vb.net	vb6
basically when i use vb.net or c#.net to do this it works perfectly but when i use vb6 it doesn t work in my for-loop where the relevant service in the relevant device is captured here is the code that returns no result.

4022977
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
i would definitely try to resolve this with composition instead of inherited by associating the needed properties traits to employee instead of subclassing it

4022992
qobject	qwidget
since qsystemtrayicon is a qobject not a qwidget my guess is this is not possible

4022992
kde	gnome
the system tray icon isn t really owned by qt - it s passed on to the desktop i.e whatever part of the gnome kde windows mac is drawing the relevant area

4022992
kde	gnome
for gnome and kde it s a freedesktop.org standard but again i don t think its your process which actually does the drawing and hence there s no way for qt to get events such as drag and drop to you

4023007
range	minimum
range minimum query and lowest common ancestor 1

4023084
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome ie8 safari firefox etc it looks fine

4023134
sorting	filtering
the following article deals with the filtering and sorting

4023159
for-loop	arrays
it does not have a predetermined limit to the number of iterations in the for-loop which means that the stringa and stringb arrays could continue to grow in size while this code is running

4023184
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i want to fade in some images after the background image has load so thanks for the explanation all is working well on firefox safari and google-chrome

4023215
int	chars
note that if the length of the string is odd second will have one more chars than first due to the rounding in the int division.

4023219
ubuntu	linux
it doesn t seem to be entirely reliable though yi jiang can t get it to work on a tft using ubuntu linux

4023264
cos	sqrt	cos	sin	sin	sqrt
2 cos -1 w 2 sin -1 sqrt x 2 +y 2 +z 2

4023264
cos	sqrt
and if we plug in w sqrt 1 - 0 + 1 + 0 your unit quaternion is 0 0 1 0 and it will rotate by angle 2 cos -1 0 2 90 degrees 180 degrees or pi radians.

4023270
versioning	upgrade
or did you initially use the express versioning but upgrade to full vs because of a feature lacking

4023270
getter	setter
edit not having encapsulate field in express used to be annoying though though the introduction of automatic getter and setter has pretty much canceled that out i think

4023294
uicontrol	uibutton
i realise i could use uicontrol but that s considerably more work since i need to handle the label subview myself and get the artist to produce highlighted versions of the artwork - uibutton is doing all that nicely if i could only disable the well effect

4023316
int	chars
there s exist function calloc in standard c library for your case it inits allocated area with 0 s which corresponds to chars short int long 0 0.0 and null

4023335
implements	extends
this means that i need to extends the test for error modes with my own methods for propagating these errors and then i start questioning whether i should just implements something completely different and not go for the idataerrorinfo interface at all

4023346
wmv	flv
my client ask videos must be no longer than 2 minutes and in either quicktime wmv mp4 or flv format.

4023358
super	extends
extends the notion if you write super it refers to constructor of the base class and if you write this it refers to the constructor of the very class where you are writing this code

4023367
public	protected
super allows you to access public protected method attributes of parent base class

4023409
memcpy	memmove
also the reason memmove and memcpy are provided by the compiler is that they are sometimes written in tuned assembly for the target cpu using a specialized instruction

4023500
codeigniter	cakephp
some frameworks you can have a look cakephp codeigniter zend framework symfony

4023502
sorting	filtering
and helpers for most specific tasks closer to the action like sorting filtering pagination json encoding pdf download avoiding duplication of code in many actions

4023503
unsigned	short
for example is there a size_t alternative to unsigned short

4023538
post	get
in rails you don t have specific post or get parameters

4023538
post	get
you do have a post or get request

4023538
put	get
or you can check for other http verbs get put and delete

4023550
dotnetzip	sharpziplib
there are other libraries that do archiving the proper way and are faster easier to use and with ore features dotnetzip and sharpziplib

4023558
google-chrome	firefox
while this code works perfectly on firefox and google-chrome it doesn t seem to work on ie8

4023563
memcpy	memmove
you can t implement either memcpy or memmove all that efficiently in portable code because the platform-specific implementation is likely to kick your butt whatever you do

4023654
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
i then set my form to inherited from that subclassing and the properties now display in the properties box

4023672
hash	salt	hash	hmac
if you re concerned about replay attacks you could use an hmac to validate cookie session requests by having the session id datetime username if that s part of your data maybe ip address in a string followed by a one-way salt hash of this data

4023694
implements	extends
the point is i don t want to force client s classes like person to implements my own interface or to extends my own class

4023701
google-chrome	firefox
after some debugging i think it s the xmlhttprequest status property when i try to alert this status in the corresponding javascript function ie shows an exclamationsign at the leftbottom corner with some vague not further defined error message while in ie8 firefox and google-chrome this is no problem at all

4023707
apache	nginx
i wound up with nginx serving static resources and proxying framework requests to apache and mod_python -- if i recall correctly my app had a mod_python dependency

4023707
apache	nginx
proxying nginx to apache assumes you already have apache serving django successfully so maybe not so useful for you

4023726
google-chrome	firefox
not elegant as what google-chrome or firefox offer but it will still work

4023731
x509certificate	bouncycastle
i have looked at x509certificate2 and also the bouncycastle x509certificate classes but can t see how to get the key size

4023744
public	protected
since that dependency is invoked through it s public facing interface by foo you stub the method that triggers the protected method within the dependency

4023744
implements	extends
if however there is no dependency but the call to the api is made from the testclass then you have to write a custom class that extends your testclass and implements it s own api calling function

4023752
implements	extends
putting it in a webview is what will make this tricky if it were just a regular view i would say extends textview and implements onlongclicklistener for it as well

4023774
hide	show
i am spending a lot for my time for a simple things i think.i want to hide and show a sprite

4023795
webclient	httpwebrequest
you can do this either with the httpwebrequest or webclient classes depending on your specific needs

4023834
width	height
here is an example of using a div 100 width + height containing an img tag to use as the background might be worth a look

4023843
post	get
i will post a tutorial as soon as i get a spare weekend

4023860
viewdidload	didreceivememorywarning
in the didreceivememorywarning you should also free as much data as you can - if you store some part of data model in viewcontroller release it and reconstruct in viewdidload that would be called when your view is loaded again when user navigates back to this controller

4023876
width	height
the box s height and width will vary as the browser is resized

4023886
getter	setter
other than that i see no other way but to assign the atomic pk properties to member variables in one or several different entityhome components of course requiring entityhome subclasses with resprective getter and setter

4023888
versioning	upgrade
initially the mysql code was written for 5.0.51a and the running mysql versioning it was somehow attempted to be upgrade was 5.0.21

4023910
jobs	cron
edit the production servers can now set a 10 minute timeout on urlfetches initiated from taskqueue or cron jobs so these objections might not apply anymore

4023922
equals	gethashcode
you can overcome this by overriding equals and gethashcode

4023932
post	get
but then above that i m trying to get an if asking whether there are any post within a custom post type that i ve defined

4023972

4024319
google-chrome	firefox
the button print and the zoom option only is showed in ie browser but i need it showing in google-chrome and firefox too

4024342
versioning	upgrade
you ll only find yourself in a world of hurt browsers get upgrade to implement features and your user agent sniff might still exclude them user agent strings can be spoofed and good old opera likes to report itself as internet explorer in older versioning

4024389
mp3	wav
i have a song in mp3 or wav and i want to accelerate the speed of it while playing it

4024444

it saves to disk in case of power failure resulting in loss of all data in the ram

4024506
setinterval	settimeout
found some explanation on how settimeout and setinterval works to see which is best for your purpose

4024528
mp4	webm
however yes for viewer convenience most video-sharing sites do convert uploaded files into flv orâ these days more likelyâ mp4 which plays on recent flash players as well as some html5 implementations possibly with ogv or webm as well for html5 browsers that don t implement mp4 for licensing reasons

4024570
width	height
using the map.panto method i can pan to them but the animation only works if the second point is less than the width height of the map

4024618
int	boolean
for n and number of user-defined int or floating point types suitable definitions and type conversions may be required the key point here is the boolean pos construct which ada guarantees will give you a 0 or 1 for the predefined boolean type.

4024655
put	get
here is some example approach if you get data fragments and you have to put these fragments together to a whole message

4024806
int	chars
i am new in c++ programming and i have been trying to convert from const chars to unsigned int with no luck

4024815
onkeyup	onkeydown
set an onkeyup or onkeydown event on your textarea the latter is better because it fires before the new line is added to the textarea

4024827
folder	directory
i have also considered using a batch file to create the mappings and do the copy but i wasn t sure how easily it would be to accomplish because the folder to copy from will not always be the same - it will always be within one directory but the subdirectory name changes

4024829
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

4024830
inherited	properties
out of the box you may be able to inherited from webcontrol and change the tagname properties to return a script tag but out of the box i don t think what you are asking to do is possible with intellisense support

4024850
strtol	atoi
or good old c functions atoi and strtol

pull	push
my workflow is to work in a branch and pull from the remote into local master then rebase my working branch merge the branch with local master then push to the remote repo

4024859
mouseup	mousedown
it stores the selection range s or textrange ie 8 in the mousedown event of the element and reselects those ranges in the mouseup event

4024868
int	chars
atoi function will convert const chars to int which can be implicitly converted to unsigned

4024873
children	parent
but it s better to just add a certain class to your parent element and then use normal css to style the children

4024908
post	get
i feel this may be the solution to my problem as later in the post it shows pixel manipulation of the image but i don t quite get what exactly it means by context.drawimage is allowed for copying areas from images hosted on other domains and it would be really helpful if someone could clarify it for me

4024910
integer	unsigned
or if charval is the pointer to the first byte of an unsigned integer then

4024957
mousemove	mouseenter
you cannot get the mouseenter|mouseover event for a part of a element that is below another element but if you know the dimensions and the position of the element you can listen for mousemove event and get when the mouseenter in some particular area

validationsummary	customvalidator
i have found a workaround for when javascript is disabled and the validationsummary does not show the errormessage property of the customvalidator

4025240
validationsummary	customvalidator
provided the customvalidatorproxy is before the customvalidator in the validatorcollection of the page then the servervalidate handler will override the isvalid property value that the customvalidatorproxy would have returned having validated the controltovalidate value and your errormessage from your customvalidator will be displayed in the validationsummary

4025241
post	get
i have a wcf service that exposes some methods with webinvoke and post method this has been working on a windows 2003 server machine for some time now the thing is that i have to migrate the service to a new windows 2008 server machine and this is where i m getting the issue i get error 400 bad request when i try to call from the client

4025241
post	get
i had another wcf service based on the same philosophy also working on the 2003 server machine so i tried to deploy it on the 2008 server i found out that get methods worked correctly on both machines but if i try to consume a very simple post method then i get an error 500

matlab	simulink
afaik matlab allows to process only one picture frame at a time surely you could elaborate an algorithm to compute a stream but using simulink you can process the stream directly

4025424
matlab	simulink
on the other hand i found aforge a lot friendlier and easier to use since you can easily adjust the processing parameters from a gui not so fast easy to do in matlab simulink

4025516
hash	md5
in that case some hash functions are somewhat faster than other md5 being one of the fast functions but md4 is faster and it is simple enough that its code can be included in any application without much hassle

4025516
hash	md5
first you will like to use one of the cryptographically unbroken hash function hence sha-256 or sha-512 not md4 md5 or sha-1 the weaknesses found in md4 md5 and sha-1 might not apply to a specific situation but this is a subtle matter and it is better to play safe

4025516
hash	hmac
hmac is a standard way of building a mac out of a hash function

int	chars
so basically it depends how you interpret the value as a int value or as a chars

4026157
hash	salt
by the way i cannot recommend enough that you also salt the password and iterate the hash to prevent brute-force attacks in the event that an attacker obtains the hash value

4026163
cpu	processors
one addition for embedded cpu architecture they have to be usually cheaper than mainstream processors so that they do not raise the product s life considerably

subtract	add
there is no way to handle the carry in out needed for your add and subtract modes to work properly the bitwise and or should work ok however

4026585
bpmn	jbpm
actually there is a web-based bpmn process editor that comes with jbpm

4026617
folder	directory
you should create a directory for each user_id in the public images folder of your application then store the images for each user there

4026669
hide	show
note that when you change the setting to a lower number that you had before vs will delete the excess items from your list not just hide them so when you revert your setting the items won t show up until you explicitly open them again

4026676
webclient	httpwebrequest
you can use the httpwebrequest or webclient classes to make requests

4026707
freemarker	velocity
others are more limited designed specifically for templating such as velocity and freemarker both utilities for java

4026713
filtering	grouping
it s no big deal if you just need straightforward simple bulk queries however i ve got to do some more complex joining and filtering unions case-sensitivity grouping the occasional join etc...

4026714
int	double
usually you ll get your primitive types to have the specified tag as well as handling types such as int bool double is a problem since they ve got default values defined and not setting the specified tag will cause those values to default to their default defined value

4026759

4026762
fgets	fgetc
actually it may be better to fgetc rather than fgets

4026792
width	margin
you would then have a div container inside your body tag that has a width and margin set to auto

4026823
cpu	processors
because of c c++ compiles to native machine code it will run a lot faster than running your bytecode in the java virtual machine jvm which is in fact a virtual processors that translates the bytecode to the local machine its native code depending on cpu instruction set like x86 x64 arm ....

4026839
getter	setter
i m not really sure what is a good practice to cover setter and getter or not

4026839
getter	setter
if yes i m not sure how because to verify the setter method you need to call the getter for this variable and vice versa

4026839
getter	setter
where i went is just similar tests for setter and getter

4026858
getter	setter
if your getter and setter are simply getting and setting a backing variable then writing unit tests for them does not provide much value as you are essentially testing that the language and compiler are doing what they are supposed to

4026862
getter	setter
if you care about coverage metrics setter and getter can kill you

4026862
getter	setter
for example if you are testing a dao you can use the setter and getter when you write you testsave method.

4026862
getter	setter
to make life easier you might be able to write a reflection based test utility to test setter and getter

4026884
mouse	keyboard
but this gets a little crazy in an example like this where i just want to hold all of my mouse and keyboard interaction in its own class because its getting huge but i have run into the need to this time and time again and cant seem to figure it out

4026912
getter	setter
getter and setter are trivial to code and are often generated for you by your ide

4026921
getter	setter
if you practice tdd test-driven design the setter and getter will emerge only as you have a need for them - you don t just automatically create them up front just in case

4026983
folder	dir	folder	directory
i m accessing the scripting apis from the installation folder as it s the same dir as my web service .dll and the files aren t corrupt because if i stick an .exe with the dsso sample code in that same directory i can see it connect just fine in the debugger

4026993
puts	putchar
overloaded functions in the c++ standard library often hide this fact so maybe an example from c will be more useful putchar takes a single character so only n is correct whereas puts and printf take a string and in that case only n is correct

4027019
getter	setter
bingoupdate constructor does not do much -- just getter and setter

4027261
maven	pom.xml
as i mentioned in a comment below i want to remove them from the pom.xml because even though they are in my local maven repository while maven is building the project it always says it is trying to download each of these local dependencies adding extra time onto each build cycle

4027261
maven	pom.xml
you can tell maven to generate this pom.xml for you when installing a jar in your local repository using

4027261
maven	pom.xml
as you correctly guessed the htmlunit that is in my local maven repository does not have pom.xml files

free	malloc
i keep telling them that as long as you know what your doing and you delete your new s and free your malloc s then c isn t a problem

all works great with the exception of when pressing the fullscreen minimized icon the two diagonal arrows pointing to each other next to the play back controls

4027879
fullscreen	minimized
i would really like to eliminate the fullscreen minimized icon but from i can tell that does not seem possible

explode	implode
update changed explode to implode i always get those confused

4028573
wxpython	ttk
in the past we would have used wxpython to create simple gui interfaces for our command line utilities but we re re-thinking this strategy in favor of using tkinter ttk for these use cases

4028573
wxpython	ttk

this style of having separate actions for calling get to view the form for creating an object and calling post to actually create the object seems to work well within a single controller

4028597
google-chrome	firefox
with the latest version of google-chrome the hotkey is the same as firefox on mac it s shift-command-del

4028597
firefox	safari
however they haven t focused the clear browsing data button so you have to use your mouse to click that button -- which is a total pia when compared to firefox shift-command-del + return or safari option-command-e + return

4028612
gmail	hotmail
it s strange that gmail hotmail mail on the mac and thunderbird on the mac display the emails fine

4028616
dlsym	dlopen
you may want to look at things like dlopen and dlsym -- for manually accessing dynamic libraries.

4028616
dlsym	dlopen
with respect to debugging let me just mention that when i intercepted malloc i found that somewhere inside dlopen dlsym were calls to malloc

i verified that this function does indeed get called before the pagerequestmanager begins its dirty work so i was able to put my calls to removenonessentialpostbackvalues in there

4028928
lisp	scheme
this is of course subjective but i think learning common lisp or standard scheme is generally more useful just for the simple fact that you then will not be limited to one compiler

4028949
ubuntu	linux
working on some linux ubuntu systems running some in-house c and c++ apps gcc

4028956
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this would work on all current versions of safari google-chrome and firefox

4028967
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i was loading up an array from a database in viewdidload that would populate the components but i was calling to reload the picker from viewwillappear meaning that the array that provided the datasource was not reloaded at the same time as the picker and thus not reflecting changed values

4028983
google-chrome	firefox
as mentioned by jnpcl it is possible to create a google-chrome uri within the browser but as i understand it that requires a full-fledged firefox add-on rather than just a greasemonkey script

4029124
folder	directory
what i did was that i removed the hibernate-annotations.jar hibernate-commons-annotations.jar hibernate-core.jar hibernate-entitymanager.jar hibernate-jmx.jar and hibernate-validator.jar from that folder and put my hibernate 3.4 jars into server default lib directory

4029222
range	max
when i use the max function on the date column the other columns all display their maxes for the same date range

4029222
range	max
so while i m trying to find new_qty for the latest date the latest date pops up just fine but the new_qty is the max for the entire range

4029228
updatepanel	scriptmanager
if this is the case and you re developing pages with asp.net you could be using the standard asp.net ajax tools a scriptmanager and an updatepanel although an awful lot of people prefer to use jquery

4029247
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
aggregate-functions ie count min max sum etc only operate on the value s supplied in case you re combining the value of two or more columns before the aggregate-functions is applied -- other columns are only a guaranteed relationship if the columns not mentioned in aggregate-functions are stated in the group by clause

4029280
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
the functions in os.path seem to be acting as though they were case-insensitive but the open function seems to be case-sensitive

4029287
lisp	smalltalk
to avoid the debate about what pl to consider we can also fix this and pick java as an statically typed oo representative smalltalk as a dynamically typed representative haskell as a functional representative scala as a hybrid oo functional representative lisp as a meta-programming representative javascript as a prototype-based representative

4029420
istream	getline
what happens is istream getline reads up to the limit then stops

4029420
istream	getline
though there are times when you want to use istream getline this isn t one of them use std string and std getline

4029420
istream	getline
the only reason to use istream getline is when you must limit possibly-malicious input from consuming too much memory

4029428
google-chrome	firefox
doesn t work in firefox google-chrome but semi-works in ie8

4029440
onclick	preventdefault
then when they click on that label preventdefault won t be called and it will just work by virtue of the fact that they added an onclick attribute

4029515
set	bag
you are probably using fluent automapping which is guessing the type as bag instead of set based on the interface type

4029529
ant	pom.xml	ant	maven	maven	pom.xml
i don t know what your ant script looks like but assuming its a basic script for building you will need to create a pom.xml file for your project add your dependencies and then build it via maven

4029532
maven	pom.xml
and i d rather not introduce maven pom.xml files just to get files into nexus

4029582

i can give a specific width and height do the div

4029582
width	height
the div as width of 600 and height of 500

my application present realtime data by using uitableview which may contains maximum 34 customized cells so when receiving update data i have to do reloaddata for that uitableview it usually be reloaded 2-3 times second to update 2-5 cells and addition that when a cell is updated i use uiview animation to blinking the related text label

4029706
getter	setter
with hibernate template configured in the xml there is a bean injection therefore i changed the dao files to add getter setter to a hibernate template property

you should create a method you ve called it fractionsums here and invoke it to calculate the fraction sum and return a double pass the int n to the method

4029996
int	double
that method can be either recursive or iterative but since you say i need to write a method where the parameter accepts an int n in this case and returns the sum of the first n terms of the sequence you should make the method return something either a float or a double

4034046
portrait	landscape
you are explicitly setting the height to 150 when you rotate to landscape but don t adjust it back when you go back to portrait

4034049
jtextfield	jlabel
but an alternative that some might find simpler is to use a jtextfield instead of a jlabel for rendering then you can use jtextfields highlighting capabilities i.e

you can change the properties of a jtextfield so it looks like a jlabel in other respects

in a sense the inverse of rjava is jri

4035011
scheme	racket
plt racket which was formerly plt scheme is a very good scheme development and learning environment

4035011
scheme	racket
the original primary focus of plt scheme was didactic the renaming from scheme to racket is a bad pun but is intended to indicate the system is also mature and sufficient enough for productive real world use

4035583
rss	feed
its the delicious rss feed

4035606
freetype	libpng
important to note if you plan on doing extensive manipulation you ll likely want to make sure you have the jpeg-6b and libpng packages installed and linked when compiling php or make sure that your host has done so gif support is automatically included along with freetype libraries

4035718
width	height
my current goal is to render every character from 0 to 255 and store the appropriate information in a glyph object top and left positions of the character width and height and an opengl texture

4035718
width	height
first i got all characters garbled but then i checked out this question and figured out i had to copy the bitmap buffer into a new one with opengl required texture sizes a power of two for both width and height

4035720
inherited	properties
and finally you have obj.hasownproperty prop which checks if the object has prop as it s own properties can t be an inherited one

take a look at the jquery api for ajax get post

4035909
g++	gcc
since i intend to write c++ i followed the example but used the swing -c++ option and used g++ rather than gcc as the compiler

4035954
width	height
you ll need to either pass the height and width to the kernel function or copy a constant to the card before you call the kernel

4035976
rss	feed
on another note if you are not doing anything fancy you probably donâ t need to use curl to fetch the rss feed xml content

4035980
post	get
one solution would be to have a method wrap the call get the result and post a notification that includes the result in the user info

4035983
kde	gnome
from my understanding the x server is what makes all the visuals possible and atop that there are the various ui environments like kde gnome and others

4035983
kde	gnome
but for instance i have always thought that running under certain ui environments restricted you to programs that utilize that environment until i realized i m able to use kde utilities and software under gnome and vice versa which retain the look of their native environment

4035987
post	get
association needs to work on get and post

4035987
post	get
if i manually navigate to everything works perfectly so get and post are both working fine..

4035998

move	drag
i usually start commenting out partials to see if one of them is causing the drag and from there move back to the controller to pay close attention to what s getting loaded

4036017
post	get
it s doing a post instead of a get

4036039
hash	salt
note although in this case the hash salt name implies i might know the length of the original string this is unknown in the general case

4036086
kde	gnome
gnome and kde are desktop environment examples of this

put	get
if you search an insecure location an attacker can put a malicious dll there and get your program to load and execute it

4036112

select the type of deployment jar file war file ear file etc

4036131
post	get
why not just wrap the entire table in a form and change get to post unless you know that you re not going to be sending more than the max amount of data a get request can send

4036143
post	get
i think you should separate out your controller actions into a get action and a post action like so

4036151
atan2	sqrt
about z atan2 y sqrt x x + z z

4036151
atan2	sqrt
about y atan2 x sqrt y y + z z

4036272
int	double	int	chars
bar bar int bool chars double and you re smooth sailing

4036281
rss	feed
i m pretty sure google is using a cached result because your feed is completely empty which is invalid rss which is probably interpreted as an error condition like the feed being down

4036289
vmware	virtualbox
there is also a project supplying a liveandroid cd image suitable for running in virtualbox vmware or microsoft virtual pc which may expedite proof of concept

4036375

crate supposedly cross-platform but i found only 1 usage example that s written in 2008 out of 2 hours of googling and the example basically covers a very specific subset of applications some ssl https authentication gem or w e...

4036407
put	get	post	get	post	put
it uses all the features of http protocol such as all four main http methods post get put delete error codes and many other things so it covers almost everything you may want

4036449
std	ostream
in particular it will look for either a member-function overload of std ostream won t exist or a free function that you should overload with the following prototype

4036486
subtract	add
you can then add or subtract the facing direction with the change in angle

4036499

because there is no way to get access to the isolated storage path by program you can not tell sql server to put things there

4036570

windows-integrated authentication uses either ntlm or kerberos

4036570

if you decide to return the parent entity without the populated children when the original query with the where clause yields no records any code that hits the set of children will cause nhibernate to load the entire table

4036677
wordpress	expressionengine
in order to make wordpress or drupal do the same out of the box features expressionengine has takes a bit of tweaking or php knowledge

4036677
wordpress	expressionengine
i primarily work with projects now using django which is a python framework and will have a bigger learning curve than wordpress expressionengine or symphony

4036678
filtering	grouping
add a datasource to the repeater control template that returns a grouping record filtering on the hidden input control

4036706

for those attempting to use the tessnet2 assembly for the tesseract ocr engine in c# and who are running into the problem of the tesseract.init method causing your app to crash - i found one possible cause

4036758
google-chrome	firefox
but here s the problem - internet explorer behaves differently from firefox and google-chrome

4036758
hide	show
the latter will show and hide the as it should

4036758
hide	show
the answer i have found to be is that in ie you can t change a position from relative to absolute and vice versa when you show hide it

4036794
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome safari

4036794
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	fontfamily	font-size	margin	font-size
even when i set the font-size fontfamily padding and margin the button in firefox will always look bigger than the one in google-chrome safari

4036800

the problem i m having is that when i switch the src on the image the attr function returns the img dom element almost instantly while the image itself does not change until the new image loads

4036867
cvs	svn
is there a way to monitor commits to a cvs repository on a daily basis say and for those changes to be replicated in a local svn repository

4036903
pull	push
i managed to make git work for pull and push over http

4036917
illegalargumentexception	runtimeexception
note that there s no need to declare illegalargumentexception - it s a subclass of runtimeexception which means it s unchecked you don t need to declare it

4037005
prepare	execute
with these you can prepare the statement once then just execute it with different parameters

4037069
fontfamily	font-size
to change individual property you will need font-size and fontfamily specifically

4037081
fontfamily	font-size
you can separate those using fontfamily and font-size

4037090
children	parent
then each parent node is awarded a fragment half of the weight of each of its children

4037091
maven	pom.xml
while maven requires those dependencies to be absolute it also defined the runtime property that already resolves to where the pom.xml file is located

4037104
inherited	properties
you can always create a base class and put common properties in there and simply inherited from it

4037152
ready	each
i have a template ready to take each variable but first i need a content source

4037153
google-chrome	safari
this doesn t happen in google-chrome or safari

4037160
uitabbaritem	uitabbarcontroller
i haven t tried anything because i haven t found anything from google searches or the documentation for uitabbar uitabbarcontroller or uitabbaritem

4037185
maven	pom.xml
this is very powerful for a legacy code base but for new code bases you should follow the maven s standard directory layout to avoid lots of custom definitions in your pom.xml files

4037234
post	get
i can see from other post that it is hard getting some newbie starter help on three20 but it is really hard to get started with three20 with the lack of documentation and examples so i will try bear with me i am just trying to get started with this very nice library

4037351
uitableview	nsindexpath
tableview uitableview tableview willselectrowatindexpath nsindexpath

4037352
width	height
if you offset your camera s position by half of it s view height and width then it will appear to center your sprite

4037364
installation	upgrade
i understand php transitions are hardcoded in php dll.s installation so if any country government decide to change their time policies then gettransitions became obsolete unless you upgrade your php installation something not so easy when you have a production environment or are using a shared hosting

4037397
set	bag
note that the ordering does not matter inside a bag its a set

4037416
next	except
the view scrolls to the left and show the next page just as it should except for the little white dots pagecontrol dots that are under the scrollview

4037448
javassist	cglib
i think it s more sense to use javassist instead of cglib

4037448
javassist	cglib
besides such grand as hibernate project decided to stop using cglib in favor of javassist

4037456
filtering	grouping
note though that that regex.getgroupnames also considers 0 to be a grouping the entire match so you may need to filtering that out if you don t want it

4037461
width	height
get the full width and height of the screen and create a new window set to the appropriate width and height and with everything disabled

4037461
width	height
create a canvas inside of that new window setting the width and height of the canvas to the width - 10px and the height - 20px to allow for the bar and the edges of the window

4037557
mp3	flv
the user clicks on a row - jquery takes the file name in first cell and changes the extension to flv mp3 - checks if there is a file with the new name - if there is a file it creates an image link to that file

4037557
mp3	flv
i worked hard on this code but now the client want that the event meaning that the image links that show if there is a file with the flv mp3 will occur on page load

4037575
google-chrome	safari
turns out it was the display inline property on the div in the li that interferes with the display in google-chrome and safari

4037588
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to at least versioning 106 if possible

4037588
versioning	upgrade
i think the if-test versioning testing specifically for versioning that each upgrade routine can handle reads better

4037618
salt	md5
i have always made my authentication codes by checking if the md5 + salt of the pass provided by the user in the form was the same as the one stored in the db and if it was i saved a session variable called status equal to 1

4037698
hide	show
what you really want to do in this switch statement is call another function that show or hide the options in another dropdown

4037714
post	get
these are kind of high-volume but people do post their to-do lists and stuff so by just listening you d get a better idea about the state of a certain boost library

4037829
post	get
this would translate into a http get or post method containing something like

4037830
setinterval	settimeout
when you run setinterval or settimeout an event is generated which is then added to the browser s execution queue

4037880
jobs	cron
and if i run it at night and set the cron jobs to be like 4hrs apart i start to get even more emails sent thought i havent had a chance to see if this is due to multiple threads method calls

4037911
int	chars
i can t tell what seems to be the standard way of doing things if there is one and whether or not there are types like chars or int or whatever already built in

4037919
ilist	icollection
define a class which implements ilist and which has a constructor which takes a valuecollection or icollection

4037980
hide	show
you can show hide each row and you can show hide the details within that list row

4037991
prepare	pdostatement
if the database server successfully prepares the statement pdo prepare returns a pdostatement object

4038000
opera	firefox
this answer provides a solution that works in ie firefox opera and webkit

4038011
hide	show
it is just a simple hide and show on another div

4038014
versioning	upgrade
you should just have a collection of objects each with the upgrade code and a versioning number

4038014
versioning	upgrade
you simply iterate over that collection while the versioning number is your target versioning and call the upgrade code on that object for each one

4038044
width	height
also these rectangles must be able to follow my rectangle property settings like height width color...put them in one line at the end

4038070
width	height
event.type 22 one or more of following changed width height x y

4038070
width	height
event.type 22 restore after maximized due to change in width and height

4038076
post	get
the form method get post

4038096
cck	ubercart
this is easily accomplished via cck and ubercart either creating directly the product in ubercart or creating the content-type with cck and a product with the same machine name in ubercart

4038100
put	get
you d overwrite the afterreceiverequest to look for your relevant certain data. if no certain data then put the copy back into the message body and go away otherwise you might want to raise an event or throw an exception that your code would catch and then go get that other page.

4038104
ant	maven
i recommend both over the other solutions since ant style globbing has pretty much become the standard glob syntax in the java world hudson spring ant and i think maven

4038116
memcached	apc
normally one solves this duality between 1 performance of static files and 2 data integrity of a database by storing data in a database for integrity and using one of the many possibilities of storing prerendered results in cache be it flat files apc memcached and the like

4038116
memcached	apc
storing caches in another location so memory as the mentioned apc memcached or flat files would be the way to go if your process project doesn t depend on the latest available data forums blogs reviews etc. who cares about a couple of seconds lag

4038177
google-chrome	firefox
but when i try it in firefox or google-chrome the results are missing values

4038177
google-chrome	firefox
here is the output in firefox and google-chrome

4038183
opera	firefox
i have problem with clearing session only in ie browser i ve tested in different version ie iis 6 and 7 - it works good in firefox and opera

4038183
opera	firefox
in firefox and opera everything is all right

4038190
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested this in google-chrome safari firefox and opera so i know it s not just an internet explorer wonky bug

4038273
google-chrome	firefox
so for your alternatives including firefox and google-chrome are correct in setting the failed capture to undefined

4038294
client-side	server-side
session is server-side but ie is client-side that s not going to be the problem

4038319
getter	setter
i have spoken many times before in regards to storing objects and scope issues and the best way i know of to over come this is by using a static abstract class with getter and setter that can help you transport objects around your application and save you having to modify classes so that you can specifically import objects for usage

4038349
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome the datepicker does not render

4038412
post	get
if you need the cookies fro a different domain to be set to a client visitor you ll have to get them there which essentially means they will have to do the post doing it with curl from you own server still leaves you with no way to set the cookies

4038412
post	get
sure you can post from your own server what you like but it won t do a lick of good as long as you cannot get the cookie information to the client which you can t due to browser security privacy issues

4038420
packets	pcap
the general idea is use regular socket in order to tell kernel to send igmp join packets and after use pcap in order to capture packets

4038443
xmonad	cabal-install
if you installed them with cabal-install by running cabal install xmonad then just re-run that command

4038443
xmonad	cabal-install
if this is the case your best option to get something working quickly might be to uninstall xmonad and xmonad-contrib then re-install them using cabal-install

4038453
public	protected
one approach is to have a protected overridable method and then have a public non-overridable method which calls the overridable one

4038466
width	height
now i d like to add dynimc layout management so when i call dolayout on the outer most panel internal widgets and panels rearrange according device s width and height

4038470
maven	m2e
behind the scenes the m2e plugin somehow generates a run configuration that contains the maven dependencies classpath container like the following

4038470
maven	m2e
my best guess is that the maven dependencies classpath container is added through some extension point being used by the m2e plugin

4038546
postgresql	mysql
asterisk makes it easy to select a destination database for your cdr s and has a myriad of different database options mysql postgresql

4038551
switching	screens
however when i put this application on my phone nexus one it doesn t switching to the new activity when i touch the screens after i take a picture

4038579
jsf	wicket
i have a menu bar component created in wicket and a form component is created in jsf

4038580
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
but of course the only availability on the surface for element access is getelementbyid getelementfrompoint and getelementsbytagname

4038587
post	get
you should post it with ajax this will stop it from changing the page and you will still get the information back

4038606
maven	pom.xml
maven parent pom.xml vs modules pom.xml

4038607
postgresql	mysql
i was hoping for an experience similar to working with mysql or postgresql but no such luck

4038607
postgresql	mysql
hibernate currently connected to postgresql and mysql

4038611
implements	modifiers
however in the recent versions of c# its kind of possible to work around this limitation for a generic class collection by implements a generic interface whose type parameter has an out modifiers on it

4038618
opera	firefox
this occurs in both firefox and opera

4038622
centos	linux
i run a dv 3.5 server on mediatemple with linux centos 5 php and mysql db and am trying to encrypt phone records with aes

4038630
stdout	stderr
with this interface you can pass messages to the child s stdin and read from the child s stdout and stderr handles

4038636
ssl	https
i am trying to access an https web service that uses ssl cert authentication using ruby eventmachine but i am not getting it to work

4038636
ssl	https
i have also tried sending the request to gmail without the ssl option plain https without cert and that works outputting status code 200 the headers and the body

4038650
post	get
it is normal for a php application to post back to the same page as it can not only process the post request but it can generate an updated page based on the original get but with the new information from the post

4038651
rss	feed
i know jfeed is rather outdated and no longer supported but firefox seems to be the only browser that is having an issue parsing an rss feed using this setup

4038654
min	max
or do i just need to redeclare the scale and min max values somehow

4038655
width	height
all you need to do is set the width and height attributes to be the size of the canvas dynamically

4038655
width	height
so you use css to make it stretch over the entire browser window then you have a little function in javascript which measures the width and height and assigns them

4038655
width	height
the width and height attributes of the element determine how many pixels it uses in it s internal rendering buffer

4038655
width	height
browser will only stretch the graphics if the width and height attributes disagree with the actual real world pixel width and height

4038658
scrollable	panels
i have implemented scrollable extjs tab panels in our product

4038676
width	height
it s worth noting that the width and height attributes of canvas are not like the old school img width and height attributes

i have looked through the ruby on rails guides and i can t seem to figure out how to prevent someone from deleting a parent record if it has children

however if you re repeatedly mapping and unmapping segments of the file rather than the entire file you ll probably end up doing just as well by reading chunks via fseek and fread -- note however that you do not want to read individual pieces of data this way ie do one large read rather than a lot of small reads

4054452

i think the design i ve put in question in this post is what is traditionally called the proxy design pattern

4055322
free	malloc
presumably the mac malloc aligns to bigger boundaries and so it s spotting the pointer you re passing to free can t be correct since it has the wrong alignment

4055322
free	malloc
however it is saying that you re passing to free a pointer that didn t come from malloc

4055326
avr	microcontroller
i don t know anything about avr microcontroller but generally speaking static variables are usually placed in the data section of the executable and since your static memory requirements are low all you need to ensure is that the data section is 256 byte aligned

4055332
children	parent
ok i store the two children ids as foreign keys in the parent and retrieve the children itself using that information

i tested it by drawing a huge polyline using direct2d and the result was absurdly slow even with 500 times less data than the amount i ve ran the same test using gdi and i didn t even use a bitmap as backbuffer in gdi i just drew to the form canvas directly

4055456
gdi	direct2d
a direct2d is slower than gdi

4055456
gdi	direct2d	bitblt	gdi	bitblt	direct2d
the thing is that gdi is still faster than direct2d if i draw to a bitmap and after it s done i bitblt the result back to the form it paints at 35ms and with the same graphics quality

do this in the .android folder under your home directory

4055903
stdout	stderr
this runs just fine on python 2.6 and 2.7 but whenever i try and test it on python 3.0 and up there is a new line printed out by the stdin.read call i think this may because the python 3 changes to sys.stdin stdout and stderr but i m not sure how to fix it

stdout	fflush
i think it is better to fflush stdout which means basically you are seeing the content on the screen or in a file if stdout is redirected

i ve tried cron jobs and such but host doesn t allow it

4056088

4056141
width	height
if the ratio is less than 70 50 1.4 set the height to 50px and the width to 50 x y

4056141
width	margin
if you use browsers that don t support vertical-align you can position the image absolutely at 50 and set the top margin to width -0.5 using javascript

4056176
int	chars
i need to know if the values i m swapping are strings chars int whatever so i can make a temporary to perform the swap

currently i have a javascript that prevent user from submission the form more than once by disabling it on submit

4056345
gridview	sqldatasource
then you don t have to add the buttons and the images in the code and takecare of adding them each time the row is created you just need to fetch the data from the database and set the datasource of the gridview and i think you can also get rid of the code fetching the data and replace it with a sqldatasource

4056382
put	get
and likely then only if you don t plan to put a sim in it or already have one with a suitable data plan beware carrier habits of forcing plan upgrades because at least in the us carriers don t usually give any discount for not buying a phone so if here you might as well get something recent on sale for 99 since you are going to pay the true value of it in inflated monthly charges even if you provide your own phone

4056509
width	height
all icons will be the same pixel width and height

4056557
hex	binary
you could just stick to binary - most maps would be a pain to edit by hand no matter what format you pick though i ve heard of starcraft maps being edited with hex editors... just use whatever seems easiest for you

4056596
int	boolean
the first operator forces the operand to an int possibly after coercing the value to a string or a boolean then inverts the lowest 31 bits

4056597
spaces	linefeed
i need to find out if any of the characters in this string are ascii whitespace characters spaces horizontal tab vertical tab carriage return linefeed etc - unicode defines some more whitespace characters but forget about them

4056615
wicket	seam	struts	wicket	jsf	wicket	jsf	seam
if yes there s struts spring mvc wicket java server faces seam jsf + hibernate - almost too many to name

4056616
post	get
same as you do in your post action but in the get you pass a new fresh initialized quadcalc model to the view

4056627
put	get
on click on that button i want to show popup but when i put targetcontrolid imbreserve i get error message a control with id imbreserve could not be found

4056633
post	get
perhaps you would provide a get method a head method a post method etcetera but you wouldn t need to provide access to the underlying sockets because you are abstracting that detail away from the user

4056636
put	get
when i put height 100 in the flash parameters i get a blank page

4056636
width	height
for the width it s ok but when i change the height from 740 to 100 or when i delete it i have a blank page

4056670
vaadin	wicket
there are other component oriented frameworks ike gwt wicket vaadin if you doesn t want to work with css and html

4056675
portrait	landscape
i m pretty new to monotouch and i m having problems getting my app to rotate from portrait to landscape mode

4056679
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
i have discovered that when my program starts in one of my viewcontrollers the order of calling is viewdidappear viewwillappear viewdidappear

4056679
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
atm i have a flag in viewdidappear to check if viewwillappear was called but it s a hack

4056708
pecl	pear
the geo ip pecl package and net_geoip pear package both provide an interface to the maxmind location database that been mentioned in other answers for php

4056714
groupbox	panel
i have 2 groupbox which i would like to customise a bit more and i dont want to resort to having a panel with a label this would mean that i would have to have the same background colour for the panel and the parent control if i wanted a border since the label would have to have a colour set to cover up the border behind the text

4056715
maven	pom.xml
maven parent pom.xml vs modules pom.xml

4056715
maven	m2e
or should i abandon subclipse and m2e and checkout and run my maven goals from the command line

4056781
google-chrome	firefox
i used the following x html under a using google-chrome and firefox on ubuntu 10.10

4056781
onclick	onchange
if you truly can t edit the html you can always use jquery to remove the onchange and onclick etc. event handlers and use a linked js file to take over their function

4056811
unix	solaris
if you work under unix solaris unix you do not have problem with jar access locking so shouldn t worry about above

4056837
gson	jackson
otherwise jackson and gson at least have full bean serialization as well as allowing custom serializers

4056875
viewdidload	viewdidappear
it s very likely that you want the behavior of viewdidload rather than viewdidappear - viewdidappear can be called multiple times by your viewcontroller when you re not expecting it to

4056893
jquery	jqmodal
it s to do with breaking changes on how is handled in jquery 1.4.2 because jqmodal was never updated to work with the jquery 1.4.x family

4056895
clang	llvm
llvm contributor dan gohman recently added clang code completion to vim

4056900
post	put
giving that i have no docs or unit tests etc i m finding it very difficult to figure out what to include in the params hash so the post put operatins succeeds

4056926
int	double
since int is implicitly convertable to double you can leave out the inner conversion

4056926
int	double
you can also just use a simple cast since you know it s going from double to int

4056966
mouse	keyboard
obviously i have to make changes to the world matrix based on the mouse and keyboard movements and hence i should somehow handle the appropriate mouseevents and keyboardevens

4056982
hide	show
since each angle will essentially be a separate stream video file the only thing i have come up with is to stream them simultaneous and when the users click the button for a specific stream use js to show hide the corresponding video - which is by far not the most efficient for load time or bw usage

4056990
postgresql	mysql
if it helps this is a graph database implementation and i need a prompt just like any other database client mysql postgresql etc.

4057034
versioning	upgrade
in my own code before i upgrade to a versioning of vb which supported lambdas i used delegate factories

4057056
quicksort	timsort
timsort seems to beat quicksort by 5 or so

4057110
hash	salt
this user have the password 123 hash using sha1 with salt 1 sha1 123 + 1 so he can read the database

4057151
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have something that works reliably in most older browsers latest safari and google-chrome releases and firefox 4 betas have a defense -- but it doesn t work in ie7 or 8 haven t tried 6 and i cannot figure out why

4057156
maven	m2e
also when i checkout the maven project from svn eclipes shows bunch of compiling errors due to some missing classes but when i build the project using m2e everything builds successful

4057229
explode	implode
you could pull the first url of the explode list implode it and write it back to the file

4057248
folder	directory
assume a and b are two different folder in different directory

4057262
lan	intranet
software like intranet chatting use s lan as connection medium

4057288

create a git project with the two directory put it somewhere else and then just create symlinks in the two locations that you need the two folder

4057309
portrait	landscape
ctrl + fn + f11 on mac to change the landscape to portrait and vice versa

4057309

4057346
wildfly	jboss
the balusc code - jsf 2.2 tutorial with eclipse and wildfly - install jboss tools

4057381
children	parent
the limitation of two children per parent is absurd you may have to inspect your methods classes i suspect one is an upward navigation and the other is downward

4057449
octal	hex
the above can be slightly confusing and not-so-well-defined because some languages may use the ascii maybe hex maybe octal etc numerical values for addition or concatenation so there s a lot of room open for mistakes

4057456
innodb	myisam
change your tables from myisam to innodb

4057475
exif	xmp
we currently provide searching by various types of user added metadata title description keywords and by various metadata which we extract exif iptc xmp etc

4057487
width	height
the span is inline element you can not apply width or height to it unless you make it block-level element like this

4057534
facebook	fbconnect
i am using fbconnect in my game to post score on facebook wall

4057567
octal	decimal
but an octal number inside a string is interpreted as a decimal

4057583
versioning	upgrade
i want an edition that lasts long and i can easily upgrade it to future versioning without any problems and it must work smoothly with .net

4057627
folder	dir
treat files like folder and just add a separate column to indicate the type of the entry file dir link etc

4057666
button	checkbox
i created a new website and place a checkbox named cbselect and a button

4057754
setinterval	settimeout
it look like you did not yet fully understand how settimeout setinterval work

4057767
octal	decimal
make sure to keep everything in octal not decimal

4057817
put	get
it s an opaque wrapper and you have to know the exact type of data that was put into it to get it back out

4057817
put	get
for example if you put in a you need to use to get the data back - won t work

4057854
google-chrome	firefox
on one server authentication works fine via all browsers ie 8 firefox 3.6 google-chrome

4057855
rtp	rtsp
i m using some code related to rtsp rtp to listen to various rtsp streams using ffmpeg it works

4057855
wma	asf
i m just wondering if anyone can help me with where to look for troubleshooting when working with wma asf audio streams

4057884
mouseup	mousedown
i attach two event handlers to the element -- mousedown to set an additional class something like button-active and mouseup to remove the class

4057888
pull	push
once they ve been pushed via alternative routes updating to a changeset where the subrepositories don t exist it s possible to then update and pull the changes from the remote repositories but if i were to push again whilst on a changeset with the subrepositories the whole ordeal repeats itself

4057924
implements	extends
my opinion of c++ iostreams has improved substantially over time particularly after i started to actually extends them by implements my own stream classes

4057924
serializable	deserialization
they could be used solely as serializable deserialization facilities to translate c++ objects into portable byte sequences

4057931
post	get
the idea is that a get to all-posts returns a list of the urls of every post object and the client uses those urls to interact with the resources

4057938
put	get
i simply want to get the list of competitions and put them into a list i have setup

4057941
innodb	myisam
if i understood your question properly then you could use one of the following two methods innodb vs myisam

4057941
innodb	myisam
personally i d take the innodb road as i m a fan of clustered indexes which myisam doesnt support and i prefer performance over how many lines of code i need to type but the decision is yours.

4057944
put	get
i am looking for advice on how to go about writing a small and simple application that will receive http get and http put request process the data simple text files and respond

4057955
post	get
might be a great way to get the uri s of the 3rd page of oldest post

4057955
post	put
put and especially post methods should really use simple uri s with the resource that will be affected in only the path portion

4057985
execvp	fork
i wrote a code in c c++ which fork a child process duplicates the stdin stdout into a pipe ends and calls execvp

4057985
stdout	fflush
in the parent process i don t see the line enter any key - it will be fflush only after the program calls exit which auto fflush the stdout buffer or an explicit call to fflush stdout is added

4058033
uigesturerecognizer	uiresponder
in uiresponder or uigesturerecognizer classes according to your target os

4058047
lxml	libxml2
many of the faster higher-level language modules for this purpose such as in the python world a href rel nofollow lxml a tend to be built directly on libxml2 doing the dom bits themselves

4058086
filtering	grouping	sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping
for example filtering grouping and sorting data or how to add a filtering to a dataset

4058097
hide	show
and if i put a hide it doesn t show in ie

4058159
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
you can upgrade your postgres installation if it is within the same versioning eg 9.1 -- 9.2 but you would require a new install for different versioning eg 8.4 -- 9.1 but then you can easily dump your tables and restore them into the new install

4058179
width	height
a solution that usually works is to wrap the whole content in an absolute positioned div with 100 height and width and customize the scrollbars of that div

4058192
width	height
i use the resize_to_fit method which will use the parameters supplied as the maximum width height but will keep the aspect ration

4058192
width	height
that will ensure that either the width or height is no greater than 640 but will not stretch the image making it look funny

4058221
width	height
use getlength 0 and getlength 1 to get the width and height of the array

4058222
superclass	subclassing
which btw means that you can override superclass in subclassing which is pretty mindblowing.

4058223
min	max
the program is supposed to return the max and min values of an array

4058223
min	max
my goal was to have two variables max and min outside of the method so that as the method ran through the array the values would get replaced accordingly

4058237
ceil	floor
just converting mentioned above is good enough though you might want to use floor or ceil functions before that

4058242
min	max
max and min method are already in stdlib or ruby

4058326
google-chrome	firefox
the following works in ie but in firefox only align the text and in google-chrome nothing.

4058332
mkmapview	mkannotationview
this object is represented on my mkmapview by an mkannotationview

4058340
strlen	strcpy
this is also the way all the c standard library functions like strcpy strlen .

4058342
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works on firefox safari google-chrome properly

4058373
hex	binary
in order to understand the bitmask u need to convert it to binary with hex it s very easy every hex number is 4 binary digits

4058373
hex	binary
hex 0 binary 0000

4058373
hex	binary
hex 1 binary 0001

4058405
post	get
it works correctly in python but in php-curl i always get a bad request error my post data is not as expected by the server

4058441
equals	tostring
i d override equals hashcode and tostring in your animal

4058467
mongoid	mongomapper
if you just want store your json in mongo you don t need mongoid or mongomapper

4058474
min	max
you need to return both the min and max values to make the recursive algorithm work so i guess you need to return a pair of values or an array in a single return statement

4058474
min	max
secondly your min and max variables initialized on lines 3 and 4 are not in scope within the minmax method body so you are actually defining new local variables there

4058486
strlen	strcpy
as sth said c standard library functions like strcpy strlen also rely on the fact that the string is valid null terminated

4058488
pascal	delphi
we are tring to use in delphi a pas file generated by free pascal

4058514
firefox	safari
in firefox it looks ok in safari it breaks to the bottom left of that line

4058564
int	double
to put it more plainly java and therefore scala does not see any common grounds between a double s + and a an int s +

4058588
filtering	grouping
i want to filtering out the column1 after grouping it into s d r separately so that i can sum it over to separately to find packet delivery fraction

4058618
width	height
each of them should have the same width and height they should be square

4058618
width	height
and i want the whole matrix to use the screen width or height depending on rotation

4058656
hex	binary
here is a hex value 0x12345678 written as binary and annotated with some bit positions

4058673
put	get
if your template code isn t all inline functions then you ll have to put in some control to make sure that things get instantiated only once so your linker doesn t spit out a pile of multiple instances of foo errors

4058729
int	double
for scale type like int double and float they are not class type

4058729
int	double
some languages like c# may wrap int or double as a object and they can be transfered to each other by a sub-routine

4058755
bmp	png
i have tried saving the image as bmp jpg png with no joy either when drawing image fromfile

4058822
libssh	dropbear
depending on how complex your requirements are you could use libssh lgpl used in various ssh clients investigate modifying dropbear mit or quick n dirty

4058830
post	get
if i send post request directly to log-in url i get authorization error

4058833
firefox	safari
both firefox and safari will accept display inline-box

4058856
int	chars
now if i entered a large no of t-shirts like 999999999999999999999999999999999999 the form was unresponsive.so i should limit the no of chars entered in the textbox.so please tell me how to set this limitation so as to not having int overflow

4058882
int	double
my source code below is generating error cs0563 because both of the parameters in my combinedjobs operator+ see step 5 ... in source code are listed as job as opposed to int double etc

4058886
post	get
details in this blog post but basically all the way through ie7 ie mashes together several namespaces that should be completely distinct for instance it treats all id and name values as being in the same namespace so if you have an element with and another element with ie will get confused

4058945
system.in	system.out
instead of using system.in and system.out directly use the console class - it allows you to display a prompt and read an entire line thereby fixing your problem of input in one call

4059010
width	height
so you will define the table layout height to fill parent but for each column you should set the width to 0px and the weight to the percentage you want the column to span

4059022
free	malloc
if you allocate with malloc you should free with free

4059025
free	malloc
if you allocate with malloc you must always deallocate with free

4059026
chown	sudo
as to permissions if you have the directory var www joomla then cd var www and then sudo chown -r www-data joomla

4059038
free	malloc
simply replace allocate_from_some_other_source with malloc and deallocate_from_some_other_source with free

4059040
post	get
just use android s httpclient and perform post and get operations against your asp.net application to access and modify sqlserver s data

4059051
google-chrome	safari
the problem is in google-chrome and safari the scrollheight isn t changed at all

4059051
google-chrome	safari
however in google-chrome safari when clicking on a link anywhere on the page and then clicking on the browser back button to return to the search results iframe content then the iframe is resized properly even in google-chrome safari.

4059051
google-chrome	safari
ps i think this person has the same problem iframe resizing with scrollheight in google-chrome safari

4059091
folder	directory
you can figure the webroot for a domain to point to any folder insider your ftp upload directory thus you can do

4059119
mediarecorder	audiorecord
this class leverages audiorecord which is a lower level approach to using mediarecorder

4059129
config	ini
for zend optimizer plus there is a number of ini config you can change as explained in

4059157
int	chars
i remember that bjarne says that encoding is the mapping between chars and int s so chars should be stored as int s in memory and different encodings don t necessarily have the same mapping

4059157
int	chars
otherwise how is it able to translate the chars to correct int and store them

4059165
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately this format wasn t accepted by firefox so i had to keep the original code for google-chrome and firefox and then use a separate script for ie with conditional comments

4059173
min	max
all of the formulas are of the same nature - they perform some high-level function average slope min max across a column of values

4059214
int	chars
mapping between chars and int s so

4059214
int	chars
chars should be stored as int s in

4059214
int	chars
different encodings interpret the underlying int as different chars or parts of chars if we re talking about a multi-byte chars set depending on the encoding

4059226
cpython	ironpython
ironpython is an independent python implementation written in c# as opposed to the original implementation often referred to as cpython due to it being written in no surprise c

4059227
cpython	ironpython
ironpython is caught up to cpython the implementation you re probably used to 2.6 so some of the features changes seen in python 2.7 or 3.x will not be present in ironpython

4059291
cpython	ironpython
if you mean compatible with cpython then yes code written to cpython will work in ironpython with a few caveats

4059291
cpython	ironpython
another difference is that ironpython lags behind cpython by a bit

4059291
cpython	ironpython
if you want to learn to program with python and also want to produce code for windows you can use ironpython for that but you can also use cpython and py2exe

4059303
int	chars
and int s so chars should be

4059347
integer	unsigned
it could be in dotted quad format or a single unsigned 32 bit integer

4059398
width	height
you should not be using the screen size to determine the width height of the image because the frame will contain a border

4059455
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it s seems like all major browsers ie firefox safari google-chrome support animated gifs

4059458
google-chrome	firefox
only has to be compatible with google-chrome or firefox

4059471
return-value-optimization	nrvo
if you compile without -fno-elide-constructors the move operations disappear because they are replaced by even more efficient optimizations like return-value-optimization or nrvo

4059479
toggleclass	each
the overall styling would depend on your markup if you have some sort of container each radio set is in you could check if none of those had a checked element within...if they all do then use the same toggleclass approach to set that all checked class on or off

4059483
put	get	post	get	post	put
to use the term restful action to describe anything other than get put post delete etc when using http is just nasty

4059484
umask	chmod
after you fix codeaddict s string versus number issue and note tchrist s umask issue you should call chmod on the new directory after creating it if you need specific permissions

4059484
chmod	mkdir
i usually call mkdir without the mask and then chmod the directory to the permissions i want

4059484
umask	mkdir
you can also set the umask to zero before calling mkdir you d need to do it this way if you need to create the directory with the correct permissions atomically

4059486
dictionary	map
you should use map instead of dictionary dictionary is obsolete

4059504
perforce	svn
the good news here is that all the new age scms will let you do that correctly plastic git hg while the old ones simply fail svn perforce and the even older ones

4059507
pascal	delphi
i guess the free pascal faq on this goes for delphi too

4059526
portrait	landscape
3 if the screen lock is portrait landscape and your game is sticked to the other orientation the screen lock forced you to orient once

4059529
put	get
it s better to put together stty 2 echo 1 cat 1 et al and just get some strings to print

4059538
postgresql	mysql
they are sufficiently similar that i d recommend starting with mysql but learning postgresql as well

4059557
int	chars
c c++ programmers are used to thinking of chars as bytes because almost everyone starts working with the ascii chars set maps the int 0-255 to symbols such as the letters of the alphabet and arabic numbers

4059569
postgresql	mysql
the reason why i usually suggest postgresql before mysql is because mysql is far from the standards sql-wise

4059589
postgresql	mysql
while you re just starting out i think you ll appreciate postgresql s pgadminiii gui tool more than you would those that i ve tried for mysql

4059589
postgresql	mysql
i d actually recommend postgresql over mysql for the window functions alone

4059609
countif	sumifs
as there is also a countif and a sumifs i think your slopes could be calculated the same way

4059609
min	max
for the rest of the functions max min etc we should analyze case by case

4059655
boost	stl
the stl and boost are nice examples of how to exploit generic programming to write code to solve many problems that is both cleaner better and more efficient than the equivalent oop code

4059669
int	chars
when you read it first read in the int then read in that many chars

4059688
uiview	subviews
then put a uiimageview containing your png as the lowest item on the uiview s stack of subviews

4059806
toolbar	tabs
you can add custom buttons to the safari toolbar create bars of your own add contextual menu items display content in bars or tabs and inject scripts and style sheets into webpages

4059810
merb	ruby-on-rails
i hoped that after the ruby-on-rails merb merge it ll be possible and easy to cherry pick the needed features but either this is not yet implemented or poorly documented

4059877
put	get
to get custom errors you ll have to set them per-element or use the meta-data plugin to put the rules on the element directly

4059890
nsimage	nsscrollview
i have an nsview in an nsscrollview that i want to create an nsimage from

4059892
gridview	sqldatasource
this will ensure that your resultset from your sqldatasource will have the columns named exactly on the gridview

4059931
domxpath	domdocument
i m using the phpcrawl class and added some domdocument and domxpath code to take specific data off web pages however the script stalls out before it gets even close to crawling the whole website

4059940
post	get
if you re trying to do server side validation once a post get is received load the form object with the submitted values

4059998
postgresql	mysql
featurewise i think postgresql is superior to mysql better query optimizer windowing functions common table expressions check constraints deferrable constraint just to name a few that mysql is lacking and it is really free

4059998
postgresql	mysql
mysql might have a slight advantage if you need multi-master replication but there are solutions for postgresql as well

4059998
teradata	greenplum
to complete the list of databases there is also greenplum data warehouse similar to teradata

4060023
plupload	swfupload
plupload and swfupload

4060023
plupload	swfupload
looking for a swfupload url their site is down so maybe plupload is a better bet

4060028
profiling	debugging
the standard version is free and offers the debugging you require as well as device code profiling

4060074
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this is perfectly working in firefox safari opera google-chrome .

4060118
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome the game feels fast but in other browser like ie understandable since it s using vml firefox ipad safari and others it feels slow at times

4060133
width	height
as you mention in your comment the actual problem was that your matrix width was not a multiple of the block width and height since it is square meaning the threads beyond the end would access beyond the end of the array

4060138

in fact i also believe you width and height calls can be removed and just cached through a closure since those are pretty static after creation see next example

4060722
width	height
you set the width and height of the enemies once so they seem pretty constant you could remove the .attr lookup and pass the width and height from the createenemies call as well

4060734

hash	salt
provide the salt also in the database could be the username and or a random value and calculate the hash again

if you can t require your users to upgrade you can spend a little more time improving the .net 3.5 code so that you don t need to make a special .net 4.0 versioning

4061275

4061394
ubuntu	linux
writing a server that runs on linux ubuntu using mono

4061460
public	protected
and if it is public or protected it is shared with any process elements to which that static variable is exposed

4061491
hash	salt
i think the second part of the first answer the part about dynamic salt in that thread gives you an answer like you expect generate a random per-user salt and store that with the hash password

4061491
hash	salt
for an example look at which avoids having the user send their password over the network at all by having them hash it with a salt specified by the server

4061509

if you want the number to be very close to a normal distribution can just add up 12 uniform 0 1 numbers and subtract 6

4061559
free	malloc
personally if getting people to do the right thing or fixing the code yourself is completely impossible i would declare my own global operator new that called malloc so then free would definitely not crash even though it would still not call the destructor at be generally really ugly

instead of implements subclass from viewgroup you can create something like squarebutton extends button or squaretablelayout extends tablelayout

4062376
width	height
override constructor class so that you will replace the width or height value with the smallest value of them both

4062376
width	height
then just set width and height of all elements within tablelayout to 0dip and the weight of all of them to 1

4062376
width	height
assuming that you have nxn elements in your table they all will get then the same width and the same height because of the same weigth

4062900
implements	extends
for example tuples implements as a pytupleobject extends a pyobject struct store their length and the pyobject pointers they contain inside the struct itself the struct contains a 1-length array in the definition but the implementation allocates a block of memory of the right size to hold the pytupleobject struct plus exactly as many items as the tuple should hold. the same way strings pystringobject store their length their cached hashvalue some string-caching interning bookkeeping and the actual char of their data

4062953

and as already noted setter getter are not implemented in ie

4063990
getter	setter
this way status is fully protected from direct access which is the point of using setter and getter

4064012
accessor	properties
make and use the accessor likely via an properties directive

4064012
accessor	ivar
going through the accessor better preserves encapsulation and acknowledges that direct ivar access is an extremely atypical pattern in objective-c largely limited only to a class accessing it s own ivars directly

4064017
int	chars
what is happening here is that the letter a is a chars which has an int value of 97

4064017
int	chars
so for each chars it is incrementing the value in the array remember all array values in an int array start at zero

4064018
min	max
that being said - you could create a method that takes your decimal along with the max and min number of places to round in reverse from and in a loop crush it down to the desired places - something like this

4064046
accessor	properties
if you declare properties as atomic the synthesized accessor will use locks to ensure that values are fully retrieved and set

4064054
innodb	myisam
move form myisam to innodb - this

4064086
uitableview	nsindexpath
- uitableviewcell setpointscell uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

it basically involves running a version of passenger standalone with one version of ruby and proxying requests to it from apache nginx that is running the other version

4064139
textarea	textbox
one contains a textarea for placing the new comments.i am having trouble with the size of textbox and the scrollbar

4064141
oncreate	ondestroy
3 in order to keep multiple instances of activities my thread was keeping in memoty list of running activities just adding to list during oncreate and deleting during ondestroy like

4064148
udp	tcp
you can still do low-level tcp or udp programming in c# so at that point it is really just a matter of choice whether you want to write network code in c c# etc.

4064156
width	height
you will need to know the exact number of bytes returned and the bitmap dimensions height width and encoding

4064167
post	get
note _x being get post request files

4064233
invalidoperationexception	argumentexception
i don t know of any publication spelling out which exception to throw when but argumentexception and invalidoperationexception should take care of most of your cases

4064236
firefox	safari
the following code works for me without any manual refresh tested on firefox 3.6.12 and safari 5.0.2 with gwt 2.0.3

4064242
for-loop	loops
the for-loop has a number of useful properties within a loops

4064252
post	put
in my onclick function for the form i put empty messages as errormessages and put a message if the form wasn t valid and return false if it isn t so i don t post it.

4064279
width	margin
i feel like there is some other kind of padding or margin or some other invisible that is contributing the math that makes up the width which is causing the discrepancy

4064284
vb.net	vb6
if i remember right return was added as the return statement to a function between vb6 and vb.net probably to make it more like other languages

4064308
int	chars
the difference between the two is that the first has type void chars and the second has type int const

4064310
rjava	jri
it might be a bit of an overkill but rjava jri give you a java api to r

4064316
sorting	filtering
i d recommend either to use data caching on web-server side see other answers for links or to implement client-side data filtering sorting - there must be ready-to-use javascript libs for that

4064331
put	get
hi frdz i have created a stored proc and i put three queries in stored proc with inputvariable etlloadid 0 and i get three different windows for each query under result tab

4064346
post	get
the get shows a form and the post takes the forms values and saves to the db

4064349
cvs	svn
in svn and cvs you can t add a file that s in your ignore list and if you do future changes aren t tracked but in mercurial hg add completely overrides ignore so unless you ll have many new jars showing up in the future just ignore broadly and add the .jar

4064360
memcached	apc
caching your results in memcached apc etc

4064360
post	get
one last thing a search page should use a get method according to http rest specifications post must be used for inserting while get must be used for retrieving

4064416
int	chars
chars int math.abs ch1 + math.random ch2 - ch1 128

4064426
ienumerable	iqueryable
i ended up creating two sets of methods ones that return ienumerable in your case iqueryable and ones that return collection pull the content before sending it out of the repository.

4064428
128bit	64bit
so floating point and its exception handling might work slightly differently and extended might not be 80-bit but 64bit or less likely 128bit

4064499
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
player should work in all major browsers ie firefox google-chrome safari

4064538
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
add it to the map view and then use the gesturerecognizer s touchesbegan touchesmoved etc

4064571
int	chars
1000 is not many you should just make sure that the underlying int type is big enough don t use a chars for your enum

4064598
int	chars
this is much more about how to display chars than it is about int

4064604
cllocationmanager	mkreversegeocoder
certain objects such as cllocationmanager or mkreversegeocoder send their results asynchronously to a delegate callback method

4064610
jboss	weblogic	jboss	glassfish	glassfish	weblogic
if you have to go for a 3-tier architecture you probably want to look at java ee java enterprise edition and at the application servers implementing it jboss glassfish weblogic etc.

4064644
activemq	rabbitmq
this leaves me with other alternatives such as rabbitmq or activemq since they both seem to have stomp adapters as possible middleware choices

4064651
mouse	keyboard
the mouse scroll wheel works nicely in gvim but i m looking for keyboard based solutions

4064665
free	malloc
free s do not necessary cause this consumption to go down it depends on how the memory is managed and the programs mixture of malloc s and free s

4064714
capistrano	bundler
i m trying to deploy a small rails3 app to a freebsd host using capistrano and bundler

4064714
chgrp	chmod
here the install fails because the install script uses chmod and chgrp to try to install the gem with root wheel as it s owner

4064734
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
iâ ve checked in google-chrome 6 firefox 2 and opera 10.5 and theyâ re fine with it

4064771
gridview	detailsview
i can t seem to bind a single gridview s row to a detailsview properly

4064776
prawn	pdfkit
if you are looking to generate a pdf you will need to use something like prawn or pdfkit

4064791
128bit	64bit
in hindsight logical because while sse2 regs are 128bit they are used as two 64bit doubles

4064802
int	double
when you type literal values for integral types like int short etc. as well as floating point types like float or double you don t use quotations

4064810
keystore	jks
i ve moved it into my android project and i m getting the following error keystore jks implementation not found

4064826
division	modulo
the is the modulo in mysql syntax -- it returns the remainder of the division

4064830
getter	setter
getter and setter are not bad by themselves

4064830
getter	setter
what is bad is the practice of making any field to be private and provide getter setter for all of them no matter what

4064883
width	height
if so if you want to use php you ll have to refresh the page which you probably don t want to do in this case since your user will have to reload the video obviously you would simply output new values to the width and height values

4064884
keydown	keyup
if you are using .net and windows forms you can use the keydown and keyup events of form class

4064929
move	drag
also say that this image can be move by the user via drag and drop

4065018
free	malloc
then the next iteration of the loop does another batch of allocations of size n and the free list no longer contains contiguous memory at that size and malloc has to ask the kernel for more memory

4065036
screens	hdpi
my app displays perfectly on small and normal densitys but for some reason the buttons are slightly higher on hdpi screens and i have to tap above them to get them to work.

4065056
folder	directory
i want this dll use the config file of itself both dll and config in the same directory i.e in bin folder of an asp.net application or beside a desktop application

4065068
min	max
for example i have dates and min max amount and the gridview is populated correctly

4065134
webchromeclient	webviewclient
using webviewclient and or the webchromeclient you can get a listener for when the page has loaded however this is sometimes called before the webview has any content in it before it has displayed anything

4065134
webchromeclient	webviewclient
so i have tried two different approaches to determining when the page has finished loading onpagefinished from the webviewclient and also onprogresschanged from the webchromeclient

4065141
lisp	scheme
lisp via acl2 is one and of course scheme has a well-understood formal definition as well

4065163
ocaml	ada
technique 2 write the software in a slightly more awkward language some subset of ada or tweaked version of ocaml for instance and write the correctness proof along the way

4065200
folder	directory
the way snesdroid works is it will play emulator files on the sd card not sure if you could code the app to download files directly to the sdcard in a specific folder then have the app rescan that directory to refresh the levels

4065202
pascal	delphi
i m coding my product with delphi so i have to port the new code to object pascal

4065245
ssl	https
depends if you use an ssl certificate to offer the wcf service in https then it s used for encryption and the client could require it to be trusted or not

4065296
realloc	malloc
an example will clarify this a bit points of interest realloc syntax is similar to malloc s no need for extra casts etc. and after realloc you need to produce the same steps for the new objects as you did after malloc

4065304
coalesce	isnull
coalesce works like isnull for n columns

4065307
coalesce	isnull
no this wont work if there is no row being returned - isnull and coalesce will work if there is a null value in the row but there should be a row to begin with

4065307
coalesce	isnull
also isnull coalesce will have to be on some column rather than the integer 1

4065315
int	double
i am trying to create a generic class that handles int double and strings

4065332
innodb	myisam
mind that i ve seen weird behavior from myisam tables -- innodb tables are more consistent

4065336
put	get
is there a possibility with a filter or a listner to get the raw http stream alter something and put it back into the chain

4065338

4065393
gtk	fltk
qt wxwidgets fltk and gtk are a few of the most obvious possibilities

4065413
hex	binary
the lua grammar you mention is a nice start but has quite a bit of errors in it binary or hex literals are incorrect as well at least at the time i looked at it...

4065466
typedef	struct
struct intelement is automatically typedef d to intelement

4065472
ssl	spdy
i doubt that it s used as the current chrome chromium only supports spdy detection using the ssl npn extension which was only recently added to the edge openssl

4065509
awt	swing
you could try by using setignorerepaint boolean value but it s a typical swing feature that can or cannot work mainly because it depends from awt so you never know

4065537
bytearrayoutputstream	inputstream
so the only way to deep copy the inputstream is to create bytearrayoutputstream and after doing read on inputstream write this data to bytearrayoutputstream

4065538
turing	decidable
with all that out of the way it s worth noting that scala s type system like haskell s is turing complete which means that you can theoretically use it to prove any decidable property about your code provided that you have written your code in such a way that it is amenable to such proofs

4065538
sml	prolog	haskell	sml
haskell is almost certainly a better language for this than java since type-level programming in haskell is similar to prolog while type-level programming in scala is more similar to sml

4065560
rss	feed
the list of changes is something similar to an rss feed

4065586
post	get
stackoverflow wants great post to be upvoted so that they can get their advertising revenue

4065613
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the javascript script works with google-chrome and firefox but not in safari

super	self
you need to assign the result of super init to self

4065682
virtualbox	parallels
my colleague is able to use virtualbox to create a vm from the vhd and i want to do the same using parallels desktop 6

4065729
udp	tcp
layers ip addresses ports packets specifically udp tcp

4065757
gif	png
for gif and png files you need to get the image identifier using imagecreatefromgif and imagecreatefrompng

4065758
centos	linux
i m using centos 5.5 linux same as redhat 5.5

4065762
gif	png
if you want to create a generic image object from a png or gif you need to use their respective functions imagecreatefrompng and imagecreatefromgif

4065786
hide	show
what it does it show hide a class based on the visible state of something

4065790
unsigned	short	int	chars	16-bit	64bit
the integral types are byte short int and long whose values are respectively 8-bit 16-bit 32-bit and 64bit signed two s-complement int and chars whose values are 16-bit unsigned int representing utf-16 code units

4065796
16-bit	64bit
16-bit 32-bit and 64bit signed

4065919
memcpy	strcpy
the program crashes if i try to memcpy strcpy assign from a character array to a character pointer

4065931
nsnotification	nsinvocationoperation
a button is clicked a nsinvocationoperation or an async nsnotification is posted to perform the calculations

4065947
cpu	processors
this maps nicely to task manager information coming from the processes tab processes and compare that to the performance tabs cpu usage history processors

4065947
cpu	processors
so individual processes applications add load to your processors cpu s

4065966
put	get
i know this is likely incredibly simple put i just can t seem to get my head around it

4065984
realloc	malloc
i ve made a list using malloc and realloc that can grow dynamically

4066023
width	height
the widget will have fixed width and height so if there are too many check boxes a vertical scroll bar should appear

4066038
uitableview	nsindexpath
- cgfloat tableview uitableview tableview heightforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

4066040
solaris	aix
that means it will run under linux aix hpux solaris os x windows os 400 or whatever it s called nowadays and even z os

4066091
qscrollarea	qlistwidgetitem	qscrollarea	qwidget	qlistwidget	qscrollarea	qlistwidget	qwidget
well you could indeed use a qlistwidget with checkable items see void qlistwidgetitem setflags or use a qscrollarea containing a qwidget where you would dynamically add qcheckboxes

4066093
subtract	addition	subtract	add	multiplying	addition	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
you have to know how to do add subtract multiplying divide and power operations with complex numbers in addition to functions like sine cosine exponential etc

4066132
accessor	properties
one solution would be to create a seperate collection of item b from a public accessor properties collection of type b

4066155
getter	setter
you should be able to hide the 1d array access behind setter and getter that take 2d indexes

4066159
put	get
it fixes the errors however in the proceeding .cpp file i get the same errors above in the put function

4066217
getter	setter
getter are syntaxic sugar like setter i consider that method are more flexible because of the simplicity of using them asynchronously

4066234
webclient	httpwebrequest
it is however advisable to use httpwebrequest instead of webclient since webclient returns on the ui thread

4066236
width	height
you can even get the background images width and height through attr attribute of jquery for image

4066236
width	height
and then based on the height and width of swipe you can set the height and width of guitar as follows

4066240
gtk	gdk	pygtk	gdk
i used pango and pygtk awhile back and i am pretty sure you could develop a headless gtk or gdk application to render text to a pixbuf

4066245
gtk	xlib
i m not using any gui library gtk qt ... just raw xlib and glx

4066254
debian	linux
both are linux machines - one is arch the other debian

4066278
std	ostream
ostream is declared in std namespace so you need to add using namepsace std before the declaration of container or use scope resolution std ostream

4066285
webclient	httpwebrequest
httpwebrequest used by webclient itself will allow you to keep most your processing off the ui thread and just do your ui updates on the ui thread by way of the dispatcher refer above

4066285
webclient	httpwebrequest
for a deeper understanding of the differences between httpwebrequest and webclient and a working project sample to demonstrate refer my post here

4066285
webclient	httpwebrequest
webclient httpwebrequest and the ui thread on windows phone 7

4066293
nunit	mstest
here a links comparing mstest and nunit

4066305
cpu	processors
this is part of the threadpool management to keep the system from being over-tasked and reducing efficiency by all the context switches between too many threads while reducing wasted cycles while a thread is blocked there might not be enough other work to task the processors s fully even though there are tasks waiting to be run and wasted memory having threads spun up and ready but never allocated because they d over task the cpu

4066332
printf	strtol
you can pass it as an argument to any function that doesn t try to modify it printf strtol strchr etc.

4066332
strcpy	strtok
you cannot write to it though so if you need to modify the contents for any reason either directly or through a function like strtok or strcpy you ll have to create a local copy and manipulate that

4066336
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
if you re using some sort of mvvm style pattern then inotifypropertychanged events are automatically dispatched back to the ui thread so you don t need to worry about it inotifycollectionchanged from observablecollection isn t for reasons unknown

4066341
touchesmoved	touchesended
will have to handle myself gestures such as swipes pinchs counter pinchs pans double taps from multiple fingers with methods such as touchesended withevent touchesmoved withevent etc

4066516
spaces	delimiter
how do i read the following file which has columns of data with header and spaces or tab delimiter in common lisp

4066529
for-loop	arrays
if you need to set it to something other than 0 in units larger than a byte set an arrays of int s to 1 s then there is no standard function to do that -- you ll have to write your own for-loop for that

4066540
width	height
there needs to be a dialog prompt to prompt the graphic dimensions height width and then create six different kinds of mdi window depending on what kind of graphics

4066868
versioning	upgrade
the one versioning is always upgrade and only by apple software updates

4066942
jboss	weblogic
another solution is to forget weblogic altogether and use a different server such as jboss or tomcat

4066956
getter	setter
i have already written a interceptor with castle dynamic proxy that will encrypt the relevant property on the setter and decrypt it on the getter

4066956
getter	setter
not knowing castle dynamic proxy that well i m sure there might be a better way of handling the interception and detecting whether it is a getter or a setter etc

4066960
width	height
note that tag is inline elements you need to make it block-level with display block to apply width and height to it and make it look like a button

4066983
uiview	subviews
create a proxy uiview instance as scrollview s subviews and place all ui elements you want to be zoomed into it

4066989
google-chrome	firefox
ps with firefox or google-chrome not a problem

4067028
nunit	mstest
i usually use nunit as a unittest framework however where i work now they use solely mstest

addition	multiplication	addition	modulo	multiplication	modulo
both addition and multiplication are preserved structures under taking a primes modulo -- it is a homomorphism

4067227
client-side	server-side
which solution you choose does not matter so much because both methods will resolve the relationship client-side note that a sql database resolves joins on the server-side

4067342
width	height
i am trying to create a scrollable menu bar which i am succeeding in doing but now instead i want to add a large button with an image centred in the button instead of taking up the total width and height of the button

4067342
width	height
the above code creates an image and button over it where the button and image are of the exact same width and height

vim	gedit	vim	emacs	emacs	gedit
but if you use pretty much anything else to view the file -- less vim emacs gedit firefox etc

4067403
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the only reason i can imagine you may want to do this is that the parent is a uinavigationcontroller uitabbarcontroller and since that is the top view you want that view controller to be presenting the modal

4067434
curlpp	libcurl
downloading flv from youtube using curlpp on top of libcurl - video not playing

4067466
jobs	cron
the cli is extremely handy for running cron jobs

4067466
jobs	cron
you can create custom cake console tasks and then your cron jobs can rely on unit-tested code which has access to your app s cake-based models

4067533
folder	directory
it s important that all my assemblies are completely uninstalled before build takes place otherwise they re not copied to my output directory since compiler finds them in gac hence gac install fails since it can t find assemblies in the output bin folder

post	get
if you are using the communicator automation api as opposed to the unified comms client api and want to get the conversation text history from the conversation window then george durzi has an excellent blog post on this

4067717
hash-collision	key
hash-collision will happen so the code that calls hasharray_search needs to compare the search key with the one stored in the value object

4067758
mvp	presenter
the whole point of mvp is to have a very thin view and all application logic inside presenter so that presenter can be unit tested locally without a view which needs a browser

4067800
hide	show
as the title says i want to hide a listview s scrollbar when the listview isn t scrolling and show it when scrolling

4067941
typedef	struct
what if i want to pass in differently sized types in this case uintptr_t is typedef to unsigned long but what if i wanted to pass in a larger struct

4067950

an alternative to qlistwidget is a qscrollarea with a widget inside which has a qvboxlayout

4068117
google-chrome	firefox
you can test this by using firebug on firefox or google-chrome ships with a console for developers now

4068131
jsf	seam
so the decision was 1 build the whole client side of our app with gwt java code or 2 build our pages with jsf since we re using seam and extend them with gwt widgets

4068131
mvp	presenter
productivity raised significantly after that one developer was implementing the business logic mainly the presenter part of mvp while another was busy building the view part .ui.xml and the widget

4068136
rtos	qnx
i am using qnx neurtion rtos

4068161
int	chars
since you seem to be receiving bytes from the receivebyte function you ought to store them as bytes unsigned chars not as int since using an int to store a single byte wastes it s 3 bytes of memory

4068219
free	malloc
i become on mac a incorrect checksum for free object and under linux a malloc error

4068242

i have a uiview with uiimageview as its subviews and i need to change the image in that view while the user swipe it

4068326
post	get
change your get method to a post method so the hidden values get posted as well to the script

4068372

how can i achieve this multiplication addition using jquery

4068469
dia	visio
i tried a few uml design tools dia bouml umbrello visio eclipse s uml2

4068496
put	get
is that the latter creates a map that you can only put strings inside but you can be sure that you always get strings when requesting a value

4068496
put	get
the former makes you able to put everything inside it but you can t be sure what you will get when fetching a value off the map

4068614
gif	png
you can then add this line wgfileextensions array png gif jpg jpeg svg xls

4068615
width	height
so i am setting up height and width for this table

4068621
ubuntu	debian
here is a simple working setup using gst-launch install the gstreamer-tools package on ubuntu debian

4068621
width	height
video x-raw-yuv width 640 height 480

4068621
width	height
video x-raw-yuv width 640 height 480

4068621
width	height
ffmpegcolorspace forcing a specific video format video x-raw-yuv width 640 height 480 adding 640 transparent pixels to the left thereby moving the picture to the right and creating a videomixer with the name mix

4068635
many-to-many	one-to-many
now the one relational thing i do need to be able to do is represent one-to-many and many-to-many relationships between tables in my storage

4068641
ssl	https
this is what you get out of a classic ssl tls tunnel a https url in a web context

4068658
min	max
there is max size of province and min size of province for example min 2 max 10

4068678
put	get
note to get error messages description on your screen rather than blank window put these two lines on top of your script

4068679
width	height
i thought of having a script take all the images and resize them offline and then link to the new picture but the aspect ratio are all different so i can resize to get the same height or width but not both

4068693
inherited	properties	for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
the other change is using a normal for-loop a for...in loops is not the proper way to iterate through the arrays you ll get other inherited properties and not necessarily the order you expect

4068752
post	put
i didn t specify this earlier but the process should be synchronous from the point of view of the browser ie webserver gets the http post request from the browser message is put into the queue message is sent from the queue webserver sends http response to the browser

4068771
getter	setter
why isn t the compiler generating the getter setter methods automagically without me having to write synthesize property

4068774
inherited	properties
so i created the own custom static class and inherited the triggers dependency properties from system.windows.interaction there via reflection and addowner just exposed the properties as shadowtriggersproperty

4068784
128bit	64bit
i do not think it would be worth the effort sse2 allow you to perform two instances in parallel you use 64bit numbers and sse2 registers are 128bit but i find it likely that a handmade division algorithm would be at least twice as slow as the cpu idiv opcode

4068786
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i tested and it works on ie7 8 google-chrome safari and firefox

4068793

stateless	stateful
do use oop to have logical representations of both stateful and stateless things that may be manipulated have attributes or be used in a variety of ways

4068819
hide	show
concerning your second question modalpopupextender exposes show and hide methods on the server side as well as similar show and hide methods on the client side

4068823
cvs	svn
other option is pulling the changes from your cvs repo and rebasing them on svn repo

4068921
super	abstract	super	implements
i created two wrappers objects emptywrapper and scheduledwrapper that have a super class activitywrapper that implements some methods common to both childs and has some abstract methods properties for the child wrappers to respond accordingly

4068936
put	get
i want to use this key to get and put data in different forms

4069054
jobs	cron
it also seems that for some of root s cron jobs that it executes as root and as foo which both send email to root s mailbox

4069082
versioning	upgrade
i d have thought that the best way to defeat code that exploits known security holes in java is to upgrade to a java versioning that fixes the bug

4069104
outputstream	inputstream
streams inputstream and outputstream transfer binary data

4069154
free	malloc
moreover when using the standard solaris malloc free libraries free memory is not returned to the os so the size metric is never decreasing

4069174
width	height
do not set the loader width and height finish the loading first and only then - in your completehandler - add it to displaylist addchild and only after that change the size

4069175
int	chars
i have to convert from strings the first 2 chars into an int

4069256
min	max
until all your provinces are larger than min size and smaller than max size

4069275
children	parent
that way you should be able to get the list of departments in one call and iterate over it only once adding children departments to already existing parent ones

4069283
subtraction	addition
you cannot do addition or subtraction with time values and there is no obvious way to use time to store durations greater than 24hrs

4069309
mouseover	mouseout
on the menu i want each item to fade to gray on mouseover and then fade back to white on mouseout

4069314
versioning	upgrade
when i upgrade to a new versioning of thematic all changes to my template files were lost

4069325
rss	feed
for those that might need to know i am parsing an rss feed and finding the md5 of a node

4069328
mouseover	mouseout
because you re disabling the control in your mouseover handler so input messages are suppressed and mouseout never fires

4069354
post	get
in my rspec tests i normally do requests with get or post methods

4069385
hide	show
hide all then show me

4069400
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the problem is it works perfectly on safari on os x but on windows it throws up a security error both in firefox and google-chrome

4069416
base-class	subclassing
imedicalnote is a base-class interface which is subclassing into a few concrete subclassing bloodchecknote temperaturenote mineralconcentrationnote etc etc

4069416
inherited	subclassing
that s not acceptable as the number of subclassing is guaranteed to grow depends on the type of medical data we want to capture which is the whole point of the inherited in the first-place

4069433
hazelcast	terracotta
you could use shared memory solutions such as terracotta or hazelcast

4069492
disk	ram
if the memory that your program is using is swapped to disk then at any time the association between your virtual addresses and physical ram can be dropped and that physical ram used for something else

4069514
put	get
simply put an open ended or makes mysql get the rows and order them to eliminate the ones not in matching your query

4069535
justmock	typemock
if you are unit testing then static is no good since you cannot mock it although it can be done with special mocking tools such as typemock or justmock

4069536
ubuntu	linux
write a program that copies the contents from one file to another in c on linux platform ubuntu or create a program which make copies of files in ubuntu

4069551

it places every parent department in the treeview control and then correctly assigns it s children to the correct parent

4069554
operands	scalar
operands to the scalar flipâ flop

4069659
squash	merge	squash	branch
use the --squash option to git merge it ll take your branch squash it into a single commit and then merge that in

4069663
int	boolean
change your boolean properties to int

4069698
filewriter	bufferedwriter
for example i usually use a filewriter wrapped with a bufferedwriter for my outputs to files but i have always been irritated by the fact that there is no println like method and one has to use newline every second line to make the output human readable

4069744
put	get
when you put your mouse over home about or jobs menu options you get that awesome rollover effect in the brown field above

4069769
filewriter	bufferedwriter
as a general usage note you always want to wrap a low-level writer eg filewriter or outputstreamwriter in a bufferedwriter to minimize actual io operations

4069773
google-chrome	firefox
this works in firefox ie google-chrome

4069922
fileoutputstream	filewriter
rather than using filewriter you should be wrapping a fileoutputstream in an outputstreamwriter

4069922
printwriter	bufferedwriter
to use printwriter with the above just wrap the bufferedwriter in a printwriter

4069928
children	parent
make them children of the parent

4069941
strncmp	strcmp
strncmp is a little bit safer than strcmp because you specify how many comparisons will be made at most

4069944
put	get
get data from db put it in a list of object that represents rows records

4069945
strncmp	strcmp
you need to use strcmp function or strncmp

4069980
google-chrome	safari
firebug as ergo mentioned here is the most powerful of the browser-based development tools it allows step-by-step debugging however the latest versions of google-chrome and safari also come installed with develoment tools that are useful but not as much as firebug

4070036
getter	setter
if so - if those objects were implemented correctly - they should have their member variable getter setter property set to retain - which means they should hold a reference to your uibutton

4070043
strncmp	strcmp
make certain you use strncmp and not strcmp

4070043
strncmp	strcmp
the strcmp and strncmp functions lexicographically compare the null-terminated strings s1 and s2

4070043
strncmp	strcmp
the strcmp and strncmp return an integer greater than equal to or less than 0 according as the string s1 is greater than equal to or less than the string s2

4070073
put	get
if i put either table in by itself there is no problem but when i add the second table regardless of which one come first i get the problem

4070100
put	get
from the above node what i want to do is go through each and get the values inside it value typesource typeuser etc and put them in a pojo

4070152
google-chrome	firefox
rather than applying the shadow to the edges of the box like in firefox google-chrome it seems to apply shadw to the content

4070205
versioning	upgrade
another benefit is that your customer cannot upgrade jquery to the newest versioning for your webapp because it always uses the versioning that is embedded in the assembly

4070217
postgresql	mysql
all major engines that is mysql sql server oracle and postgresql will merge these predicates on parsing stage making identical plans from them

4070261
width	margin
one is to set your content column to a fixed width and float it left then set your ad column to have a left margin greater than or equal to the width of the content column

4070265
floating-point	integer
but something you need to consider is that accelerate neon are designed to greatly speed up integer operations but not necessarily floating-point operations

4070265
cpu	processors
you didn t mention your cpu processors and it seems that accelerate will use either neon or vfp for floating-point operations depending on your cpu

4070276
min	max
actually then myisam s composite index on emailaddress category orderdate should already contain max min and count per category and that should be cheap

4070286
urdu	arabic
i want to provide the support for arabic and urdu language segmentation

4070286
urdu	arabic
but i am not able to find breaking sentences for arabic or urdu languages

4070286
urdu	arabic
in arabic or urdu following punctuation characters where used

4070331
cloudant	couchdb
i am trying to connect to my couchdb database on cloudant using node.js

4070371
button	checkbox
edit same goes for radio button and checkbox

4070382
getter	setter
dynamic is not required when implementing the setter getter yourself

4070382
getter	setter
property in the interface very much is short hand for the getter setter method declarations

4070396
mouseover	mouseout
i tried with li mouseover and mouseout but its not working in ie7

4070412
udp	tcp
low level api to work with tcp udp etc

4070435
filewriter	printwriter
printwriter doesn t have a constructor that takes an append parameter but filewriter does

4070435
printwriter	bufferedwriter
interesting side note if you wrap an outputstream in a printwriter java automatically inserts a bufferedwriter in the middle

4070435
filewriter	printwriter
think of it like i want to print to a file so i need to wrap a filewriter in a printwriter

4070454
serializable	deserialization
there have been a number of vulnerabilities in the implementation of serializable and deserialization

4070491
width	height
you need to recalculate width and height after first condition

4070568
google-chrome	safari
1 webgl - very cool open source project works fine but works only on mozilla with the plugin and it supposed to work on google-chrome and safari as well but google-chrome supposed to be started with special key to enable it

4070594
graphviz	graph-visualization
first i tried to look for common graph-visualization packages graphviz tulip networkx python but i realized that all of them are specialized at graph-layouting when there are no coordinates

4070608
ubuntu	linux
i also got the same error on my windows machine than on my linux ubuntu machine

4070612
put	get
all projects get searched to find any custom controls to put in the toolbar i donâ t know if this is part of your problem

4070622
webclient	httpwebrequest
you could try using httpwebrequest instead of webclient

4070652
int	chars
then call inputstreamreader.read chars buf int offset int length to fill your chars buffer like this

4070696
cloudant	couchdb
cloudant is focused squarely on scaling couchdb up see the open-source bigcouch project to power data-intensive applications in the cloud

4070757
typemock	moles
for stuff like the above you need either the ms moles framework or a commercial tool like typemock

4070772
boost	stl
in your stl implementation it could be std tr1 unordered_map instead of stdext hash_map and there is boost unordered_map as well

4070799
google-chrome	firefox
the browser s width is like 1200px so it is not a concern and this happens on both firefox and google-chrome

4070863
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the above code works correctly on ie and opera but it doesn t work on firefox and webkit google-chrome safari

4070966
min	max
it was included in c99 so that modern cpus could use their native read sse instructions for floating point min and max and avoid a test and branch and thus a possibly mis-predicted branch

4070966
min	max
i ve re-written code that used std min and std max to use sse intrinsics for min and max in inner loops instead and the speed-up was significant

4071109
put	get
to take pdf1 and pdf2 and put the text on a single page in resulting pdf the first thing that comes to mind is that you could use cfpdf with the getinfo action to get the text if you don t already have it in a plain text or html format

4071120
folder	directory
explanation ls -r will recursively list all files and directory in your home folder

4071124
int	double
i have an nsmutablearray with instance of an object containing one int and two double added to the array in each loop

4071126
stdout	stderr
if you are using the django runserver you can print to stdout or stderr

4071131
pascal	delphi
modern versions of pascal objectpascal delphi may provide some form of generics

4071141
implements	extends
in order to extends the interception mechanism you need to reference the ninject.extensions.interception dll and implements the iinterceptor interface or extends the simpleinterceptor class

4071150
pop-up	dialog
it will pop-up a permission dialog which will be rejected if the user chooses not to share her current position

4071175
int	double
to have the contents of your object displayed the int double you need to implement the -description method in your object

4071177
min	max
you could get o log n by using a min max heap structure

4071181
pull	push
if you need to occasionally pull or push a subset of the data then notessql is probably the easiest approach

4071198
put	get
it doesn t seem to matter what i put in that third line i can t ever get the jquery to recognize that i m referring to the image

4071199
width	height
i had the width and height of the button s vbox bound to the picture s width and height

4071199
width	height
when i changed it to a static width and height it worked

4071208
button	checkbox
now i have the checkbox and the submit button and so

4071313
int	chars
when taking int from the file they are extracted fine however with the strings i just get a blanks space and garbage from my uninitialized chars array

4071327
rss	feed
i have it to where i snag the rss feed and parse the messages

4071351
int	double
first for very large int values converting to double might loose precision

4071378
junit	testng
do they depend on junit only or does testng work as well

4071381
subtraction	addition
you re probably better off creating your own class that wraps the ticks as uint64 and provides methods for converting to human-readable presentation like datestr doing addition and subtraction parsing the strings you re getting to the uint64 values and so on

4071410
x86	64bit
on x86 for example two 32 bit int values side-by-side are exactly the same as a 64bit long long value

4071468
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have a fairly complex piece of javascript that works flawlessly with no errors in google-chrome firefox safari and opera

4071471
typedef	struct
but couldn t you just typedef a struct in the c++ to determine the data type and append a header to the info you are putting on the stack indicating how the data is laid out

4071475
put	get
if you want to get rid of the message go to the bottom where it has predefined separated and put in that textbox then run again

4071510
getter	setter
avoid internal getter setter

4071510
getter	setter
practices and have getter and setter

4071543
operands	scalar
if either operands of scalar

4071636
pascal	delphi
this should be in standard pascal not delphi

4071640
stdout	stderr
it appears to be because both stdout and stderr have been redirected so tput doesn t know what terminal you want the info for

4071642
getter	setter
i would suggest not writing generating any getter or setter until you actually need them to be accessed from outside of your class

4071642
getter	setter
alternatively making those getter setter private by default would have the same result but it s more code for no real benefit

4071695
jar	war
the possible solution is that you might have another jar like servlet.jar available in a war file under tomcat that conflicts with servlet-api.jar s servlet.class

4071695
jar	war
try and find out which war contains the jar and remove it

4071716
spoofing	traffic
it isn t possible to spoofing your address unless the attacker is between you and your server which is very unlikely - he would have to be an isp or to be able to overwatch and control your internet traffic

4071717
portrait	landscape
i want to change the screen orientation from portrait to landscape and vice versa when the user rotates his android mobile phone clockwise anticlockwise

4071744
unsigned	short
chances are that your use of unsigned int short etc plus your compiler options especially structure packing might mean that your struct fields do not match the actual bmp file data in offset and maybe in length

4071863
folder	directory
i want to map a directory to different local folder such as aa adir and bb adir at the same time

4071864
super	self
since super differentialspeed self .__init__ resolves to the next __init__ in the call chain the next __init__ is object.__init__ which means you re passing arguments to that function

4071864
super	self
the correct thing to do in this case is almost certainly to remove the argument and just call super differentialspeed self .__init__

4071877
multiplying	add
the code bellow add to core data issues but after it added i can t save with error multiplying validation error occured

4071894
folder	directory
i called it from the jsp which works with other classes in folder in the classes directory

4071957
division	addition
after that you can determine if you ve landed on the other side of say a sloped line requiring only division addition operations

4071982
postgresql	mysql
i want to initially support mssql mysql postgresql and sqlite

4071982
postgresql	mysql
i have little postgresql experience i have mostly dealt with mysql

4071988
post	get
the post data that i am passing can be longer than maximum amount of characters that get method allows therefore i can t use only get method.

4071988
post	get
this page should be able to redirect to our server as well as to someone s server and it doesn t need to know where it came from or where it goes it just simply needs to keep the same post get and header information as well as additional information received at this step

4071993
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works fine for me in safari google-chrome opera ie - but the links aren t active in firefox and when i look at the code in firebug firefox renders the a href and li tags as separate lines

4072004
width	height
as suggested in the threads you pointed to you can check for when the view has focus and assume that once it has focus it has width height greater than 0

4072016
int	chars
qapplication s constructor takes an int argc chars argv to handle any qt specific commandline arguments

4072032
csv	tsv
if you only need to send data and bandwidth data usage is not a constraint then you can create a csv or tsv file with the data you need optionally compress it and send it to the server and implement all merging logic in the server

4072033
width	height
you ll want to style up the a inside the li making it s width and height 100 here s some other suggestions

4072063
profiling	debugging
this is very counterintuitive and i was wondering if there s any debugging profiling tips someone could help me with

4072106
integer	unsigned
the type uintptr_t is an unsigned integer that is guaranteed large enough to hold a pointer as well

4072117
hide	show
i have an asynctask in which i show a progressdialog in the onpreexecute and hide it again in onpostexecute something like

4072261
cairngorm	flex
you may have issues with swcs if you don t compile cairngorm from source for flex sdk mis-matches but once you have all your library projects in place this should help you get started

4072276
hide	show
another approach would be to output your data table into something that is modified by say javascript using a library like jquery you can utilize a table plugin that will let you hide show columns and reorder as you please

4072293
groovy	gsp
i m building a grails groovy gsp app

4072293
groovy	gsp
one other thing i noticed is that for error messages regarding groovy gsp pages the line numbers are always completely off and useless

4072295
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari have dev tools built in on google-chrome ctrl+shift+i will open the panel

4072301
int	double
declare implicit only the conversion operators from base-types int double string ...

4072363
boost	stl
i would like to extract 34 1 using c++ stl but no boost c

4072417
firefox	safari
again not in firefox or safari

4072427
google-chrome	firefox
both ie and google-chrome work fine it s just firefox 3.6.12 giving me problems

4072432
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox and safari work as expected

4072459
button	checkbox
when a user click the checkbox i would use radio button if only one form could be displayed at time use jquery or what ever to change the value of that particular div s display to block

4072640
nsoperationqueue	nsinvocationoperation
i use nsoperationqueue and nsinvocationoperation to implement a thread

4072657
uiview	subviews
afaik if you add a uinavigationcontroller to a uiview via code it won t send those messages to it s subviews by default

4072706
ddms	adb
i ve used all the tricks i can find on the web the command line adb kill-server the ddms reset adb i started the emulator both before and after eclipse and searched for ports being used by other programs

4072723
octal	decimal
the i conversion specifier handles decimal octal and hexadecimal formats but you still have the first two problems

4072723
strtol	atoi
if you aren t allowed to use atoi you probably aren t allowed to use strtol either

4072723
octal	hex
if you need to be able to handle octal or hex formats then it gets a little more complicated

4072723
octal	hex
the c convention is for octal formats to have a leading 0 digit and for hex formats to have a leading 0x

4072723
int	chars
if the first non-whitespace chars is not a - + 0 or non-zero decimal digit then this is not a valid int string

4072723
int	chars
if any of the remaining chars do not satisfy the check function specified above then this is not a valid int string

4072741
children	parent
i also looked at trees as in defaultmutabletreenode and documents as in xml and dom the problems i saw there where they both allow a node to have multiple children while my understanding of a pure linkedlist is that each node has only one parent and one child

4072746
filtering	grouping
i need to set up ip filtering in a sharepoint document library based on a grouping that a user is a member of

however when i put the same url into my browser the request goes through and i get a response

4080679
sequence	permutation
i don t even want to think about how many hours and install permutation it took to come up with this sequence

4080690
google-chrome	firefox
the weird thing is that the exception happens on google-chrome and firefox but not ie8

4080697
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
you would have to either use a different data structure altogether such as sorteddictionary or sortedlist or use a separate list to store the order in which they were added

4080732
client-side	server-side
but it seem like the issue is the postback devexpress should have a feature in there to fire a client-side event and keep that all on the client and not have to worry about a server-side postback

4080747
ant	maven
we proceeded with maven ant tasks using the maven-ant-tasks jar

4080767
wordpress	joomla
if you need to find drupal or joomla plugins replace tghe word wordpress in the google search

4080790
int	double
and then work with the contents as a float and i have also tried with a few others such as int and double

4080852
swt	swing
we ve analyzed gef picollo netbeans visual api plain swing or swt jface but none of them seems to help us to achieve our goal which is implement a really basic image editing tool

4080875
getter	setter
almost invariably the use of getter and setter in c++ is poor style and inadvisable

4080903
hide	show
hi i have an html page with jquery accordian menu that show hide divs on click

4080911
chown	chmod
also may as well check ownership permissions chown and then chmod the folder so it s writable

4080919
getter	setter
i should rewrite it some day now that i know how to fetch the type of an already written data member plus several functions aimed at converting identifiers member - getter - setter - parameter - local variable - constant underscore separated words - lower upper camel cases

4080919
getter	setter
alas i ve been introduced to demeter and i tend to minimize my use of getter and setter and hence my need to modernize the ftplugin

4080919
getter	setter
edit since then i ve written two new refactoring methods for my lh-refactor plugin extract setter and extract getter

4080919
getter	setter
as explained above the extraction methods know how to build the names of the setter and the getter from the name of the member variable

4080934
super	abstract
what really makes me feel bad about mocking abstract classes is the fact that neither the default constructor yourabstractclass gets called missing super in mock nor seems there to be any way in mockito to default initialize mock properties e.g list properties with empty arraylist or linkedlist

4080943
width	height
the first time the image loads the browser will not know the width or height of it so it goes in at some arbitrary and usually wrong size

4080943
width	height
subsequent requests will load the image from cache very quickly possibly before the javascript has a chance to run which means that the width and height attributes are populated correctly

4080943
width	height
you might be able to fix this by putting the width and height attributes in the html that is sent to the client

4080962
textview	imageview
i am trying to make a grid view of a view composed of an imageview and a textview

4080962
textview	imageview
let s say my inner textview has an id of a and my inner imageview has an id of b

4080988
int	chars
an additional pad chars is allocated which may be used to force the encoded output into an int multiple of 4 chars or equivalently when the unencoded binary text is not a multiple of 3 bytes

4081052
post	get
normally selecting language for a site is independent of other form submissions and you can get away with a get instead of post

4081139
mp3	wav
i also stream audio files wav mp3 via a php mechanism

4081154
iboutlet	ibaction
preferably using an ibaction or an iboutlet

4081156
min	max
is there an alternative to hard coding these min and max values

4081169
min	max
unique constraint does allow two properties to be linked that way hoping min max constraints allow that

4081176
min	max
note these are sql type min max not the .net types like the previous 2 answers -

4081189
gif	png
if you have uncompressed images like bmps you will get better results using a compression technique specific to images than using gzip so you are better off just converting them to gif png jpg depending on your needs

4081198
post	get
if you mean without a post then yes you can use a get

4081202
getter	setter
there are some side effects that may occur when using setter or getter here -- because they are methods and hence may be overridden

4081228
integer	unsigned
however before the right shift it must convert the x to an unsigned 32-bit integer

4081228
integer	unsigned
therefore the overall effect of is convert x into a 32-bit unsigned integer

4081232
bmp	png	gif	bmp	gif	png
other than bmp s if you see someone using them over the wire prepare your shotgun images are mostly already compressed including jpeg s png s and gif s

4081272
hash	md5
get its hash with your algorithm of choice md5 sha1 etc

4081273
post	get
you would have to use either post or get to pass html data from the page to a php function

4081298
post	get
so go and study ajax so that you will be able to make an async call to a php script that will elaborate get post variable and call the php function

4081298
post	get
or just look at the post and the get functions of jquery

4081303
google-chrome	safari
in testing it in google-chrome and safari the animations are smooth and very much to my liking

4081372
post	put
read the content of that post again and put each word in a fixed buffer array 50 words until i find the keyword

4081387
sqlconnection	sqltransaction
you can create an sqlconnection and sqltransaction and supply it to the linq to sql datacontext

4081399
children	parent
since you have a min-heap there your downheap operation should swap the new parent with the smaller of its children

4081401
hlsl	glsl
gpu code shader languages such as glsl cg or hlsl or gpgpu stuff like cuda or opencl typically defines types like these though as names for the corresponding simd datatypes

4081406
jobs	cron
these environment variables will then be available to all cron jobs run through your crontab

4081455
post	get
if you can t get this to work then post back and we ll help you get it sorted out

4081458
datamapper	activerecord
2.0 s datamapper pattern is really superior to the 1.2 activerecord model

4081552
hide	show
alternatively i guess you could put this code show hide calls in the constructor and destructor of the modal dialog if you want to keep the code there

4081638
width	height
i d like to get the equivalent width height area in metres

4081646
width	height
you need to adapt it to resize the image to a specified width and height

4081668
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
you can use nsdatecomponents to store only the components you need hour and minutes for example and then use nscalendar datebyaddingcomponents todate options to create an absolute date reference when you need using the serialized components and a base date

4081677
integer	unsigned
yes - will cause erlang to require a packet frame of a 4 byte unsigned big endian integer length value on receive and will emit one before each packet of data sent

4081678
post	get
i suggest starting off with the jquery documentation and if you run into issues post specific questions with code snippets back here and i m sure you ll get lots of answers and feedback

4081679
rss	feed
for the specific case of an rss feed and the specific case of individual corrupt item entries you can use xmltextreader to manually read in each item separately handling the xmlexception for invalid items

4081688
filtering	grouping
i m not entirely sure whether you want to filtering or grouping the results

4081698
serializable	deserialization
hope this example helps - covers both xml serializable and deserialization using linq

4081716
fink	macports
i have been unable to compile some packages like wxwidgets on mac os 10.6.4 using gcc 4.5 compiled from source not from macports fink etc

4081724
google-chrome	firefox
according to the documentation here it supports four browsers google-chrome ie firefox and htmlunit

4081724
google-chrome	firefox
i can import the firefox driver using from selenium.firefox.webdriver import webdriver and the google-chrome driver using from selenium.chrome.webdriver import webdriver

4081764
jtextpane	jeditorpane
a jeditorpane just a like a jtextpane has a document that you can use for inserting strings

4081831
getter	setter
so i can use property copy to auto generate setter getter

4081855
put	get
it would seem silly to do the first because most banks put a limit on the number of free transactions you get per month

4081904
boost	stl
considering my code only depends on boost and the stl that the issue is to check code compatibility and not lib compatibility

4081922
sorting	grouping
sorting analytics grouping counting aggregation etc

4081939
punctuation	words
split a body of text into tokens words punctuation

4081982
inherited	subclassing
calling a constructor from clone would be problematic as this would break inherited in case a subclassing wants to add its own additional cloneable logic

4081982
inherited	subclassing
another problem is that any subclassing that forget to override clone will automatically inherited the default shallow copy which is likely not what you want in case of mutable state which will now be shared between the source and the copy

4081987
hex	binary
i assume that by a hex file you actually mean a binary file not a text file with hex codes

4082020
cos	sin
x y z sin pi m m cos 2pi n n sin pi m m sin 2pi n n cos pi m m

4082062
ubuntu	linux
when i log into a particular ubuntu linux 10.04 64bit host via ssh i get a bash shell

4082070
mdpi	hdpi
i have put the bitmap in all density-folders hdpi mdpi ldpi and scaled them according to the documentation the mdpi-bitmap is 25x25 pixels and the ldpi-bitmap size 75 of the mdpi-bitmap size and the hdpi-bitmap size 150 of the mdpi-bitmap size

4082128
put	get
i could solve the problem by making sure that in the application i first get all instances that i want to delete put them in a second container then loop over the second container and delete the instances but since there is always the risk that an observer explicitly deletes other instances that were already on my to-be-deleted list i have to put explicit observers to keep this second copy up to date as well

4082154
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
how ever you do it you will need separate year month day hour minute and second values so that you can construct an nsdate from nsdatecomponents using nscalendar s -datefromcomponents method

4082202
width	height
try 20 is height 10 is width

4082216
hide	show
that way i can do some show hide on the tables like a next prev navigation

4082234
mouseup	mousedown
if you re creating a custom drag function you could use mousedown and mouseup events

4082261
width	height
it s a chess board and so i want it s width to be the same as it s height

4082279
squeak	visualworks
i know that there is a reader for sif in gst but i m not sure if visualworks or squeak have readers for this format

4082303
post	get
for example using fiddler i issued several requests to and i got 200 response for the head get and post but i got 405 for the trace

4082382
imap	nntp
--you could use php s imap functionality which supports imap pop3 and nntp

4082410
width	height
so when the keyboard appears or disappears or when orientation changes i need to detect the width and height and re-layout accordingly

4082431
mousemove	mousedown
on mousedown you should flag a possible drag and save the mouse coordinates where the mousedown occurred then attach a mousemove handler

4082431
mousemove	mousedown
the mousemove handler should change the css class of the dragged element only when the distance between the saved mousedown coordinates and the current mouse coordinates is greater than some delta

4082431
mouseup	mousedown
finally on drop mouseup then handle the drop event as desired and clear the possible drag flag and the saved mousedown coordinates

4082478
httpwebrequest	networkcredentials
if the website is using http basic authentication a browser-generated login dialog you can set the httpwebrequest s credentials property to a networkcredentials instance

4082569
free	malloc
every new should match a delete every to a and every malloc to a free but don t use them in c++...

4082576
integer	fractions
always remember that floating point stores binary fractions your number will be represented with a summation series of 2 -n where n is any integer from 1 to mantissa size raised to some exponent n

4082595
free	malloc
if you malloc it free it

4082692
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
the only thing you should look out for is new vs new that s why i like c type memory allocators so much more calloc malloc free if i don t need constructors and destructors ie

4082729
ssl	https
note you might need to use curl_setopt to turn off curlopt_ssl_verifyhost and curlopt_ssl_verifypeer if you want to reliably follow across https ssl

4082748
vim	emacs
emacs - and i suppose vim maybe - have several advantages

4082751
post	get
facebook is ajax intensive series of http get post operations without full page refreshes

4082753
vim	emacs
emacs and vim are the most polished and multi-purpose software i can think about

4082759
feedback	review
the review is where what was finished in the sprint is shown to others typically stakeholders to get feedback and update the product backlog with new items that may come from seeing the product

4082776
post	put
so on the show view i want to show a post and at the bottom have the fields that when completed and submitted create a new comment associated with the post and put it in the database

4082776
put	get
i just can t get a form to work to put new ones in

4082840
nsdateformatter	nscalendar
well i ve written enough date formatting code to know that constructing nscalendar and nsdateformatter on the fly utterly kills performance

4082868
post	get	instances	transient
the forumpartitionrouter is the more obvious different forums are stored in different databases this is interesting because it s clear that they have some awesome management tools that allow them to define these partitions to their django servers when the servers are started treating each django instances as a transient and ephemeral object of their system and the server uses the forum_id to go and find the right database from which to get the related members of the forum in this case the post

4082900
daemons	systemd
you can write a daemons from scratch using the pcntl functions since you don t care about multiple worker processes it s super-easy to get a process running in the background. or cheat and just make a script that runs forever and run it via screen or leverage some solid library code like pear s systemd daemons or nanoserv

4082906
children	parent
give the #container div a min-width 1000px property that way the parent will always be wide enough to hold both the children side-by-side

4082912
int	chars
if you are parsing a text file with the int represented in decimal ascii chars you can just use

4082925
google-chrome	safari
it works fine on google-chrome but not on my ipad safari

4082954
relaxng	schematron
you can do this using a co-occurrence constraint with a relaxng schema or you could use schematron in conjunction with any of those schema languages

4082954
relaxng	schematron
i ve resolved issues like this before by using embedded schematron rules with schemas good discussion of this with xsd on xfront and with relaxng on xml.com

4082960
openjpa	openejb
openejb bundles openjpa as default persistence provider

4082965
children	parent
also if there are children pages they need to be in a nested and show as a dropdown when the parent is hovered on

4082979
try-catch	exception-handling
you might want to put the try-catch into a separate function as the body of your foreach loop is getting large once you catch several types of exception-handling

4082980
post	get
i will post a solution as soon as we managed to get the exception solved

4082996
put	get
i get really annoyed at repeated code patterns like this so for me it would probably be worth it to extract the repeated copy paste control code and put it in it s own method

4083001
typedef	struct
you would use such a struct just the same way you would with however compilers often emit the name of the struct not the alias and so you may get better error messages involving the struct if you give it a name and typedef that as opposed to typedef ing an anonymous struct

4083003
codeigniter	kohana
have a look at codeigniter or kohana

4083022
onchange	onkeyup
i have used both onchange and onkeyup and neither seem to be helping

4083033
put	get
get the diameter and height for option 2 from my query and put those dimensions in my p tag.

4083131
hide	show
i can retrieve level1 and level2 calling show and hide on them successfully

4083142
children	parent
.show and .hide on a parent doesn t affect the children if they re hidden they stay hidden...they re handled independently

4083154
folder	directory
i tried deleting my .suo file my bin directory and my obj folder then rebuilding but still no dice

4083163
folder	directory
so the installer will create the logs folder give all authenticated users ntfs permissions to wreak havoc on that directory and blow away all of the log files that were created after the original installation as part of the uninstall process to leave a clean uninstall

4083175
width	height
we can t accomplish min width height with just the usercontrol because if we set the height for it then the parent container won t scale it verticaly and the same goes for width

4083175
width	height
if we try to juggle them around then there are situations where we end in an endless width height resizing loop

4083175
width	height
what we need is another hidden control in the same space that fills it completely and can tell us what its width and height is everytime it changes

4083175
width	height
then we can use the math.min width height solution

4083193
vsto	add-in
there are several ways to do this but since your using vb.net your best off using the newest approach which is building a vsto com add-in

4083193
vsto	add-in
there are numerous other questons available on how to best build a vsto add-in some in c# some in vb.net but all this information is exactly the same for both just different syntax

4083193
vsto	add-in
your existing one plus a excel vsto add-in which you can also do in vb.net

4083214
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
in terms of layout of what we have we have a navigation controller and on it s stack is a uitabbarcontroller - uitableviewcontroller - uitableviewcontroller and we want to add on top of that a uiviewcontroller with a uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontroller in that

4083291
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
just wondering what is the size and number of cookies allowed by ie firefox google-chrome and safari

4083302
put	get
the open command works fine and i get a succeeded in active and passive mode but when i try to do anything check for a file put a file download i get 500 illegal port command

4083322
width	height
in all the examples that i can find that use a jtextarea the height width is known before constructing the jtextarea and if the jtextarea would require more height then it is put inside of a jscrollpane

4083322
width	height
obviously the height of jtextarea is dependent on the width and the text contents

4083322
width	height
the correct dimensions should be the width that i provided when i constructed it and the minimum height that is required to display all the text with the provided width

4083322
width	height
i m tempted to basically create my own jtextarea that takes a width and string and computes the necessary minimum height based on the width and font settings but i figured i would ask around first before spending the time to do that

4083325
vim	emacs
what toolmakers are banking on is that those extra things provide enough of a benefit that it will outweigh how effective vim and emacs are as editors

4083333
openrowset	openquery
if the databases are on different servers you ll need to look at using one of openquery openrowset or linked servers to do the query but fundamentally even with all these you d still be writing a variation on the command above

4083430
hex	binary
if you are opening the binary file in what is known as a hex editor you will need to understand hexadecimal

4083431
division	multiplication
when a multiplication or division involves a signed zero the usual sign rules apply in computing the sign of the answer

4083447
capitalize	capitalization
note according to this capitalization of day names article the names of the days of the week are not capitalize in french like they are in my default english locale but that is taken into account automatically too which means the weekday name passed to it must be in the language of the current locale and is also case-sensitive

4083531
versioning	upgrade
however i must consider the scenario when a user has an old versioning of the world state on their phone because they were in the middle of a game they upgrade the app and now the app cannot load the world state

nsscanner	nsstring
i considered about converting to nsstring and re-converting into sint64 with nsscanner or strtoll but i believe there s better way

4083602
google-chrome	safari
add it as a javascript function...i believe that webkit supports it so it should work in ios android google-chrome and safari

4083609
int	double
it s safe to assume that updating a double is never atomic even if it s size is the same as an int with atomic guarantee

4083654
super	self
as i understand it the purpose of self super init

4083654
super	self
it could be argued that super init is unlikely to fail but then why assign the results of it to self and check for nil

4083680
post	get
basically if a post heading takes up 40 characters then i don t want to display any other headings basically i need to get the length of all post titles combined and work out which ones can be displayed to fit within the character limit constraints

after much research and hitting several brick walls i decided to create my own class that inherited from webservicehostfactory and overrides some of the implementation in order to specify the maxreceivedmessagesize properties on the binding

4083759
png	ico
see also the evolution of the ico part 4 png images

4083778
width	height
well perhaps if you know your width you could run some tests and work out how wide each character of text is that way you could use a loop to determine how many characters fit on each line and total the characters that are to be shown then you could set the height based on how many lines there are to be

4083898
hide	show
i have a text link that show hide a div layer

4083928
multiplying	multiplication
this function is only for pretty way pass the size of element and number of elements when in malloc you must multiplying this values to get needed number of bytes this function check integer overflow too in multiplication

4083931
calloc	malloc
the only notable difference is that calloc is required to initialize the allocated space to zeroes while there is no such guarantee with malloc

4083946
calloc	malloc
for this reason since calloc uses two arguments of type size_t it can allocate bigger blocks than malloc will ever be able to since malloc takes only one argument of type size_t

4083955
decoder	encoder
assuming you have access to a bencode encoder and decoder you could

4084105
junit	mockito
i agree that junit and mockito are excellent starting points

4084106
addition	multiplication
in addition as darren mentions in his answer you will likely have to use the element-wise multiplication operator instead of the matrix multiplication operator

4084151
scheme	racket
to be fair though the sxml folks are interested in supporting all scheme not just racket so they can certainly be forgiven for not spending lots of time writing documentation in the racket format scribble

4084242
put	get
you might be tempted to reverse-engineer the grants after they get put in place by some ad-hoc method but it s easy to miss something when new tables or views are added to the application

4084273
getter	setter
i created a new question at creating an performant open delegate for an property setter or getter with a better explanation of my issue and a solution using wrapping which i want to improve on

4084276
ienumerable	ilist
if you do not want to provide calling code this ability then you should return back ilist or ienumerable results - which contain the results of a query that has already executed

4084277
post	get
if you can post some code you would get precise answers

4084367
uilabel	nsstring
i m not having much luck i ve tried to use cgcontextaddrect + cgcontextsetdrawingmode + cgcontexteoclip cgcontextclip as well as trying to use nsstring s -drawinrect method and also resizing the frame of a uilabel

4084415
width	height
if the width height of the header is fixed and you want each of those elements to appear at a certain position within the header using float and margins is a bad idea

4084457
google-chrome	firefox
i have already set the option cache true but the cache seems only work in ie but not in firefox and google-chrome

4084477
width	height
also due display inline other css text height width background image is not applying to your div so remove it and use float left instead

4084482
subtract	add
you can iterate through the string and add or subtract the appropriate number from each alpha character so that the ascii value is resolved to the opposite case ascii value

the precision of the gyroscope and accelerometer sensors is much greater than the precision of the compass and gps

4087127
accelerometer	gyroscope
the compass and gps are for finding out where the device is on the globe and the gyroscope and accelerometer are good for finding out where the device has moved in the last few milliseconds

4087127

4088373
superclass	subclassing
the second approach violates the principle that superclass should not know about each of its subclassing

4088373
superclass	subclassing
i think the element you re missing is that the base class can define template methods like getboardsize countredpieces countblackpieces that can be overridden by subclassing and your superclass has code that uses those template methods therefore telling its subclassing what to do but not how to do it

4088375

4088530
put	get
in jpa 1.0 only basic mappings can be marked as apart of the id requiring redundent mappings and some code to ensure that the values relationships get put into the cache correctly when persisting

4088530

if you mark the joincolumns as read-only you will need to get the values from the referenced dept and put them into the correspoinding basic id attributes manually when you want to persist a project

4088534
ienumerable	ilist
if you can use ienumerable instead of ilist to pass your data to rest of your program you would be able to collapse this list using the selectmany linq method

they both inherited from defaultmodelbinder and they both encode a single properties on two separate view model classes using an iencodingservice that is injected into their constructors

4088719
int	double
however if you handle double or floats instead of int based types such as hours or days setting the interval to zero may be a little bit extreme while zooming you will end up having overly precise labels such as 2 907343253253235

4088723
min	max
max and min length

4088738

std realloc is dangerous in c++ if the malloc d memory contains non-pod types

4089225
hash	md5
looking at the traffic with fiddler i see that the content-md5 header is set to a valid md5 hash

4089225
hash	md5
the md5 hash being passed to putblock with base64 encoding ytkxyzu4oda5mmnlzgjkyjfiodjjmmqznzg2zmq1mdk and without it a91c588092cedbdb1b82c2d3786fd509 doesn t seem to make a difference

for-loop	arrays
do these need to go into an arrays and then through a for-loop

4089275
post	get
after splitting i want to filter lines with get or post word in them using regex and store this filtered lines into new file

4089293
put	get
if you can try to put any temporary files and folders into a parent folder that you can add to svn ignore and you will get rid of a lot of these problems

4089299
lisp	prolog
i m not going to say that php is the most efficient language to be doing this in...i would suspect c++ or java to be much better alternatives if you aren t exactly on board with jumping into prolog or lisp but there s also fann which is a library for neural networks and has bindings for various languages including php but it doesn t seem to work with php 5.3 and appears to no longer be maintained but i m sure it s still great for other languages

4089357
ivar	subclassing	getter	setter
that allows subclassing to override the setter getter and do something different to just fetching the value from the ivar

4089372
int	chars
for primitive types int chars bool and friends just set the variables to be equal

4089391
children	parent
i am using mvvm for a wpf app and i have a telerik radtreeview and when i collapse a parent i d like to recursively collapse all children and their children etc so that when i expand the parent again i don t see any grandchildren because all children are collapsed

4089394
lisp	smalltalk
dynamic typing -- possibly a lisp invention possibly smalltalk

4089394
lisp	smalltalk
object orientation -- mooched from smalltalk by lisp i think

4089396
disk	ram
as far as i can see without changing your system on root level to install memcached or store session files on a ram disk this is not possible

4089404
memcached	apc
in memcached you can access the data from various languages c python etc.. while apc works only for php

4089427
imagemagick	wand
the code you re looking for is in imagemagick wand import.c

4089439
nsurl	nsstring
turns out that info objectforkey uiimagepickercontrollermediaurl returns a nsurl and not a nsstring

4089440
fileinputstream	filechannel
fileinputstream has file getchannel which returns a filechannel which can tell you the current position in the stream

4089440
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
so if you give a bufferedreader a fileinputstream to read from you can find out where the bufferedreader stopped reading in the fileinputstream and you can also set the fileinputstream to that position before you give it to the bufferedreader

4089440
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
so the position of the fileinputstream is not the same as the position in the bufferedreader

4089440
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
you may have read 20 lines from the bufferedreader but the bufferedreader may have read 30 from the fileinputstream

4089477
ddms	adb
you can however do it over adb from the ddms window of your development machine as adb runs in the graphics group which has permission to the framebuffer

4089481

4089616
getter	setter
pass a reference to gameengine in the contructor or use a getter setter type method

4089644
aggregate-functions	sum	subtraction	addition
the only aggregate-functions allowed in an indexed view are count_big and sum because they distribute over set addition and subtraction that is

when i post 56 cents and i put as shown in the code 00 cents in the new object it still shows the 56 cents thus it looks at it is right ignoring my new m variable

4089789
google-chrome	firefox
you could try which displays those uicolor in a browser that supports rgba firefox and google-chrome

4089794
portrait	landscape
when you create a uisplitviewcontroller and add it to uitabbarcontroller it will work fine in portrait mode even if you swap from portrait to landscape and back

4089794
portrait	landscape
it will launch in portrait mode but will immediately switch to landscape mode if you hold it that way and the problems seem to be gone

4089827
dns	spf
i was able to look up the spf records on a specific dns by using the following query

4089849
hide	show
you can however hide and later on show it again

4089896
folder	directory
the root folder of the pylons app should probably be where you point the vserver at and let pylons handle its own chunk of the directory tree

4089900
inherited	properties
the map class creates new instances of these objects which all inherited from the drawable class which contains the basic methods and properties needed to draw the object to the screen

4089917
min	max
this would let them choose before in the 1st one and after in the 2nd one to provide for a min and max search on date

4089927
width	height
setting the width and height to 100 kind of works but it requires a lot of tinkering when you have a lot of paths

4089934
openssl	gnutls	ldd	gnutls
in addition it s possible that your version of svn is linked against another library than openssl for its ssl tls stack for example gnutls this should be visible using ldd on the svn binary

4089979
spaces	delimiter
query seven columns in management studio and then save the results as a tab-delimited text file the resulting file is generated and delimiter properly but when i run the same query in ssis to produce the same text file it insists on right-padding all varchar columns with spaces

hide	show
the only way i was able to consistently get he window to hide and show is as follows

4090001
min	max
specific max and min length is not supported and will probably not be implemented but who knows

4090023
mp4	h.264
i have a library of footage encoded as h.264 aac inside mp4 containers

4090029
put	get
however that all depends on how big your data set is - if it s lots of data to get the next 20 rows i d put something like press here for more results and wait for the user s input to fire off the request

4090056
unix	solaris
i use teamcity to build c++ on unix solaris

4090104
folder	directory
the images are being displayed by a css file residing in a virtual directory folder

4090180
metaclass	subclassing
i had an event metaclass from which every specific event could subclassing ie ui events npc events etc

4090180
metaclass	subclassing
eventually the design of having an event metaclass from which i have to keep subclassing was not very flexible for me and it was tedious work so i went with another approach where i can attach properties arbitrarily to an event object and the handling component would have to know how to deal with it

4090204
firefox	safari
they look great in firefox safari but the social media icons don t render correctly in ie

4090336
hide	show
and when clicked i want it to hide and show another box

4090374
apache	lighttpd
apache was somehow fixing all the headers just before there were actually sent out and lighttpd does not really care

width	height
look at your object tag s width and height attributes

4090396
springsource	grails
sts is an eclipse distribution packaged by springsource who also own grails project

4090425
hash	md5
and 16 bytes 128 bits is the size of an md5 hash

4090425
rainbowtable	hash
while a crypto hash function can t be easily reversed there are online rainbowtable services which can revert them for short or common inputs

4090427
pop-up	dialog
i need to show a grid or table of data in a pop-up dialog box on android

4090436
realloc	malloc
the main exception i can think of is code that allocates a big array then reduces the size once the size needed is known - but even this might require moving data on some malloc implementations ones which segregate blocks strictly by size so i consider this usage of realloc really bad practice

4090559
mouseover	mouseleave
the problem is that because the arrows are on top of the photo when i mouseover the arrows to click they dissapear because the mouseleave from the photo is triggered

4090579
typemock	moles
microsoft moles and typemock have this capability

4090605
serializable	deserialization
i think the best solution will be to implement some methods for serializable deserialization of such collections by yourself

4090609
getter	setter
when i run doctrine orm validate-schema it pops up a bunch of warnings about my mapped columns being public and not using getter setter methods to wrap them

4090648

i have this function to generate a number from min to max

4090729
min	max
now i would like extend this query to get min max and avg of mynumber

4090734
getter	setter
here is the result of what we ve done so far ignore the fact that we have a million getter and setter -- it s a requirement for the project that we won t actually be implementing in that way

4090741
getter	setter
and as for your second question a property is distinct from it s getter setter methods

4090776
hide	show
i tried using show hide methods but this won t change the stack order

4090798
backgrounding	multitasking
if it is running in multitasking mode i imagine that you d be able to access location data through a backgrounding task

4090821
accessor	properties
as for the second question the custom attribute is set on the properties itself not on the properties accessor methods

4090838
portrait	landscape
thanks for your code on fixing this for portrait and landscape

4090838
portrait	landscape
in my app this works because i just wanted to force them into portrait to start and if they move to landscape after that it rotates and works fine because i support all orientations

4090838
portrait	landscape
if its not then its in portrait and if it is then its landscape based on how the splitviewcontroller works by setting that to nil or not

4090868
superclass	subclassing
the first line of your subclassing constructor must be a call to super to ensure that the constructor of the superclass is called

4090914

i was under the impression that if a user attempted to visit a website that had been secured with an ssl certificate but did not use https and instead used plain http in the address box a 403

4091032
width	height
just create a coordinate region using the width and height of the latlonbox

4091056
vsto	add-in
currently all this is possible and simple to do with a .xlam what are the pros cons of moving to vsto or creating a c# add-in i notice vs2010 has a new project option of creating an excel 2007 add-in

4091068
uu-parsinglib	parsec
we ve had great success using uu-parsinglib - we ve switched to that from parsec as it s quite a bit more flexible and powerful - eg it can support lazy parsing if needed and you don t need to explicitly use a combinator like try in parsec to mark possible back-tracking points

4091083
google-chrome	safari
i am able to do js functions from a except for safari google-chrome

4091089
apache	nginx
i have nginx reverse proxying to apache and if i add deny from 111.111.111.111 to my htaccess it still allows them through as nginx doesn t forward the remote_addr ip of the visitor

4091140
drawingml	presentationml
you d need to create an xslt or use another transform technology such as linq in .net to convert presentationml and drawingml assuming powerpoint 2007 and later to a different mark up

4091162
versioning	upgrade
update i was asked which framework versioning we re using - it s 2.0rtm and it s extremely difficult to get upgrade past that point because it s on an xpe platform

4091173
subtract	add
interval is more portable than assuming that you can add or subtract days although i ve noticed some slight differences in the interval syntax between oracle and postgresql

4091189
width	height
for part 2 of your question simply add the icon to the itemtemplate and make it slide from outside and or grow changing width height with the vs animation

4091239
mamp	wamp
imo mamp wamp easy get up and go in a development environment

while your app tree may be in a full trust environment nothing is enforcing the rule for the public protected methods and classes

4091503
ubuntu	debian	redhat	fedora
i know that fedora and redhat share a similar kernal while ubuntu used the debian kernel

4091509
free	malloc
_malloc_crt used elsewhere in the c runtime such as to allocate memory for the environment and for argv on the other hand calls straight to malloc and _free_crt calls straight to free

4091525
free	strdup
your string handling in numpair looks ok strdup + free and your field container delete looks okay but it s hard to say because you don t show what v_ is

4091577
post	get
i made the following entries into my route file so that the get for profile will route me to the profile action in the user controller and the post for profile will route to the update_profile action in the user controller

4091595
uiwebview	uimenuitem
i have a custom menu item uimenuitem attached to a uiwebview

richfaces	openfaces	richfaces	icefaces	richfaces	tomahawk	icefaces	openfaces	icefaces	tomahawk	tomahawk	openfaces	primefaces	openfaces	primefaces	icefaces	primefaces	richfaces	primefaces	tomahawk
the strength of jsf is mainly being a java ee maintained standard and the availability of relatively a lot of 3rd party component libraries primefaces richfaces icefaces openfaces tomahawk etc

4091610
struts	stripes
you should pick a request action based mvc framework instead like spring mvc struts or stripes along with a js library like jquery

4091623
rar	zip
another answer is to encrypt the zip file or rar file

4091631
post	get
i want my app to be able to perform simple get and post requests to my server

4091639
google-chrome	firefox
you can also use a javascript profiler such as firebug in firefox the ie developer console in ie8 or higher developer tools in google-chrome etc

4091658
google-chrome	firefox
ie sends the whole path to the server on file upload while firefox google-chrome do not

4091679
getter	setter
each of the properties with the corresponding types a backing field a getter and a setter which invokes the failiffrozen method

4091687
cos	sin
tan x sin x cos x

4091690
put	get
if you can open a browser and put replace ip with your server s ip and assuming your server is answering on port 80 stock http port and get your server to respond then no you don t need a domain

4091751
disk	ram
we re testing a single instance of membase 1.6.0 on a large ec2 instance with 5gb ram 750gb disk linux fc8

4091751
disk	ram
i should also mention that this happens once the data is larger than ram and it s increasing size on the disk

4091778
public	protected
you can do this using the protected extensions for a protected function but it throws an exception if public

4091797
post	get
one solution is to change ape s default xhr method from post to get

4091806
telerik	radcombobox
1 rcbcomboboxinradpanel is a telerik radcombobox

4091812
google-chrome	firefox
i need an embeddable audio player that will play wav files in ie firefox and google-chrome

4091817
post	get
on the post back those controls never get recreated so no event fires

4091817
post	get
all that code should run for each and every request get and post

4091821
drive	createfile
these drive are not including as a physical drive and cannot be accessed using the devicestream class or createfile win32 api method as cited in the topic above

4091821
drive	createfile
the first cd-rom drive appears as device cdrom0 though attempting to open this via createfile will fail apparently per

4091826
int	chars
also it gives guarantees that say short is at least as big as chars int as big as short etc

4091864
int	chars
besides i suppose that because of some obfuscated necessity the second parameter has type int but is in fact a chars

4091874
range	minimum
the c standard do not explicitly say that long has to be at least 4 bytes but they do specify a minimum range for the different integral types which implies a minimum size

4091874
range	minimum
for example the minimum range of an unsigned long is 0 to 4 294 967 295

4091877
int	chars
so chars short int long long long

4091879
int	chars
the second parameter is of type int because in c chars constants like a are of type int

4091885
hash	md5
one thing that jumped out at me immediately was the md5 hash you provided.

4091885
hash	md5
in every case i ve tested my md5 hash end with two equals signs like the following captured from fiddler

4091921
width	height
but the images are still scaling that is unless i set them to a specific height width

4091940
put	get
however when i put it on the server i get a segmentation fault with the following traceback

4091954
pull	push
since case 2 can only make use of 4 threads and case 3 can make use of more it s not at all crazy to think that in the 4-thread case the clock speed wins but in the 8-thread case the increased memory contention 8 threads trying to pull in push out values tips the hand to the higher-bandwdith xeon

4091954
cos	exp	cos	sin	multiplying	add
if you want to try to see if finite memory bandwidth is playing a role here you can artificially add more computation to the problem eg multiplying exp sin a by cos b cos b or something to ensure the problem is compute-bound eliminating one variable as you try to get to the bottom of things

4091969
yacc	bison
lex yacc flex bison are the gnu versions - the old school industry standard

4092007
invokelater	invokeandwait
i think on the blackberry the right thing is invokelater or maybe invokeandwait depending on what you re trying to accomplish

4092007
invokelater	invokeandwait
if the timer thread is dedicated to this single purpose as it appears you can probably replace invokelater with invokeandwait if you like

4092014
ostream	istream
also it appears that the class declaration only needs a forward declaration of ostream and istream

4092024
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu debian .

4092062
int	chars
for example iirc on the ti c5x a long is 32 bits but sizeof long 2 because chars shorts and int are all 16 bits with sizeof chars 1

4092073
width	height
width 100 but it doesn t stretch to the height of the window see when i include height 100

4092140
phong	shading
this is the information i have for computing light intensity color phong shading

4092149
phong	shading
there s a good description of phong shading here

4092192
width	height
yup although youâ ll need an extra and this solution assumes the has a known fixed height and width

4092222
hash	md5
now for every link that goes from domain1.com to domain2.com you should add a _get variable that contains a randomly generated session id md5 hash will do

4092268
entity-relationship	diagram
design database entity-relationship diagram

4092277
udp	tcp
qt c++ framework has a very good network class that i ve used for tcp and udp server client type connections

4092290
range	minimum
secondly the c language standard guarantees minimum range for each integer type these guarantees are present in both c and c++

4092290
range	minimum
knowing the minimum range for the given type you can always say how many value-forming bits this type is required to have as minimum number of bits

4092349
maven	m2e
nexus and sonatype are pretty much locked on maven and m2e

4092349
hudson	bamboo	gradle	ivy
artifactory provides an awesome hudson teamcity and bamboo integration and gradle ivy support

4092349
nexus	artifactory	maven	m2e
so while nexus gives you nothing once you step out of sonatype comfort zone maven m2e artifactory embraces and collaborates with all major build tools

4092349
nexus	artifactory
as you see artifactory thinks outside the box while nexus thinks inside the box and only cares about maven and maven artifacts

4092349
nexus	artifactory
artifactory has a simple and straightforward rest api don t know how it works for nexus

4092349
nexus	artifactory
but while nexus stops there being strictly a maven repository manager artifactory goes on and on being a general binaries storage for binaries of any kind from any build tool and ci server

4092359
hide	show
if you use a webkit-transition to show hide the element attaching the following event to the element appears to fix the select inside of it

4092380
put	get
to put the target of the externals above the directory where the externals is defined on you get

4092381
uu-parsinglib	parsec
recently i recast a dsl parser in uu-parsinglib which had been written in parsec

4092408
width	height
this element will grow as needed anchored to the bottom right of the page so long as you remove the height and width properties

4092418
ivar	subclassing
i have an object ivar foo inside a nsmanagedobject subclassing bar that i need to be there at all times as long as the object exists

4092443
lisp	scheme
i cannot say as i use different scheme to protect my work when writing lisp for others vlx fas bricscad s encryptor my own loader obfuscators ...

4092496
put	get
everytime i press the back button i get the last string object that i put to my stack and set the jtextarea to this string object

4092511
interpreted-language	compiled-language
another is the namespacing - you can have a code to compress the lot into a single include file more meaningful in interpreted-language like php than in compiled-language

4092526
google-chrome	firefox
also you can run using the google-chrome backend which is firefox with lower security barriers

4092528
min	max
i also know i can chain max and min together

4092558
maven	pom.xml
i would like to update my maven pom.xml with the latest hibernate hibernate-annotations and ehcache dependencies

4092565
min	max
if you wanted to you could even make the min max a list so it looks more mathematically pure

4092571
min	max
chaining max and min together is the normal idiom i ve seen

4092586
width	height
with images that resized to the div by absolute and the li which class .image_block which has width height and float at 100px so something like this

4092586
width	height
so what i want to acheive is as soon as i drag a picture from one of the random width height it adds .image_block

4092589
nsscanner	nsnumberformatter
i was originally using nsscanner because it was easier than nsnumberformatter to use but i ran into the same problem it doesn t parse the entire string just the first number in the string

4092619
children	parent
so the session that retrieves a parent may not be the same as the one asked to retrieve children

4092624
width	height
i was wondering if there was an inexpensive way to get the width and height of a jpeg after loading an array of bytes

4092624
width	height
i know jpegbitmapdecoder can get the jpeg s pixel width and height but it loads alot of information as well which i assume would be an expensive operation

4092767
nsstring	nsdata
the data from the json string nsdata to nsstring is

4092771
post	get
another alternative may be to place the data as a hidden attribute in a form which uses the post method to get around the 1024 char limit and simulating a submission of the form in javascript to accomplish the redirect including the data

4092791
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have a subclass of uiviewcontroller called helpviewcontroller that is created the same way as several other similar classes i have for adding to a uitabbarcontroller

4092793
mouse	keyboard
ideally i d like to be able to instrument a ui and then capture mouse and keyboard navigation gestures to display via a heat-map

4092795
gson	jackson
which covers all kinds of serialization including json using jackson gson protostuff

4092804
superclass	subclassing
all of the subclassing in question are required in order to create cmmotionmanager and cllocationmanager subclassing capable of acting like the superclass only loading their data from a csv file

4092824
gif	bmp
edit the new file you uploaded is a bmp file with gif extension.

4092841
hide	show
yes services and hide show are supplied by the system

4092877
width	height
okay well i figured out to do it knew it was simple just had to change the width and height of the ui.helper object with so heres how i done it

4092918
multiplication	modulo
modulo operations are expensive as are multiplication to a lesser extent

4092918
multiplication	modulo
the number of multiplication and modulo can be decreased by approximately a factor c 100 by switching the color-loop with the position-loop

4092918
multiplication	modulo

listview	gridview
in a listview i have a gridview where the row background is colored depending on a property of the item in the data context of the row

4097480
getter	setter
closure object is functionally equivalent to the following normal perl object but with faster method calls since there are no hash lookups or other dereferences around 40-50 faster for short getter setter type methods

4097480
getter	setter
which is around 70 faster than pre-caching a method from a normal object for short getter setter methods

4097482
firefox	safari
this happens only in ie7 - ie6 safari and firefox all behave as expected

4097493
width	height
if you want to display the entire image these should be the width and height of the image

4097541
int	double
keywords are fixed strings generally used for basic language keywords int double ... and also in your case for the fixme and todo

4097557
versioning	upgrade
so if i have an aggregator project that lists 300 projects all that use apache commons-io and i want to upgrade them all the the latest versioning of commons-io i can just change the versioning in the dependencymanagement section of the root pom

4097595
int	double
this could cause some problems with high-valued int since the log2 function is casting to double and some numerical issues may arise

4097686
ssl	https
https ssl support

4097694
division	multiplication
i m doing multiplication and division of float s and int s and i forget the implicit conversion rules and the words in the question seem too vague to google more quickly than asking here

4097694
multiplying	multiplication
how about for multiplication â if i multiplying a float and an int is the answer a float

4097701
width	height
first of all the name of your function is misleading because what it does is not letterbox images regardless of the specific height width aspect ratio involved -- so here it s been renamed aspectcrop to better describe what it does

4097708
powermanager	batterymanager
i have read powermanager and batterymanager classes but they are of no use

4097754
uidatepicker	uipickerview
try using a uipickerview with different components and prepare a custom uidatepicker if you want

4097817
pkcs#12	pfx
then try to decrypt using that pfx pkcs#12 file instead

4097865
jdom	dom4j
it s important to note that my example code is for jdom not dom4j as the person was asking

4097888
getter	setter
barring that it appears i should be able to workaround the problem using explicit getter setter but that is not very groovy

4097966
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it s true that under modern at least versions of firefox google-chrome opera and safari an anchor tag with an empty href href not a missing href will display as a normal link that simply doesn t respond when clicked unlike the hash-href which jumps to the top of the page

4097987
hide	show
first show the uiactivityindicatorview then spawn a new thread that loads the images then on the last line of the method that is executed in the new thread hide the uiactivityindicatorview

4098049
uitableview	nsindexpath
- void tableview uitableview tableview didselectrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

4098081
post	get
and everything works great but requesting get post variables from other sites signup forms

4098210
ienumerable	icollection
internally though linq checks if your ienumerable implements icollection and if it does it uses the count property

4098230
for-loop	loops
if statments if-else statements for-loop while loops etc are considered as one line

4098304
nscountedset	nsmutableset
nsset nsmutableset and nscountedset

4098324
button	checkbox
i m making use of red carrot s checkbox tree plugin but trying to adapt it to use with a nested list of radio button

4098324
children	parent
but any children of the deselected parent remain selected and the list does not collapse

4098400
children	parent
i implemented a navigation system which switched between different view controllers with one parent handling the children

4098463
post	get
i noticed a few post on so regarding mysql updates using python and still cannot seem to get this correct

4098509
ubuntu	linux
edit this is for a linux system ubuntu

4098515
hash	md5
3 get a short hash crc32 maybe md5 experiment with this as well for each block

4098528
gtk	gio
to use gio with the gtk file chooser

4098531
vmware	esx
simply running an installer should function the same under vmware as on the real pc especially if you are using vmware esx

4098537
profiling	instrumentation
your best bet is to learn a bit more about instrumentation and memory profiling so you can determine for yourself what the problem is

4098544
ant	maven
i d like to introduce maven to my fellow coworkers who mostly use ant to build their projects

4098556
subtraction	addition	division	addition	division	subtraction
that said it is possible to do a correctly rounded double precision division using only conversions between double and single double precision subtraction addition and single precision operations but it s pretty complicated if you really want to do it right

4098607
width	height
if you re setting its width and height with wrap_content it shouldn t matter but it s worth a try

4098618
int	boolean
but i want to do a search with 3 more parameters paramvaluationid int paramvalue boolean paramtitle string

4098658
getter	setter
but i guess that implies that there must be a getter for the property not only a setter

4098671
jms	jta
i m trying to use ehcache s transactional abilities together with atomikos and apache tomcat for usage with jms and hibernate but that s just to assure the sceptics i really need jta

4098671
put	get
i m currently working on a small poc where i m trying to put an instance of myvalue which implements serializable and when i try to commit the transaction i get the __ with classnotfoundexception as the root the stack trace is at the end

4098671
put	get
when i jar the myvalue file and put it under tomcat_home lib i get no exception

4098671
classcastexception	classnotfoundexception
if you don t do that you will get a noclassdeffounderrors or a classnotfoundexception or even a classcastexception during your web application deployment

4098672
scatter	graphing
i m trying to plot 2 scatter plot graphing on one report using ssrs2008

4098684
tiff	png	gif	png
the safari web content guide mentions that the maximum size for gif png and tiff images is 3 megapixels 3 1024 1024

4098753
getter	setter
if i take out the getter and setter methods then it doesn t work it tells me i need to create some getter and setter methods or use synthesize - but putting synthesize in the implementation throws an error too

4098753
getter	setter
but with the getter and setter methods i get an exc_bad_access and a crash

4098768
width	height
width and height are semantic in the case of img es and object s

4098779
punctuation	words
for example a person that types 60 wpm where words are an average of five chars is typing 360 characters per minute which includes spaces between words but excludes punctuation

4098809
width	height
you need to make sure the component uses the same width height padding and gutter settings

4098818
short	base	unsigned	short
as an alternative hack you might be able to get most of what you want using a base pointer and unsigned short offsets

4098847
width	height
you should set width and height properties of each img tag

4098875
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
according to the article google-chrome 4+ safari 5+ and opera 9.6+ all support the properties

4098886
getter	setter
this in combination with the getter and setter ensures that this invariant will hold true

4099060
jar	war
i have a multi module project consisting of several jar modules and a war module

4099062
getter	setter
obviously with obj-c there s usually no reason to write getter and setter thanks to useful mr synthesize

4099099
getter	setter
property syntax within the setter getter because that invokes the setter getter again instead of directly assigning to the variable

4099116
int	double
of course it would work for basic types like int and double but imagine a type with several different members

4099182
width	height
i think the simplest solution is to set the size of your usercontrol to some constant value where height width and then drop the whole thing in a viewbox which will handle the scaling whilst maintaining aspect ratio for you

4099185
innodb	myisam
i ve been reading up whether to use myisam or innodb for a log table lots of writes very few reads

4099187
textview	imageview
in a layout xml put a linearlayout oriented vertically containing first an imageview widget then a textview widget

4099199
for-loop	loops
a fortran do loops is the same as a matlab for-loop

4099221
google-chrome	safari
visit this url using safari or google-chrome browser

4099221
width	height
set the width of the browserâ s window to make sure the height of the green box is greater than the height of the red box

4099221
opera	firefox
the red box never disappears in other browsers ie firefox and opera

4099230
innodb	myisam
my guess is that for a log you would probably be doing only a few queries so myisam may be the best choice for you but if the log is being frequently displayed and filtered in your application then you should use innodb

4099244
folder	directory
usually i build publish the site to a folder on my dev machine ftp into the live server then drag-and-drop the new published files and folder to the live site while making sure not to overwrite any user-generated directory

4099250
uiview	subviews
for uiview subviews in view subviews

4099280
put	get
the instant you put a delete call into your code an exception can be thrown which would cause the delete to get skipped leaking memory

4099380
zlib	libpng
you may want to check here for some uses for libpng which will need zlib

4099415
children	parent
there are any number of circumstances in which for instance the availability of commands in the parent view depend on the state of its children

4099435
persistent	transient
fredley s answer about sqlite or storage may be overkill if that data doesn t need to persistent beyond this one session in the activity or if the data you re working with is also transient network data that changes often that s temporarily loaded into an arrayadapter and in any case it s a bit misleading because just dumping data to disk doesn t solve the fundamental issue with your conflation of views of data with your models

4099438
keydown	keyup
use keypress instead of keyup keydown because the latter two do not accurately protray the keycode reference see last paragraph

4099443
accelerometer	gyroscope
looking at the magnitude of each of accelerometer gyroscope and magnetometer data using norm and plotting these over time

4099452
hide	show
if the textbox is already visible the code should hide it and create a new usercontrol in its place that show the text see below for details of that usercontrol

4099472
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
edit this works in every browser i ve tried including opera safari google-chrome firefox ie6 7 8 9

4099480
folder	directory
the easiest way is to have a directory that s outside of your code folder where you store the user data

4099528
hash	salt
but more important than strength of the salt is the way you hash it

4099564
google-chrome	firefox
the code below works fine on firefox and google-chrome not with ie

4099566
versioning	upgrade
note that this approach also would allow you to create more advanced scenarios like prompting the user to upgrade to a different versioning of the app pro for example or that they need to upgrade their silverlight to get the latest

4099608
viewdidload	viewwillappear
this all works fine but the caveat is that the size of the scroll view and any other view for that matter is adjusted to the orientation of the device not in the viewdidload method but in the viewwillappear method

4099610
google-chrome	firefox
when i m working on this via everything works perfectly ie 8 firefox google-chrome - it all works

4099610
google-chrome	firefox
again - works perfect on firefox google-chrome when called by anything - just not ie 8

4099619
post	get
my php script parse the user information from my mysql data base and shows it when a get or post action is made

4099664
stringstream	ifstream
the ifstream will use a buffer however so while that s probably faster than reading into a string then creating a stringstream it may not be any faster than working directly from the input stream

4099673
width	height
this sets the default width height and background for all buttons

4099673
width	height
note that when you drag an image onto the design surface in visual studio 2010 it sets the width and height for you

4099673
width	height
you need to remove the width and height from the button elements themselves to enable the style to control those properties

4099751
hide	show
i assume this is to do with a gallery not having scrollbars to show hide

4099814
width	height
so when i create say a rectangle in wpf with width and height both set to 96 the size of the rectangle actually depends on which screen it appears on

4099834
innodb	myisam
also myisam has table-level locking while innodb uses row-level locking which won t make much different for a high-read low-write table

4099916
viewdidload	viewdidappear
viewdidload or viewdidappear

4099929
google-chrome	firefox
this would need to work in ie6+ firefox and google-chrome

4099993
width	height
setpixels int pixels int offset int stride int x int y int width int height

4100007
google-chrome	firefox
there is the file api but whilst it works in newer firefox and google-chrome versions it s not going to happen in ie no sign of it in ie9 betas yet either

4100028
crossover	mutation
a genetic algorithm maintains a population of possible solutions and at each step selects pairs of possible solution combines them crossover and applies some random changes mutation

4100040
fileoutputstream	objectoutputstream
just serialize your arraylist out to a file using an objectoutputstream wrapped around a fileoutputstream

4100049
post	get
202 would be appropriate for a post that returned but isn t finished but not really a get request

4100062
gridview	rowdatabound
both get popualted in the rowdatabound method of the gridview

4100080
folder	directory
i added an external data source to my c# app i ve placed it on the root directory in a folder named data but when i run the program i get an error at con.open

4100106
qlabel	qtextbrowser
hi i have a problem in my program i have several qlabel and qtextbrowser at times i want each of them to display something but i want to do this through another function called newmessage

4100106
qlabel	qtextbrowser
so newmessage will receive message from qlabel or qtextbrowser and process them then display it

4100150
hash	md5
rob thank you for offering to help and pointing out the difference in the md5 hash

4100150
hash	md5
1 the md5 hash i noticed the hash you pasted in your answer is shorter than the one i was getting but it took me a while to see yours was exactly twice shorter

4100171
gridview	sqldatasource
i have a gridview that displays the contents of a database table using an sqldatasource

4100203
hide	show
once it looks ok checking multiple browsers etc then you can just show hide the div and you won t need to worry about custom positioning it with jquery

4100221
sorting	filtering
you ll probably need to use a standard jtable rather than a swing.table but it can handle all of the sorting and filtering you will ever have to do

4100278
int	boolean
precendence of boolean ops is rather easy if you map it to their corresponding int ops

4100285
post	get
if your post or cookie also set tour_date to an empty string then the request values get overwritten

4100295
subtraction	addition
random-access iterators support addition and subtraction and std vector iterators are random-access

4100311
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i never was able to get either tableview scrolltorowatindexpath atscrollposition animated or scrollrecttovisible animated to accomplish this either from the viewcontroller viewwillappear or viewdidload methods

4100311
viewdidload	viewwillappear
note that the workaround method previously only worked when called from viewwillappear and not from viewdidload

4100350
put	get
when i search for mysql and comments i get only ways to put comments in tables etc

4100367
folder	directory
ideally i d like to move the initial folder to the documents directory copying the folder would mean wasting 20mb of the users disk space

4100373
lisp	scheme
edwin is a variant of emacs which uses scheme instead of emacs lisp

4100373
scheme	racket
you could try plt scheme racket which would let you run scheme code you might have better luck in windows

4100382
width	height
images will tend to look fuzzy if you either place them at non-integer coordinates or set the width height to a non-integer value

4100385
mouseleave	mouseenter
i ve run into a similar problem before and it s caused by the mouse raising a new mouseenter mouseleave event before jquery could process the previous show command

4100385
hide	show
the easiest way to fix the problem is to add a generic command to cause all of your color images to show before running your filter to show hide the color and b w image you re working with

4100385
mouseleave	mouseenter	hide	show
when the mouseenter or mouseleave events fire the script will first show all of the color images and hide all of the b w images

4100385
hide	show
then if it was a mouseenter the script will hide the color image and show the b w image

4100423
fadein	fadeout
then use the jquery fadein and fadeout methods to change the opacity of element b on hover

4100495
google-chrome	firefox
this is how all other browsers i used would return innerhtml ie6 7 8 firefox 3.x google-chrome etc. and when i checked the length it would return 17 in all these other browsers

4100505
mp3	m3u
i tried to write a small script to automate the creation of playlists m3u for dozens of folders subfolders of mp3 mp4 files while omitting various other misc files therein

4100546
cassini	iis
cassini runs as your account whoever is logged on iis runs as a service which means some things change quite a bit

4100546
cassini	iis
what i would recommend for anyone wanting something as simple as cassini yet more compatible is to use iis express which supports almost all features from iis yet with a much simplified model suited for development

4100597
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu linux and apps seem to be more stable than windows

4100599
cassini	iis
i used to debug like you host the website in iis an then attach the debugger but i ve found using cassini far more productive because of the edit and continue feature which is an absolute godsend

4100661
children	parent
i can get a pointer to the parent node and everything works but trying to get a pointer to a node that has no children just returns the value of that node

4100694
width	height
this means use 100 of the parent s height but 25 of the parent s width

4100703
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i am developing a facebook canvas application using the iframe method because of existing infrastructure the session data is set in a cookie between each page request including jquery json requests this all works fine in safari firefox google-chrome and ie with the p3p header being set but not in mobilesafari on the ipad ios 4.2

4100705
hide	show
you can hide the tool windows by unselecting show tool window bars

4100708
prepare	execute
what i recommend is to prepare standalone script readable only by specified user and execute it from rails with system command with db name as parammeter

4100747
128bit	64bit
for example if the largest integer type of your platform is a 64bit type then at assembly level on your machine you have access to mul operation producing the correct 128bit result

4100749
width	height
if there is no special reason for having the relativelayout s width and height to wrap to it s content i d say specify it like that

4100782
postgresql	mysql
i m not sure if this is for mysql or postgresql but i think that this query may help

4100782
postgresql	mysql
it works at postgresql from version 8.4 not sure about mysql

4100827
folder	directory
i can t have php create the files folder itself because it doesn t have access to write to the root directory either

4100887
chgrp	chmod
you could chgrp the files to the web server s group or php s if it s set up to run as its own user and chmod 770 them

4100899
folder	directory
have the users chmod 777 the root directory have your script create the new folder and then have them restore the root directory s permissions

4100918
printf	atoi
you need to and to get atoi and printf as the compiler complained about both being missing

4100924
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
everything is working well but the text is showing as white in firefox but light blue in webkit safari google-chrome

4100934
ant	maven
easy ant maven targets goals to manage the generation of said server side keys and so on

4100959
concave	convex
notice that depending on the position of the control points the orange and blue arcs may each be either concave or convex

4100979
converter	multibinding
another alternative is to use multibinding with a converter

4100995
stopwatch	timertask
i am trying to create a stopwatch in c++ something similar to java s timertask

4101017
treemap	treeset
you might be able to do this by doing some fancy stuff with subclassing the treemap and wrapping the treeset s that are added to it but it would be quite challenging to make it all work properly i think

4101020
versioning	upgrade
the problem i have is that the upgrade path from 1.0 to 1.0.3 is not working but only if i add 1.0.2 to the previous versioning list

4101020
versioning	upgrade
if i remove 1.0.2 from the previous versioning the 1.0-- 1.0.3 upgrade path works perfectly

4101040
entity-relationship	diagram
i have the following entity-relationship diagram below that outlines my table structure

4101059
cairngorm	flex
so you don t compile the project by running cairngorm you use cairngorm in conjunction with the other code and compile all of it using something like either flash builder flex builder or the open source compiler that adobe produces

4101063
google-chrome	firefox
for me the text is white in both firefox and google-chrome so i m pretty sure there is some issue with another part of the css the pseudo selectors on the link element

4101067
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested in google-chrome and firefox on linux and windows and the results are always the same

4101071
subtract	add
i need to add or subtract different values from a given date

4101156
sorting	filtering
depending on how your sorting works then this plugin might be an alternative as it allows filtering a table by column

4101170
calloc	malloc
assuming you want to initialize your bit-field to zero calloc might be preferable to malloc

4101184
crossover	mutation
the other two ways that new members of the population are usually referred to as mutation and crossover

4101230
cassini	iis
vs2010 supports iis mode pretty well plus you get the advantage of being able to test web.config properly since cassini doesn t support system.webserver portion

4101231
onchange	onkeyup
there is no onchange event but there is an onkeyup event

4101240
temp	tmp
tmp refers to a variable of type table stored in memory whereas #tmp refers to a table in the temp database

4101280
keydown	keyup
you could listen for keydown keypress or keyup events but remember to add a timeout to make sure that their last keypress has been taken into consideration as their last press may have been the backspace key

4101319
ubuntu	linux
for example compiling a program on 32-bit linux wont run on 64 bit windows but if you compile a program on ubuntu and then put it on another ubuntu machine it should run fine

4101352
ilist	iqueryable
you re also returning an iqueryable when your method clearly says it gives back an ilist

4101352
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	iqueryable	ilist	iqueryable
whether you really need an ilist or if you can get away with a concrete list which is also ienumerable and iqueryable and thus allows for easier further manipulation is a topic for another discussion but understand that ilists as ilists cannot be iterated

4101407
min	max
those methods seem to match the operators you can use with collections sum min max distinctunionofobjects etc

4101433
lisp	scheme
the one that comes to my mind is scheme lisp

4101468
ssl	https
if you re using https ssl and please do for anything that needs to be secure then yes an ajax request is no more or less safe than a full postback to the server

4101501
oncreate	onstart
onrestoreinstancestate is called after onstart whereas oncreate is called before onstart

4101522
keydown	keyup
we then create another array that stores all the keys that are being pressed keydown add the item keyup removes it

4101575
queue	fifo
in windows it s fifo queue at each priority level and a thread

4101595
subtract	add
if the sortid values are always continuous you don t remove records which would cause a gap then you can just add or subtract one to get the next or previous record

4101642
voip	sip
voipcore is just an old version of abto voip sip sdk from voipsipsdk.com so that may be a better choice

4101667
width	height
you re missing a field in your file there should be a 255 for the maximum pixel value after the width and height

4101691
rss	feed
bbc basic rss feed reader

4101714
128bit	64bit	16-bit	64bit
so i would prefer choice b since it scales with whatever system you re running 16-bit 32-bit 64bit maybe even in the future 128bit but that kind of effort may not be necessary for you

4101742
post	get
this request has both get and post values

4101742
post	get
the script on the other end of this is php and expects certain values to be in the get and others to be in the post

4101765
filtering	grouping
here s an example where i m trying filtering out a grouping

4101773
post	get
for example if you wanted to send a get request with username fred to www.example.com index.php you would send a simple get request to so to answer your question just use the post method but have the url contain your get data

4101867
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
this works perfectly with firefox opera and ie but safari doesn t seem to see the hashtag for the anchor in the link

4101876
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately i run linux so i can t test ie but it works in google-chrome and firefox

4101879
many-to-many	many-to-one
it concerns many-to-many and many-to-one relationships between entities

4101905
hide	show
you can make an xml layout with all of your items present and then write a list adapter where you can hide and show items as needed

4101925
nunit	mstest
see migrating from nunit to mstest

4101925
nunit	mstest
mstest nunit wins for unit testing

4101942
expression-blend	silverlight
in order to create and use behaviors you need to download and install the expression-blend sdk for silverlight 4 and add a reference to system.windows.interactivity.dll

children	parent	maven	pom.xml
as far as the philosophy goes the assembly plugin is there to help you build custom artifacts and in maven each project should produce one main artifact not counting sources classifiers etc. so if multiple children need to use the assembly plugin you would only put what is common to all of them in the parent pom.xml

post	get
post can be substitued with get if necessary or even cookie or request although you probably want to be more sure what you are getting

4102517
internationalization	localization
the long answer is to read apple s internationalization documentation understand how resource look-up interacts with localization directories within the bundle structure get familiar with nslocalizedstring and its relatives and play around with some .strings files and changing your system language around in order to get a feel for how what you re doing will affect the end-user

4102517
internationalization	localization
when it comes to localizing information contained in xibs you should read wil shipley s article lost in translations. you might also want to look at how open source cocoa projects such as growl and adium handle internationalization and localization

4102773
ati	nvidia
i was just set to purchase a nvidia gtx 470 when i saw some statistics regarding ati which i didn t know

4102810
userid	usergroups
it s also worth noting that you may not need all the relationships you would define in sql - for example if you have a group containing a million users the ability to get a list of all users in a group is completely useless so you would never create the groupsuser list at all and rather than a seperate usergroups list have userid groups as a multivalue property

4102810
userid	usergroups
if you just need to check for membership you could set up keys as usergroups userid groupid and get constant time lookup

you cannot expect to get the same format html out of the dom serialised from that as you put in

4102851

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
behaviour observed in osx google-chrome firefox safari

4102916
try-catch	exception-handling
but i would consider this one to be a not too good practice to employ it of course using those provided by api like the int32 one to avoid try-catch is exception-handling

4102923
udp	tcp
first i would check that you can access ports tcp 1433 and udp 1434 on that server you need also the udp port since you are using the sqlexpress instance in the server

one option is to install testdriven.net which makes it easier to run unit tests on any of the major unit testing .net frameworks nunit xunit.net vs tools etc

4103872
division	multiplication
because one actually wants all the digits of the result unlike rsa where one is only interested in the residue mod a number that s much smaller than the numbers we have here i think the best approach is probably to extract nine decimal digits at once using long division implemented using multiplication

4104704
width	height
the height and width attributes are considered to be no longer valid in most cases

4104708
width	height
in this case it is definitely the right way there really is no wrong way to specify the width and height on the image tag itself

4104708
width	height
author requirements the width and height attributes on img iframe embed object video and when their type attribute is in the image button state input elements may be specified to give the dimensions of the visual content of the element

4104804
put	get
i m not going to get into a long discussion on the security aspects of this but suffice it to say that setting this up could will expose your internal computers to the big bad world so do a proper risk analysis and get management approval before you put it live

4104809
google-chrome	firefox
if this is available from google-chrome and firefox as well it might be worth investigating whether autohotkey can access the clipboard on a more detailed level to fetch the right format with the annotation in it

4105675
put	get
then i want to find out of what kind of track i should put together to get from point a to point b with a given distance and a margin

4105737
implements	extends
in general and to keep these two functions apart you do not want to extends thread you only want to implements runnable or callable

4105737
implements	extends
it is possible to extends thread and directly implements run rather than letting it delegate to the runnable but that is sort of old school

4105762
inherited	properties
only if i create a new class without inherited and define there string name properties and properties i get the right result

4105767

to get a min max that evaluates to the type as per the c integer promotion rules it would be necessary to know how the types relate and what the resultant type would be for every combination of left and right input types

4106349
min	max
i wish to perform a min max with the same behaviour as the c sample under gcc given above and with the same promotion thereby ensuring the same behaviour as in gcc

4106349
min	max	range	max	range	min
note that immediately after performing this natural min max i ll be numeric_cast ing to the expected size range

the main purpose would be to replace getter and setter of some properties

4107248
x86	64bit
my solution is to simply compile a x64 php build with the free visual c++ studio download but before i dive into that i d like to know if my assumption is correct - a windows x64 php build will correctly handle 64bit int values and correctly convert the windows ticks into a 64bit unix timestamp for its native date time functions as it does for a x86 build.

4107276
post	get
looks like this may be something with firebug as when i modify the dest .ashx page to just spit back the filenames that it received from the post request i get both files

4107332
maven	pom.xml
so for example you would set up a test prfile in your maven pom.xml and when you build with that profile the xml file in your jar will have the desired property in it

firefox	safari
the image is properly animated in safari but on firefox it is not

4107635
post	get
your php page made a post request behind the scenes to get the data but it then served it back to your browser

4107635

what s even worse is that getopenfilename pop-up an open dialog that looks like the one in windows 95 at least when you try to customize the dialog with the lpofnhookproc feature on vista or windows 7

4108299
punctuation	words
in this case you would want your expression to allow non-english characters since you don t want to split a words but you might be able to remove all punctuation marks that aren t inside of a quote-delimited phrase

4108465
inherited	subclassing
abstract classes from which subclassing can inherited code and behavior but not table structure

4108465
inherited	subclassing
you could implement a #path attribute on content using attr_accessor and it would be inherited by subclassing but it would not be persisted to the database unless the table for your model subclassing had a path column

4108465
inherited	subclassing
single table inherited where subclassing inherited both behavior and table persistence

4108521

4108604
comparator	comparable
what are the keys differences between comparable and comparator

4108684
getter	setter
i can t see any other reason it would throw nullreferenceexception - although it would really help you could clarify whether you were calling the getter or the setter at the time it threw the exception

4108688
pull	push
as some answers already pointed out branches named or anonymous are usually more convenient than two clones because you don t have to pull push

4108696
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome and safari the behavior works as expected the div overlays all the html elements below it

4108764
comparator	comparable
when your class implements comparable the comparator method of the class is defining the natural ordering of that object

4108764
comparator	comparable
in general implement comparable for natural order natural order definition is obviously open to interpretation and write a comparator for other sorting or comparison needs

4108816
postgresql	mysql
supports postgresql mysql

4108844
yslow	pagespeed
pagespeed extension and yslow extension are both very helpful to understand what should be optimized

4108906
min	max
the isindeterminate property just means that the progressbar doesn t have a min or max value but continually scrolls

4108948
getter	setter
i have setter getter on one of my class properties i noticed that i must add set in front of the setter name else the compiler says that there is no setter

4108949
min	max
using the min and max of the sample you can then create another array to count how many sampled elements are in each bins a reasonable rule of thumb is that you should have sqrt n bins if you have n samples

4108970
int	double
i want to create a very generic utility method to take any collection and convert it into a collection of a user selectable class that extends from number long double float int etc.

4108976

post	get
i ve been using these two post to try and get the encryption of the key right but i m still having trouble

4109037
accessor	properties
according to the rules defined around attribute targets there doesn t appear to be any reason that the obsolete attribute would not be valid on a properties get or set accessor

4109037
accessor	properties
in order to apply an attribute to a properties set accessor that attribute must be applicable to either a method parameter or return value target

4109037
accessor	properties
in fact you can define your own attribute with the same valid targets as the obsolete attribute with the attributeusage attribute and you ll find that you can apply it to a properties get or set accessor whereas you cannot apply the obsolete attribute

4109037
accessor	properties
if you try creating your own attribute that is not valid on a properties set accessor and you apply it there then you may notice the error message is slightly different

4109074
put	get	post	get	post	put
i see it s possible to implement index get post put delete for the api then implement new and edit actions for the web in the same controller

4109079
hash	md5
md5 is designed to uniformaly spread the input over all the output bytes so it s as good as any other general hash function - sounds like a bit of overkill if you only want 256 values

4109102
hash	md5
i m not certain specifically how expensive md5 is relative to others but there are plenty of better ways to create a small hash see this article for some algorithm ideas

4109107
int	double
read the int and double directly from it using

4109130
post	get
if the number of fields on the view is dynamic and you get an x number of employees back then you would have to iterate through the post collection to bind them to your viewmodel

4109136
pull	push
when i do git pull it automatically fetches and merges changes from test to myname_test but for git push i need to specify the repo and branch name

4109184
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
about the only thing i would definitely say to do is to make sure to use try catch finally try finally or wrap sqlconnection sqlcommand and sqldatareader within using s

4109284
gridview	formview
i have a gridview object and a formview object

4109284
gridview	formview
when the gridview is clicked the formview is populated

4109304
google-chrome	firefox
use firefox with the firebug extension or google-chrome to debug dynamic pages using the right-click inspect element feature

4109305
profiling	instrumentation
you then instrumentation and overwrite your app using build in the profiling - also fine

4109309
width	height
i often find that i need to find the width or height of a part of a non-client area sizeable tool window border width for instance and i have never come across a complete diagram of what part is what

4109340
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and ie are aligned while firefox will have a 2 pixel variance between .buttonl and .buttonr

4109348
division	multiplication
mod is a division operation not a multiplication operation

4109348
division	multiplication
division is more expensive than multiplication

4109368
division	multiplication
yes mod is more expensive than multiplication as it is implemented through division

4109390
google-chrome	firefox
this code works perfectly in ie7 ie8 firefox and google-chrome

4109423
inherited	subclassing
2 the major reason why people use protected inherited is that the expected subclassing is not a subclassing of the base for example car is not a subclassing of engine

4109424
cdr	cons
so now to explain the behaviour you see in the lisp family of languages cons a b creates a pair containing a as it s car and b as its cdr

4109449
implements	extends
then you would use a partial file class to extends the category class to implements the comparison logic

4109454
width	height
when i call it on an img element that has a specific width and height that is not the actual width and height of the source image . the rotation is applied accurately however it resets the width and height to match the source image

4109473
public	protected
- the major reason people want this is to hide public protected members of base from clients of subclass

4109473
inherited	subclassing
contrast this with private inherited which hides base completely from subclassing and clients of subclassing - this would also meet your criteria in the last sentence of 2 but disallow any other external use of base via subclassing

4109483
google-chrome	firefox
as i stated i want to use firefox or google-chrome and i m on linux

4109505
width	height
the png specification doesn t appear to place any limits on the width and height of an image

4109559
versioning	upgrade
it s for any type of settings but it s better to put local settings in a separate file so that versioning upgrade don t clobber them

4109606
getter	setter
i have debbuged and see that the getter and the setter of the atribute are accesed twice why i dont know

4109616
division	multiplication
algorithms processors execute the division and the multiplication by algorithms implemented in gates for division are more costly than for multiplication

4109616
division	multiplication
as a matter of fact some algorithms for division which have a good complexity are using the multiplication as a basic step

4109625
width	height
now i can understand why this is happening the lines actually go one unit beyond the width and height of the grid causing the grid to expand by one unit then there s a relayout the data binding causes the lines to redraw ad infinitum

4109625
put	get	width	height
so to try and deal with this i decided to put a in the grid but then no matter what i do with horizontalalignment and verticalalignment i end up with both the canvas and the grid having zero width and height which means i don t get my cross which is massively irritating

4109625
actualheight	actualwidth
if i bind to the actualwidth and actualheight properties of the button i just end up with an x that has the top-left corner centred on the centre of the button

4109667
allegro	sdl
it will work with both allegro and sdl

4109667

you could try looking into the documentation of the various web servers apache iis lighttpd nginx.

4109743
hgrc	hgignore
you can use a different file name for hgignore or more accurately have no hgignore and then use an line in your hg hgrc file to reference an additional ignore file with whatever name you want

4109764
post	get
for http this is usually a get or post request which is responded to by the server appropriately

4109767

you need to get the size of your object first and then set the width and height that you wish to use with something like this at the beginning of the plugin

4109782
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
the innertext property does not work on firefox that property is ie-specific although iirc is supported by opera google-chrome

4109853
int	double
note that tselapsed.totalseconds is a double not an int

4109864
agile	sprint
if i had 36 months of development time to spend i would spend 3-6 months writing a wrapper api and then replace each unit tested i o pair with new code every 7-10 days utilizing sprint scrum agile

4109895
udp	tcp
when people refer to socket communication these days they re typically using tcp or udp

4109895
udp	tcp
if you d like to learn more of the fine details on socket communication i would start with udp because it s a simpler protocol and then move on to tcp

4109965
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
after all you used an autoresetevent not a manualresetevent

4109994
rss	feed
i browsed through my rss feed and grabbed out this selection

4110216
many-to-one	one-to-many
if you need some sort of constraint many-to-one one-to-many then change your index types to unique etc

4110217
int	double
here the original class contains an int and double

4110292
allocator	stl
however after reading a bit i found this little bomb about the stl c++ standard see references saying that all allocator instances of a given type should be equivalent that is that should return true for any two instances and most terminal

4110306
xslt	xquery
-- update i understand now that difference between xquery and xslt is a difference in point of view since two different working groups are maintaining them both will do the job though in different approaches

4110317
rss	feed
the reason for the structure of these classes is that i am building a rss reader and i intend to have these two classes hold data on the feed

4110329

4110329
spaces	delimiter
the decimal number are the sales of that product in millions of dollars delimiter by a white spaces

4110400

4110428
client-side	server-side
i suggest you to generate your client-side control on the server-side under such conditions

4110443
freebsd	linux
the answer is epoll if you re using linux kqueue if you re using freebsd or mac os x and i o completion ports if you re on windows

4110443
udp	tcp
additionally it is important to note that udp does not have connections as opposed to tcp

4110449
folder	directory
an easy way to pack up your lib jars into your project so that subversion just handles it so you can grab it out with all the attached libraries ready to compile and go is to include them all under your project directory via the shared libraries option by managing the libraries folder

4110463
qlist	qvector
just a brief qlist intro qlist is similar to qvector and stl vector but in addition it also reserves some space at the beginning

4110463
boost	stl
i am looking for something similar in stl if not atleast boost

4110487
folder	directory
every time i rebuild my project which is huge i have to drill down into the windows ms.net framework v4 temp root random directory...wherein i must open up each of the 50-some randomly named directory in there that hold the built dll s and i must copy the pdb files from my project s bin debug directory to each respective dll folder

4110531
apache	nginx
this may have been corrected recently but all my research says that nginx and apache can t host websockets at the moment

4110536
mvp	presenter
it s my belief that the presenter is the one responsible for handling the navigation aspect of a mvp application

4110601
.htaccess	httpd.conf
on apache you can do this in an httpd.conf section or .htaccess using mod_headers and this syntax

when the user taps the done button on the keyboard call -resignfirstresponder on the text field to dismiss the keyboard then update your table view s data source object this is the object you ve assigned to the uitableview s datasource property with the string from the text field s text property and remove the uitextfield from your table cell and reload the table s data by calling its reloaddata method

4110715
hide	show
if i am working with php and i am iterating through few items and each item has his content to show hide i cannot set static ids to my divs because script just won t work

4110728
allocator	stl
looking at the source gcc s vector implementation which i think is based eventually on sgi s original stl implementation does sort-of store a copy of the allocator object passed into that constructor so there s some hope that this won t happen

4110740
post	get
i d like to know how to get an array of urls for all the photos in the post

4110745
getter	setter
they are not a substitute for proper getter and setter

4110794
mouseleave	mouseenter
for previous question since the popup is over top of the element use the mouseenter on the trigger mouseleave on the popup like this

4110837
free	malloc
but bad things will happen if the pointer wasn t originally returned by malloc 3 and never previously given back to free 3

4110935
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu i m sure has packages called debhelp and dhtml which presents a web-based search interface including boolean search and can be used to index all of the documents in usr share doc -- pdfs html ps and more as well as man pages texinfo documents etc

4110979
calloc	malloc
if the memory pointed to was not allocated by a heap allocation function such as malloc or calloc then the data preceeding the block will be meaningless as heap management data

4110979
free	malloc
all it knows is that malloc returns a void and that free accepts a void

4110999
getter	setter
ditto for private variables with no getter or setter

4111015
fortran	ada	ada	pascal
ada pascal assembly fortran etc etc

4111049
button	checkbox
button sliders checkbox radiobox etc clear this global variable

4111055
children	parent
you could iterate over all the children of the parent control compare their name to the name you want to find the control you want

4111069
oncreate	setcontentview
now to make you understand why your imageview wasn t displayed when declaring it the way you initially tired by creating a new object because you most likely had the setcontentview methods parameter in your oncreate method set to r.layout.main your main.xml file containing your layout

4111075
hash	salt
the salt you use is supposed to be a random value stored alongside the hash result

4111141
width	height
if you don t set the width and height of the ellipse and border they will size with the window automatically

4111141
width	height
instead use a grid to set the relative size of the controls using row height and column width percentages eg

4111167
hide	show
i m using jquery script to show hide some content

4111167
hide	show
since i m using php i am iterating through few items and each of them has a button to show hide its content

4111180
mvp	presenter
if you follow the mvp model i think this validation logic would live in your presenter

4111196
idictionary	ilist
system.web.mvc.controlleractioninvoker.invokeactionmethodwithfilters controllercontext controllercontext ilist 1 filters actiondescriptor actiondescriptor idictionary 2 parameters +305

4111200
mouseleave	mouseenter
you need to use the mouseenter and mouseleave events which .hover uses directly when binding with an object like this

4111200
mouseleave	mouseenter
.hover is defined specially here in the jquery event code...it simply isn t supported like other events in places like .bind since it s not an event it s just a function to help you bind the mouseenter and mouseleave events

4111201
post	get
im in the exact same situation...i came across this post with in interesting comment further down although i couldn t quite get it to work

4111202
int	chars
types bool chars char16_t char32_t wchar_t and the signed and unsigned int types are collectively called integral types

4111216
webrat	cucumber
if your image is identifiable on the page by a css id you should be able to accomplish this using cucumber webrat and or cucumber selenium the latter if you also want to test javascript in the page

4111339
post	get
using ssl to post the data through your own domain and you proxying to the other seems like a better option if it s possible so you re not providing data using get at any point

4111356
uitableview	uisearchbar
i had my uisearchbar side-by-side with my uitableview in my xib file and was adding it as a subview of the table view in code

4111358
codeigniter	cakephp
i already have a method which is just to implode the route and use the array for the function arguments but i would really like to know how to do it like in codeigniter or cakephp

4111369
implements	extends
aside from the rare case of classes which provide the same method but aren t related nor do implements a common interface for example the close method -- source for one does not extends closeable i find no use for structural types with their present restriction

4111406
config	ini
after proper config of ini

4111470
pull	push
i m successfully using mongomapper s built-in support for atomic push and set but can t figure out pull

4111509
width	height
so the problem with your example seems to be the min height width

4111509
width	height
if you can t just use height width i d suggest something like the following

4111530
min	max
i know this is a simple min max type thing that you do a thousand times in lower programming classes

4111538
hide	show
if you need another element above this say a that hide and show appropriately when there are aren t errors add a errorcontainer #somediv option as well

4111563
cpu	processors
and these tests have been run on my machine running the latest gcc and an amd athlon tm 64 x2 dual core processors 4000+ cpu

4111572
nfa	dfa
as constantin says dfa and nfa can be represented as dags

4111574
rdiff-backup	unison
unison doesn t preserve history so if you want that you should schedule rdiff-backup to run every day on one of your hosts preferably whichever one has the largest most reliable hard drive

4111574
pull	push
in my head i ve designed a little python or ruby system tray process to watch your repo for changes nag you when it s dirty have options for autocommit after a period of no changes and also do auto push pull

4111614
spaces	delimiter
how can i formulate this so that it will pick up and delimiter with potential spaces but also properly encoded urls without delimiter

4111633
typedef	struct
you can simulate a class with private members by defining a struct inside the source file and providing only a typedef and a set of functions to your users

4111636
sorting	filtering
also for more complicated sorting and filtering try

4111645
maven	pom.xml
the only artifact i had thought was being produced by the pom.xml i was working with was a .war but you ll notice in the log that the artifact which maven is attempting to deploy to the release is actually a .jar

4111654
pull	push
they will need to pull from the main repos make changes and then resolve conflict if they want to push

4111676
google-chrome	firefox
it it supported by all major browsers firefox 3.6 ie8 google-chrome other webkit-based browsers but i d still highly suggest to use a library which handles the event for you - by using a timer in browsers not supporting the html5 event and using the event otherwise

4111694
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
my current application consists of a uitabbarcontroller with 4 different tabs and a uiviewcontroller

4111695
width	height
this could happen if your fft size is much larger than the height of the drawing area or the number of spectral lines is a lot more than its width

4111708
getter	setter
if you don t synthesize the object it won t make getter and setter for you so that may be why setting the rightbarbuttonitem isn t working as there is no getter for the toggle barbuttonitem so you re setting it to nil

4111721
pull	push
one is a pull one is a push

4111743
post	get
i get a proper response but it doesn t send me to the post data page just redirects back to the top of the page due to the anchor

4111743
post	get
right now probably going to go with a hidden field and then do a .submit but wondering if there s an easier way to get the page since the post could be done properly

4111756
put	get	post	get	post	put
when i really thought about that there are only 4 i know there are some more http verbs - post get put delete - i felt it couldn t create powerful restful apis cause they are limiting the api to basic crud operations

4111756
put	get
cause get and put are verbs that could be replaced with create a read and create a change

4111756
put	get	post	get	post	put
but if that is correct then this mean that http restful api could be used to create anything in the right way not by hacking it with modified versions putting the verbs in the uri request body etc but only using post get put delete

4111761
radgrid	linqdatasource
hi i m using a linqdatasource with a radgrid

4111772
put	get	post	get	post	put
get post put and delete do not directly relate to create read update and delete

4111772
post	put
they often can but it is important to note that post and put can both perform update and create functionality

4111772
put	get	post	get	post	put
this means that post should be used for any function that changes server data state and get put and delete should be used for any functions that do not change server state

4111787
pull	push
you can always push and pull a single revision and all of it ancestors using

4111801
post	get
you can create any system using only two methods get and post by equating get read and post write

4111803
g++	gcc	fortran	ada

4111806
width	height
what tricks can i use to make it easy for someone reading the output to quickly figure out if the coordinates are a x y width height vs

4111806
width	height
a format i ve seen before is something like +100 +300 500 500 on x11 where the + - are meant to imply that the first two digits are x y since width height cannot be negative values where as with left top right bottoms any of the values can be either positive or negative

4111810
punctuation	words
it reads two words from command line ignores spaces and punctuation and determines if they are anagrams

my workaround is to set the iframe the height width well over any anticipated source page size in css the background property to transparent

4111904
firefox	safari
it works in ie8 firefox 3 safari

4111931
put	get
the php works fine when i access it directly and put the get parameters in the url but for some reason it won t validate properly and thus won t let the form submit

4111981
put	get	post	get	post	put
this means that you really don t need custom verbs standard interfaces are usually better anyway because you can get everything done using get put post and delete

4111990
google-chrome	firefox
everything works fine in firefox and google-chrome and i ve had two other people test this on different pcs running ie8 and they have the same problem

4112022

instead of making it private public or protected

4112151
centos	linux
i m fairly new to linux centos in this case

4112155
stdout	stderr
you can read from stdout or stderr synchronously or asynchronously

4112198
int	chars
ord returns the int ordinal of a one chars string

4112198
ord	chr
so you can t do a chr sequence or an ord sequence

and then there s always the option of running bsd unix linux-based tools in os x as well as windows programs if you have an intel-based mac

4112316
int	double
i ve been working on a class assignment for c++ and we re required to acquire input from a text file and assign those values to an array....one is a string the second an int and the third a double

4112320
getter	setter
have a look at com.thornglatch.pingo.usercontroller line 25 and check that the name you re accessing has a setter and getter or it is a public field in com.thornglatch.pingo.user

off course a4 size has fixed width and height

4112464
mouse	keyboard
in this state i m unable to move the mouse the system just steals the cursor back and i m unable to quit instruments since when i hit cmd+q i m prompted to save the document which i can t do because i have no control of the keyboard or mouse

4112470
stdout	stderr
i need to start a process and receive 2 or 3 handles for stdin stdout and stderr so i can write input to the process and receive its output the same way command line pipes behave grep

4112483
folder	directory
my solution that is not working was to add 2 subdirectories to my classes folder in my project directory - one for each target

4112520
gif	png
prefered formats for output would be png gif would be acceptable jpg will probably not work due to compression and lack of transparency as in png and gif

4112526
post	get
if you want to do it using post run a few with get and then this article is useful

4112582
opera	firefox
other browsers at least opera and firefox do not show such a behavior

4112619
integer	unsigned
consider the following array of bytes that is intended to be converted into a single unsigned integer

4112631
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if you test the above-stated code in browsers other than opera tested on v9.62 it works like a charm i have tested in safari firefox google-chrome

4112633
getter	setter
you are using self.bannerisvisible but i can t see neither a synthesize for this nor setter and getter

4112663
google-chrome	firefox
in every browser i tested google-chrome firefox and ie no not even when wrapped in a parent element that has the cursor property

4112707
post	get
if you use the post method in the form you get the name of the button in the form collection otherwise you get it in the querystring collection

4112714
jdk1.6	jdk1.5
also you may have changed the location of your jdk which could be leading to incompatibilities between jdk1.5 and jdk1.6 at compile time

4112723
libpcap	wireshark
see this q a from wireshark which is essentially a gui to libpcap for possible workarounds

4112742
getter	setter
you should not be using the names in the getter and setter attributes on the property declaration with dot syntax

4112863
post	get
here is the checkboxes i want to get checkbox values base on name as businesstype in controller using post menthod

4112864
inherited	properties
the whole point of objects is that they can inherited from parent objects implement interfaces and be passed as arguments - static members have none of these properties so they aren t truly object-oriented they re little more than a namespace

4112904
pop-up	dialog
i also have who of these did you mean and i want a pop-up dialog for this too where you can select one of the names you ment

4112918

you can redirect stderr file descriptor 2 to stdout file descriptor 1 with

4112978
google-chrome	firefox
i find that there is an annoying horizontal scrollbar that appears only on firefox not ie or google-chrome when i use iframes and content that is too big to fit within the width of the iframe

4113012
put	get
now my question what is the best place to put my groupheaderstyle and how to get it via

4113020
button	checkbox
if only one of these checkbox can be selected at a time you should use a group of radio button instead

4113020
button	checkbox
to get the value of the checkbox or radio button group use

4113036
getter	setter
i don t think there is a way to express this concept using native syntax even using rhino spidermonkey proprietary extensions like getter and setter

4113049
int	chars
because string isn t a primitive type it s a class which has methods whereas int short chars etc

4113066
folder	directory
i created a django project and as it was recommended in django tutorial i placed static files like .js in separate folder as well as template directory

4113103
versioning	upgrade
be warned once your databases are upgrade they can not be restored on an install of an older versioning

4113140
put	get
just put it in a folder in your project it will get deployed with your application

4113154
width	height
ie7 for some reason does not respect my width and height set to 16px and instead makes all rows and columns to take the average size

4113155
webstorm	aptana
i ve tried some of the editors ides regularly recommended for coding javascript aptana webstorm ... but none of them has a satisfying autocomplete functionality

4113197
oncreate	onstart
you should only create things in oncreate and start them in onstart or onresume

4113210
maven	m2e
i performed import existing maven project in eclipse using m2e plugin

4113258
jboss	glassfish
or when you re not on a servlet 3.0 compatible container yet tomcat 7 glassfish 3 jboss 6 etc or newer then map it in web.xml the old fashioned way see also our servlets wiki page

4113273
width	height
i don t have ie7 nor ie6 here so this is just a guess try setting the width and height of .m to auto

4113299
apache	nginx	passenger	webrick
there are webrick mongrel passenger apache nginx and many more i am sure and i don t really understand the different roles they play

4113338
public	protected
non-nested classes in c# can be public or internal but not protected

4113359
maven	pom.xml
you should also add the groovy maven plugin to your pom.xml like this see this page for details

4113399
fadein	fadeout
i m looking for a light-weight low bandwidth cross-browser solution to show some alternating texts in a div on webpage with fadein fadeout

4113439
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if you test the above-stated code in browsers other than opera tested on v9.62 it works like a charm i have tested in safari firefox google-chrome

google-chrome	firefox
try jetbrains webstorm and its css xfire plug-in for firefox and google-chrome

4113553
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
should work in all ie 7 8 firefox google-chrome safari

4113570
apache	nginx
you are also confusing the roles of apache nginx with the roles of other components

4113570
apache	nginx
apache vs nginx

4113570
apache	nginx
apache is more popular and has more features nginx is smaller and faster and has less features

4113570
apache	nginx
neither apache nor nginx can serve ruby web apps out-of-the-box to do that you need to use apache nginx in combination with some kind of add-on described later

4113570
apache	nginx
apache and nginx can also act as reverse proxies meaning that they can take an incoming http request and forward it to another server which also speaks http

4113570
apache	nginx
when that server responds with an http response apache nginx will forward the response back to the client

4113570
thin	webrick
they were using thin before so i have no idea why they switched to webrick

4113570
thin	unicorn	puma	unicorn	puma	thin
app servers that may not be directly exposed to the internet mongrel unicorn thin puma

4113570
apache	nginx
these app servers must be put behind a reverse proxy web server like apache and nginx

4113570
apache	nginx
you must then setup apache or nginx to reverse proxy to this cluster

4113570
apache	nginx
apache nginx will take care of distributing requests between the instances in the cluster more on this in section i o concurrency models

4113570
apache	nginx
apache and nginx are very good at doing many things at the same time because they re either multithreaded or evented

4113570
apache	nginx
apache and nginx can do it faster

4113570
apache	nginx
people typically set up apache nginx to serve static files directly but forward requests that don t correspond with static files to the app server it s good security practice

4113570
apache	nginx
apache and nginx are very mature and can shield the app server from perhaps maliciously corrupted requests

4113570
puma	unicorn
puma was also forked from mongrel but unlike unicorn puma is designed to be purely multi-threaded

4113570
apache	nginx
phusion passenger integrates directly into apache or nginx and so can be compared to mod_php for apache

4113570
apache	nginx
just like mod_php allows apache to serve php apps almost magically phusion passenger allows apache and also nginx

4113570
apache	nginx
instead of starting a process or cluster for your app and configuring apache nginx to serve static files and or reverse proxying requests to the process cluster with phusion passenger you only need to

4113570
mri	rubinius	jruby	mri	jruby	rubinius
phusion passenger supports many mri ruby jruby and rubinius

4113570
thin	unicorn
mongrel unicorn and thin only support mri

4113570
flask	django
it also supports python wsgi so it can for example also run django and flask apps

4113570
passenger	unicorn
unicorn also has a similar feature but phusion passenger s version is more flexible because

4113570
passenger	unicorn
2 phusion passenger s version works well with multithreaded apps while unicorn s does not

4113570
apache	nginx
you should refer to the comprehensive phusion passenger manual apache version nginx version or the phusion passenger website for information

4113570
jruby	rubinius
jruby and rubinius have no gil so they can fully leverage multiple cores in a single process

4113575
serializable	deserialization
i faced in a problem with unicode characters serializable and deserialization

4113604
dotnetzip	sharpziplib
and the next to zip it i suggest sharpziplib but also the dotnetzip

4113605
getter	setter
i might approach it by reducing the visibility of the one-to-many relationship and create a getter setter as such

4113618
google-chrome	firefox
i have this html that shows up fine in firefox except in ie and google-chrome

4113638
client-side	server-side
i would like both the server-side and client-side validation to be set accordingly

4113717
hash	salt
also you don t want to double hash things like your salt and username because this will only limit the possibilities of the hash and the username values although this is probably purely a theoretical problem since it s not common use to hash your salt

4113720
inherited	subclassing
this is when you design your class for inherited and you want to provide hooks for subclassing

4113728
setinterval	settimeout
the exception is when you run code that is asynchronous like a settimeout setinterval or an asynchronous ajax request

4113752
gridbaglayout	springlayout
then you might use a gridbaglayout or springlayout for the other components

4113766
width	height
but in internet explorer and firefox it is not the table stretches to the width but ignores the height property and its height is determined by its contents

4113798
stdout	stderr
ft popen cli_parts stdin pipe stderr pipe stdout pipe file

4113821
portrait	landscape
for example when you create a layout you can choose the orientation so that you will have one layout for the landscape view and one for the portrait view

4113821
portrait	landscape
the layout will be automatically chosen whether you are holding the phone in portrait or landscape mode

4113823
getter	setter
i intentionally missed setter getter and some other things for code clarity

4113835
multiplying	add
but we can t just add multiplying the two statements

4113845
public	protected
you can also replace public with protected if you don t like this example

4113845
system.in	system.out
in real life you have something simillar in java when it comes to system.in or system.out

4113846
itunes	apple-id
in other words once you have created that app and then uploaded it to itunes connect then both app and your itunes connect account are locked together by the same apple-id and the same pw

4113849
public	protected
the solutions using a public constructor are fine too but as the constructor cannot be called directly on thr interface i think protected is better

4113873
getter	setter
explicit getter and setter can be overly-bureaucratic

4113873
getter	setter
the main cited reason for having getter and setter functions is that it isolates the clients of your class from potential changes in implementation in the future for instance consider what would happen if you decide to generate an engine object on demand rather than using a member variable or decide to hide it behind a smart pointer or some other container

4113873
getter	setter
if your class if very simple close to being a pod and unlikely to change then it may not be worth the faff of having to implement the getter and setter

4113880
getter	setter
i read an interesting java article why getter and setter methods are evil which applies just as much to c++ as it does to java

4113882
folder	directory
i can find out where the working directory of the windows service is by outputting to a the log the working directory in this case c windows system32 and copy over nginx directory into that folder but this is not great for when it comes to bundling the application into a setup.exe file which may be installed in any arbitrary location - plus it clutters the system32 folder

4113951
division	addition
in addition whether integer division by zero raises sigfpe is also cpu + os dependant

4113958
ubuntu	debian
if you are on debian ubuntu apache.apache would be www-data www-data

however peer authentication happens when a tcp connection is established between peers so there is still plenty of security beyond the udp broadcast but i just don t want to be too easily intercepted and interpreted by a 3rd party

4114173
getter	setter
as i happened to get educated on recently getter and setter smell of bad design

4114191
zsh	tcsh	bash	tcsh	bash	zsh
it even works with auto-completion if you have the git-completion in place for bash tcsh zsh

4114198
jar	war
i ve had similar issues before and it usually boiled down to the jar missing from the built war

4114199

starting it in portrait works fine also after pushing my ipad to landscape after starting in portrait

4114199
portrait	landscape
starting in portrait switching to landscape

4114265
for-loop	loops
hey guys m running into a problem i have a for-loop n in that i call a function and in that function i have a if condition i want to skip 1 loops if condition gets true for this problm i was thinkin to use goto statement but as i read in many forums that goto statement is an evil.

pull	push
i d like to restrict write access for the master branch to only several developers while allowing others to pull everything and push to other non-master branches

4114426
inherited	subclassing
assuming you want to use inherited to be able to use the same mapped fields in each of the subclassing i ve approached this by using a trait for those fields

4114477
lxml	libxml2
lxml s documentation says the support for parsing broken html depends entirely on libxml2 s recovery algorithm

4114477
lxml	html5lib
so i recommend swapping lxml for html5lib which handles baidu s invalid html with no problems

4114508
hide	show
i have a pesky link that calls a javascript function to show and hide the div layer

4114508
hide	show
however instead of performing this javascript show hide in the webapp view it closes and loads the page and javascript in safari

4114582
width	height
you seem to misunderstand the box model - in css you provide points for the top and left and then width and height - these are all that are needed for a box to be placed with exact measurements

4114621
width	height
there is a nice example of using accelerator and stage width and height for obtaining device orientation

4114636
expression-blend	silverlight
my personal recommendation for developers using silverlight is to use expression-blend

4114665

different from get however post data will not be stored in the browser s url history nor in proxy logs etc

4114674
scheme	racket
i am attempting to create a simple language interpreter for a homework assignment in plt scheme racket

4114698

persistent	transient
once nh persistent an entity in a single session and that session is closed i need to fetch it again in a new session in order to reference it in some other transient entities

or i can call session.lock on the new session instances and let nh know this entity is not transient

4114856
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the lytebox script works until the show only one is invoked from that point on it s broken in ie firefox and opera google-chrome and safari do not throw an error with this error

4114874
stdout	stderr
however if you want to distinguish stderr lines from stdout lines maybe you need to use ipc open3 or the mis-named ipc open3 util

4114918
inherited	properties
every object you create in js inherited its properties from the prototype

4114929
rss	feed
i have a project that i need to make a service that we will add to it about 500 rss for different sites and we want this service to collect new rss feed from these sources and save title url in my sql server database .

4114954
for-loop	arrays
second thing you can do is to create an arrays of all html elements you want to check and then have a nested for-loop

4114968
stdout	fflush
i thought i was getting the same problem but then i realized that i was just forgetting to fflush stdout

4114968
post	get
it seems that chrome always sends the request up to the end of the headers before sending the request content and you have to use a second recv call to get the post data

4114974
rss	feed
it s not the web service that should consume the rss feed it should merely be responsible of spawning the work to do so asynchronously

4114999
switching	screens
then if the person touched the screens in the second view it would switching back to the first view and stop playing i assume the best way to do this would be to have some kind of stop playing method in the viewdidload section of the first view

4115000
wmv	flv
i am using ffmpeg to convert any avi wmv videos to flv

4115006
children	parent
and i am trying to structure a query such that i get all of the parent who have children records which all have a date before a specified date

4115006

but the problem with this is i get parent that have children with a date before the date specified and have child records with a date after the date specified when i want only the parent of children with a date before the given date

4115013
min	max
if you are looking for more of a best-fit type algorithm replace the max - min 2 function in step two with an averaging function

4115068
g++	gcc
have gcc or even better g++ installed

4115095

if you want to fork the whole thing put it on github get ten or a hundred friends to bang on the code and make an f# clone for jvm or something you could do that too

4115108
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
html5lib uses exactly the same algorithm that s also implemented in recent versions of firefox safari and google-chrome

4115127
children	parent
i want all parent who s children all have a date on before date x

4115141
postgresql	mysql
one could get away with using analytic windowing ranking functions like row_number but it depends on data and database support mysql doesn t support analytic functions oracle 9i+ postgresql 8.4+ sql server 2005+ do

4115149
hide	show
if you want the user be able to switch between different views and this is data that can simply be included on page load then just include onload then hide show or load as json and then populate as needed

4115198
hide	show
i ve had a look through your demo code and all is working as intended - the tab event handlers are being bound correctly to the list elements which when clicked are applying the correct css classes to the div elements to show the corresponding one and hide the others respectively

4115361
glut	sdl
glut is much more easier while many of people use sdl or sfml they re more flexible and feature-full than glut

4115395
rss	feed
it seems to work just fine in loading up the table with the rss feed data but when i add it to the uitabbarcontroller the list never gets populated with anything

4115415
width	height
usually you wouldn t detect this issue with this script but the way i have my site set up with javascript to update the div tag s content the menu doesn t notice the page content increased or decreased in height or width depending on situation and you can t scroll so the menu stays where it is at the top of the page

4115462
ubuntu	linux
update my development environment is on ubuntu linux

equals	gethashcode
i m facing a problem with gethashcode and equals which i have overridden for a class

4115555

i am using the operator to verify if both are equals and i d expect this would be calling both gethashcode and equals if their hash code are the same in order to validate they are indeed equals

4115560
portrait	landscape
there is a dropdown within the layout editor that allows you to select landscape or portrait orientation

4115573

you can fix it s position hide show it or listen to it s events

4115679
int	chars
here in this code when i put a chars such a in int type variable while loop repeats over and over and don t ask me whether to repeat or not

4115679
int	chars
this problem just appear when i put chars not int

4115771
portrait	landscape
i noticed that the text of the softkeyboard in landscape mode doesn t show the same characters as i see in the edittext field in portrait mode

4115771
portrait	landscape
when i type in a in landscape mode i don t see it in the softkeyboard-text but it appears in the edittext when i flip the screen to portrait mode

4115795
postorder	inorder
it s also possible to do an inorder traversal left subtree then the node itself then the right subtree or a postorder traversal left subtree then right subtree then the node itself

4115836
filesystems	ntfs
the file must be on an ntfs filesystems volume

4115861
getter	setter
unlike the username userid and other user info password is not stored in the database but for the sake of the pojo getter and setter method i attempt to include a dummy password field - for serving the struts2 action form

4115881
opera	firefox
hacks.mozilla.org often features blog posts on experimental html5 stuff going into firefox similarly the opera core and opera dev blogs have a lot of stuff

4115984
opera	firefox
opera 10.x supports svg in background images and svg lets you do gradients in much the same way firefox and safariâ s css extensions do

4115990
uilabel	uibutton
navigationcontroller.view - uiscrollview - uiview container for each page - uibutton with custom views done using uiimageviews and optionally uilabel underneath each uibutton

i m looking for a good solution for an autocomplete autosuggest jquery plugin

4116111
persistent	transient
annotate any fields that you don t want to be persistent as transient

4116144
folder	directory
if you would like to add a further level of protection i would recommend you take your secure.html file outside of your site s root folder public_html and place it on the same level as that directory so that it is not inside the directory

4116156
submit	submission	post	put
my strategy is to put a live binding to the submit event on my form which then prevents the default submission and does a jquery post using the form values as parameters for processing at my site

4116159
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome however use dom order

4116159
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
in this case when a user clicks on move ie8 firefox google-chrome and opera all use dom order not character stream order

4116219
profiling	debugging
it runs fine in the debugging configuration with a provisioning profiling

4116294
portrait	landscape
had the same problem with gc launching in portrait on ipad when my cocos2d game was in landscape

4116301
jar	manifest.mf
also once exported you could unzip jar file and look into meta-inf manifest.mf file - there should be main-class entry with fully qualified name of your class where the main method is

4116305
width	height
image with width x and height 1 causes the content of the td to be push up or down by more than 1px

4116305
width	height
div with width x and height 1 and float left this seems to work the best at the moment although it does push the content up or down slightly

4116368
put	get
however although i have successfully created a dll and put it in the extensions folder and told php.ini about it now i get this

4116369
getter	setter
assuming you are talking about a subclass of nsmanagedobject here the setter getter are provided by coredata

4116387
for-loop	loops
i have tried to change the while loops into a for-loop but i don t think that has to do with anything with the error

4116413
width	height
if the div elements you re using have a fixed width and height you can simply make them all float right and they will naturally layout right to left and top to bottom

4116422
oncreate	onstart
so put the above code example in the oncreate or onstart of your launcher activity to have it play on startup and place it in a button s onclick method to respond to a button press

4116445
getter	setter
dynamic as used in classes you define not core data means that your are going to type in the getter and setter for the property

4116445
getter	setter
generally you would only do this if you are not going to store the value for the property in a variable are going to somehow transform it first or need to hook some other processing into the getter setter concept

4116459
post	get
for each iteration over post then you are hitting the database at to get p.by which i assume to be a foreignkey to an auth.user

4116459
post	get
in addition to that with an invalid cache first run you are hitting the db again at to get the list of that post s images

4116520
put	get	post	get	post	put
don t forget to add the header when you do the post to make it get interpreted as a put

4116542
post	get
you can send post and get request to this php file refer these links if you are not aware of sending request to server side from iphone app

4116606

i can see in firebug dom inspector both firefox and google-chrome that it s creating the same dom structure for this

4116657
qgraphicsitem	qgraphicswidget
there is a graphicsitem property of qgraphicsitem qgraphicswidget but looking at the code i don t think i can assign my item s to this property and have them work properly

4116713
gentoo	linux
this was seemingly a gentoo linux related bug

4116769
typemock	moles
you can do the same with the free ms moles framework for visual studio 2010 which is a suitable alternative to typemock if you have to do such tests only occasionally

4116792
for-loop	arrays
upon initialization i do a for-loop which sets an arrays of cell by multiplying the x y given by the user say if x 10 and y 10 i create an arrays of cells 100

4116798
coldbox	coldspring
a. use an dependency injection framework such as coldspring only suitable for singleton services lightwire or coldbox s own di solution wirebox

4116801
inherited	properties
it looks like i can intercept the strokes like this but the styluspoint is a sealed struct so i can t just inherited add a new properties

4116820
folder	directory
i have thousands of images in a directory divided in sub folder

4116843
width	height
i have created image viewer control that provide zoom in out the image and when the image zoomed and be larger than it s viewer you can t see all the image i provided the ability to drag the image like windows photo viewer using translatetransform but i wanna the image to stop dragging when it s border left or right or left or down is appeared i have done some calculations of the width and height of the fourth sides and it s work fine but when you speedy drag the image it stop after it s border pass it s container border and the distance increased by greater drag speed

4116850
pop-up	dialog
edit the issue is starting emacsclientw for the first time pop-up this dialog which connects to emacs-server but then does not close

4116865
division	modulo
i know how to do this for decimal integers by using modulo and division

4116879
debian	linux
debian gnu linux 5.0.6

4116883
division	modulo
you can use modulo and division by 2 exactly like you would in base 10

4116883
division	modulo
you can also use binary operators but if you already know how to do that in base 10 it would be easier if you just used division and modulo

4116913
super	self
if you re inheriting from uitableviewcontroller your view should be a uitableview not a plain uiview then when you want to create a view programmatically you should allocate it initialize it set its properties and assign it as your controller s view i haven t tried super loadview before but it s creating the tableview for you and assigning datasource and delegate to self so you don t have to do that

4116931
division	modulo
expanding on frã dã ric and gabi s answers all you need to do is realise that the rules in base 2 are no different to in base 10 - you just need to do your division and modulo with a divisor 2 instead of 10

4116955
unsigned	short
represents an unsigned short grayscale image non-indexed

4116966
free	malloc
so malloc free or is what you should use to create and destroy an array of that size

4116971
bitarray	bitset
use a bitarray bitset in java with one bit for each number

4117082
x86	64bit
on other processors such as powerpc it is quite common - 64bit registers and instructions are available in 32 bit mode whereas with x86 it tends to be all or nothing

4117101
nsapplication	nsmenuitem
i ve inspected the xib file associated to the main menu and that nsmenuitem is sending a openpreferences id sender ibaction to the firstresponder which sould be the nsapplication

4117117
mvp	presenter
in mvp i see the presenter as the orchestrators of activity

4117117
mvp	presenter
exposing the view of a presenter to other presenter breaks the idea of encapsulation within the mvp pattern

4117117
mvp	presenter
the only code i have in the view are the notifications to its presenter of what a user has done also known as user gestures in some mvp discussions

4117137
ubuntu	linux
for compatibility on both mac os x and ubuntu linux i used

4117152
rpm	yum
libx264 does not come pre-installed licensing issues i believe if you ve downloaded it via yum rpm

4117159
ubuntu	linux
recently i migrated all of my homeworks to linux ubuntu 10.04 trying to assemble codes with nasm or nasm i receive a lot of errors almost in each line

4117178
antivirus	rootkit
many antivirus software raise a flag when they detect such rootkit like behavior like api hooking hidden files ssdt hooks etc.

4117208
getter	setter
is it good practice to use mutable getter and setter for spring or hibernate framework and using immutable setter and getter for my custom coding

4117217
getter	setter
edit the exception is occurring in the setter because you re always trying to access the underlying dictionary s getter

4117218
getter	setter
note that if you provide a mutable setter and getter it will eventually be used by people

4117229
filesystems	ntfs
to read label from ntfs partition -f needed for mounted filesystems

4117256
width	height
what i am trying to do is get the height and width of the image so that the new window is created with the same height and width as the stored image

4117256
width	height
create a height and width column in my database and store the values when the image is inserted into the database

4117256
width	height
retrieve the image from the database and calculate somehow the height and width just before displaying it and then resize the browser window to the right size

4117256
width	height
i already have over 150 images in the database so that makes option 1 difficult because i would have to go back over my db and calculate height and width for images that are already in the db

4117268
put	get
secondly when i get the values of the parameter it put all values in one record

4117278
textview	imageview
i have a basic file browser within my app that for each row of the list outputs an imageview and a textview

4117282
firefox	safari
this is easily doable with such tools as firebug on firefox or equally good really inspector on safari

4117282
client-side	server-side
most server providers don t let users do this but if you can - and want security - do it - don t use any known protocol but rather something that suits just your need - after all you control both server-side and client-side so the communication can be done anyhow

4117294
post	get
to get parameters not to be in the url you need to use post

4117299
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
note this code works in modern browsers only - ie8 firefox google-chrome opera safari

4117310
yacc	bison
use bison flex which is the gnu version of yacc lex

4117348
post	get
an api will tell you how you can do things with the site without having to reverse engineer all pages post ... and the format of every output resulting from post get operations

4117385
getter	setter
i now understand that i can receive this object as a parameter in my controller method and that spring will bind the form parameters to the getter setter of my person object

4117403
ssms	sqlcmd
also the sqlcmd utility has a number of additional enhancements that go beyond what the t-sql scripts in ssms can do

4117419
mouse	keyboard
there are times application is run without a keyboard mouse eg kiosk so i will put up a virtual keyboard for the user

4117419
hide	show
if unable to do it guess i just hide the caret brush otherwise it looks abit confusing especially when u are at the 3rd character but the caretbrush show on the 1st character

4117428
jruby	rubinius
it might also work on rubinius or the not-yet-released jruby 1.6

4117430
unsigned	short
if i call append and use t as unsigned short word

4117484
put	get
i ve been trying to get opengl-es to do something roughly like the following to see if glpushmatrix and glpopmatrix could be used to put things such as blending states back how they were before glpushmatrix was called

4117492
g++	gcc
now set full path for gcc or g++ as follows

4117501
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
you must call free on pointers you obtain from malloc and realloc

4117501
realloc	malloc
there is no reason to cast the result of malloc or realloc in c

4117501
free	realloc
if realloc is unable to reallocate enough memory it returns null but the original pointer is not free

4117509
move	drag
i ve had this problem several times now and never found a satisfactory solution if i want to move a group of items with a view all together in interface builder and these items are all on top of a larger background item i can t put a selection rectangle around the items in the view because any click and drag in the view initiates a move of the background item

4117521
serializable	deserialization
but i don t know how to do serializable or deserialization

4117561
width	height
in flex the width can be set to 100 but in flash it seems i can only set the width height in unit of px

4117565
put	get
my question is if you can dynamically set the id string r.id.btn7 to put in a can get the buttons for and for example change the color ..

4117580
width	height
furthermore any event type can be passed in and the following jquery methods can be called val css html text data width height or offset

4117613
quicksort	mergesort
you won t find a parallel sorting algorithm based on quicksort or mergesort without using it

4117621
post	get
when evaluating that a form was submitted i check that the method was post not get

4117630
post	get
html only supports post and get as form methods even though http has others

4117630
post	put
even outside the context of an html form the answer is still no as put and post are very different

4117630
post	put
post is a generic here is some data do something with it method while put means replace the resource at this uri with this data

4117633
width	text-align
also because the ul s width is 100 it doesn t help to wrap the ul in a div and give the div a rule of text-align center

4117648
apache	nginx
but one of my partners suggested that we use a standard server like iis apache or nginx

4117655
post	get
if you re doing it for security reasons get or post doesn t matter

4117672
min	max
a more intutive but slightliy slower variant would be to use min max on each axis

4117685
post	put
there is no different between put and post in security ..

4117691
portrait	landscape
as usual in android each time the screen is flipped to portrait landscape mode an activity runs through life-cycle from onsaveinstancestate to ondestroy and then is recreated

4117721
move	drag
i need functionality as used in google maps drag and move and pinch gestures

4117736
yacc	bison
you will probably be best to use bison or yacc to generate your parser code

4117748
ftp	telnet
server side software could mean lots of different things for example this could be a trivial app which echoes everything back on a specific port to a telnet ftp server to a webserver running lots of services

4117748
post	get
simple web site - slightly different to the above respods to html get post requests and serves up static or dymanic content i m guessing this is not what you re after

4117801

you could use a md5 or better a sha-1 hash

4120435
free	malloc
the only real danger i know of with returning a pointer to allocated memory is this if your library is compiled on windows and linked to one instance of the visual c++ runtime library msvcrt for example it is statically linked to it and a client program is linked to another instance for example it is linked to the dll then they each have a different malloc arena and pointers returned by the library cannot be free by the program

i create a mouselistener for the table so it gets the mouseevent at the click and shows the popup menu at the correct place

4121335
hex	binary
when for example you have signed hex 0x80 which will be converted to binary 1000 0000 however in order to compute the decimal value for this binary representation it is signed so we have to invert 7 bits so we get 1111111 and add 1 which gives us 10000000 which is -128

4121353

4121590
slideup	slidedown
when the mouse pointer leaves a the slideup effect should also be delayed by the same amount - my hope with this last requirement is that if you move down from one to the next the slidedown and slideup effects will occur at the same time so it just appears that the title row between them is moving up i hope this makes some sort of sense

4121634
inherited	subclassing

4124855
move	drag
in my experience mousedragged events work fine even when you move the mouse outside of the component area it will continue to report the x and y positions inside the component that are closest to the mouse s location outside of the component but it won t terminate the mouse drag as if you had released the left button

4124857
google-chrome	firefox
if you re using iexplore try using the iehta if using firefox try google-chrome instead of firefox

4124861

hash	md5
if you want to secure your password as you said in the update hash it with a hashing algorithmic md5 sha1 ... then stored in the database

4124917
client-side	server-side
even so this still makes the user s passwords more secure though this can safely be done client-side rather than server-side for improved protection

4124964
gif	png
for jpeg gif png i use libgd

4124976
hash	salt
to check if the entered password is correct you don t decrypt the saved password which isn t possible but you hash the entered password with the same salt as the original password and then compare the hash

4125033
division	multiplication
i want to know what are the algorithmic architectural requirements that cause division to be vastly more complicated in hardware than multiplication

4125068
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
edit it doesn t work in google-chrome 7 or safari 5 but it works in internet explorer 8 and firefox 3.6

4125074
division	multiplication
yes many cpus can perform multiplication in 1 or 2 clock cycles but division always takes longer although fp division is sometimes faster than integer division

4125074
division	subtraction
division requires iterative subtraction that cannot be performed simultaneously so it takes longer

4125074
multiplying	division
in fact some fp units speed up division by performing a reciprocal approximation and multiplying by that

4125087
put	get
the problem is that another slave may have assigned the job to itself between the get and put

4125092
subtract	add
it would be easier to just grab the month and year of the current date add subtract the number of months difference then generate a date from those new values

4125094
g++	gcc
you can try adding the -pthread command-line option to g++ this options means in gcc parlance do everything required for posix threading support

4125094
g++	gcc
i do not know whether your specific combination a rather old g++ with a rather old solaris is supported some googling shows me that some people can use it with an older gcc 3.4.3 with a newer solaris 10

4125142
children	parent
if you add a parent on the client and add some children to it s entitycollection when you submit all the entities will show up on the server

4125154
division	multiplication
division is inherently a much slower operation than multiplication

4125154
division	multiplication
are not semantically identical - 0.1 cannot be exactly represented as a double so a slightly different value will end up being used - substituting the multiplication for the division in this case would yield a different result

4125161
onclick	onsubmit
you need to run onsubmit not onclick

4125188
content-disposition	content-type
setting the content-type and content-disposition enables a browser to do the right thing ie open the file-save dialog but custom clients httpwebclient web service proxy etc don t have those behaviors built-in so you will need to add whatever is missing

4125192
division	multiplication
for example doing lots of multiplication on an array on x86 should be much faster then doing division because the compiler should create the assembler code which uses simd instructions

4125192
division	multiplication
since there are no division in the simd instructions then you would see great improvements using multiplication then division

4125199
equals	gethashcode
equals and gethashcode and none of them are being called when the value

4125207
onchange	onkeyup	onchange	onkeydown	onkeyup	onkeydown

now i m not sure what meebo does with these but even though there a reference to an http rather than https in there url it also references ssl and is in fact an https request

4126509
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
i have looked around and only came across graphicsmagick imagemagick which are excellent but are written in c and i only need an application that does compression so they are a bit feature rich for my needs

4126521
post	get
i am able to post to the service and get the response using web request and response.but i want to do that using wcf

4126597

unsigned int chars 255 p text

4126755
profiling	debugging
in debugging configurations in project settings you should have selected developer s profiling no need of specifying the entitlements plist

4126777
folder	directory
you can also create a .gitignore file in the repository s root directory outside the .git directory and write the folder entry there

4126858
jar	manifest.mf
the recommend approach is to have the following entry in jar s meta-inf manifest.mf file

4126863
versioning	upgrade
i think i might need to save the git versioning hash along with the continuation and only upgrade a continuation at checkpoints where no state is needed

4126877
width	height
this point.interpolate would give you a point that you will finally use with each possible target for the bullet either loop through all or for performance check if the x and y distances are smaller or equal to their width and height - target.hittestpoint interx intery true livedocs

4126883
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox

4126906
gridview	detailsview
my gridview is in an updatepanel asp .net ajax and the detailsview as not

4126906
gridview	detailsview
when i put the detailsview in the same updatepanel as the gridview it also worked

4126955
implements	extends
a class however can only extends one class abstract or not but can implements as many interfaces as it wants

4126961

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox google-chrome safari but guess what it does not work in ie

4126983
nsbezierpath	nsimage
i think i can get around this by drawing the nsbezierpath to nsimage and then to display the nsimage in lieu of the nsbezierpath but i haven t found a single source that shows me how to go about this

4126983
nsbezierpath	nsimage
i should note that i want to save this before the nsbezierpath is displayed - so solutions that draw an existing view to an nsimage are not useful

4127000
mouseup	mousedown
my only beef with this sample code and i stress that it is sample code is that the action is being done at mousedown and not at mouseup

4127020
width	height
i have an image which width is 213 and height is 200 when i echo the image from my database and i resize it the image was not as clear as when it was 213 200

4127031
int	double
replace double with whatever data type you desire int string object .

4127043
width	height
as a general rule don t set both the width and the height explicitly for the image

4127045
width	height
the best way is to keep the images aspect ration so basically if the image was 800 x 1200 instead of resizing it to a certain pixel size do it by percent and make sure the width and height are being changed by the same percent

4127084
stdout	stderr
under unix stdout and stderr go to the string list

4127177
prepare	execute
execute test prepare

4127202
hash	salt
something not mentioned in here is you should salt your hash

4127202
hash	salt
if they hash with no salt then breaking passwords would be as easy as downloading a large pre-hashed dataset of a crap-ton of strings

4127202
hash	salt
if you add a salt aka pre-determined random string to a password before it is hash then you can t just pre-hash a ton of strings

4127202
hash	salt
each password has a different salt so you can t use one pre-computer hash lookup table you d have to re-compute the hash for every password

4127202
hash	salt
even if you store the salt in the same table it would be incredibly hard for anyone to make a hash lookup to try to reverse any one person s password

4127247
folder	directory
create matching directory and files that you want modified in the local folder for the module

4127250
hide	show	slideup	slidedown
i need to hide show actually slidedown slideup an add to cart button underneath each table column

4127250
hide	show
my markup is a pretty basic table and the buttons positioning isn t causing any trouble either but what i cannot figure out is how to attach an event handler to the hover event of a table column that will show the button inside that column then when hovering a different column hide the currently showing and reveal the next one currently being hovered

4127297
memcpy	strcpy
you have to assign the elements individually or use a function such as strcpy or memcpy

4127339
put	get
ideally you would want everything in the same table with something in your query to get the correct version however you should be careful how you do this as an inefficient query will put extra load on your server

4127362
pop-up	dialog
i pop-up a dialog which explains that the license check failed and presents them with two buttons

4127435

4127472
super	implements
if you have two subclasses of nsmanagedobject where the parent class implements a dynamic property and its subclass the grandchild of nsmanagedobject overrides the methods for the property those overrides cannot call super

4127491
gridview	sqldatasource
the search button fires the gridview row command and changes the underlying sqldatasource s select command and adds the text value from the text box as a parameter

4127506
jobs	cron
it has cron based interface or a more dynamic way to generate jobs that are relative from a specific event if your use case calls for it quartz can do it

4127524

uiapplication	uiwindow
you could do this by creating a subclass of uiapplication for your app which returns the uiwindow object from a custom method

4127625
mouse	keyboard
i keep finding vaguely related postings that talk about input messages mouse and keyboard but i don t know what i can do to verify that

4127625
mouse	keyboard
i ve already tried butchering the code to remove every mouse keyboard operation i could

4127694
mouseup	mousedown
to avoid using threads you can add a timer component on your form control and simply enable it on mousedown and disable it on mouseup

4127731
post	get
it turns out that i get this every time i try to post or update now

4127731
postgresql	mysql
i can create new rails apps that work with sqlite mysql or postgresql but this old app which worked fine before can t work with any of the databases and i get the same connection refused - connect 2 error no matter which i try

imagemagick	vips
if that wasn t the issue try using imagemagick instead of vips if it s an option

4127764
asp.net-mvc	openrasta
i m testing out the feasibility of using openrasta as a viable alternative to asp.net asp.net-mvc

4127769
postgresql	informix
implementable in other dbms such as informix and probably postgresql but i m not confident of that

4127817
width	height
1 start more basically and give your elements height and width

4127859
hide	show
if you want to show the same form again create another instance or just hide it instead of closing

4127871
spaces	delimiter
split the string using the delimiter of your choice - i m assuming you want it to be whitespace then loop through the string tokens printing each one until you can t fit it in the remaining spaces then go to the next line and keep going

4127873
viewdidload	viewdidappear
so i started printing an nslog at each step of the launch process application didfinishlaunchingwithoptions applicationdidbecomeactive viewdidload viewdidappear and discovered to my surprise that does not mean that the view will load before application didfinishlaunchingwithoptions is complete

4127938
int	chars
even though isdigit receives an int as its only parameter it expects a chars value a byte number representing an ascii letter not a pure int as you are now using it

4127946
int	chars
although isdigit takes an int as an argument it checks the chars value of your variable

4127946
int	chars
gives you an int value not a chars value

4127951
cout	cin
try not to mix c libraries printf scanf etc. with c++ libraries cout and cin

4127960
int	chars
you re using scanf with d which will convert the digit s to an int but isdigit is intended to work with raw chars that have not been converted yet

4127960
int	chars
if you use it you d probably want to read a string then check whether all the chars entered were digits with isdigit and only after you ve done that would you try to convert to an int

4127980
cvs	svn
cvs svn i hate the differences showing 100 s of changes when there are only a handful due to the update in the comments for cvs info like log or id

4127981
int	chars
so you could use this on each chars of the the string representation of your int but your a is already an int as set by scanf_s

4127981
int	chars
once you have the string you can loop over every chars in it checking if it is a digit or you can use a library function like strtol to do this for you and return the int value checking afterwards that it consumed all the input when it did so to reject things like 123x

4127987
uilabel	uifont
for instance instantiating anything that attempts to use uifont uilabel for instance will explode messily segmentation fault or similar outside a running uiapplication

4128007
pop-up	dialog
i am trying to create a dialog pop-up box with 2 forms inside of it

4128007
pop-up	dialog
the pop-up works great but inside of the dialog i have 2 forms each with separate actions

4128034
ati	nvidia
hw acceleration works on xp but requires that you have a video card from nvidia ati or intel and the driver date must be post nov 2004

4128036
post	get
name is used during form submission to post get the values

4128049
jar	war
having the dom.jar in your classpath helps only eclipse in managing classpaths of class files when doing development but building your jar war ear files you have to manage your libraries which you can configure in eclipse too

4128061
typedef	struct
is this recursive - so suppose struct typedef a contains a field of typedef struct b

4128098
put	get
the next thing you have to look at is where does the backing object get put into the request scope

4128099
x86	64bit
if i reference both of them the installation only works on 64bit machines whereas referencing only the x86 version allows me to install on 32-bit machines

4128132
post	get
this post on stackoverflow shows how to get the autohide feature working

4128178
scrollable	panels
if i continue to tap on the drop down at the bottom of the panels the scrollable area will continue to expand indefinitely

4128187
fgets	strtol
use fgets then strtol strtoul etc

4128223
yacc	bison
if you re trying to implement anything that looks like a real programming language use a parser generator like yacc or bison

4128235
for-loop	loops
for example if i want to loops through every line of a file and want to use a for-loop i could do this

4128269
rss	feed
the site also has a sidebar where we would like to display the three most recent article titles from the pr s rss feed which is the same thing as the embedded iframe

4128269
rss	feed
i am using expressionengine if that makes any difference but the rss feed is external and not through ee

4128308
many-to-many	one-to-many
you have mapped the customer- address as a one-to-many relationship customer hasmany address in your fluent mapping but address- customer as a many-to-many

4128327
accessor	properties
when you use generated properties accessor they manage all the memory for you

4128327
accessor	properties
so in your code this would result in releasing the properties s previous object twice once directly by you and again by the properties accessor when setting it to nil

4128327
accessor	properties
you must either manage the properties directly or let the accessor manage the properties

4128327
accessor	properties
since you re using properties and generated accessor you should probably just stick with that and rewrite your delegate method

4128328
put	get
i m trying to get the list of my most recent statuses from facebook and put them on my website

4128328
rss	feed
the rss feed doesn t work so i look at api approach

4128367
min	max
from a practical point of view the main problem is in windows programming where microsoft s windows.h header defines zillions of non-uppercase macros including by default min and max which conflict with the c++ standard library

4128441
direct3d	directdraw
if anyone knows a more efficient way to use directdraw direct3d please comment

4128500
processors	hyperthreading	cpu	processors	cpu	hyperthreading
if the processors is slow enough and the disks are fast enough that zipping makes your cpu a bottleneck you ll make some gains on multicore or hyperthreading processors

4128503
int	chars
the idea is that 4 6 bit int require 24 bits or 3 chars

4128517
mouseup	mousedown
or you can do it your way and start a timer on mousedown then on mouseup end the timer and then see if it s more or less than 5 seconds

4128518
mouseleave	mouseenter
you don t want to use .hover because it will fire once for mouseenter and once for mouseleave

4128522
mouseup	mousedown
sure handle both the mousedown event and the mouseup event

4128522
mouseup	mousedown
start a timer on the mousedown and see how long it has run on the mouseup

4128548
put	get	post	get	post	put
if you pass the index to the form validation rule it works fine but to get the data into another var you need to first put the post array into a temp variable and then access that index

4128579
post	get
if you want to see the results of any given form post get request files you can point a form to

4128584
equals	gethashcode
i have a class person for which i have to override the equals and gethashcode method

4128645
put	get
i would like to get some opinions on when if it is ok to put code in codebehind

4128645
mef	prism
so the learning curve has been tremendous to say the least â learning wpf xaml c# unity prism mef .net mvvm etcâ fun but very challenging

4128659
uitableview	uisearchbar
you must have a containing view - it should be a subview of your detail-view and it should contain the uisearchbar and likely your uitableview

4128721
int	double
assuming that inta intb and intc are typed as int int32 then convert.todouble is basically the same as a simple cast to double

4128749
factors	matrix
this even factors in the possibility of a jagged array a matrix with an inconsistent number of rows in the column

4128764
actionscript	mxml
i m trying to set a specific list item in a mx combobox to have a custom item renderer the problem is that i cannot do this via mxml it needs to be done via actionscript at a later stage eg combobox gets created combobox gets populated user does other tasks combobox needs to set one or more items in the combobox to have icons via item renderer

4128773
google-chrome	safari
i was trying my script in google-chrome safari and ie8

4128829
mouse	keyboard
beside of this there re much better ways to simulate keyboard mouse events

4128877
textview	imageview
the way i try to do this is to put the two textview in a linearlayout then place the imageview and the linearlayout containing the text in a tablelayout with one row and two columns

4128897
keydown	keyup
therefore the keyup event sent by your code above will be sent at least 2.638 seconds later than the keydown event and not a millisecond sooner

4128913
cvs	svn
cvs svn

4128967
ant	maven
i would pick one of the more configurable build tools like ant or maven as a starting point

4129011
onreadystatechange	onload
you may be able to get at the data before the browser tries to parse the script by attaching onload and onreadystatechange events to the script element

4129036
pop-up	dialog
i started using visual studio 2010 and am missing the dialog box that used pop-up in visual studio 2008 and earlier that would warn you if there are build errors

4129055
xsl-fo	xslt
you can use saxon to perform an xslt transform creating the xsl-fo but you will still need an xsl-fo processor to create the pdf from the xsl-fo

4129055
xsl-fo	xslt
xslt transform to create the xsl-fo

4129055
xsl-fo	xslt
learning the xsl-fo at the same time you re learning xslt is going to be tough but i will show you two ways to output an svg in a pdf

4129055
xsl-fo	xslt
xsl-fo created by saxon from svg input and xslt stylesheet

4129062
vsto	add-in
you could write a little vsto add-in that hooks into the file save process and instead of saving the file via word saves whatever portion of the file you want into your own xml format

4129113
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome safari both default to tabbed browsing even without that property set

4129116
int	double
of course as mentioned by many if the values are just int then a double cast will suffice

4129116
int	double
assuming the inputs are int and not huge then if you premultiply inta by intc before doing the divide you can eliminate one double operation as int intc can be safely done at int precision

4129116
int	double
it s not a lot different from the accepted answer but on some platforms could perform slightly better by using an int multiply instead of a double one

4129147
min	max
for less memory but more processing time you could simply sum the deltas computing the min and max as you go

4129147
min	max
that has the potential of throwing off your results but if you are primarily concerned with the statistics generated based on the invidivual iteration measurements then you can just do the min and max calculation outside of the time delta check

4129148
int	double
the other converts can t fail as any int can be represented as a double

4129148
int	double
so you could write it using casts with no change in meaning and exploit the fact that in an expression involving int and double the int are cast to double automatically

4129160
mongodb	bson
bson is its own format built specifically for mongodb

4129187
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
my code seems to work in firefox google-chrome and safari but not in ie tested in ie9 beta not sure about other ie versions

4129197

i think i could get it to work if i can find a way to hide the checkbox but still show its label

4129202
pop-up	dialog
i would simply like to use publish.stream to post to facebook from an iphone app but without using the uiwebview that pop-up when you call the facebook object s dialog method

4129296
rss	feed
it s because you re trying to use the api feed as if it were an rss feed

4129304
libcurl	typhoeus
you might want to look at ntlm authentication for ruby with typhoeus and libcurl then look into using typhoeus instead of rest-client

4129328
min	max
to this end you can compute the min max or k outliers and standard deviation

4129328
for-loop	loops
if the operation is so tiny that the overhead of a for-loop matters measuring the speed of multiplication then use manual loops unrolling

4129328
min	max
for myself i wrote a little class for gathering min max mean and standard deviation which could be used for benchmarks or other statistics

4129347
maven	pom.xml
once the artifact has a pom.xml maven shouldn t need to check anymore

4129355
opera	firefox

4129360
internationalization	globalization
have a look at the sample solution here in the code base for an excellent example of how to do internationalization or globalization with spark

4129385
folder	directory
to find it i use directory.getcurrentdirectory but it returns the testresults out folder where there is not my xml file although it has in properties copy to output directory

4129394
interpolation	splines
i m not sure which interpolation you want but either the splines or rbf in scipy.interpolate will be more appropriate

4129466
scheme	prolog	erlang	scheme
languages close to erlang are prolog and scheme

4129466
haskell	ocaml
anything statically typed ocaml haskell java c# c++ and so on are definitely beyond the horizon

4129469
screens	tablet
it s just tablet or slightly larger screens devices where this is happening

4129482
uiview	calayer
your compass2 should be a uiview of some sort and its layer should be a calayer object

4129500
pull	push
you could work with dvcs in a way that you could have a master repository where you could push changes and pull changes from just like a client-server vcs subversion with the added advantage that you could work offline

4129532
chunked	transfer-encoding
transfer-encoding chunked

4129552
spaces	delimiter
words within phrases are delimiter by spaces

4129561
screens	tablet	width	height
it is quite possible that those large devices tablet have much larger screens width and height than a typical phone

4129561
width	height
anyways i ll share a function i wrote that will resize a bitmap to your desired width and height so you can calculate this based off of the screen size then have it re-scaled

4129561
mdpi	hdpi
of course all this is doing is scaling it so make sure you have appropriate mdpi hdpi versions

4129588
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i have test it on ubuntu with firefox google-chrome opera latest versions and does not work

4129598

nvidia fx composer there was also amd formerly ati rendermonkey but it looks like that s been shelved.

4129600
oncreate	ondestroy
when an orientation change occurs ondestroy is called and the activity will be created again using oncreate

4129616
serializable	deserialization
well if you need only serializable deserialization behavior without involving wcf or remoting there is a plenty ways

4129637
post	get
my problem is that in the repository to get user i make a call to the post repository to get all the user post

4129637
post	get
in the repository to get post i also make a call to the user repository to get the poster

4129735
for-loop	arrays
instead of have a for-loop to read and assign the value to a new arrays

4129745
google-chrome	firefox
this happens on firefox and google-chrome

4129759
width	height
for example if the user put a video from youtube ok i can write code to limit its width height

4129766
h.264	webm	vp8	ogg
there are three formats with a reasonable level of support h.264 mpeg-4 avc ogg theora vp3 and webm vp8

4129802
pull	push
i use push and pull to keep them in sync and if i lose one it s likely i ve not lost any of the changes in it

4129806
draggable	droppable
basically all classes drag are draggable and droppable

4129814
width	height
to get the width and height of the video you can use the console tool ffmpeg

4129829
google-chrome	firefox
i have a page that works on firefox and google-chrome

4129866
nsurl	nsstring
in the code i originally posted i generated an nsurl from an nsstring and stored that in a property

4129866
nsurl	nsstring
by storing my file location as an nsstring instance variable and then creating a new nsurl each time from that string and passing this fresh nsurl to my newly allocated avaudiorecorder it works and does not produce these leaks

4129889
profiling	debugging
which seems to indicate i ve mis-identified the problem - it s not that the profiling is improving things it s that debugging in the ide is killing it.

4129903
getter	setter
for more information on private members and getter and setter

4129945
oncreate	ondestroy
i would think i need to load all bitmaps and sounds outside the actual game activity to prevent from having to unload and reload them everytime ondestroy and oncreate is called for example like when the phone goes to sleep or everytime a new level is chose from the level select screen

4129972
google-chrome	firefox
you could look at the source of web browsers like google-chrome or firefox

4129986
integer	unsigned
on your implementation evidently unsigned int is a 32 bit integer occupying 4 bytes

4130001
exslt	libxslt
php s xslt using libxslt should support extensions like exslt s date difference wherever the docs say that they re implemented by libxslt.

4130014
pylons	pyramid
i ve been developing in pylons for a little while now and have recently learned they re merging with another framework to create pyramid

4130060
mathml	mathjax
i m trying to display the less-than sign using mathjax to render mathml input.

4130071
width	height
it does seem to support rotation on tags like div p or h1 but i noticed that when i first tried doing this the symbol disappeared because you need to define a height and width large enough so that the rotated element will fit inside

4130071
width	height
you might be able to find another html text tag that rotates properly in webkit or do some javascript to determine the height and width of the text you need to rotate.

the official docs for these methods is under responding to touch events in the uiresponder class docs uiview inherited those methods since it s a subclassing of uiresponder

4130646
post	get
i know the basic difference between get and post methods

4130646
post	get
that is we can see the url parameters in case of get and can t see the url parameters in case of post

4130646

other implementation differences in get and post

4130727

not really considering that a double can be a much higher magnitude than an int

4130727
int	double
you wouldn t want to overflow an int with the large value that a double could be

4130727
int	double
so you could have a double that is 3 000 000 000.50 and floor it which would overflow the max value of an int

4130815
qtreewidget	qtreeview
i would recommend using a qtreewidget which inherits qtreeview

4130816
atomic	interlocked
you can perform some operations interlocked causing the read and write to be one atomic operation but i don t believe that bitwise logic falls into the set of operations that can be performed in this manner

4130824
vb.net	vb6
if this indeed is the case then my suggestion would be to recompile the vb6 code as a vb.net and you might have to make some changes to the code as the two platforms are not absolutely identical and expose it using comvisible as a com object and use p invoke to consume the current c++ code which is fairly similar to the way currently your vb6 code consumes it

4130825

4131272
post	get
if you scope out those post you can get a general idea about how to go about it

4131292
put	get
mainly nsanimationcontext doesn t have a callback completion mechanism like catransaction does so i had to put the thing there to explicitly get the view s animation and set the delegate so a callback gets triggered

4131307

as far as passing values to a controller action are concerned you can pass them in the request get post put delete or route in this case the model binder will automatically bind them to action parameters

4131438
mouseup	mousedown
i bet they actually use window to capture all the mouse gestures they care about i assume mousedown and mouseup

4131438
mouseup	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown
if you re absolute-positioning the elements you could detect mousedown mousemove and mouseup figure out the span elements mouse is over or nearest to and fill in a textarea with the contents of all content between those two elements

4131438
mouseup	mousedown
it only does mousedown and mouseup and it doesn t work in ie i don t feel like debugging it

4131440

hypersql	hsqldb
stop press according to their documentation hypersql hsqldb supports assertions though i m left wondering why they don t shout about it on their list of features

4131726
fink	macports
if so be careful not to mix packages between fink and macports

4131726
fink	macports
it would be safest to remove all of the fink packages and install macports versions

4131728
children	parent	inherited	properties
after all that you ll still need to check for inherited - go through each of the parent of the element in question and look for properties that can be inherited and add them to this list if they re not already set on the children

4131728
inherited	properties
this also means that you ll need to maintain a set of properties that inherited

4132066
codeblocks	codelite
nice-to-have i don t really care for ide project file generation like cmake does for visual studio because ides versions and compatibily change and there are a ton of nice ides out there for c c++ codeblocks codelite eclipse cdt - all of these are portable on thumb drive vs is not but nice-to-have would be makefile integration - a makefile that that simply calls this build tool s own makefile script - seen something similar for scons

4132353
puts	gets
this procedure recursively gets all lefth and righth values and puts it into separate strings

4132398

following on from that if i have a static synchronized method in such a class is it only synchronized among threads within the web-app it exists in but not synchronized against the same method in the same class in a different jar file in a different war file

4132569
salt	md5
you re using a salt excellent idea and you re making it extremely difficult to decrypt the information the md5 key is good

expander	togglebutton
the solution which i have got so far does that by binding the expander s isexpanded state to the togglebutton s ischecked state

4132893
width	height
also i noticed that video.google uses only and inline css for width height

4132932
expander	togglebutton
this works by setting up a onewaytosource binding between the ischecked property of the togglebutton the binding will be set against the source when the target value changes and uses an imultivalueconverter to translate the single value into one for each of the expander s

4132933
integer	unsigned
convert an integer from -128 to 127 a byte into a 8 bit unsigned int represented as an integer

4132940

swt	swing
swing and swt have some data binding support based on java beans which isn t ideal

4133066
sorting	grouping
however while hashed-file databases excel at low-overhead nearly instant retrieval based on a key value they tend to be poor performers at sorting large grouping of records on an attribute because the data are not stored physically in any meaningful order and gathering the records can involve much thrashing

4133111
datediff	difference
you can calculate the date difference between the start and end date in either sql or crystal - i suggest using sqlserver s datediff function

4133121
post	get
there is way to much code to post the whole solution but this should get you started

portrait	landscape
i want the second view to always be open in portrait view.in my case when i launch in landscape the view is in portrait but the device is in landscape mode

4133280
portrait	landscape
the output i expected was if i open the view in portrait and and on rotating it to landscape with no rotation

4133280
portrait	landscape
if you open the app in portrait and if you given auto-rotate as no.then if you rotate the device to landscape then there will be no rotation in output.i want the same effect when loading a view initially in landscape

4133548
formview	detailsview
there are also other controls you can use like detailsview and formview but honestly i never use them because by the time you add in complexity like transactions and custom validations and all that it can be a pain and i think it is just easier to handle all the code manually for the edit and insert unless it is a really simple situation

4133566
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome and opera it is fine in case of there is a slight problem when the page loads the div appears straight for some time after that it rotates to specified rotation value

put	get
honestly while i get a feeling of why 4 was put in place to avoid delaying the distribution of one company indefinitely i think it could be expressed otherwise to consider the first and last day of distribution as being special since on the first day you typically take what s left by the previous company and on last day you distribute what s left

hash	salt
a salt is a piece of public data which you hash with the password in order to prevent sharing

4134391
hash	salt
the salt is a public data element which alters the hashing process one could say that the salt selects the hash function among a whole set of distinct functions

4134391
hash	salt
the attacker can no longer share cracking efforts because any precomputed table would have to use a specific salt and would be useless against a password hash with a distinct salt

4134391
hash	salt
the salt must be used to verify a password hence the server must store for each hash password the salt value which was used to hash that password

4134391
hash	salt
or you could concatenate the salt and the hash password in a single blob

4134391
hash	salt
the point of the salt is to be as much as possible unique to each hash password

4134722
subclass	abstract-class
edit one more use case of using def over val is when an abstract-class has a val for which the value should be provided by a subclass

4134728
hash	salt
that way when you are checking the password against the hash all you have to do is hash the input with the salt again and the resulting hash should be the same as what came out before

4134730
hash	salt
for example by saving the salt to a user table along with the username and hash password

4139444
portrait	landscape
resize scale your image to 20x20 and your image should look correct in both portrait and landscape

google-chrome	firefox
another solution i can think of is to have an ajax call that checks to see if a session variable called do_refresh has been set every second and if it has refresh the browser and then writing a script that appends |do_refresh onto the end of all the php session files when you want to reload but that doesn t raise the browser to the foreground which is what i wanted because i have 4 monitors so having code on the first google-chrome on the second ie 8 9 on the third and firefox on the fourth and having them all come up when i make a change to my code is really nice but if you re running with 1 or 2 monitors you may not actually want the windows to come into focus

4143446
put	get
therefore i need to somehow get the application s bitness and put it in a launch condition

4143486
int	double
although bigdecimal solutions are more flexible here s a simpler solution using int and double

4143497
google-chrome	firefox
it works as a native plugin for firefox there is also a lite version for google-chrome but i don t think this can track js files

4143504
pull	push
i plan on supporting all built-in commands so that you can commit update push pull check incoming and outgoing clone etc

4143507
put	get	post	get	post	put
still having a httpservlet without having doget dopost seems a bit pointless since servlet can only communicate with the a limited number of request methods such as get post delete put for more see specification section 5.1.1

4143596
spaces	delimiter
the delimiter is s+ that is any kind and any number of spaces

4143624

4143757
put	get
3 as long as you put the cookiejar somewhere on your filesystem that others can t get arbitrary access to you should be fine - for example you probably want to put it somewhere outside the webroot

4143792
direct3d	gdi
in recent windows version vista and 7 one can see a preview of any window content in the taskbar whether its gdi direct3d or opengl

4143806
queue	fifo
his technique implements a fifo queue that is on delay -- it holds what we just sent to the buffer

4143806
queue	fifo
the delayed fifo queue does not hold pixel data it holds shape primitives which might be pixels in your application but it could also be lines rectangles easy-to-draw things because they are just shapes no unnecessary data is allowed

4143806
queue	fifo
based on the contents of the fifo queue i know what the monitor looks like at the moment

4143806
queue	fifo
i compare my desired output to erase or draw new primitives with the fifo queue and only change values that need to be changed updated

4143806
queue	fifo
the fifo queue contains a lot of information the previous state or the current stuff on monitor or time-based polling device

4143806
queue	fifo
a conditional bit is added to every slot that can hold a primitive in the fifo queue

4143806
mouse	keyboard
only instead of installing it to your hdd and running it through your processor you buy a brand-new board that holds the entirety of the game and takes as input mouse keyboard and takes as output monitor

4143817
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the externalinterface works on ie6 7 8 firefox google-chrome safari etc

4143824
put	get	post	get	post	put
my understanding if i got you correct is you want your http get post put delete to call your doservice method

4143824
implements	extends
if you extends httpservlet you don t have to override doget and dopost as it s already implements by httpservlet

4143958
post	get
i m afraid there is no simple answer to this but the simplest way to do this that i can think of is write a simple script that will make get post requests maybe even using wget and run it on a farm on amazon ec2 or something like that so you can truly reach the max capacity of your infrastructure

4144062
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i am trying to display display .xls file data in a browser prefer ie firefox google-chrome and safari as a web content

4144075
watij	webdriver
i can see the usage of watin and watij reducing as more developers move to selenium 2.0 webdriver which will offer the same functionality as watir using a different api and multiple programming languages

4144093
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
by default itâ s not possible to have two sqldatareader s open at the same time sharing the same sqlconnection object

4144149

i use entity-relationship modeling and entity-relationship diagram

4144179
post	get
i m posting another answer so i can post some code that doesn t get garbled

4144230
public	protected
but i needed that variable and its uses in the game for some functionality of the game.so that time i declared the variable in public previously it was a protected variable and every thing worked perfectly fine

4144230
public	protected
i am very surprised to see this unusual behavior whenever i declare the variable as protected there is problem but if i copy and paste in public the problem is solved. the variable is only being used in the class where it is declared so there should not be any problem

4144236
button	checkbox
what i m looking to happen is for the user to be able to select certain items from the repeater using the checkbox and process them perform some data operations on those items on clicking a button which is outside the repeater

4144282
min	max
max length of list is min m-i+1 n-j+1 min m n

4144302
portrait	landscape
you could do this through code or through using the native behaviour of how landscape and portrait layout xml files are chosen based on the screen rotation

4144321
put	get
i have a configuration activity and i want to put a cancel button that when user press this button the configuration window get s closed and turn back into the previous activity

4144469
put	get	post	get	post	put
also the method parameter to link_to tells it which http method post get delete put to use

4144494
pop-up	dialog
i would expect the click event of div1 below to pop-up a dialog stating div1 but it pop-up s div2

4144514
innodb	myisam
don t worry if these figures don t match the myisam example as innodb estimates the cardinalities so they wont be exactly the same

4144514
innodb	myisam
the stored procedure is exactly the same as the myisam example above but selects data from the innodb table instead

4144514
innodb	myisam
based on the cursor example above i would expect the innodb version to out-perform the myisam one

4144514
innodb	myisam
in my simplified system the myisam table doesnt perform too badly so it might not be worth migrating to innodb

4144527
multiplying	division
you can first divide a by c and also get the reminder of the division and multiplying the reminder with b before dividing it by c

4144527
multiplying	addition	multiplying	subtraction	subtraction	addition
another approach would be to loop addition and subtraction instead of multiplying and dividing but that is of course a lot more work

4144528
nullpointerexception	classcastexception
i have succesfully recovered my existing workspace from a totally messed up situation all kinds of core components giving nullpointerexception s and classcastexception and the like by using this procedure

4144528
cvs	svn
if your projects are in cvs svn etc synchronize them

4144541
post	put
also if it s wordpress you probably rewrite post s urls somehow - if the script is in your domain s root directory you should put before filename if it s in a template directory try what nick pyett proposed

4144547
post	get
however as soon as i change the type from get to post i receive a 405 method not allowed error

4144600
windows	wow64
what i ve found however is that my 32-bit app in windows 7 running under wow64 thread a calling suspendthread on thread b can pause it while it s running 64-bit code which i would expect is not user-mode code

4144600
put	get
if i put a breakpoint at the instruction which the above returns to and then get the thread to resume i found that the esp changes back to the value before the x86switchto64bitmode call which is the correct stack pointer

4144620
opera	firefox
if you go to view - developer tools and check opera dragonfly you will see dragonfly open in the bottom of the browser which appears to have similar capabilities to firebug for firefox dom browser network monitor script debugger etc

4144625
bmp	png	gif	bmp	gif	png
i ve tried various different image formats png jpg gif bmp and none of them display correctly

4144637
managed	loaderlock
the loaderlock managed debugging assistant mda detects attempts to execute managed code on a thread that holds the microsoft windows operating system loader lock

4144637

now to get the application to run in debug mode you can disabled the loaderlock mda in debug exceptions interface by pressing ctrl+d e then open managed debugging assistants tree and uncheck loader lock

4144648
gmail	hotmail
for example flag everything in this wikipedia list as free heck i would think covering gmail hotmail yahoo aol would cover a huge of users anyway

4144678
keydown	keyup
i m having the same issue - keyup and keydown events are being fired twice though their handlers are bound only once and i m definitely attaching them to only one element

4144780
innodb	myisam
so far optimization has included adding indexes switching between myisam and innodb but no luck

4144781
post	get
instead to process post and get parameters and generate html i want to receive soap messages to process it and to return response as soap message again

4144956
division	multiplication
the algorithm is basically ancient egyptian multiplication of a with the fraction floor b c + b c c with the slash denoting real division here

4144970
hide	show
the show and hide methods are handy and easy but in my opinion managing state appearance by class name is really a much more powerful and maintainable way to do things

4144975
min	max
you need the 3 images for the min max normal close buttons referenced in the images as images min.png images max.png images normal.png images close.png

4144980
move	drag
when user move drag change the position of the 1st page window mainwindow.xaml then user click on next button to proceed to 2nd page process.xaml the window process.xaml is not at the same position as the mainwindow.xaml that the user move to earlier on

4144983
hide	show
- show the element restoring the display from before hide or restoring the default display for the element type

4144994
jobs	cron
if you have many deletes run two cron jobs one ascending and one descending

4144994
jobs	cron
better yet have the purge jobs running in an endless loop started once per day by cron

4145000
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
the real catch is it does not work in google-chrome and firefox but it does work in ie8 and opera

4145000
google-chrome	firefox
when we right-click on the textbox or calendar elements in google-chrome or firefox nothing happens

4145000
google-chrome	firefox
hence it seems as if a right-click action on a disabled form does not work in google-chrome and firefox

4145000
google-chrome	firefox
the real issue seems to be the oncontextmenu attribute of the div around it not reacting properly when clicking on a disabled form element in firefox google-chrome

4145004
width	height
the funny thing is width and height are getting set in the style property of the iframe

4145021
maven	pom.xml
the maven pom.xml schema is version 4.0.0

4145030
calloc	malloc
malloc the closest is calloc which will initialize all your allocated memory to zero

4145036
google-chrome	firefox
so the behaviour shown by google-chrome and firefox kind of makes sense imo

4145062
int	chars
fno int 4 fname chars 30 ftype int 4

4145132
int	chars
the trick is to convert each digit of the int into a chars

4145153
innodb	myisam
cache table is using myisam engine and master table is using innodb engine

4145297
http.sys	httplistener
i ve been trying to do some testing with the http.sys httplistener on my workstation and it seems that there is some limit in place that prevents more that 1000 concurrent connections

4145297
http.sys	httplistener
i seem to have missed that using http.sys httplistener begingetcontext isn t very good for concurrent connections as the new begingetcontext will only fire after the response stream from the prior request has closed

4145331
folder	directory
spath and npath are absolute paths to folder so being in another directory should not matter

4145342
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout and setinterval are exactly the same speed they are different statements though

4145342
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout will run your function after the timeout setinterval will run it continuously after a set amount of time between each run

4145387
folder	directory
however i get an error when i try to run it on cron saying that no file is in the directory referring to the code within mypythonfile that refers to the other files in the folder

4145393
content-length	content-type
however remember to send the correct content-type and content-length headers

4145398
getter	setter
as a rule of thumb use always the setter and getter provided by cocoa with one exception dealloc

4145398
subclass	accessor
the reason to avoid accessor in dealloc is that if there are observers or an override in a subclass that triggers behavior it ll be triggered from dealloc which is pretty much never what you want because the state of the object will be inconsistent

4145398
accessor	properties
if you are only targeting 64bit macs you can use properties to generate both accessor methods and the instance variable itself

4145402
mouseup	mousedown
if you replace mouseup with mousedown will fire on scroll bar also in all browsers

4145457
googletest	cppunit
you might want to take a look at cppunit or googletest for unit testing with c++

4145463
width	height
you shouldn t be moving self.view you should be moving the frame of the menu and you only need to move the center since that will effect the frame position i m assuming your width height of the frame isn t supposed to change

4145472
uilabel	uibutton
you will need an uilabel to display the time an uibutton to start and stop the timer

4145491
tiff	bmp
a number of formats is supported including bmp tiff and psd

4145598
folder	directory
example if your web root is var www html you might make a separate directory for the xml file s like var www xml now this folder is not assessable from the url but you can link the file s to be called from your php script on successful session authentication

4145609
width	height
so basicelly each rectangle can be defined by center-x center-y width height and angle

4145610
width	height
they currently use a pricing matrix in the form of a two way table with height and width along each axis in a spreadsheet that lets you look up price

4145610
width	height
since the pricing grids they use are up to 19x17 i realise that i would need a 3 column table width height price with 323 19x17 rows for every permutation of the available height and widths and it s corresponding price but is there a less longwinded way to achieve this without manually entering each possible width and height combination

4145668
webclient	webrequest
webclient uses webrequest.create to obtain the request response implementation that will ultimately supply the stream and that s an extensible mechanism - .net has 5 built-in implementations of webrequest and it offers an extensibility mechanism that lets you register additional handlers

4145699
versioning	upgrade
a while later comes up a question do i want to also upgrade to the versioning 4 of .net framework

4145717
vsto	add-in
a vsto add-in

4145729
wan	lan
i find that on a lan things are faster without compression compression takes more time than xfer and on a wan it s the reverse

4145750
children	parent
you can create one parent work item like product backlog item or pbi in scrum then create two children work items from it which will be like tasks or sprint backlog item then assgin to two teams

4145758
powerpc	i386
the architecture is set to standard 32 64-bit valid architectures include i386 powerpc ppc64 ppc7400 ppc970 x86_64 and build active architecture only is turned off

4145762
width	height
price table - foreign keys to both width and height table keys and corresponding price

4145762
width	height
now to insert your data into the database directly without manually entering each width and height combination by importing data from an excel sheet to a temporary table and writing appropriate sql scripts to insert data to height width and price tables

4145769
innodb	myisam
the solution should work on the latest version of mysql and may use either the innodb or myisam engine

4145789
fink	macports
ok so after a day of messing about with various things such as fink macports pecl etc

4145794
maven	pom.xml

4145841
children	parent
it ll allow you to push that configuration information down to the children pom.xml files from the parent pom.xml

4145871
mouseover	mousedown
the reason i want to get rid of it is that every so often i will move my mousedown toward the bottom of the screen and when i mouseover this area the mouse jumps all the way to the top-left of my screen

4145894
buttonclick	linkbutton
there you do an entirely new pageload but your original buttonclick that generates the link never happened now so the linkbutton is never made and the event can not be thrown

4145918
memcmp	strcmp
memcmp isn t intended to compare strings that would be strcmp

4145918
strlen	strcmp
strcmp and strlen can cause weird behaviour with bad c-style strings not ending with 0 or null

4145979
onclick	onchange
you may want to use the onchange event instead of onclick

4145980
uiview	subviews
i am bit stack with creating two uiview which are switchable each uiview has some of subviews

4145980

4146066
queue	fifo
queue - fifo used for sequntial processing of data

4146126
freemarker	velocity
velocity and freemarker are both quite capable

4146126
freemarker	velocity
velocity s syntax is simpler and more distinct freemarker s heavier syntax allows them to support jsp libs

4146126
freemarker	velocity
freemarker provides much better native whitespace handling recent velocity releases provide more interesting content controls #define #evaluate # literal block #

4146126
freemarker	velocity
stringtemplate is also respectable though they are mvc nazis and can t match velocity or freemarker for features

4146131
factors	matrix
these are hence not the same factors as one would obtain by using f ml with f the factors matrix m the original matrix and l the loading matrix

4146141
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
if you already use a a vs setup project you can deploy the new versioning of this project and it will upgrade existing installation

4146152
vb6	vba
so i never got into detailed error processing too much when i played in vba vb6 a lot

4146183
hide	show
i want to make it easier to track when the software keyboard hide and show so that i can resize content in my view

4146214
client-side	server-side
we determined the simplest solution was to call the javascript function from the client-side rather than try to do it from the server-side

4146250
pop-up	dialog
to prevent the pop-up forms go to list settings- advanced settings and turn off the dialog

4146266

shim	polyfills
html5 cross-browser polyfills is a very useful and long list of shim fallbacks and polyfills that add html5 features to browsers that don t support them

4146355
move	drag
one of the most short-term feature i would like to borrow from flex is their animated drag and drop and animated automatic reordering of components cell phone examples hide one the 2 others move side-by-side or when you drag elements in a window it move the others around in a fluid and logical fashion versus zk that looks nice but statically move boxes or information around and

4146356
public	protected
the problem is that in all of my files i m using class-only modifiers such as private public protected and fb sometimes protests regarding these

4146416
bash	zsh
this uses bash or ksh or zsh process substitution but you could create temporary files that are sorted if you re using a shell that doesn t support that

4146440
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
why don t you open it up as a fileinputstream and dump the contents over into a fileoutputstream

4146451
gmail	hotmail
however in hotmail and gmail this blue underline persists regardless of what color the text is

4146488

for instance i want the first controller to be plugged in to represent player 2 if player 1 opts to use keyboard mouse input

4146496
macports	homebrew
you may also be advised to use macports or even better homebrew

macports	homebrew
if you are already using macports and nothing works anymore you may even want to uninstall it and start from scratch with homebrew

4146545
put	get
i get an error when using razor helpers in an mvc 3 project did put the cshtml file in app_code

4147140
typemock	moles
also consider tools such as typemock or moles which can mock things without an interface - but bear in mind that s cheating and you won t get an improved design so should be a last resort

4147156
uilabel	uitextview
coretext is simply not compatible with normal uilabel uitextview s or uistringdrawing so you can t mix them

4147168
gdal	mapnik
gdal geos libproj4 mapnik i don t know what

4147189
nunit	moq	mbunit	nunit
i suggest you to use nunit or mbunit as a testing framework and moq as a mocking framework more clear in it s outputs than rhino mocks

4147197
public	protected
2 - i think that not using one of the public protected private keyword in a class s function declaration is a mistake

4147210
superclass	subclassing
if you do not specify an transactionattribute on a superclass those methods use the default regardless of how subclassing maybe annotated

4147223
width	height
you need to get rid of the wrap_content properties and just have the fixed width and height as so

vb.net	vb6
the vb.net upgrade wizard converts the vb6 input # statement like this

4147456
vb.net	vb6
converting from vb6 to vb.net requires substantial edits in the code base i would expect turbobasic to be even more demanding

4147459
x86	64bit
a 64bit application can t load the same 32-bit version of the dll that was loaded when running as x86 so you have to be pointing to a different dll

4147480
google-chrome	firefox
it works in ie8 google-chrome firefox but not in ie7

4147495
post	get
i d recommend creating links that pass in a url parameter such as ... catid 232 ... so that when the person clicks on that particular link you can parse the parameters in the url and get the exact post based on id or even do further filtering by passing in other fields as needed

4147532

gprof has a lot of problems listed here and according to the google-perftools manual some of the same issues are repeated there such as reporting procedures not lines emphasizing self local time emphasizing the graph etc

4147562
x86	mips
now if you had a binary file that only contains two 8-bit bytes in the system s native byte ordering little-endian for x86 big endian for mips pa-risc 680x0 then the hexdump would look like

4147562
x86	64bit
i m using a 64bit system little endian x86 so i wanted to be explicit so the your results should match assuming little-endian

4147579
versioning	upgrade
i tried recreating your error and failed so it might be you need to upgrade your versioning of node

4147584
getter	setter
i prefer using setter and getter because it allows you to manually wire up the object when you re not running it in a spring context setting mocks in a unit test

4147695

postgresql	mysql
depending on how complex these calculations are it sounds like you want a custom database view supported i believe by sqlite mysql postgresql and oracle at least used in conjunction with a model with

4149201
mongoid	activemodel
the mongoid documentation says that each model includes activemodel validation which i thought would allow them to work with my custom validations

4149257
superclass	subclassing
it will be difficult to maintain if you do require different behaviour for each subclassing so you should think about whether you can move some logic into the carn classes or the car superclass and remove the dependency

4149277

4149380
irc	xmpp
i m comparing between irc xmpp and a third proprietary server i have

4149457
google-chrome	firefox
i m wondering if something is wrong with this svg file since i can not view it in firefox or google-chrome map of texas highlighting tarrant county

4149465
inherited	properties
i would expect the first class would be one class and the second would be an inherited class which keeps track of which class it s instancing and if it s own properties is not set queries the parent object

4149469
width	height
i end up getting it to expand in width to 100 but in terms of height it is just 3 pixels high and there is a scrollbar to scroll to the bottom

4149508
post	get
i know very little about wordpress- is there an easy way to get the raw text of a post

4149533
super	extends
if you want pagecenter to access a protected attribute from pageindex using the super keyword then you should extends from pageindex

4149543
super	extends
super in your pagecenter class is referring to flowpanel because that is what it is extends

4149549
width	height
i decided how many pixels in width the border would be based on the screen width and height passed in on onsizechanged

4149549
width	height
then with columns and rows set to 10 that would leave 10 pixels left for both height and width

4149549
width	height
no matter what screen size is passed in i store exactly how many pixels in width the boarder is and the height width of each square on the board

4149549
screens	tablet
meaning if i create 3 different background bitmaps once for each density won t they still be resized to fit each devices screens resolution because from what i read there were not just 3 screens resolutions but 5 and now with tablet - even more

4149549
width	height
so far the examples i have looked at just show how to scale the overall bitmap and get the overall bitmaps width and height

4149549
width	height
i might not be able to find the exact width height and location of each playable square within a single scaled bitmap but by looking at the snake example in the sdk i see it doesn t create 1 bitmap for the entire board and scale it based on the screen dimensions - instead it creates a bitmap for each tile and then scales the tile based on the screen resolution and the number of tiles wanted on the screen - just like i do when i draw the board manually

4149549
width	height
i probably will have to do a similar approach for the borders so i can detect their width height as well after scaling

4149549
width	height
i detected the width and height of the screen through onsizechanged

4149549
width	height
now in order to detect how many pixels wide the border was scaled to and how many pixels in height width the squares were scaled to i first calculated how much the over all image was scaled

4149552
width	height
then you can give it 100 width and or height inside the body using css

4149657
width	height
it gets the inner window width rather reliably and then sets the image width height

4149660
for-loop	loops
imagine the scenario where a starts the for-loop and gets to the first line in loops before getting interrupted

4149671
for-loop	arrays
alternatively you can iterate over the arrays elements using a for-loop

4149701
margin	height
i need some jquery to re-calculate the height of the sidepanel div and the apply the appropriate negative margin to keep the div centered

4149701
margin	height
i have not worked on the calculation to set the negaitve margin to half of the height but this is not giving me the height value i m looking for

4149704
httphandler	httpmodule
if it does then check to see if it is setting a system.web httpmodule or httphandler or system.web identity impersonate or something like that and the application pool is running in integrated mode

4149704
httphandler	httpmodule
so what you need to do is either remove the offending httpmodule httphandler impersonate setting or change the application pool to run as classic or add the same configuration your site includes which is validation validateintegratedmodeconfiguration false

the main one or at least the one on launch is in on landscape mode then if you go to any other view is in portrait

4149717
portrait	landscape
the problem comes when you try to go back to the first one landscape the view appears in portrait therefore all view is wrong displayed

4149729
margin	height
try setting the margin to the window s height minus the div s height all divided by two

4149795
stdout	stderr
if your application is built with the use multi-byte character set configuration option you can use cstdiofile to write to either stdout or stderr

4149815
width	height
then set the size of your iframe in pixels based on the height and width

4149815
width	height
you may have to add a bit to the height and width to account for margins

4149866
portrait	landscape
if you want to rotate to portrait and then back to landscape just return yes

4149874
required	placeholder
of course this required that you have a header placeholder in your masterpage

4150007
width	margin
decrease the margin with the same amount of pixels you increase the border width with

4150026
inherited	properties
the object.create new date .getdate case is different the problem there is that the implementation of the getdate method relies on the internal time properties of the object it s called on which it cannot access because that particular properties is not inherited along the prototype chain

4150030
width	height
change the width and height of the element by twice the amount of the border-width change live demo

i want to be able to switch from one file to another in the eclipse editor in the java perspective from the keyboard and bind those key combinations to buttons on my mouse

4150097
recv	epoll
just because epoll returns pollin doesn t mean there will be data available to read since recv may just return the error from the non-blocking connect call

4150097
recv	epoll
i think epoll returns all the registered events with pollerr to make sure the program calls send recv etc

4150155
hide	show
if you call hide the window will vanish like it would when you call close but you ll be able to reshow it later by calling show again

the reason why your example fails is that it will try to evaluate the data source and call the dates function and min and max operators when you define the query but the data source doesn t contain any data at that point

4156428
min	max
a workaround would be to have your dates method actually receive the observablecollection and call min max itself

4156448
put	get
datastore can get put serializable just fine

4156498
int	chars
istream get is not the right method to use as it reads chars not int

4156515
put	get
from past experience i know that the moment you put an app out there in first week you get 100s of downloads and i dont want that to happen until my beta testing is finished

jlabel	jinternalframe
i have a jinternalframe which contains a jlabel

uiview	calayer
if you re eventually using the calayer with a uiview then the delegate must be the view object itself

maven	pom.xml
they have tag developers in pom.xml and link the maven team on site

4156620
google-chrome	firefox
i have the following form working just fine in google-chrome but doesn t seem to work in firefox

4156657
ienumerable	ilist
hashset has a constructor that takes an ienumerable so you need merely pass the list into this constructor as ilist derives from ienumerable

4156672
width	height
keep in mind that textures width and height needs to be a power of 2 on iphone ipad platform

4156680

ant	maven
i strongly suggest you utilise ant with ivy s dependency managment or use maven or any otehr build tool that has dependency management

4156717
nexus	artifactory
with either of those i d use a artifact repository maanger such as nexus or artifactory as well so you have the one true source for your internally built artifacts

4156722
google-chrome	firefox
since google-chrome and ie does look at the root directory for a favicon.ico it appeared to work but i didn t notice until now that firefox wasn t loading up the favicon

put	get
normally during my build process i use adsiedit to navigate to that object and then go through all the security tabs to get down to put a checkmark next to

4156760
width	height
you need to be using trigonometry to determine the correct width height using transparency to prevent the black area and i think the transform is wrong which is making it off center

4156800
src	attr
i was wondering if it was possible to add a fadein effect when an attr is changed for example i have this code working when the user clicks on img2 imgmain s src is changed to img2 s like this

4156845
getter	setter
in java using a getter and setter is usually considered best practice

4156845
getter	setter
this is because if you ever need to change your code to do something else when a property is accessed or modified you can just change it in the existing getter or setter

4156845
getter	setter
i tend to think it causes a bit of clutter for simple objects but if you have ever had to refactor a public property to a getter and setter to add additional functionality you will see that it can be a pain

4156848
getter	setter
expression languages support setter and getter

4156848
getter	setter
if we are pedantic setter and getter for all fields also breaks encapsulation though

4156848
getter	setter
you may want to perform some extra logic inside the setter or getter but that is rarely advisable since consumers expect this to follow the convention - being a simple getter setter

4156848
getter	setter
you can specify only a setter or only a getter thus achieving read-only or write-only access

4156852
getter	setter
i suspect most will say to always use getter setter to access private members

4156856
getter	setter
using getter setter vs using fields

4156856
getter	setter
use the variables directly from the same class actually from the same .java file so inner classes are ok too use getter setter from other classes

4156873
children	parent
dest will be our parent table with children dest_one and dest_two which will contain information on things of type one or two respectively

4156876
getter	setter
getter and setter allow you to change the implementation later do something more complex allow you to implement validation rules setname throws an exception if the name is not more than 5 characters whatever.

4156876
getter	setter
you could also choose to add a getter but not a setter so that the variable is like read-only

4156876
getter	setter
in some companies i ve worked at it s been mandatory to write getter and setter for all attributes

4156950
getter	setter
in general you d want to use setter and getter to give the opportunity to developers reusing your code by modifying it or extending it to add layers of processing and control when accessing and modifying your internal data

4156950
getter	setter
in practice multiple people working on a class might not know what everyone s doing and those lines of integrity checking in your getter and setter might be useful in most cases while the micro-optimization may not

4157106
fast-forward	merge
however if the merge is one that would be fast-forward you don t need to check out the target branch because you don t actually need to merge anything - all you have to do is update the branch to point to the new head ref

4157106
fast-forward	merge
don t use it unless you are sure you the merge will be fast-forward

4157178
opera	firefox
you re trying to implement http push or http streaming or whatever the issue is that not all browsers will support this correctly for browsers such as firefox opera etc you could try the mime-type multipart x-mixed-replace so as long as you keep the connection live and send stuff down firefox should read but this will not work in ie.

4157240
voip	sip
the most common case for sip is voip

4157240
voip	sip
the same applies to documentation sip documentation will tend to be geared around voip

4157275

first of all since it is around 1million you had better perform the algorithm in ram not on disk that is first load the contents into an array then modify the array then paste the results back into the file

4157296
min	max
min max vs order by and limit

4157358

sqldatasource	formview
i ve placed a sqldatasource control on the page and then tried putting a formview control there and an image control within that

4157435
fast-forward	merge
as amber said fast-forward merge are the only case in which you could conceivably do this

4157435
fast-forward	merge
i happen to have a script around i use for exactly this doing fast-forward merge without touching the work tree unless you re merging into head

4157435
fast-forward	merge
it s a little long because it s at least a bit robust - it checks to make sure that the merge would be a fast-forward then performs it without checking out the branch but producing the same results as if you had - you see the diff --stat summary of changes and the entry in the reflog is exactly like a fast forward merge instead of the reset one you get if you use branch -f

4157437
hash	md5
a hash function such as md5 or a simpler one usually including a modulo operator can be used for this

4157442
min	max
since speed seems to be dependent on the min and max scroll speeds i kept them close to the min and max zooms every time it actually zooms using the uiscroll delegate

4157451
dictionary	map
the immutable dictionary implementation is faster but no less pure in usage than the map implementation

php crop image to fix width and height without losing dimension ratio

4160555
width	height
then you would scan the first row to find the width check each row for valid characters and the same width and count the rows to find the height

4160576
erd	diagram
each time i approach a problem and attempt to come up with a design following oo strategies my diagram uml classes for example come out looking like an erd

4160583
inherited	subclassing
i would argue that the subclassing examples you suggest could just as easily be implemented as wrapper classes around a templated container favouring code reuse through composition over inherited something advocated by the gang of four amongst others

4160592
int	chars
the value representation could then be a int or chars and is easily accessible

4160601
textarea	textbox
i ve used some textbox and textarea for that

4160650
zipoutputstream	zipfile
and on the other side zipoutputstream is used if your have the contents and need to combine them into a zipfile

4160657
multiplication	modulo
the solution below uses a multiplication to space the lower 4 bits into higher bits and then the modulo of a 2 n-1 number to roll the bits back down

4160679
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
so far it works fine in firefox but not in safari or google-chrome

4160679
google-chrome	safari
in safari and google-chrome the .content divs appear beneath their respective accordion panes rather than retaining their position and exhibiting the width animation

4160693
tcplistener	tcpclient
i am working on a network project which uses tcplistener and tcpclient

4160733
range	max
on the built in mic on a macbook pro with + - 1.0 normalized audio data range with input volume set to max some data points

4160788
getter	setter
in object oriented programming a good practice is to expose getter and setter to allow other class to interact with a class content instead of making member variables public

4160859
postgresql	mysql
what you are trying to do is somehow valid in mysql but invalid in standard sql postgresql and common sense

4160859
filtering	grouping
you can also put additional having clause after grouping that contains aggregate function expression that can also be used as post-group filtering

4160901
public	protected
the idea is that functions can be disabled by changing them from public to protected rather than renaming them or removing them

4160901
public	protected
i currently do this but it doesn t matter if the command is public or protected

4160943
imperative	declarative
though this seems to be only a declarative statement but indeed the compiler will generate many imperative instructions for it

4161012
maven	m2e
i m just starting to explore maven and i use m2e as to use maven in eclipse

4161022
folder	directory
i have a folder in my local directory that is untracked

4161060
getter	setter
there are two main reasons for coding setter and getter

4161060
getter	setter
there are several libraries apis like freemarker that absolutly depend on haveing getter and setter methods in your class

4161060
getter	setter
so by building in getter and setter from the start you are building in both the flexibilty to do more exotic things within your class while at the same time providing a stable interface to your class users which wont rquire them to change thier code every time there is a small change in functionality

4161087
children	parent
another difference is that fork ed children can outlive their parent where as all threads die when the process terminates

4161095
inherited	properties
your usercontrol will inherited the datacontext from the window so you can bind properties on the listbox as though it were declared in the window

4161130
int	double
if the values in in are int don t use double quotation marks like this

4161209
width	height
new_x and new_y should be divided by the images height width not the container s height width which is wider

4161209
mousemove	mouseenter
no need to bind mousemove on mouseenter which rebinds the mousemove will only occur when you re inside anyway

4161244
octal	binary
you can easily format numbers in octal hexadecimal or binary without the clutter of running them through a function storing the result in a temporary variable and passing it through echo

4161258
octal	hex
you can convert numbers to octal hex

4161265
post	get
hi in order to get around your issues with your constraints please read this blog post i wrote on the subject

4161276
udp	tcp
sockets read write if tcp and other functions for udp if you will use it etc.

4161277
hide	show
the idea is to have the div show or hide via animation either on click or hover of that link

4161392
put	get
i also tried to put a doctype before the tag inside the template i get another error saying i cannot place a doctype after a proclog or something

4161399
freemarker	velocity
simple template systems like velocity and freemarker don t do the database stuff

4161404
pascal	delphi
i inherited a delphi application and i know nothing about object pascal

4161415
uilabel	uitextview
i have a uitablview with search box when you type a text content will show according starting character typed in serach box then when you select uitableview cell it goes to another page which has nearly 30 objects like uilabel and uitextview

4161420
min	max
min and max will both work for this

4161426
post	get
post variables are available in the system structure form and get variables in the system structure url

4161467
for-loop	loops
i m binding a grid view inside a for-loop which executes more than once.now when loops ends the data in grid view is the data binded at the last run of for-loop i.e all previous binds in the for-loop over overwritten.i dont want this .i want new rows to be inserted at each run of the for-loop ..plz help somebody

4161468
folder	directory
there are about 12-13 files that must be in the directory of the folder some .dlls some .xml files etc. for the application to run and i want to make my application as compact as possible meaning i want as fewer files to go with the application

4161485
listener	eventhandler
as such you much attach a listener to the downloadcompleted event handler and move all processing to that eventhandler

4161498
google-chrome	safari
works in google-chrome safari only

4161585
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve looked in the error consoles of safari google-chrome and firefox

4161588
mouse	keyboard
would i be better off creating callbacks for each of the types i need mouse keyboard gamepad etc

4161589
pull	push
i prefer websites so i went with asp.net s mvc 2 then started writing all the parts of those books namely a data repository services to pull data and control to push it

4161593
post	get
i will tell you one last time but if you do not post it we can not help you even the opposite your post get downvoted

4161619
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox still apply all styles with no problem

4161640
int	double
if possible i would like to solve this problem because i ve got a project that doesn t use double to deal with prices it converts to int after treat the string just like that but in javascript i understand some parts of the code but i don t know how to implement in groovy java but i ll paste it anyway

4161717
int	chars
i m assuming that your chars array contains bytes instead of actual ascii chars which you want to convert into 16-bit signed int

4161848
cvs	svn
think svn cvs git all these versioning control system help u to branch trunk tag for your code to each clients projects

4161951
int	chars
access through char_buf when dealing with chars access through int_buf when dealing with int

4161970
ant	maven
for automated builds you might want to consider looking into ant maven or ivy but for getting started an ide has a smaller learning curve with a lot of extra benefits code completion debugging a ui for reviewing junit test failures...

4161975
yslow	pagespeed
i do not want to load javascripts in as i am trying to optimize my site per pagespeed yahoo yslow recommendations

4161981
rss	feed
if you have an rss feed for each forum you could grab this feed and based on the feed then email your cell phone say at t you send to number txt.att.net

4161989
children	parent
what kind of restrictions would you put on kids or do you let the parent do the login for their respective children

4162005
hide	show
if you want to show and hide an existing element then can do something like

4162008
fflush	gets
the problem is when i retrive the user by username using a criteria query and fflush the session all the security roles attached to the retrieved user gets deleted and re-inserted again although i do not make any modifications to the retrived object

4162038
i2c	spi
you might also consider this usb-spi i2c adapter if you have an available i2c or spi interface and you can handle the wiring

4162038
i2c	spi
it says it can go to 400 khz i2c or 200 khz spi which is still not quite enough by itself but you could split the data between the spi i2c and the serial link you already have

4162054
versioning	upgrade
it has a freeware versioning with upgrade available

4162068
elementname	datagrid
all you need to do is change the value of elementname to the actual name of the datagrid ie datagrid1 instead of datagrid

4162090
vim	emacs
i m told that facebook generally uses vim or emacs for development but i m hoping for a more full-blown ide that supports this syntax

4162131
scatter	graphing
i then processed my log with a script which extracted the times per url and did scatter plot graphing and trend graphing based on load

4162176
onclick	onfocus
the first onclick i want to use to populate the list and the second onfocus i am using on select a value to make an ajax call to other jsp script

4162225
onchange	onfocus
why don t you try something like calling second method on onchange event instead of onfocus like

4162232
cos	sin
i have already defined sin cos but i am having a lot of trouble with atain2

4162259
google-chrome	firefox
the behaviour is exactly as expected in both firefox and google-chrome but good old ie issues a postback when the row that is not selected is clicked in the button column

4162327
width	height
width 560 height 345 flashvars i 130553 allowfullscreen true width 560 height 345 pluginspage

4162336
folder	directory
- one thing i failed to mention is that all of the build servers have the same installation structure for cruisecontrol.net on them and the installation directory is directly accessible through a folder share

4162382
atan2	sin	cos	sin	cos	atan2
depending on your required precision you might consider precalculating a table of the cos sin atan2 etc values and just use a simple lookup of the closest value

4162428
google-chrome	firefox
but if the height is changed to 1px or 0 then the shadow doesn t have a good blur and is uniform in color and is lighter too on both firefox and google-chrome

4162465
int	chars
there are hash functions that will map a byte chars short or int to a unique int but a hash function that maps long values to unique int values is impossible

4162480
jdk1.6	jdk1.5
previously with jdk1.5 we used hpjmeter it worked fine but now with jdk1.6 it doesn t

4162513
post	get
in your python code parse the json post in my example is where you get your post data in your cgi script

4162520
mef	prism
i am looking to build an application using prism mef where i can offer new plug-ins for the application from time to time

4162525
post	get
when i post a link all i get is the link people can click

4162537
prng	random
the proper way to generate unbiased random numbers between 0 inclusive and k exclusive is this first get a proper prng that gives you a large-enough random number say 32 random bits

4162546
for-loop	loops
the basic structure for-loop commands is where n is the number of times loops will execute

4162567
std	ostream
the in std ostream that are defined as member functions aren t virtual

4162604
google-chrome	firefox
in ie firefox and google-chrome the browser offers to remember the login credentials but our client is using some built in lotus notes browser and it doesn t seem to offer this service

4162666
voip	sip
however you need to install another sip server for voip services

4162740
button	checkbox	checkbox	dropdownlistfor
i am able to create textbox dropdownlistfor and checkbox in property panel but found no way to create button and other controls

4162775
post	get
if the post get data with any key is not defined then instead of raising an exception the fallback value second argument of .get will be used

4162824
width	height
thus the amount of memory gd will need to work with the image is directly proportional to its size width x height whereas the image you re uploading is probably compressed and thus may be much smaller on your own disk

4162839
lapply	grepl	for-loop	loops
in the above function we use x instead of the list name spamdata because when lapply and sapply loops over the spamdata list the individual components referenced by in the for-loop get passed to our function as argument x so we only need to refer to x in the grepl call

4162859
uiview	subviews
in this app i did the following i add two uiview s as subviews to the window of the application

4162859
portrait	landscape
now comes the problem i wanted to add the option to rotate the device from portrait to landscape and back

4162867
int	double
60 and 23 are int literals so you are doing int division and then assigning to a double

4162871
width	height
but i need to use percentages rather than px values for the left top width and height parameters

4162920
serializable	deserialization
assuming your function objects are stateless which is usually the case you could skip the serializable deserialization step

4162930
portrait	landscape
i want to do orientation from portrait to landscape but the issue is it is not changing on orientation

4162947
strcpy	strncpy
you need to either pass the length as an additional parameter like strncpy does or zero-terminate the array like strcpy does

4162967
gridview	calendarextender
i have a gridview where one of the cells holds a textbox with a calendarextender attached to it

4162985
post	get
this call will need to pass the query variables to the server via post or get

4162992
jar	war
and this log4j.xml will be packaged into jar-module.jar file however i would like to make it into web-inf classes directory in the war package rather than in the jar file so that users will be easy to find this configuration file and modify it if necessary it is very hard for them to find it if this file is in the web-inf lib jar-module.jar because there are many other jars under that directory

4162998
puts	gets
edit i should mention that i have checked that the parameter gets set correctly in around_recognize - a puts of the params collection here does indeed contain the correct shop object

4163012
udp	tcp
it would be more to the point to get rid of udp at the sender rather than try to shoehorn it somehow into your tcp design at the receiver where it is already too late

4163042
metaclass	subclassing
first because in your comments you said that subs was a bunch of classes in a list some of which might be its subclassing and more importantly because that is not the case with the code in my update which only works for base subclassing since they are effectively registered automatically via the metaclass -- but leave anything other in the list alone

4163042
metaclass	subclassing
exactly the same thing can also be done using a metaclass -- which has the advantage that it eliminates the need to explicitly decorate each subclassing as shown in the accepted answer above and instead makes it happen automagically

4163042
metaclass	subclassing
note that even though the metaclass s __init__ is called for the creation of every subclassing it only updates the subs list if that subclassing s name appears in it -- so the initial base class definition of the contents of subs still controls what gets put in it and in what order

4163049
int	double
the reason the fixed-decimal solution using __int64 as underlying type is even discussed is that someone claimed that double performance is still significantly worse than processing float s and that we might see significant performance benefits using a native int type to store our numbers

4163088
int	double
so double will probably be significantly slower than floats but comparing with int is difficult and i d prefer float double over fixedpoint is most scenarios

4163111
ant	maven
i have been tasked with getting these ant scripts to run from maven using antrun and i ve gotten some of the way but not all.

4163136
cos	exp	cos	sin
divisions square roots and transcendental functions exp log sin cos etc. are usually notably slower with double arguments since their runtime is dependent on the desired accuracy

4163136
int	double
if you go fixed point multiplies and divisions need to be implemented with long int multiply divide instructions which are usually slower than arithmetic on double s since processors aren t optimized as much for it

4163136
128bit	64bit
even more so if you re running in 32 bit mode where a long 64bit multiply with 128bit results needs to be synthesized from several 32-bit long multiplies

4163136
int	double
64-bit int and double are the same size - if you need more than 32 bits you re gonna eat that penalty no matter what

4163163
hide	show
but i won t use this to hide show items instead wrap the content with another div and slidetoggle it like this

4163197
udp	tcp
your tcp clients are not picking up the packets quickly enough causing the buffer to fill up which forces the server to block which causes it to miss udp packets

4163203
google-chrome	firefox
on my machine and many others using a mixture of google-chrome ie 7 8 9b and firefox this is working as expected

4163230
getter	setter
this means that i have a component class with setter and getter for attribute type

4163312
jikes	javac
on the other hand my primary ide intellij idea allows do that choose between javac jikes or eclipse compilers

4163415
folder	directory
i see the directory structure doesnt allow to put the whole content into my public html folder and directly access it as it has a htdocs folder in which normally my vhost docroot conf should point to

4163415
folder	directory
so i want to change the .htaccess file in the root directory so every access to the root directory internally redirects to htdocs folder

4163416
folder	directory
on jre home field click on directory button and browse to you jre jdk root folder

4163420
int	double
t cand be bool int double and string

4163423
put	get
so let me put out this simple question for which i am finding hard to get a simple answer

4163441
button	checkbox
what i want to do do is have a checkbox on the datagridview for the option accountenabled and a update button at the bottom of the form so it will update all users that have had changes made against them

4163447
gif	png
each icon has two definitions - one as a gif for ie6 and a png image for all other browsers

4163449
post	get
unfortunately if i use the post data because some of it is invalid the form won t validate and i am thus unable to get to the data in the form to fix it

4163470
subtraction	addition
this module should also handle the simple subtraction addition as well as the calculation of duplicate items

4163548
width	height
you give it the filename of your file along with the target height width it will check available memory and return true or false if you have enough to perform the resize

4163556
tabcontrol	tabitem
also myusercontrol is added in a tabcontrol and tabitem

4163585
width	height
if you want to give a text area a specific width and height then i would recommend using style rather than cols or rows

4163611
ssl	https
your website will run over https with any old x.509 certificate so if you only have a few people accessing your ssl site you may convince them to trust your self-issued certificate and save the money for the certificate

4163630
iboutlet	ibaction
there are still targets and action iboutlet and ibaction

4163673
ravendb	couchdb

qtreeview	qabstractitemmodel
i have implemented my own model qabstractitemmodel for qtreeview so my qtreeview properly displays the data

4163740
move	drag
now i would like to add drag and drop support for tree s nodes to be able to move a node inside the tree from one parent to another one drag-copy and so on but i cannot find any complete tutorial how to achieve this

4163740
qtreewidget	qtreeview
i have found few tutorials and hints for qtreewidget but not for qtreeview with custom model

4163786
getter	setter
on a side-note most programmers wouldn t access fields directly object.field but rather through getter setter object.setfield x

4163812
int	chars
since you attempt to read an int d with scanf and store it in a chars variable there is a memory overflow a chars is 1 byte while an int is usually 4

4163812
int	chars
declare your variables as int to avoid this or explicitly read chars values with scanf - but if you want to multiply values it is better to start with int s right away to at least mitigate the risk of int overflow

4163819
int	chars
either declare m and the other variables as int or scanf a chars

4163849
lapack	alglib
if you re after the full breadth of lapack then my recommendations are alglib if you re on a budget or extreme optimization if you can afford it

4163862
put	get	post	get	post	put
every single resource i va come across on internet always describes very well what you can do with the get operation how it works and so on bu it never explains the post put delete and particularly the format of the data you pass in the http body i m using json

4163887
hide	show
now based on some condition i would like to show hide a given div

4163894
google-chrome	firefox
i d prefer projecting my presentation using a vanilla google-chrome or mozilla firefox

4163896
packets	multicast
following code works fine but there is a problem in this code - it blocks the current thread until it gets the multicast packets

4163897
vim	geany
use an editor with line-wrapping such as geany vim gvim etc

4163901
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
all major browsers except ie - including firefox webkit google-chrome plus desktop mobile safari and opera have had a chance to implement the html5 implementation of server-side push

4163908
getter	setter
i just have the property named theres no property for it in my header so no getter and setter

4163912
post	get
there have been numerous questions asked here about how to get aero glass effects in winforms applications and just as many more blog post code samples and more posted across the internet

4163918
textview	imageview
i made a graphbar custom view that is a relativelayout with a textview on the bottom and an imageview varying in height above that

4163921
ubuntu	debian
i do wish there was a debian ubuntu package for sbt -- it s just a tiny shell script and a jar file after all and it takes care of downloading scala lift etc and at whatever version you need

4164025
base-class	subclassing
the subclassing member function is implicitly virtual if a virtual base-class member function with the same name and signature exists

4164042
public	protected
inherits all of the public and protected methods from the parent class

4164087

4164116
ssl	https
i want to implement ksoap2 web service using https http over ssl

4164128
cvs	svn
hudson can be configured to poll cvs svn etc for changes to your source code and trigger a build based on that change

4164136
int	double
i ve trouble the understand the rationale as double as slower than float we ll use 64 bits int

4164136
int	double
first note that two of the factors which have been given to explain the claimed slower double performance than float are not pertinent here bandwidth needed will the be same for double as for 64 bits int and sse2 vectorization would give an advantage to double.

4164136
int	double
i ve already seen cases where doing int computation in double was a win attributed to the added computation units available

4164158
debian	linux
debian gnu linux 5.0.6

4164426
post	get
and supports both post get and parameters

4164483
hash	md5
that said before cryptographic hash like md5 became commonly used simpler algorithms generically called checksums were used

4164548
folder	directory
is actually sort of not performed actually you end up having the canonical source.o and source.s files in the directory where you re building instead of random-string. os in some temp folder but from the point of view of locating debugging symbols that s fine

4164565
scheme	racket	lisp	racket	lisp	scheme	newlisp	racket
aside from plain cl and scheme implementations you also have a couple of next-generation lisp such as clojure probably the most modern of them all - designed from the ground up for heavy concurrency and newlisp and the next-generation scheme racket formerly known as plt scheme

4164610
width	height
note how in the designer you set the size of the form with the width and height properties

4164610
min	max
it also prevents the form getting too narrow trying to make sure that the icon and min max close buttons are always visible

4164617
post	get
i ll post details as soon as i get time

qiodevice	qnetworkreply
qnetworkreply waitforreadyread does not have an implementation so it always refers the base class waitforreadyread in this case qiodevice

4169776
bmp	png	gif	bmp	gif	png
if it s affordable to check for only bmp gif jpg or png types but not tif psd svg etc then you can just feed it directly to imageio#read and check if it doesn t throw an exception

4169776
bmp	png	gif	bmp	gif	png
for example jmimemagic or apache tika which support both bmp gif jpg png tif and psd but not svg

4169776

put	get
this does not always happen correctly they might forget put in the wrong loc or get the wrong version

4169801
wtl	atl
wtl wraps the detail of creating the ribbon and accessing it but wtl was made for com programmers looking for a windowing api so it s not an easy api to begin with if you don t have experience of com programming with atl

4169848
sorting	filtering
if you want support only data sorting and paging but don t need any searching filtering support

4169886

4169897
firefox	safari
but when rendered on macs firefox safari starting with 500 data points the page becomes significantly slow and or crashes

4169956
gtk	gdk
if you want to consider other windows than the ones from your application then you could try gtk.gdk.screen_get_default .get_toplevel_windows but this will only get you gdk windows and not gtk windows because you have no way of knowing whether those gdk windows are actually associated with gtk windows

4169980
lisp	scheme
scheme has been defined before common lisp by almost a decade

4169980
cdr	cons
scheme still had legacy like s-expressions cons cells symbols car cdr cons and more

4169980
lisp	scheme
that scheme has legacy makes it a member of the family of lisp languages which has its roots in the first lisp from 1958

4169980
lisp	scheme
scheme s initial goal was to be a small clean language that is closer to lambda calculus than traditional lisp

that is tell the compiler that ptr refers to a chars then get that chars value which is promoted to an int in an argument list and subsequently output correctly by the d specifier

4170128
int	chars
the parsing will end at the dash as that can t be a part of an int except as the first chars

4170254
daemons	launchd
that code is all being launchd from a daemons thread created earlier

4170274
int	chars
without the typecast the compiler doesn t know if you want to read a chars usually 1 byte a short usually 2 bytes or an int usually 4 bytes

4170274
int	double
and this will compile but won t look up customer 69 a double is not an int

4170399
min	max
you could most likely use min max in a subquery but there s no way to tell if it would be better or not

4170409
bash	zsh
in bash and ksh zsh dash etc. you can use parameter expansion with which will remove characters from the end of the string or # which will remove characters from the beginning of the string

4170416
wordpress	phpbb
if you are running a software package like wordpress or phpbb you could google around to find a plugin that did it for you

4170482
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
for example a hash consisting of 32 hex digits might well be one or more repetitions of md5 and if you can get a single input output pair then it is quite easy to confirm or refute this although see salt below

4170498
client-side	server-side
you need a server-side proxy anyways and it will keep the client-side code simpler

4170513
getter	setter
setter and getter are a generic programming concept that apply to all object-oriented language not limited to objective-c

it seems most of the other php orm libraries doctrine 1.2 included are activerecord while doctrine2 is a datamapper

4170568
scheme	racket
the languages racket r5rs pretty big are more like real scheme and should all work for the little schemer

4170594

i was hoping that i could get the dev_appserver.py application to display the post data in the request line but i can t seem to find a way to do that

4170741
background-image	background-position
you might also be able to fix the issue by making a single sprite image and have your hover class change the background-position instead of changing the background-image

4170787
width	height
i wouldn t scale the image every single time in the paintcomponent method but do it once if the width and height have been changed since the last call and in that case recreate a bufferedimage containing the image which you blit every single time before calling the superclass paintcomponent scaled up to the right size use something like image scaling does not work when original image height width is smaller the scaling height width

4170794
folder	directory
im having trouble converting a working solution that takes a directory folder as an input and outputs the filenames and other file attributes of files container in the folder into an excel spreadsheet to a recursive solution that also outputs the files contained in subfolders

4170809
getter	setter
it just generates getter setter methods according to declared properties

4170840
put	get	post	get	post	put
i made a spring rest application where you can perform crud operations based on http methods of post put get delete

4170899
children	parent
the way javascript dom events work is that they bubble up from children to parent

4170955
mouseleave	mouseenter
2 deal with mouseenter and mouseleave events of the panel you added

4170979
folder	directory
then assuming java as your project type you can open up your project properties and add as a source folder your existing directory

4170987
button	checkbox
in the new java project wizard uncheck the checkbox that says use default location and the use the browse button to find your directory

4171007
folder	directory
maybe there is a built in way to symlink in eclipse but i sometimes end up with the project folder in the workspace with the src symlinked to the actual source directory somewhere totally different

4171008
hash	md5
what i want to do is update the row where the md5 hash version of questionid some string

4171028

the last part the pair of square brackets after the parentheses they are the properties accessor and they receive an expression which is formed by the unary plus operator applied to an empty array again

4171070
sequence	permutation
if you really need a random permutation you generate a full filtered sequence in advance with this same algorithm shuffle it and consume the values one by one

4171073
subtract	add
to that number we add or subtract our interval and then cast the new number back to an nsdate

4171128
width	height
the negative margins are there to offset the positive margins to prevent the width and height of the anchor from changing affecting the surrounding elements

4171144
hash	md5
if you really want to use an md5 hash in this way i would suggest precomputing the hash value of questionid and storing it in a column of the questions table

4171144
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
you may also wish to use a salt so that your md5 hash are not easily converted to their original value

4171229
width	height
easiest way to get width and height is to assign it to language construct

4171233
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this seems to work pretty much the same in firefox and ie7 i didn t check opera google-chrome safari ie8 though

4171239
cos	sqrt	cos	sin	sin	sqrt
i have therefore replaced the calls to sin cos sqrt et cetera with calls to the floating point versions of those functions as they result in a 3-4 times speed increase overall

4171247

silverlight for windows google-chrome firefox ie 6 and later mac firefox safari and google-chrome

4171253
sorting	grouping
i have am using an mx advanceddatagrid and i running into a problem with grouping column sorting

4171276
inherited	properties
the second approach is a classic example of one of the advantages of having inherited that is sharing functionality and properties

4171279
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that i can make it look great on either internet explorer or firefox and google-chrome but not all 3 at the same time

4171279
google-chrome	firefox
the page looks ok on ie as it now - physiocall.co.il but the sidebar is hidden in firefox and google-chrome

4171279
google-chrome	firefox
the site looks great on firefox and google-chrome the sidebar pushed left to it s place

4171309
versioning	upgrade
while i also use versioning control to do this another approach you might consider is to package up the source using whatever package management your host systems use for example rpms or dpkgs and set up the systems to use a custom repository then an apt-get upgrade or yum update will update the software on the systems

4171310
public	protected
to me this helps preserve encapsulation and abstraction because i am not modifying the public or protected interface of the class

4171336
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended
1 subclass the textview and override touchesbegan touchesmoved touchesended

most of the things can be done using the api of cfstring and nsstring which supports unicode out of the box

4171536
cfstring	nsstring
so please do learn cfstring and nsstring methods

4171573
pow	sqrt
2-norm or euclidean distance distance sqrt pow r1-r2 2 + pow g1-g2 2 + pow b1-b2 2 you compute the square of this which is fine - you can avoid the sqrt if you re just checking against a threshold by squaring the threshold too

4171683
post	get
post your code and expand on your question to get a better response

4171753
post	get
i m still using get so that i could see how the data looks like i ll change it to post later

4171766
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	background-color	transparency
i can accomplish this in safari firefox and google-chrome by having my toolbar sit on top of everything on a transparency background height 100 and background-color transparency for both the div and iframe

4171766

4171854
datamapper	activerecord
using datamapper instead of activerecord

4171859
hash	salt
i just looked at the implementation of password hashing in django and noticed that it prepends the salt so the hash is created like sha1 salt + password for example

4171859
hash	salt
with a prepended salt one must calculate hash salt store the hash algorithm s state and then go on from that point for each permutation

4171859
hash	salt
as copying the hash algorithm s state is freakin fast the salt hardly adds any complexity here no matter how long it is

4171859
hash	salt
but with an appended salt the attacker must calculate for each permutation leading to 26 10 hash operations

4171925
tostring	string.format
so the various tostring string and string.format overloads that don t take a culture will use the thread s current culture system.globalization.cultureinfo.currentculture to format

webkit	gecko
unfortunately they ve dropped support for other engines like gecko and webkit since 4.0 version

4172393
sin	sqrt
the library routines for stuff like transcendental functions sin sqrt log etc are in fact implemented in c so again there s no good reason to look to other libraries

for example i wrote a simple program to time nested loops where the outer loops ran both with a for-loop and with parallel.foreach

4172788
multiplying	multiplication
you ve already got a multiplication operator so use that when you want to multiplying

4172791
accessor	properties
if you use a properties accessor to cache your imagearray object your properties accessor should be declared to retain the object you assign to

4172791
accessor	properties
now that your method properly return an autoreleased imagearray and you have a correct properties accessor all that s needed is

4172805
google-chrome	firefox
if your user switched between say google-chrome and firefox a differing database would be used

4172913
strlen	strcpy
1 strcpy + strlen is the winner with just 967 milliseconds

4172941
width	height
the key to this working is the defined width on the table itself and then on the td of and tables apply a consistent width to all cells in the same column and height of cells in the same row unless colspan or rowspan forces different behaviour

4172991

4173390
getter	setter
by the way i can only advise you to avoid do...while without serious reasons and to use getter and setter

4173425
width	height
when resizing images you also have to keep in mind the aspect ratio so you cannot just apply a percentage value to both the width and height

4173435
entity-relationship	diagram
for creating entity-relationship diagram by db reflection i use

4173487
pull	push
after that push pull will move over only the compressed changesets that the server doesn t already have

dialog pop-up

4173960
put	get
i guess if you allocate a buffer large enough it ll have to get another few pages and then it ll put the buffer at the start of the first page

4173971
for-loop	arrays
you will need to use a for-loop to pick out each byte from the byte arrays

4174049
post	get
as pointed out this post relates how to get the height rather than the number of lines

4174076
min	max
maxlength is the max between the size of a and b so in a loop from 0 to maxlength you will get an arrayindexoutofboundsexception when i exceeds the min of the size of a and b

you will need to setup the webclient s downloadstringcompleted event handler to do the processing of the rss feed

4174169
avaudioplayer	avfoundation
they won t generally be normal file urls but they are urls that the avfoundation is able to use so an instance of avaudioplayer should be able to play a song

4174187
int	double
numbers should be read as int or as double depending on the input

4174189
firefox	safari
i will also be installing visual studio and several browsers ie safari firefox etc

4174222
implements	extends
in essence you want to analyze c++ code your rule of three or extends the c++ language with some new features and then implements those features using standard c++ capabilities

4174224
awt	swing
if customcanvas is a canvas i don t think you can mix awt and swing components like that

4174229
accessor	properties
synthesizing the properties creates a pair of accessor methods but doesn t automatically create an instance of nsmutablearray for you

4174270
implements	extends
a class in php can extends only one parent class but can implements any number of interfaces thus allowing you to create objects having many different types

4174287
unix	bsd
ibm has a nice example here which will work on any flavor of unix linux bsd etc

4174300
junit	testng
mvn -x would print a bunch of these so you can try to figure out if it s something from the above - like not using the right junit version when you create from the quickstart artifact i think the default is 3.8.1 having testng in the classpath before junit or so

4174300
maven	pom.xml
edit 4 ok i just created a test project with maven quickstart artifact added two modules also created with quickstart artifact inside added source target java version and junit junit 4.8 dependency to the parent pom.xml only

4174317
google-chrome	firefox
actually it worked only in firefox not in google-chrome or i.e

4174336
datamapper	activerecord
you basically need to implement all the datamapper activerecord and other patterns connected with them

4174354
int	chars
simply because a chars in c++ is a single byte or at least it s guaranteed by the c++ standard to be less than or equal in size to int or short whereas the size of an int is usually larger than a byte

4174363
uiview	calayer
calayer cannot react on touch events directly but lots of other objects in your program can - for example the uiview which is hosting the layers

4174363
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended
for touches there are three possible messages touchesbegan withevent touchesmoved withevent and touchesended withevent

4174384
webclient	httpwebrequest
my googling directed me to use httpwebrequest but i liked the webclient api

4174384
webclient	httpwebrequest
i ended up extending webclient and overriding a protected method there that would create the underlying httpwebrequest

4174447
min	max
other relevant proposals relating to min max are n1840 n2485 and n2551

4174448
int	double	int	boolean
the valueof string method is present in the wrapper classes short long int float double boolean so it supports these and any other class which has this method

4174495
moq	fakeiteasy
functionally there are no major differences between moq and fakeiteasy

4174522
awt	swing
also don t mix the awt canvas components with swing

4174526
put	get
non-blocking calls and put sockets to epoll when you get ewouldblock

4174643
post	get
for example when writing something like this inside a form which works and post and i can get the checkbox value

4174659
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the websockets api has full browser support in google-chrome 14 firefox 6 ie 10 desktop and mobile opera 12.1 desktop and moblie safari 6.0 desktop and mobile android 4.4 google-chrome mobile and firefox mobile

4174670
udp	tcp
i m working on a game and want the freedom to choose between udp and tcp connections in the future when i decide to add multiplayer

4174670
udp	tcp
the first is that a player becomes the host of the game in the browser and thus would need to communicate with other players directly via tcp or udp

4174670
udp	tcp
the second scenario would be to have the web server host the game and pass messages back and forth to the clients again via tcp or udp

4174672
hide	show
adding via javascript is the only way to dynamically show and hide elements at run time

4174677
udp	tcp
the first is that a player becomes the host of the game in the browser and thus would need to communicate with other players directly via tcp or udp

4174677
udp	tcp
the second scenario would be to have the web server host the game and pass messages back and forth to the clients again via tcp or udp

4174680
move	drag
the tool looks close to how a power point looks allowing the user to easily drag and drop learning objects to the slide with pictures resize images move them overlap text add the tests etc

4174697
portrait	landscape
when i rotate the device from landscape to portrait though the detail vc remains looking quadratic

4174697
portrait	landscape
the view remains quadratic like it was in landscape mode even when rotated to portrait

4174722
hide	show
now i want to hide the status bar as soon as the fullscreen controls start to fade out and show the status bar if the controls are visible

4174768
button	checkbox
i am making a gui program in tkinter and am running into problems.what i want to do is draw 2 checkbox and a button

4174784
nsoperationqueue	nsinvocationoperation
i then have a method which loops through that array and creates an nsinvocationoperation puts it in the nsoperationqueue releases the operation and so forth

4174814
width	height
try the checkboxlist but set the repeatdirection to be horizontal and set the container to a specified width but not a specified height

4174852
gtk	gdk	gtk	cairo	gdk	cairo
i am mostly playing with f# on linux and would like to get all the necessary gui libraries gtk gdk atk glib pango cairo to be referenced by default so that i can simply use

4174856
implements	extends
there is value in a non-public class having public methods if the class extends or implements a public class or interface since the derived class can stand in for the base class or interface type

4174862
google-chrome	firefox
now this all works just fine in ie and firefox but in google-chrome when i get to step 3 there are horiz and vertical scrollbars on the popup window if i m coming from the twitter auth in step 2

4174928
nginx	lighttpd
use fast web-server like nginx or lighttpd for serving js and css files if not using yet

4174960
post	get
i though i d post the whole app since it is relatively small and so that i could get some help without confusion

4174964
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome it works the way i would expect it to however in safari it does not play the way i would expectâ it plays all the bottom animations first then rushes through the left animations at the end

4175024
ddms	adb
first when you get a force close dialog use adb logcat ddms or the ddms perspective in eclipse to examine logcat and look at the stack trace associated with your crash

4175028
post	get
what i want to do is to get all the threads in a forum and get the post count of every thread

4175028
post	get
so i get every thread where forum_id whatever and then i left join with the table post so in order to count the results

4175060
avurlasset	avmutablecomposition
avurlasset to get hold of the different videos then shoving these into an avmutablecompositiontrack and then putting this into an avmutablecomposition which i m exporting to file with avassetexportsession

4175060
width	height
i tried messing around with the avmutablecomposition naturalsize changing the width and height around but that just made my people look short and fat

4175127
fread	atof
also from reading the docs it seems like i could just use fread to load all of the contents of the file into a string and then use atof to parse out each double

4175153
width	height
you should rather look at view lifecycle generally you should not know width and height for sure until your activity comes to onresume state

4175210
firefox	safari
hi people when you fill a form in safari and submit to a preview page when you click back it takes you to the original form and still shows the selected item against asking you yo select anything fresh for some reasons what soever firefox does not do this it there a way to make it do this so that one can have a uniform experience on different platform

4175231
for-loop	arrays
it looks like your fakedata arrays is being released inside of the for-loop which seems problematic on several levels

4175251
jnetpcap	libpcap
you ll need to use something like jnetpcap which wraps the native libpcap packet sniffing library

4175300
vb.net	vb6
vb.net includes some of vb6 s design flaws for the sake of backward compatibility

4175317
post	get
i analyzed all requests and created my own post get class to make things happen

4175324
cpu	processors
you always interact with the system in that the cpu or some other processors like a gpu has to execute your code

4175374
int	chars
rearranging the two chars s means that the int will be aligned properly and so the compiler doesn t have to bump the base address via padding

4175381
next	except
the outgoing packets between my application and theirs are next to identical except i get no replies back when i use mine

4175383
x86	64bit
update since the title is misleading i think it is important to clarify that visual studio 2010 x86 32 bits installer works perfectly on amd64 64bit machines

4175385
x86	64bit
my vs2010 pro x86 that i acquired via our websitespark membership works fine on my win7 home premium 64bit on an hp pavilion w amd turion ii ultra m620

4175445
realloc	malloc
i malloc for struct figure and then realloc as needed

4175450
x86	mips
i have heard that there is a way of configuring gcc so that it can convert c code to the mips architecture rather than the x86 architecture my computer users an intel i5 processor and prints the output

4175466
getter	setter
an atomic property is one for which the getter is guaranteed to return a valid meaningful value even if the relevant setter is being called simultaneously on another thread

4175512
int	boolean
you can also see that internally int are used to store boolean values

4175525
strncmp	realloc	strncmp	malloc	realloc	malloc
either you need to figure out how many new values you need in the structure then call malloc or put the realloc code into the if strncmp word draw max_word 0 section

4175536
rss	feed
i switched to nokogiri several years ago because i had some html and rss feed that caused hpricot to explode

4175550
g++	gcc
your best bet will indeed be the projects that gcc g++ depend on

4175597
implements	extends
the best thing i found was to implements it myself from scratch by extends adapterview

4175637
inherited	properties
parent-child relationship in this control imparts certain inherited of properties values and doesn t read shouldn t necessarily imply a parent-child relationship in the control tree

4175653
hide	show
make a table with two or three columns for the layout you want inside a div and use a wrapper div to hide and show it and to provide proper placement

4175653
hide	show
then you can show and hide it using the button on the search bar

4175667
innodb	myisam
please note that this is an option only if you are using innodb rather than myisam

4175678
pseudo-class	visited
note it is possible for style sheet authors to abuse the link and visited pseudo-class to determine which sites a user has visited without the user s consent

4175728
ubuntu	linux
if you re using gcc linux in class just install ubuntu

4175730
mongodb	bson
both use json as their native format mongodb actually uses bson but it s quite similar

4175730
put	get
i don t know what your relationship is going to be to the clients and how easy it ll be to get them to put couchdb on their machines

4175733
subtract	add
i can do it with time_ago_in_words time.zone.now+3600 but that feels like a bit of a hack there is no reason to add subtract from the current time just to format this value

4175789
hash	salt	crypt	salt	crypt	hash
by default htpasswd uses the standard crypt function and thus passwords are already salt - note in this example that both users have the same password yet the hash are different

4175789
hash	salt
the first two characters of the hash are the salt

4175792
salt	md5	crypt	salt	crypt	md5
the crypt and md5 formats permute the representation by prepending a random salt string to make dictionary attacks against the passwords more difficult

4175803
soql	apex
you can also select it natively via apex using simple soql

4175847
3-tier	n-tier
i read books articles tutorials and all that kind of stuff about the n-tier architecture and i m trying to apply the famous 3-tier dal bll pl and i just got into the game actually i ve read a lot about how bad is to load the whole database into memory which the dataset do specially when i m going to need to view details about an item which will have to be retrieved from 5 tables or something so it will be a lot and i want just one record

4175852
tolower	toupper
in there are the two functions tolower and toupper declared

4175915
hash	md5
very simple method generate an md5 hash using the source files as input

4175951
multiplying	modulo
i think multiplying hashes together modulo a prime might work if the underlying hash function had an unrealistically strong guarantee such as n-independence

4175958
free	malloc
of course feel free to continue using malloc and free instead of and if the data is being handed off to code that assume that malloc was used

4175962
versioning	upgrade
if your app is truly good then people will pay again for the upgrade versioning

4175974
int	chars
the method setmnemonic chars mnemonic is obsolete you should use setmnemonic int mnemonic with the appropriate vk_e instead

4176042
int	double
in general when passing data to and from an unmanaged dll via a p invoke call unless the data being passed is a vanilla type int double string - with appropriate marshal decoration i pass data as an intptr

4176109
mkplacemark	mkreversegeocoder
fwiw if you are using mapkit you can also use the mkreversegeocoder to obtain an mkplacemark

4176116
mouseup	mousedown
so you should simulate mousedown click and mouseup which by the way is what the iphone ipod touch and ipad do on tap events

4176156
jobs	cron
cron jobs are automatic and cannot rely on any human interaction

4176159
textview	listactivity
i have two textview a listview this is a listactivity by the way and a datepicker

4176168
post	get
and since you can t dynamically tell the client that the input is wrong via javascript you ll have to go through a post validate get page reload cycle to tell the client the input was invalid

4176177
minimum	max
i tried to find the minimum execution time for each pk and then find the max but i doubt my solution is dynamic programming since there is no recursive formula

4176185
put	get
i m struggling to get a design like i put in this image in css

4176292
post	get
i have re-done the 2 date pickers but still cant get the post to function

4176292
post	get
no matter how i write the get or post function it does not work.

4176294
width	height
you will need to complete the code for instance you have to give a width and height to the relativelayout tag put your textviews etc.

4176302
hide	show
only other way that i can think of is to re-write all three of your pages and combine them into one then you can use javascript to show and hide part of the page and you can use media print css stylesheet to show all of them when the document is being printed

4176308
min	max
the values are strings and i need them to be decimals 2 decimal points and also the min and the max for price and low accross all the rows

4176332
min	max
try to figure out max min yourself

4176361
width	height
an application can build scroll bars for a certain height or width and not actually render anything to the surface until the user actual drags the scroll bar

4176366
x86	mips
you can cross-compile the gcc so that it generates mips code instead of x86

4176375
keydown	keyup
you need to implement keyup and keydown events

4176390
getter	setter
a poco is simply a class that represents your data however it s not just bags of getter and setter

4176390
getter	setter
they are only bags of getter and setter

4176456
serializable	deserialization
don t spend all your time fretting about serializable and deserialization

4176534
strlen	strcpy
i ran some tests of it against strcpy + strlen and your custom algorithm and in my environment it beat both

4176534
strlen	strcpy
i don t know how well it will work in yours though since for me your algorithm runs much faster than you saw and strcpy + strlen much slower 14.4s for the former vs

4176550
google-chrome	firefox
couldn t believe it at first but tested in google-chrome and firefox

4176566
fossil	git
interestingly enough but recently after i ve asked this question fossil got import export commands so that now it s possible to use git s fast-import export protocol

4176574
openssl	libcrypto
i am looking for a js crypto lib similar to say openssl s libcrypto that facilitates digital signing of data in the browser

4176581
shadowing	named
as for named shadowing - i think it s generally good to avoid if you can - seeing map in the middle of some code will lead most haskellers to expect the standard library fn

4176617
post	get
looks like you actually want to get not to post the params

4176706
put	get
you don t want to put them in the webapp tree because they will get clobbered if your webapp is redeployed

4176707
children	parent
how can i dynamically list all children under their respective parent such as.

4176710
uiview	subviews
generally we use empty uiview at the top of hierarchy and put the subviews inside which is uilabel in your case

4176715
cout	ofstream
like cout your instance of ofstream shares the behaviour of ostream which already has a suitable operator for strings and can be used exactly as cout

4176715
std	ostream
if you need to stream an object that doesn t have overloaded for std ostream then you you will need to overload the operator like this

4176728
median	minimum
and i ve only seen it be able to plot a minimum and a maximum together with a data point in between presumably for an average and i see no good way of fitting the median and deviation into that model

4176743
width	height
alternatively if you actually want to know what those width and height values were for example to populate tag attributes

4176761
getter	setter
changing the getter and the setter to use an integer object does the trick

4176762
typedef	struct
i m new to cuda c and am trying to pass a typedef d struct into a kernel

4176764
trie	tree
auto-suggest is usually done using the data-structures trie or radix-tree .here is a good implementation of radix tree .for zk frame work check this link

4176843
x86	64bit
also if you are using 64bit os you will need to change both paths to use program files x86

4176847
ati	nvidia
it s difficult to know the exact details of everything that s going on because nvidia and ati are relatively tight-lipped but the key thing is that gpus are made for massively parallel execution

4176849
cvs	svn
the tool cvs2hg might also help to convert to mercurial if you can convert from svn to cvs without information loss

4176871
post	get
the date shows in the box but it does not get or post anything to the div tag.

4176883
scheme	racket
currently learning scheme racket and have problem running this piece of code

4176887
pull	push
i ve created a .net wrapper that simplifies using exchange push pull notifications in your own applications

4176945
maya	blender
remember that that the representation of a model in max maya or blender is very different than the run time version

4177005
width	height
if you use absolute positioning you will need to listen to the resize event and then start calculating the height width x y of each element

4177053
median	minimum
a standard way to display median statistics is the box-and-whisker -plot which shows minimum first quartile median third quartile and maximum

4177053
median	minimum
this assumes that your data file has the columns x-value minimum first quartile median third quartile maximum in that order

4177069
post	get
when my facebook app post to the users stream those post do not get links for like and comment

4177095
folder	directory
select your source folder and click add tree to add the whole directory structure to the project

4177097
mouseover	mouseout
so basically i want the mouseover mouseout functionality to be disabled when the input box has focus and then when it doesn t have focus anymore re-enable the mouseover mouseout functionality

4177138
put	get
if top is neither put sentinel in top get value from result put result - next in top delete result

4177186
bluetooth	usb
that is given a local machine with a standard usb keyboard plugged into it other devices could discover this machine and use it as a bluetooth keyboard

4177214
onfocus	onblur
more generally to detect whether an element has focus you might want to flag it somehow in its onfocus handler and clear the flag in its onblur handler

4177272
dotnetzip	sharpziplib
for zips you can use public libraries like sharpziplib or dotnetzip

4177325
put	get
if i put just ccelda.setvalue myvalue works great but i need to get the value from the bean that the reason i use the valueexpression

4177326
wxpython	pygtk
and if you need some gui you can opt for wxpython pygtk or something similar

4177327
folder	directory
however i want the client s html and css files which reside in the resources folder to be copied to the server projects webapp directory

4177341
folder	directory
will create a new folder called myproject inside your current working directory with a default skeleton structure

4177361
int	double
try not to think of a union as a variant type that can be either a byte or a double or an int depending on which member you happened to write most recently

4177399
serializable	deserialization
in that case it s usually better to create a dedicated serializable deserialization function rather than relying on any particular memory layout

4177410
getter	setter
to best understand these things you should study the use of property s assign and retain and the code behind the synthesized setter and getter

4177418
cublas	magma
for dense matrix operations you could consider cublas provided with the cuda toolkit magma and culatools

4177429
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
it can t be interface inherited subtyping since by only inheriting a subset of attributes a subclassing instance would not be substitutable for a superclass instance

4177429
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
for example assume the superclass exposed properties a that the subclassing didn t inherited

4177429
superclass	subclassing
at run time a variable v declared as the superclass type gets bound to an instance of the subclassing

4177452
uiview	subviews
the easiest way to fix this is to set the view of photoviewcontroller to a regular uiview and add the scrollview as a subviews of this uiview

4177482
tabcontrol	tabitem
if i set the path stretch property to fill it will stretch so much that each tabitem header will be the same width as the tabcontrol - which mean only one very wide tabitem header per line.

4177518
ati	nvidia
nvidia opencl ati opencl amd opencl cpu are just three different implementations of the same api opencl

4177548
google-chrome	firefox
after that in firefox and google-chrome it works fine whereas in ie8 i see the following issue

4177577
cout	ofstream	cout	cin	ofstream	cin
to write to the file rather than reading from it you basically need to change the type of file to an output stream ofstream file to cin and cout to file

4177665
hide	show
then you can listen to openlayers.map zoomend event and show hide right geometry from your array depending on zoom level

4177698
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i need to do this on firefox safari google-chrome and ie mac and windows

4177794
inherited	properties
i m trying to call a properties in a class that is inherited from my baseclass but it doesn t work

4177794
inherited	properties
as you see i m trying to call the _productnetto properties that is inherited from my produkt class

4177808
qthread	qmutex
than qthread qmutex blablabla.

4177863
hide	show
then you can show hide or swap the two views within that container

4177878
width	height
now i want to add sliders for controlling the grid parameters nb raws nb columns tile width tile height ... and these parameters influence the size of the custom view

4177882
nltk	mallet
a quick glance at the nltk source code suggests that modules that depend on mallet in particular might be problematic since this is compiled java code

4177897
mouse	keyboard
it is especially a problem for keyboard input but mouse input has trouble too

4177922
mp3	wav
i need to know if my file is audio file mp3 wav etc..

4177923
config	ini
i need to create an ini file-invoke c script that will create a config file which i need for the test i m writing

4177933
operands	scalar
operandn not matter whether the operands are scalar variables or nested expressions

4177961
folder	directory
i think the slightly more proper modern way it way is to put a non hidden file under a folder with your apps name under the the config directory directory

4177991
public	protected
my classes are event driven so for example the public mouseclick calls the protected onmouseclick

4178001
clang	llvm
that said many compiler suites like gcc and even more so like the upcoming clang + llvm use an intermediate form to decouple the bit that knows about the specifics of one architecture from the bit that knows the specifics of a particular language

4178012
livequery	jqtransform	jquery	jqtransform
the baseline contains dozens of js files with easily over 10 000 custom lines of code they also use multiple 3rd party libraries such as jquery livequery jqtransform and others

4178028
width	height
these two values could be used to represent a position as well as a width and height

4178041
post	get
being very new to jsp i was wondering if there was any possibility to get only get or only post parameters from the http request

4178041
post	get
i have seen servletrequest.getparameter and alikes but it seems that those methods get both get and post parameters

4178041
post	get
and if not is there any precedence rule which values overwrite which like post parameters always overwriting get parameters

4178053
post	get
it would return get or post

4178055
post	get
in jsp you can look at the request object to determine what kind of request it was get or post but there s only one parameter map

4178059
button	checkbox
created a tablelayoutpanel set to 4 rows 4 columns and randomly populated with button textboxes radiocontrols checkbox

4178073
invalidoperationexception	argumentexception
instead you should throw an argumentexception invaliddataexception or invalidoperationexception

4178137
inherited	properties
the object already has an inherited properties called tostring and things would get very weird very quickly.

4178160
x86	64bit	x86	mips
the precompiled binary you will find in an ubuntu system knows about x86 possibly both 32-bit and 64bit modes but not mips

4178160
debian	linux
you can use it to run a virtual machine with a mips processor and within that machine install an operating system for mips debian a linux distribution

width	height
you d need to hardcode the initial values might replace an unintended similar string the code doesn t really communicate your intention to change height width not to manipulate strings

4178329
width	height
you would have to know which instances of vector2 are representing a starting point and which ones are representing a width height

4178331

they also support a min and a max value

for-loop	loops
i don t want to give you all the specifics but it will take another for-loop and the nested for-loop for printing needs to be independent of any other loops occuring when everything else is done

4178485
cpu	processors
even reading a single byte presents a quite small chance the another processors will come along and modify it before you re doing reading it except in some cases that deals with cpu cache and aligned chunks of memory fun thread interesting read

an individual floating-point division instruction will take longer than an integer one

for this table the max date and min date values seem logical to me but i am confused about how the recordid and httpmethod where chosen

4178833
width	margin
provide a width to the #body element in the link above and center it using margin 0px auto

4178863

4178931
hash	salt
to mitigate this you could hash your password preferably with a salt

4178931
hash	salt
well in order to mitigate a rainbow attack you can use a salt in other words another value added to the password that will create a different hash

4178931
hash	salt
a simple salt can be the username store hash username + password instead of hash password

4178931
hash	salt
now since hash are fast to compute the salt should be hidden somehow

4178931
hash	salt
well evil eve will have a tough time penetrating your login screen by now hash passwords with salt and iterations and all

4178948
children	parent
you ll need to get the children first and the parent of the parent control and then add the children back to the parent of the parent control

4178981
terminate	timeout
i ideally would like to have a separate processes handle the locking and releasing of a particular lock the idea being that i can use the timeout argument in gen_server to terminate the process if no one has requested it after n amount time so that only currently relevant locks will stay in memory

4179045

my game works in landscape only and when turning off the screen the android screensaver takes the control in portrait mode thus sending an orientationchange that destroys and recreates the activity

on second reading of your question i see that ultimately you want to send simulated mouse and keyboard events to an application running in the background in which case sendmessage postmessage may be more appropriate apis

profiling	benchmarking
ruby s benchmarking and profiling tools are certainly not the most advanced in the programming ecosystem but they get the job done

4179551
accessor	properties
those that don t provide call handlers and properties accessor for reflective methodinfo and propertyinfo evaluation respectively

4179561

mdpi	hdpi
i have created multiple bitmaps - one for each folder mdpi hdpi ldpi

4179646
stdout	fflush
i still don t know why it was doing that but fflush stdout before it loops again solves the problem

4179659
ienumerable	ilist
so you re definitely going to need to have some code in your viewmodel to do this transformation and at the same time you can populate an observablecollection instead of an ilist or ienumerable

4179666
mouseover	mouseout
you re really close here but it s only detecting the mouseover and mouseout right as you cross the borders of the circles because they re not filled in

4179687
rubygems	rvm
check the rvm prerequisites page then follow the installation directions including the parts about modifying your account s start-up script and then read the part about installing rubygems

4179708
keydown	keyup
in the demo i have a keydown and keyup handler

4179708
keydown	keyup
however the problem are the backspace and arrow keys - they will also expand the text-box on keydown and only on keyup the text-box size will be corrected

4179717
int	chars
note that c is declared int not chars because eof has a value that is distinct from all chars that can be stored in a chars

multiplying	add
that last line will allow you to re-use the same code for the movements multiplying the values you have to add to the current position to get to the new one by the variable

4179818
width	height
nsimage has a size method returning an nssize struct containing the width and height of the image or if the size couldn t be determined

4179818
width	height
i have placed explicit casts to double because on some systems 64-bit especially the width and height members may not be float types but double and we would be providing the wrong types to nslog

4179827
filesystems	ntfs
they will not transfer off of the ntfs filesystems well

4179856
try-catch	exception-handling
window.parent.location window.frameelement in try-catch statement which you can use to handle the exception-handling yourself

4179958
gmail	hotmail
sure it s possible otherwise gmail and hotmail and yahoo wouldn t have been able to do it

4180023
int	double
as a side note if you d prefer that end up being an int instead of an int and be a rational instead of a double you can use a default declaration to override the default defaulting rules

4180056
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
in all other browsers i ve tried google-chrome firefox opera in that context - and helpfully as well

rss	feed
i am using python s feedparser module to parse an rss feed

4180281
cdr	cons
this can be done by writing a simple recursive function that uses cons to prepend the item to the first list using car to get the first list and then uses cons again to prepend the extended list to the result of calling the function on the other lists on the cdr of the list of lists

4180289
width	height
where size is height or width depending on what is bigger

4180307
width	height
i have noticed that i tend to removed the width and height attributes because they are a pain when i tweak an image so best to only use if necessary

4180315
width	height
i d say it s good practice to leave the width and height attributes in so that the page doesn t keep shifting around as the images load

4180315
width	height
i suppose you could do it with css instead or put the width height on some container element.

4180324
onclick	onmousedown
use onmousedown insted of onclick

4180324
onclick	onmousedown
in spite of using wmode transparent some browsers still wont call the onclick but they do call onmousedown

4180326
put	get
if you really think this is an option at least create a separate assembly with a namespace myapp.entityorm or whatever put all your repository classes there and get rid of the ef prefix

4180336

i have a fairly simple flex swc module that is compiled via the maven flexmojos plugin

4180598
vbscript	jscript
this lib provides me with functions to define the type of scripting language such as jscript and vbscript and i can supply it with script code and have that executed with passing arguments in and back

4180599
portrait	landscape
instead the behavior is exactly the same in landscape as in portrait with a uibarbuttonitem on the left side of a uitoolbar at the top of the screen bringing up a uipopovercontroller with the master view controller s view

4180599
viewdidload	viewwillappear
the problem is that none of the uiviewcontroller lifecycle methods ever get called besides viewdidload viewwillappear viewdidunload etc.

4180599
uinavigationcontroller	uiwindow	uiviewcontroller	uiwindow	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
it seems that the only times a uiviewcontroller -derived class acts like a uiviewcontroller is when it is added as a subview of the app s uiwindow or to a container class like uinavigationcontroller or uisplitviewcontroller

4180619
put	get
put framebuffer and renderbuffer somewhere you can get to them again at the relevant moment and you should also

4180661
uiview	subviews
if doing this with uiview probably not the high-performance choice you are probably going to define one big view that can handle all the tiles and tile them onto the view add and remove subviews setting the large view s frame to define your camera position

4180672
pop-up	dialog
i have a issue with a jquery datepicker pop-up dialog being clipped by an iframe as shown in this image

4180694
versioning	upgrade
i m using grails 1.2.2 because i couldn t upgrade my app to the most recent versioning i spent a few hours on it and then i threw in the sponge

4180695
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
for debugging or trying out quick javascript i find safari s and google-chrome s built-in development tools handy but on firefox it s firebug all the way

4180715
keydown	keyup
the thing you have to remember is that you can t reliably tell anything at all about any character that may be typed in a keydown or keyup event that all has to be done in a keypress handler

4180715
opera	firefox
you will need to have separate paste event handler although this event isn t supported in firefox 3.0 opera and very old webkit browsers

4180723
post	get
usually you want to execute a post and not a get when you are sending a form back

4180746
rss	feed
all the information i could find regarding generating rss feed gives examples where an indeterminate number of items is returned

4180794
folder	directory
so the url - - might correspond to a service file called myservice.svc that is in folder c which is in folder b which is in folder a which is in the root directory of the web site that is listening at port 80 this is the default value and can be left out on the server called mywebserver which resides on the domain mydomain

4180799
ienumerable	ilist
and list it implement many interface like ienumerable ilist etc

4180815
listview	gridview
however using a listview with a gridview isn t what i want

4180816
sorting	grouping
i don t see a way to have the items ordered in a particular way that they can be grouping since i m already ordering sorting them by date because the date order is messed up by the first grouping

4180850
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i can confirm that it works in firefox opera google-chrome

4180863
width	margin
the css box model defines width as the width of the content excluding border padding and margin

4180912
folder	directory
i don t like virtual subdomain mechanism to create subdomain because it willl mess up the folder structure belongs to virtual directory

4180916
imagemagick	magick++
unfortunately i need to be using magick++ the c++ interface api for imagemagick but i can t seem to get the equivalent operation in magick++

4180945
post	get
you can either pass your post parameters via get along with the pagination data and look for them in either or or if you re feeling saucy or create your pagination control as a postable form

4180952
post	get
looks to me like when you click on a link you no longer have the post data being sent it becomes a simple get request

4180970
tinyint	boolean
tinyint 1 - it looks like a boolean so make it one

4180982
tinyint	boolean
boolean is an alias for tinyint 1 and is stored as one byte of data

4180985
postgresql	mysql
i don t think either of these situations is supported by common databases like mysql postgresql sqlite etc

4181003
lxml	beautifulsoup
i use lxml for xml parsing but i use beautifulsoup for html

4181040
mouse	keyboard
in the first it says that in version 4.9.5.5 they added an option for mouse hints disabling - maybe it will work for keyboard too

4181081
servicepoint	httpwebrequest
a quick look at httpwebrequest with reflector shows that it doesn t differentiate servicepoint objects based on the proxy credentials

4181136
google-chrome	safari
this will work with the current versions of safari and google-chrome

4181152
int	chars
i have a chars pointer and i want to display an int value

4181155
uiview	calayer
when you commit an animation the properties on the uiview or calayer are set straight away

4181173
int	chars
no it s generally wrong because a chars is only 1 byte while an int is typically 4 bytes

4181173
int	chars
the correct way to do it would be to get the chars value first and then cast it to an int

4181173
int	chars
of course in this case an explicit cast may not be necessary at all as the chars value will implicitly get promoted to an int

4181176
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
since microsoft only expose apis in c# silverlight and firefox safari google-chrome are coded by c c++

4181251
foldable	traversable
traversable and foldable supply useful methods for running computations over collections

4181258
hash	salt
i use a hash and a salt for my password encryption it s the same hash that asp.net membership uses

4181287
post	get
ps i know there is a better actual objective-c way of getting an objects properties i even found a post with this get an object properties list in objective-c

4181291
put	get
i would log print the key val you put in and then log print the key val you try to get out

4181309
put	get
i think this would not be very hard to get this behavior out of edit texts that i put into my own application but i am wanting to add this option to any edit text inside any application on my phone

4181309
pop-up	dialog
edit 150 bounty i am looking to add an item to the edittext pop-up dialog when it is long pressed

4181324
centos	linux
webserver is xampp for linux centos 5.5

4181360
identifier	ambiguous
in mysql it s used to surround identifier when they might otherwise be ambiguous such as using a reserved word as a table or column name

4181363
gridview	objectdatasource
i ve researched and see there are default paging for gridview which is not very efficient my report table may have thousands of records and custom paging but this requires using objectdatasource which i don t use

4181446
google-chrome	safari
by default safari has 3rd-party cookies disabled but google-chrome has them enabled by default

4181446
google-chrome	safari
safari does not store content in the dom google-chrome does

4181446
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome uses the v8 javascript engine safari uses nitro

4181451
google-chrome	safari
they use different javascript engine google-chrome v8 safari nitro

4181480
google-chrome	safari
even different versions of google-chrome will behave differently same for different versions of safari

4181568
realloc	malloc
for example a struct inside a struct when you need to malloc both of them and realloc both of them

4181578
hide	show	width	height
you should use height or width transition in order to show and hide second level menu

4181578
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
works perfect in opera 10.7 without transitions in firefox 3.6.12 and doesn t at all in google-chrome 7.0.517.41

4181618
width	height
here i have defined a relative layout the layout will occupy the full screen s width and height

4181621
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
i m still not getting any errors other than the undefined in the second sample when trying the sample code so i can t say for certain what will fix it but here s an approach that simplifies things and gets rid of the arrays indexing operation use a foreach loops rather than a for-loop

4181738
int	chars
fgetc returns an int and not a chars

4181768
getter	setter
if you hover over the corresponding control in ib you can see the declaration and brief documentation on the method that it triggers usually the getter rather than the setter but it s easy enough to infer one from the other

4181909
getter	setter
but you ll have to define the getter and setter yourself

4181920
setinterval	settimeout
if you want to change the period after generating each number use settimeout rather than setinterval

4181923
folder	directory
i ve tried deleting the talent folder and recreating it just mkdir talent but i still can t get is_dir to accept that it is a directory

4181954
int	double
don t forget that the range of int is much smaller than the range of double

4181954
int	double
a cast from double to int won t throw an exception if the value is outside the range of int in an unchecked context whereas a call to convert.toint32 double will

4181966
put	get	post	get	post	put
i don t care about the verb types get post put delete because for example if somebody wants to delete a record i want them to be able to simply type in a url into their browser to delete

4181994
textview	imageview
each row has a mix of imageview and textview

4182017
idictionary	ilist
it will be a ilist of idictionary s so it should be in this form

4182024
lua	scheme
however i have heard that android also supports scheme python lua and others but never could find it verified or an actual list

4182033
typedef	struct
it s pretty rare in c++ but common in c where struct foo does not automatically alias to just foo . you might see it in a library that has different classes for different platforms a canvas class which is very implementation-specific. the library would use the typedef to let its users simplify their code

4182054
min	max
i need to select all numbers n integers between min and max

4182054
min	max
let s say min 5 max 9

4182079
restrict	shared
but if one shared hosting client will be given an exception then there will be another respectively with access to common system restrict functionalities and areas

4182112
min	max
and if you know min and max then directly put those instead of nested query

4182124
width	height
now consider the textview if you make layout_height wrap_content it will take the height of the text and the width will be limited to whatever you provided..........

4182131
udp	tcp
by the way please stop suggesting tcp over udp

4182146
octal	decimal
in these lines you have used a decimal constant 666 where you should have used an octal constant 0666

4182152
ubuntu	linux
i m running ubuntu linux and trying to compile native code for android using the ndk

4182168
udp	tcp
make up a secnod connection udp or tcp based that you use only to send control commands

4182186
disk	ram
note i ran the tests with php 5.3.3 and used a ram disk as my temp folder

4182195
hash	md5
this example get md5 hash in a few lines of java has a related example

4182198
octal	decimal
which will get rid of all the cr characters in your file 15 octal is 13 decimal

4182306
children	parent
in other words because the parent ul has a gray background i want its children to be on top of that gray background

4182325
int	boolean
if you convert the int into a string it shouldn t be any difficult all you need is an operator that the std string class provides and an array of boolean for recording which element has already been checked

4182354
hash	md5
however it should be noted that the md5 hash is not really an integer in any useful sense

4182354
hash	md5
i guess you are just doing this so that you can print or order the md5 hash

4182411
h.264	webm
i know about h.264 ogg and some webm never heart about it

4182423
svg	vml
afaik they now use svg for non-ie browsers mozilla svg and ie uses vml up to and including ie9 beta vml on wikipedia

4182423
svg	vml
using firebug or the ie developer tools you can see the svg svg tags vml shape tags markup

4182423
svg	vml
i expect its a combination of normally rendered svg vml markup with the live changes eg

4182424
getter	setter
just rename it to relatedproducts and the respective setter getter

4182433
perforce	cvs
but in my scm configuration i couldn t find git option and see only cvs perforce and subversion

4182437
pop-up	dialog
right-click on the start group and select add dialog from the pop-up menu

4182456
post	get
but for your case when you post form a and controller a processes post you might get into validation problems and that s when you return view on a post action and that s why form b is rendered via its post method

4182464
fadein	fadeout
i want to override jquery s fadein and fadeout effects when page loads

4182476
integer	unsigned
therefore c99 will have a unsigned integer wrapping which does not

4182483
slider	jcarousel
i have a div for displaying images placed at the center of a page and below that div i ve added slider displaying image thumbnails using jcarousel clicking on thumbnail images from the slider displays the bigger image inside a div positioned just above the slider and this is done using ajax i mean i m just changing the content of div to display selected image but whenever i click on thumbnail in slider for loading image the page gets scrolled and image is displayed what could be the problem pls suggest

4182486

int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

4182614
fadein	fadeout
you can override fadein and fadeout ..

4182634

you can put data in intent with intent.putextra .. and get data with intent.getxyzextra .. where xyz dependt on the type can be string int array etc

4182664
pull	push
i will be needing to both pull data and push data to and from the server

4182700
ceil	floor
methods floor and ceil can be easily implemented based on this solution

4182788
min	max
the first two arrays known_xx to the second two min max

4182821
inherited	subclassing
sourcetype and destinationtype are slightly suspect -- this might be a case where subclassing class inherited might be suitable later on

4182862
post	get
you could set either a target _blank or a javascript popup link to that action and submit the blog via get or post

4182880
udp	tcp
i want to develop a chat application with a server client model opening tcp or udp sockets in visual basic 2008

4182892
int	chars
the problem in your code is that you already convert the int value to a chars and test the chars

4182904
int	chars
type mismatch cannot convert from int to chars

4182937
ssl	https
if you want to see what is send received by your application but https hides it then you can use normal http query with stunel which adds ssl to socket transmission

4182943
equals	gethashcode
or are you just trying to understand how gethashcode and equals relate to each other

4183007
freebsd	linux
linux and freebsd solutions are both welcome thanks

4183110
public	protected
class b can t do it you must make x protected or public for that

width	height
all folderbuttons are fixed width and height

4183205
udp	tcp
despite your proposal that i don t suggest tcp over udp i have to

4183244
int	boolean
public view getchildview int groupposition int childposition boolean islastchild

4183291
int	chars
int comparisons and arrays can be optimised to use register specific instructions so a lot of sort search may happen inside the cpu cache directly - with strings multiple method invocations may be needed to access chars check length etc

4183342
width	height
get coordinates is a custom function of mine to get left top width height zindex of an element

4183361
min	max
you d probably have to modify the control yourself to take in an array of acceptable dates which might not be that difficult as it seems as you could use the min max functionality as a starting point

4183377
onkeyup	onkeydown
i have overridden onkeydown onkeyup for one of my activities in order to capture the volume keys press events and manipulate the sound of the application

4183404
stdout	stderr
this background program can be given input command via stdin and use stdout and stderr to keep printing out output and error messages

4183419
width	height
instead of specifying the width and height of a raphael canvas i need it to be 100 the size of its container

4183444
hash	md5
what i am trying to do is hash md5 inside php the javascript variable

4183456
gprof	callgrind
you need to run some form of third-party tool against your binary something like quantify ibm or callgrind or as paul r mentioned above gprof

4183470
hash	md5
there are several md5 solutions out there for javascript but it s not the same if you want the variable hash before it reaches the user

4183471
getter	setter
the setter method has to have the same name as the getter

4183476
apk	dex
those that compile translate directly to dex opcodes without too big of 3rd party lib contained in the apk are of course better performance wise

4183493
width	height
if you are using a div then you could use css to set that to 100 of the width and height

4183543
google-chrome	firefox
is not showing up when i inspect the element in firefox google-chrome

4183553
filtering	grouping
you can use jquery or a js framework of your choice to filtering grouping client side or if your getting the data from a database such as mysql you can grouping the data from the query before rendering it to the client

4183625
put	get
microsoft has a script debugger that is actually pretty good once you get it running but in this case a more primitive but simple and effective method is to put an alert into the source code until the point is reached where things crash

4183636
config	ini
the neat thing with this approach is that you can have different types in your config files and as long as they are formatted as ini files then this will work

4183683
uilabel	uitextview
find uicontrollers that draw nsattributedstring because uilabel uitextview do not support nsattributedstring

4183738
maven	pom.xml
if you d like it to maven add the following dependency to your pom.xml

4183763
textview	imageview
you can do it yourself using a linearlayout an imageview and a textview

4183775
keydown	keyup
keydown and keyup cannot be used reliably for this purpose

4183797
sorting	grouping
if this data comes from a database you might want to look at using a grouping by clause there and save yourself the trouble of sorting on the server

4183814
internationalization	localization
after that internationalization and localization see

4183828
cpu	processors
i having a high mysql cpu usage on server intel r xeon r cpu e5520 2.27ghz 16 core of processors and 16 g.b ram running on centos 5.4

4183883
for-loop	loops
replace your while loops with a for-loop with the same number of runs as you wish the original number has digits including leading zeros

4183894
cvs	svn
supports svn cvs git mercurial and archive

4183911
filtering	grouping
if it is in the grouping what you can try is to eliminate the filtering for the computer name on the filtering and iterate over the resultset in order to find out if your element is there

4183953
domxpath	domdocument
use domxpath for this along with domdocument or simplexml

4183978
protovis	infovis
i ve looked at infovis toolkit and protovis but i d have to implement a custom layout for them and a lot of custom code

4183982
aggregate-functions	sum
the sum and total aggregate-functions return sum of all non-null values in the group

4184044
gif	png
i would like these diagrams to be specified in javadoc blocks and then converted into png gif images attached to api html

4184086
superclass	subclassing
now threat this new subclassing as if it were a single but specialized version of its superclass

4184086
titlebar	window
for the case of a window s titlebar look with a pixmap background and buttons try a window with an image and a fixed container to hold the buttons

4184089
decoder	encoder
mostly tv tuner cards uses windows media encoder to encode the format that they are receiving from cable so that tv tuner software can decoder it and display in playable format

4184185
ironruby	ironpython
ironpython and ironruby were implemented on top of the dlr as is c# 4 s dynamic feature

4184195
maven-antrun-plugin	pom.xml
my first attempt was to hook the maven-antrun-plugin which calls the createrepo command to the parent pom.xml s the super-pom deploy phase

4184206
width	height
you can validate image width height on the client side but that does not guarantee anything because it s easy to manipulate circumvent

4184246
explode	implode
if it s not you should explode it mysql_real_escape_string each value and implode back

4184280
free	malloc
however the malloc s and free s don t add up

4184280
free	malloc
sometimes i see a free on a memory block that pass through didn t the malloc hook before

4184280
free	malloc
but i also see that malloc sometimes returns a pointer that it has returned before and there has been no free in meantime at least my free hook wasn t called

4184280
free	malloc
so my guess is that certain malloc s and free s are not passed through my hooks

4184280
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
implementing malloc realloc free and calling the libc versions using dlsym rtld_next malloc didn t work either

4184326
fpdf	fpdi
the following code shows how to use fpdf and fpdi to fill an existing gift coupon with the user data

4184351
children	parent
the parent class holds a list of children

4184351
children	parent
i want all children to hold a reference to the parent so every child holds a parent pointer

4184382
onclicklistener	ontouchevent
to comment the onclicklistener of listview and writing the same logic in any ontouchevent

4184395
getter	setter
i want to add a property that has a getter and a setter and does a bunch of things via code block

4184408
centos	linux
server is linux centos 5 with dual core processor

4184411
std	ostream
i don t see any advantage into using this class versus simply using the std ostream interface

4184413
put	get
or is it necessary to put name new textbox name so that i can get all their values

4184430
innodb	myisam
however one could arrange things in such a way that myisam tables are only secondary data sets into which one dumps texts already existing in innodb tables such that the myisam tables could be rebuilt from scratch when needed

4184430
freebsd	solaris
a pretty good solution therefore seems to be mysql on solaris zfs or on freebsd ufs

4184478
mersenne-twister	random
i use mersenne-twister to generate pseudo random numbers

4184497
memcpy	memmove
for example memcpy memmove and the like usually implement some variation of this algorithm copy words halfwords bytes using gp registers until you hit 16 byte alignment then use sse to copy 4 words at a time that s 16 chars at a time provided sizeof char 1

4184497
memcpy	strcpy
then again you can also test the performance of your implementation vs memcpy strcpy and see what you get

4184515
pthreads	usleep
usleep is deprecated and has been deleted from the most recent pthreads standard

4184565
mayavi	matplotlib
i have successfully frozen a mayavi matplotlib traits app on mac using py2app and windows using py2exe starting from the enthought python distribution but it wasn t easy

4184594
onclick	onsubmit
you could disable it for all links forms on the page by removing the window.onbeforeunload handler in each link s onclick handler or onsubmit for forms

4184595
qgraphicsview	qdockwidget	qgraphicsview	qmainwindow	qmainwindow	qdockwidget
the game itself is displayed by qgraphicsview qdockwidget in a qmainwindow

4184595
qmainwindow	qpushbutton
but now i m trying to make a menu for it so i thought to make an extra qmainwindow with qpushbutton

4184595
qgraphicsview	qdockwidget
so when i click new game in the menu the game qgraphicsview qdockwidget is immediately and in the same window displayed without first shutting down the menu-window and then showing the game-window

4184688
versioning	upgrade
the recommended solution is to simply upgrade to a versioning not affected by the bug however if you absolutely need to support 9.6x you can easily detect the exception and fall back to using postmessage for cross-domain communication

4184754
width	height
considering the third approach it might simply work if you change width to height

4184793
for-loop	loops
you are using a for-loop where you are trying to loops through a variable row that is never defined

4184797
children	parent
inside the iterator i ve created a current node instance and iterate with a for-loop over all children and then get back to the parent

4184802
switching	screens
the thing is that it is buggyâ actually it doesnâ t seem to work at all when you click on it type a letter you get autocompletion you choose a value the text property gets filled with it alright but the keyboard never goes off either after taping elsewhere or switching the screens â

4184959
width	height
at runtime based on a condition i want to change the height and width properties to another value using code behind

4184975
post	get
i just wanted to update this post with this information so people get the whole story

4184980
children	parent
i m trying to implement hibernate mapping using annotations but during the saving of my parent object and its children i noticed that an update statement is being called instead of an insert statement

4184987
for-loop	arrays
to load the thumbnails i have created a for-loop for the arrays of thumbnails and the number of the image is recorded by the variable noofimage

4185032
aggregate-functions	sum
the example uses the sum aggregate-functions but you just need to reference the column name and it will duplicate it in your datatable

4185045
int	chars
as others said comparing int is a single sub instruction while to compare two strings they have to be pushed by reference on the stack the function called the function entry code performed then a loop over the chars performed the function exit code performed then the return followed by a single sub instruction

4185181
hash	salt
store salt+hash in one column or store salt and hash in two columns

4185181
hash	salt
personally i would store it as a single column because it is unlikely you will ever be retrieving just salt or just the hash

4185181
hash	salt
also if you update the salt then hash needs to be updated also and when updating the hash you might as well update the salt

4185209
integer	unsigned
vhdl is strongly-typed so if count is representing a number and with a name like that it better had be use either a signed or unsigned vector or an integer

4185218
inherited	subclassing
otherwise if you can t change the schema you could try creating a view that does the join and use table_per_class inherited and map the subclassing to the view

4185240
folder	directory
directory to the folder where the file

4185273
post	get
i m trying to get all the html content inside the post div but excluding the title byline submissions buttons and tags sections

4185273
post	get
i get back the entire content of the post div including the unwanted headers divs

4185302
width	height
i think the easiest way to achieve this is probably to bind the width and height of the image to two properties

4185302
width	height
if you want to change the width and height of all images you can use two properties in code behind and if you want to be able to do it individually then just do the same but bind against properties in the collection items

4185302
width	height
this way the listboxitems will increase decrease in size with the width height of the images

4185365
folder	directory
that path is just an empty folder in xcode that i use to house the projects from the other directory

4185392
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval and settimeout it will do what you want in conjunction with jquery

4185465
sorting	filtering
in particular it says in the examples area there is a demonstration of a sorting algorithm making use of exactly this technique to interpose yet another coordinate system where the order of the rows is changed rather than the order of the columns. you might compare what you re doing with the relevant example in sorting and filtering

4185493
inherited	properties
length is a properties inherited from javascript

4185523
client-side	server-side
i did a bunch of research and stumbled across things like httpresponses and httpservletresponses in java but have no idea how to bridge the gap between the client-side and server-side to use that effectively

4185534
rss	feed
i use nutch 1.1 not trunk to parse rss feed

4185535
pbkdf2	salt
obviously you shouldn t use the source straight as the salt instead use a key derivation function like pbkdf2

4185556
google-chrome	firefox
it currently only works in firefox or google-chrome since it uses javascript filereader and html canvas to generate the sprites inside the web browser without uploads

4185558
inherited	properties
-for each view object get all properties each view in fact will inherited from a special base one specialview for example

4185640
put	get
when i put this command in firebug i get this element

4185679
serializable	deserialization
the basics of deserialization are simple just like the basics of serializable are simple--once you know the trick

4185705
google-chrome	firefox
however with ecmascript 5th edition implementations ie 9 google-chrome 7 firefox 4 you can use object.getownpropertynames to get an array of property names for a specific object

4185720
pbkdf2	salt
if you use a derived salt as opposed to random salt the salt source should be strengthened by using a key derivation function like pbkdf2

4185720
pbkdf2	salt
thus if your username is theunhandledexception pass that through pbkdf2 for x iterations to generate a 32 bit or whatever length salt you need value

4185720
pbkdf2	salt
make x pseudo random as opposed to even numbers like 1 000 and pass in a static site specific salt to the pbkdf2 and you make it highly improbable that your username salt will match any other site s username salt

4187218
int	double
as many people have said a 64bit int is probably not worth it if double is an option

4187218
int	double
if you need additional precision in long sums of floats you should keep in mind that this operation is sometimes problematic with floats and double and would be more exact on int

pdfbox	itext
i have never used pdfbox but since it s under the covers using itext which in turn should already be supporting unicode utf-8 i think that part is fine

4187307
width	height
found the problem example works good but needs equal dimensions for width and height

4187326
ssl	https
the issue is that the authentication is performed using ssl https and since there is a different set of properties for the https proxy this didn t work

free	malloc
if some other thread calls malloc free while the hooks are unhooked you won t see that call

4187554
free	malloc
your mutex doesn t help as while unhooked a malloc free call won t call your hook function so won t wait on the mutex

blob blurs for small lengths as the engine may optimize the storage and pull a blob in-row or push an in-row value into the small blob allocation unit but this is just an implementation detail

4187989
rss	feed
i recommend you use dom or simplexml for parsing rss atom feed

4187990
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
standard sql requires you to specify a group by clause if any column is not wrapped in an aggregate-functions ie min max count sum avg etc but mysql supports hidden columns in the group by -- which is why

i see no advantage of people declaring annotations on the getter and or setter so far

4188051

httpwebrequest is there specifically to allow you to make get post put etc requests to a remote server

4188127
for-loop	loops
personally i donm t have any problem with reusing index counter variables - although in some languages eg .net using a variable in a for-loop specifically scopes the variable to that loops - so it s cleaned up afterwards no matter what

4188178
equals	compareto
if you re comparing objects i would write your own compareto method in order for you to test if the objects are greater less or equals to each other

4188203

you will want to change the verbosity of the build log found in the process tab in the build definition to something like detailed or diagnostic to get a list of where files are getting put on disk when the tfs build is running

4188627
width	height
you just should separate the x and y axis during distance comparison if the y distance is smaller than the width and the x distance is smaller than the height than there is a collision

4188627
width	height
i also assume the bullet has virtually no size and that the x.axis is the width and the y.axis is the height

4188635
put	get
to get it working put an image with transparency in resources transp.png

4188694

you ll probably want to use getlocale to get the existing locale then setlocale to set it to something like en_us or c then call the strftime method and finally restore the previous local with another setlocale call

4188734
multiplication	exponent
use numpy.matrix instead of numpy.array -- then multiplication will be matrix multiplication and powers by integer exponent will work as expected

4188737
textview	imageview
in my android app activity i have a relativelayout with one imageview and a couple of textview being populated at runtime

4188749
post	get
that way you can just refer to the views field for each post to get a quick peek at how many views it has

4188749
post	get
this solution works well if your site is read-intensive and you are constantly having to get a count of how many views each blog post has again assuming that is your application -

4188763
width	height
one which also specifies pixel values for width height

4188765

width	height
test if it s less than zero or greater than the parent width height - it s width height

4188934
width	height
you may need to make other tweaks to get it working for yourself like setting the height and width etc but all other css styles should continue to work as normal with this

4189035
int	double
so if you are manipulating big chunks of primitive data int float double it can be worth your while writing your own version of arraylist

4189035
int	double
for a big list of primitives like int or double write your own list

4189044
mongoid	mongomapper
both mongomapper and mongoid have the before_create hook so you should be fine in either

4189278
width	height
you give all your objects a width and a height attribute and do your collision checks using x y width and height

4189329
strtol	atoi
for real use you probably want to replace atoi with something like strtol though it improves the ability to deal well with bad input among other things

4189356
width	height
my idea was to create an image of same width and height then apply transparent corners but then i need to preserve the alpha channel and just copy image on that mask leaving transparent still transparent but colors changed to copied image or vice versa put mask on image

4189378
put	get
it seems like you should put that onselect code in the onclose function which would get fired when a date is selected

4189384
post	get
please post the table description and the tool if any so that you d get the appropriate answers for your case

4189414

4189639
post	get
a quick google search doesn t provide alot of answers - it s some sort of event tracking script for facebook and i saw a tweet and a couple of forum post where people mentioned disabling it and gaining a speed boost - i think you can safely get rid of it atleast it s worth giving it a try

4189657

4189657
client-side	server-side
at the same time i m working on both server-side and client-side java applications

4189673
post	get
if you are using the post redirect get pattern you will need to use request.isajaxrequest in conjunction with tempdata ie you persist the result of request.isajaxrequest in tempdata that way when you get the redirected request you can check tempdata to see if it is the result of an original ajax request

4189734
prepare	execute
this will not be execute - it will be prepare as subquery in

4189769
dictionary	map
the problem is that the map delegate can now leak implementation detail to an end user because they can observe the method to be the trygetvalue method of a and the target will be the private dictionary

4189855
postgresql	mysql
if you do not need a and you have less than peta bytes just leave it go ahead with mysql or postgresql

4189926
filtering	grouping
however if i add the where clause before the grouping by see below it ll filtering on contactid first before doing the grouping by and producing this result

4189964
hide	show
right now i can show a div by clicking a button and hide it using the same button

4189964

i have verified that i am matching every malloc -ed and then realloc -ed object with a corresponding free

4189987
realloc	malloc
now i test a realloc arrangement which malloc -s only once

4189987
free	realloc
if i look at the output of free -m on the command-line while i run this realloc -based test with a large data set that causes the million-loop condition my memory goes from 4 gb down to 0 and the app crashes

4190011
symfony	kohana	codeigniter	kohana
look at symfony kohana zend framework codeigniter

4190023
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
a malloc free pair can be better than a realloc if you don t need to keep around the original memory

4190023
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
that s why realloc can temporarily require more memory than a malloc free pair

4190028
postgresql	mysql
or you could just complain that postgresql isn t like mysql

4190070
profiling	benchmarking
use mysql query profiling for real benchmarking

4190093
codeigniter	cakephp
i ve looked at solutions using zend framework codeigniter and cakephp â but they all presume a specific coding style or so it seems and the prospect of reorganizing all of my code is in a word deflating

4190130
boost	allocator
you may also consider using boost.intrusive or boost bimap with specialized allocator

4190215
scheme	racket
racket is a really nice scheme implementation

serializable	deserialization
if you use the datacontractserializer with iextensibledataobject as shown in that article you can implement forward compatible serializable and deserialization

4190340
superclass	subclassing
i find it inconvenient that a subclassing that overrides a getter method in the superclass can change the element name that jaxb outputs but the superclass s one is also being written to the output

4190361
pop-up	dialog
i do not want the chooser dialog to pop-up

4190442

another question i would ask is how should getter and setter be properly declared

4195116
hash	salt
if you really need a fast way to do this you should consider emailing them a hash of some salt and their username and then logging them in that way

4195178
getter	setter
design your programs in a way that there is less need for getter and setter

4195210
getter	setter
firstly is that getter setter shouldn t be abstract in what they convey to the users of your class

4195210
getter	setter
thirdly getter setter should be named appropriately to their function

4195378
getter	setter
not all of this need be done by hand have a look at the active record design pattern and tools like php-ar that will do most of the basic getter and setter methods for you

4195388
post	get
you also might want to add some additional conditions to only change the protocol on get and head requests but not on post requests

4195395
hide	show
the button actionlistener checks if the dialog isvisible hide it if true show it if false

4195494
g++	gcc	gcov	gprof
finally i decided that using gcc tools g++ gprof gcov etc. is the safest option although i couldn t figure out how to do it

4195509
int	double
for starters there are a whole bunch of predefined types and those have names int float double

4195580
pascal	delphi
this is not strictly pascal but delphi was spun off from pascal

4195596
post	get
as sneeu notes above it s the act of adding the data to be posted to the request that converts the request from a get into a post

4195620
children	parent
apply z attribute red background to every children of a div parent

4195646
apache	nginx
the easiest solution is like tadman described set up a dns record and write a rewrite rule for apache nginx whatever which will eat subdomain and add it to params

4195667
sikuli	selenium
selenium to drive anything web based in firefox and sikuli to do all the rest

4195741
gridview	rowdatabound
i had copied the gridview and was calling a rowdatabound event handler for a different grid.

4195747
maven	pom.xml
if you re using maven you could create a local maven project containing all the classes you might need in different projects and add this dependency to your pom.xml which requires these classes

4195750
children	parent
the selector will select all immediate children not all descendants of the element with id parent

4195750
children	parent
to every children of a div parent .

4195755
public	protected
the best thing to do is to follow the rule that a base class destructor should be either public and virtual or protected and nonvirtual.

4195801
profiling	debugging
there s also entity framework profiling by ayende oren eini which isn t free but it does make reading and debugging the queries a lot easier

4195864
audiotrack	audiorecord
so i am using audiotrack to play incoming audio audiorecord to record data from the microphone and audiomanager.setspeakerphoneon to enable or disable speakerphone

4195865
google-chrome	firefox
this problem is not present in google-chrome firefox

4195870
equals	gethashcode
if i understand you correctly you just need to override the gethashcode and equals methods in your datapointcollection class and use the method in this question to generate the hash code

4195882
equals	gethashcode
you need to override both gethashcode and equals - it s the combination of the two which will be used by the hashset

4195886
post	get
i have to use only button type button and have to post the form so that i can get uploaded files in the controller using request.files

4195886
post	get
the form is post but not able to get the files

4195896
ienumerable	iqueryable
also i m not sure if your example binding is pseudocode or not but you have to bind a grid to an ilistsource ienumerable or idatasource so you need a collection list iqueryable etc

4195928
gridview	rowdatabound
then you could use findcontrol in the rowdatabound event of the gridview to store the id value

4195985
decoder	encoder
python s io system uses 2.6.5 but fileio s ascii encoder decoder

4195985
decoder	encoder
encoder decoder

4196001
min	max	range	max	range	min
for the range min to max inclusive use

4196022
memcached	apc
you should profile code and focus on bottle necks and then try things like caching static apc memcached

4196027
hash	salt
i m writing a password salt hash procedure for my .net application largely following the guide of this article

4196027
hash	salt
basically the code for computing the salt hash is this

4196097
rss	feed
i am binding a collection rss feed into a list box such as this

4196132
deselect	multi-select	autocomplete	multi-select
i m aware that there are different styles of multi-select widget eg an available list and a selected list vs a single list with select deselect checkboxes vs autocomplete combobox.

4196183
min	max
you can fix the problem by using either min timesent or max timesent in your sub-query in place of timesent whichever is appropriate

4196191
x86	64bit
a possible cause is a x86 dll in a 64bit app pool the solution is to enable 32 bits apps in the application pool settings

4196198
multiplying	add
but if you create it yourself you d have three types of binary ops add multiplying and power and two types of leaf nodes coefficient and variable

4196232
mp3	wav
also check out this article about mixing wav tracks in c# - once you have the final wav file you can just encode it to mp3 if that s your format of choice

4196233
division	multiplication
something simple like multiplication or division is not much different between c++ and c# - the c++ compiler has an optimizer and the clr runtime has the on-demand jiter that does optimizations

4196237
cos	sin
just write a loop in c# and c++ having a few multiplication sin cos .

4196251
cos	sin
suppose a cpu had a tan math function but no sin or cos and a programming language implemented sin and cos in terms of tan but did not expose tan itself

4196251
cos	sin
a programmer using that language would be forced to implement tan in terms of sin and cos which themselves are implemented in terms of tan therefore characterizing abstraction inversion

4196299
proj	ogr	gdal	proj	gdal	ogr
many users will find the gdal ogr library and utilities another osgeo open source proj a useful way of leveraging proj.4 s capabilities on common data formats eg

4196312
innodb	myisam
however you are left with not having an engine that can do transactions and full-text search at the same time between myisam and innodb

4196312
innodb	myisam
and 4 myisam vs innodb and datatypes

4196312
innodb	myisam
however as i said with mysql myisam innodb you don t have an engine that can do full-text search and transactions fks

4196312
innodb	myisam
a simple option is to have a 2nd copy in myisam of the innodb tables that need full-text search capability

4196346
hide	show
rather create a separate thread you start upon starting your app that initializes show some splash screen before it and once the init is done hide the splashscreen

4196352
cllocationmanager	mkreversegeocoder
callbacks methods of mkreversegeocoder and cllocationmanager

4196390
put	get
put it all together and you get

4196404
int	boolean
the textbook example of your second point is integer.valueof int similar for boolean short long byte

4196405
for-loop	loops
use a for-loop instead of a foreach loops and start at where you left off instead of at the beginning

4196409
put	get
when i actually put in the code i get the following error failure system.configuration.configurationerrorsexception the configuration is read only

4196425
opera	safari
here are some default layout widths safari iphone uses 980px opera 850px android webkit 800px and ie 974px

4196472
google-chrome	safari
both of these work fine in safari and google-chrome

4196480
put	get
you would need to get a range of ip addresses and put them in a while list

4196505
move	drag
interact with nodes links to drag move select

4196559
post	get
an http redirect instructs the browser to issue an http get for the url specified as opposed to the http post that is used to submit the form

4196561
public	protected
since immutablelist doesn t expose any public or protected constructors it can be subclassed within the package while not allowing users to subclass it and potentially break its immutability guarantee

4196568
post	get
you need to implement the post redirect get pattern

4196626
pull	push
push and pull only exchange information about already recorded changed

4196676
mouseleave	mouseenter
you just have to handle this two events mouseenter mouseleave

4196696
hex	binary
you could use a plain hex string or base64 encoding - both are well-established methods of transporting binary data as a string

4196717
memset	malloc
make sure you can tell whether the malloc s worked or not at end of program hence the memset in this code

4196727
salt	md5	crypt	salt	crypt	md5
i ve gone for using the crypt function with the user s password as the salt via md5 like so

4196761
pop-up	dialog
i m using this code to pop-up a facebook dialog and to allow the user to make a wall post but the user name doesn t appear

4196768
put	get
how can i get emacs to not put buffer list there but instead show another one of my files

4196831
inherited	properties
well i m not sure from your description that inherited is actually the right solution to the problem but here s how you make it possible for a properties to be overridden

4196922
width	height
this gives you enough information to provide parameters x y width and height

4196923
addition	multiplication
primitive operations like addition multiplication etc work only on c primitive types like int short float etc

4196925
hash	salt
using the hash value with a salt is much safer if someone breaks into your db no password is there

4196925
crypt	hash
only the hash of the password is which they can t use to log in and crypt really isn t very secure

4196925
hash	md5
unfortunately md5 has issues too so i would suggest using sha512 as a hash

4196933
nunit	mstest
i had done a comparison of nunit and mstest unit testing frameworks in one of my blog

4196960
accessor	properties
optional if you want to enforce singleton instances you can create a module that acts as a singleton container - include a private instance variable and a public accessor properties

4196976
jstl	taglib
then declare the jstl core taglib in top of jsp page as per its documentation

4197009
pop-up	dialog
i have a delete button where on clicking the button i want a dialog box to pop-up and then on clicking ok it should do the ajax call else shouldnt do anything

4197012
internationalization	localization
and also internationalization and localization

4197034
google-chrome	safari
i ve tested this in safari and google-chrome on osx...same behavior

4197091
hex	binary
you will learn nothing trying to program in binary for a specific operating system and specific cpu type using a hex editor

4197100
public	protected
this is an obscure scenario but if you want to support inheritance across component boundaries you need this otherwise the addition of new public or protected members on a base class would invariably be a breaking change

4197118
rvm	bundler
i agree with maarons that bundler and or rvm gemsets are best practice but if you want to keep your gem code versioned as part of your applications repo then i think the solution you re looking for is to vendor your gems and then add them as submodules to your application s git repo

4197146
int	chars
the styles int hence the 32-character limit would be seen as a set of 32 1-bit fields with each one indicating whether a chars has its own style pointer or whether it should use the same style as the previous chars

4197201
folder	directory
this would change the packages folder for the configuration level you put the file in solution if you put it in the solution directory project in project directory and so on

4197212
put	get
put as much code as you can get away with in the diddecelerate method like loading in higher res images like vodkhang talks about rather than processing loads in didscroll

4197270
for-loop	loops
before trying it this way i tried having a while loops inside the 2nd for-loop to iterate through each list and use a binary search to see if the 2nd list contains each element but i think this takes the same amount of time or longer

4197287
ant	maven
it looks like maven is similair to ant

4197319
put	get
also of note the error you are getting is caused at the end of the method when you try to initalize a new freeze object from your runes array because when you put the object into the runes array you encapsulated it as a nsdata object first but when you get it out you don t dearchive it before setting it to newfreeze

4197336
folder	directory	pop-up	dialog
however i would like to be able to pop-up a folder selector dialog to let the user pick out a directory

4197353
width	height
it gives you the bounding box effectively width and height some text will occupy so you can determine where to place the text before writing it on the image

4197388
firefox	safari
there is no password when using firefox safari chrome.

4197427
getter	setter
all my attributes are public to avoid getter and setter and private business

4197528
jax-ws	jax-rs
jax-rs and jax-ws are great for producing an api

4197528
gson	jackson
some json libraries out there such as jackson and gson provide a feature where you can specify a different input output representation for a given object based on a runtime setting which seems like a suitable way to handle versioning for many cases

4197590
webclient	httpwebrequest
you might want to consider swapping your webclient for plain old httpwebrequest which hands you a stream out of the box

4197656
width	height
i am actually trying to compute the pixel width and height

4197691
equals	gethashcode
oh and if you re overriding equals you should also override gethashcode

4197699
fontconfig	freetype
we updated freetype in osx 10.6.5 and fontconfig which links against freetype wants this newer version

4197744
pop-up	dialog
and in the dialog that pop-up i would choose to discard the changes from the merge target ie

4197758
equals	gethashcode
if you override equals you should get the behaviour you expect but note that if you override equals you should also override gethashcode to have a similar implementation

4197903
post	put
i will post an example url in the comments since i m a relatively new user and can t put more than one link in a post

4197911
children	parent
you would create a parent pom and have both a and b as children with a keeping its dependency on b

4197928
integer	fractions
all the operations in your expression are performed in integer arithmetic meaning that the fractions part of each intermediate result is truncated

4197962
int	chars
if you are dealing with a combination of fields with different types like numeric and timestamps then use any of the conversion commands decimal int chars substr ... at your disposal to convert to text equal and then match it up accordingly

4198038
submit	submission
and secondly how to wrap around submission i don t know maybe some ajaxsubmit event to evaluate the form and only when it s valid and then perform the submit itself so probably the function should return true etc

4198042
punctuation	words
there were no requirements such as ignoring punctuation so i ve allowed myself to write a version that only works for clearly separated words and thus inserted spaces in your sample text string

4198116
width	height
the alternative is to have something server side that will feed you the sizes of the images from the beginning but in the absence of that i suggest either dropping in my utility or modifying its logic to suit your need start a timer that monitors each image for having a width and height

4198187
filtering	grouping
so basically i need to figure out a way to filtering bind to my waves collection according to the id# property of the current element that is bound to grouping

4198210
subtract	add
now we have twice subtract the configurations where at least n1 + 1 x1 and n2 + 1 x2 are used hence we need to add ways v - n1 + 1 x1 - n2 + 1 x2 and etc

4198281
getter	setter
i do know that the declaration in the header file allows other classes to see its attributes the property specifier determines how its getter setter methods will be constructed

4198281
getter	setter
and the synthesize line actually builds those getter setter methods

4198297
put	get	ant	maven
the xml files get copied there by whatever you use to build with you can put them under src main resources in a maven project or copy them from your source directory into web-inf classes with ant

4198340
postgresql	mysql
lite is an ajax based and best viewed with any browser chat system that supports mysql sqlite postgresql databases

4198350
illegalargumentexception	runtimeexception	nullpointerexception	runtimeexception	nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
i think obvious runtimeexception mean here nullpointerexception arrayoutofboundsexception illegalargumentexception and so on so your code will run without obvious failures

4198367
post	get
i have the below page and i am racking my brain as to why when i have two update panels do they both get post backs

4198368
superclass	subclassing
i m sure i remember reading that there is a way to make any subclassing of the superclass define certain methods

4198368
superclass	subclassing
in my example the superclass is account and is abstract and the subclassing are savingsaccount and currentaccount

4198384
implements	extends
then any class that extends your abstract class will be forced to implements the withdraw method

4198394
hide	show
in a few words i m using two links to show and hide flash videos link1 show video1 and hide video2

4198394
hide	show
link2 show video2 and hide video1

4198398
profiler	yourkit
i ve used yjp yourkit java profiler to profile applications before

4198399
width	height
ensure that the content areas below the div with the scrollbars is not greater than 100 of that divs height or width at runtime

4198430
put	get
the class masterpriceitem is correctly analysed by hibernate if i put a field that is not in the table i get an error

4198458
getter	setter
obvious uses for this would be auto property getter and setter non obvious uses may be code generated by r# equals implementation or orm generated code

4198461
post	get
when invoking one of the endpoints with an http post and a valid payload i get the exception stack trace as you can see below

4198462
post	get
so show me how to do methods other than get post without it

4198478
versioning	upgrade
the down side will be having to very carefully maintain your messaging object versioning globally and having to keep a set of transformers on hands to accept and convert from different versioning if you plan to upgrade only a portion of your infrastructure

4198486
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
activexobject -- is not an option because it will not work for firefox safari google-chrome

4198488
width	height
use size width height

4198488
width	height
width and height are maximum width and height of drawing in inches.

4198519
implements	extends
if you declared you account class and method as abstract then compiler will give you an error if you don t implements abstract method in your subclasses that extends account class

4198525
int	chars
since this is memory mapped a simple copy the chars to a stack array and atoi to the another int array on top of a another memory mapped file would be the very efficient

4198530
margin	height
you can check if the css top + height value of the detail box is more than the container value and then add a negative top margin to offset it

4198537
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
now while this code works fine on google-chrome and opera on firefox it is behaving a little weird

4198537
google-chrome	firefox
update-just had a look at the request headers of firefox and i find no x-requested-with xmlhttprequest header but it is present in google-chrome

4198547
int	chars
chars is an actual 8 bit int value

4198547
int	chars
is a 32 or 64 bit value with information about where a 8 bit int chars can be found

4198567
pop-up	dialog
the issue i face with is when user hit on export a file save as confirm dialog pop-up and if user changed her mind click on cancel

4198580
int	double	int	chars
for primitives such as int double chars etc it works more as you might expect

4198585
subclass	abstract-class
i would go for a minimal fake subclass associating this with the abstract-class

4198586
onsubmit	onkeyup
from we have the following option properties onsubmit onfocusout and onkeyup

4198609
mouse	keyboard
i could select multiple characters with the mouse and keyboard and if i hit delete they would be deleted

4198614
submit	submission
when i place a submit button on the form and use that the ajax submission works fine

4198671
integer	fractions
in line 2 you are converting the input values to integers and then doing an integer divide because both operands for the divide are ints the divide is done in integer space - which means any fractions resiult will be truncated

4198679
post	get
there is another post here that describes a solution using jquery but unfortunately it doesn t include any code samples which is what i need because i m not very familiar with jquery and new to web development and i need to get this issue resolved as soon as i can

4198704
std	ostream
an std ostream s output needs to be flushed

4198753
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
in my app i used touchesbegan touchesmoved and touchesend but i faced a big problem if the user drag 2 fingers just one finger handle the drag

4198787
put	get
note that the begin that the iterator is initialized with is not where the elements get put

4198804
unix	solaris
because weâ re running in a mixed unix environment solaris linux darwin with most desktops being macs we have quite a few annoying macroman files

4198822
implements	sealed
secondly make the class sealed the class is not implements the dispose pattern properly for inheritance and put gc.suppressfinalize this

4198926
width	height
instead of changing that img width and height i delete it and create a new one

4198969
post	get
in difference of get with post you are changing the state of the system most likely your trigger is doing something and changing data

4199051
public	protected
uint64 is not cls compatible and all classes in the bcl need to be at least on their public protected stuff

4199140
width	height
it won t create a height width on it until there s something inside the div

4199187
mouse	keyboard
the problem is with the wincombobox object if i use the scroll wheel on the mouse and scroll down past the bottom of the list really fast it has to be fast going slow or using the keyboard will not trigger this then i get this error

4199239
multiplying	add
the first way would be the easiest and most logical way and that is to store their offset if you already have it that is and multiplying that by 3600 1 hour in seconds and then add that value to the current unix timestamp to get their final time of running

4199273
valgrind	memcheck
when running valgrind memcheck tool i often get many hundreds of thousands or more since valgrind cuts off at 100k of small invalid read statements

4199294
integer	unsigned
the program deals with bitmap manipulation and as such much of the data in the app is represented as byte an unsigned 8-bit integer

4199294
integer	unsigned	unsigned	short
there are many suggestions to instead use the short data type in java in order to mimic as close as possible the unsigned 8-byte integer

4199299
width	height
the important thing is for margin-left and margin-top to be negative half the value of width and height to ensure that the popup is exactly in the middle of the screen

4199327
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
start with a very compliant browser then look at the page in other browsers i focus on google-chrome safari firefox ie6-7-8-9

4199327
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
ie6-7-8-9 tool is good enough for me because i tend to focus on all versions of ie but only the latest versions of google-chrome safari firefox

4199358
width	height
also the size of the board is variable...so it can have lots of squares or very few but the board has always the same height and width that is the same number of squares running from left to right as the number of squares running from top to bottom

4199363
min	max
the aggregate function min and max will return null if the lowest value is null

4199367
user-controls	tabcontrol
i am having a problem when attempting to host a user-controls as tab content within a tab item in a tabcontrol

4199392
min	max
min max sum avg and certain other aggregates will return null if a null exists in the data set

4199395
qlist	qmap
you aren t passing the correct arguments to qmap insert and qlist append

4199402
qstring	qmap
also you have a mismatch in parameters that is to say you have a list of qmap the maplist list and you are trying to append qmap qmap qstring qstring int the returnedlist map

4199406
activemq	rabbitmq	openmq	hornetq	pascal	delphi
note i am the author of delphi and free pascal client libraries for open source message queues message brokers activemq hornetq openmq rabbitmq

4199408
rsa	dsa
while not the only way to do this off the top of my head you could for example use a hmac with specific keys or just a public key algorithm such as rsa or dsa on their own it is probably the best way to achieve what you want to do with the minimum of effort

4199450
button	checkbox
i have a dialog box with a checkbox and a button

4199450
button	checkbox
i want to make the button enabled disabled depending on the state of the checkbox

4199450
button	checkbox
checking unchecking the checkbox does nothing to the button

4199455
persistent	transient
however if the real issue your facing is maintaining some sort of transient state specific to the connection i would reconsider the design and do something that persistent between connections tied to some sort of unique identifier from the user s session

4199460
postgresql	mysql
for the ones i tried mysql and postgresql min ignores null

4199469
arraylist	linkedhashmap	put	get
if you don t want to go through the arraylist searching for duplicates put everything in a linkedhashmap -- no duplicates and you still get the order-of-insertion that arraylist gives you

4199475
hash	salt
passwords should not be stored in plain text but should generally be salt and hash

4199499
button	checkbox
checkbox and radio button aren t sent unless checked

4199574
gridview	datalist
my problem is how to display this using a gridview or datalist control

4199577
google-chrome	firefox
i have a page link removed that works completely well in firefox and google-chrome but for some reason i am getting an object expected error in most if not all versions of ie

4199663
getter	setter
getter and setter are nothing to do with models but act as a great tool so i think your righti n a sence but you should understand that getter and setter having nothing to do with the model principle but are a way to construct your model classes to suite your framework

4199663
getter	setter
model is the layer between the view and the database storage and acts as getter + setter

4199675
for-loop	loops
for loops are quite simple to me and if it was nested for-loop my head starts to spin

4199685
gridview	datalist
use a datatable stored in the viewstate to carry the data and bind to a gridview datalist

4199691
keyup	mouseup
you can check the lastchild on keyup and mouseup to make sure it s a br element

4199691
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
tested on apple os x w google-chrome 7 mozilla firefox 3.6 apple safari 5

4199705
int	chars
first if a programmer passes in arbitrary int cast as pointers then they may actually be valid pointers within your address space -- they might even point to null terminated chars arrays in fact if they are within your address space they will point because the data there will be treated as chars and at some point there will be a 0 byte

4199706
vmware	virtualbox
if you re using virtualbox or vmware you can open a console window that essentially functions as the monitor on your vm

4199708
lisp	scheme
this is how gpus functional languages such as lisp scheme apl and some frameworks google s map reduce handle concurrency

rel	src
i need to add add the rel 0 to the end of a end src tag from a youtube embed code

4199847
maven	pom.xml
set the necessary import in my maven pom.xml for felix by

4199896
for-loop	loops
i surrounded it for-loop and while loops several times but it causes eofexception

4199906
implements	extends
as such it might be required for your specific situation that you implements a gesturedetector and implements your own simpleongesturelistener class mygesturelistener extends simpleongesturelistener that manages the double and single tap events your looking for

4199917
ubuntu	debian
if you are using ubuntu or debian and you serve .json files through apache you might want to serve the files with the correct content type

4200065
hash	salt
putting it all together 64bit salt + sha1 hash 160 bit base64 encoded takes 40 characters so i store it as char 40

4200065
hash	md5
sha1 and md5 hash are insanely fast

4200065
hash	salt
a future proof method would be to include the number of iterations in the password field iterations + salt + hash

4200085
int	chars
based on your comments about how sql is not returning 5 chars use this updated query to go from int to varchar with leading zeros

4200095
min	max
when grouping every column in the display list that is not part of the group by expression must be passed through an aggregate function avg min max but you re just asking for day

4200101
fpdf	fpdi
last time i had to do this zend_pdf wasn t around and i ended up using fpdf fpdi which was ugly but worked fine

4200106
put	get
the easiest way to get this done is to put the empty view in the main.xml layout

4200130
scheme	racket	lisp	racket	lisp	scheme
so emacs is pretty good at editing scheme racket lisp code

4200145
emacs	aquamacs
aquamacs 2.1 emacs 23.2

4200162
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that neither ie7 or 8 load the new content - latest versions of safari firefox opera and google-chrome are all ok

4200198
inherited	properties
queue implementations generally do not define element-based versions of methods equals and hashcode but instead inherited the identity based versions from class object because element-based equality is not always well-defined for queues with the same elements but different ordering properties

4200221
subtraction	addition
i ve already overloaded subtraction addition etc

4200259
webchromeclient	webviewclient
i created my own webview and set the webchromeclient and webviewclient objects

4200343
devise	cancan
and i have some problems with cancan and devise

4200386
django	web2py
simply go get a full featured python web framework such as django or web2py and learn how to write python web applications using their in built development web server

4200393
haskell	ocaml
i suppose that this topic is absolutely basics of fp for many of you but i ask for help here because i haven t found anything on the internet about signatures in ocaml there are some articles about signatures in haskell but not explanations

4200395
post	get
i think i should add that if you re using a server how to configure it and how to get the connections to your code will vary by server and j2ee level so post your environment

4200446
min	max
i ve got a form with two radio buttons buying renting and two select lists min price max price below

4200454
int	double
void simple_fir_filter double buff int buffsize

4200479
nsstring	uifont
one thing i have found useful is a little function that takes a nsstring a uifont and a cgsize returning a cgfloat representing the largest font size for that string that will fit in the cgsize passed - it uses sizewithfont on successively smaller point sizes until the size returned fits within the cgsize argument

4200479
width	height
you can pass cgfloat_max as either x or y if you don t care about one dimension like when you are checking width of a line and will check height later on the whole string

4200479
min	max
you define max and min font sizes of course

4200483
post	get
i d like to get rid of the show link and make the entire postpreview link to the post

4200493
firefox	safari
i will have to check it out in all types of browsers but at the moment it is working in firefox and safari

4200605
migrate	upgrade
when the client wants to upgrade migrate their data to the later instance of the product and change the rewrite rule for their subdomain

4200608
ready	each
the effect is that you parse the tree of elements depth first and at the end of each branch you roll it back into the parent until you re left with a single object such as your connectionlist that contains all of the parsed data ready to be used

4200669
ubuntu	linux
i have an ubuntu server 10 virtualized with an amd64 architecture i used this machine to test the program under linux and everything works fine

4200700
width	height
respectively set the height and width of the a element according to your image size or better the surrounding div

4200705
int	double
in file2.c you decide that it would be a great idea to represent the number of chickens as a double instead of an int but you forget to update file.c

4200705
int	double
the linker will treat number_of_chickens as a name referencing a 4 bit int in file.c and an 8 bit double in file2.c

4200705
int	double
if you call the count_chickens function it will return garbage the high 32 bits of the double will be filled in with the contents of int number_of_chickens the low 32 bits will be undefined - whatever comes after number_of_chickens in memory

4200706
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	opensuse	opensuse	debian
i d recommend you just package a 32 and 64-bit binary for .deb and rpm that way you can hit most of the major distros debian fedora opensuse ubuntu

4200711
for-loop	loops
but generally the slowest big o algorithm would affect the program s efficiency the most - so a stand-alone for-loop that depends on n as its stop condition wouldn t slow down a program much more if it also had nested for loops that depend on n

4200719
french	hebrew
the program stores bible verses in 5 languages hebrew russion arabic english and french

4200734
maven-assembly-plugin	maven-jar-plugin
you need to use two plugins to accomplish this maven-jar-plugin and maven-assembly-plugin

4200743
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	opensuse	opensuse	debian
you should at least target debian ubuntu with dpkg packages redhad fedora mandriva with rpm and suse opensuse with rpm again i mention these two rpm cases separately because you might need to produce separate packages for these families of distributions

4200760
stdout	stderr
i have my stdout stderr signal slot s working just fine but i cannot seem to find a good solution for finished

4200784
centos	linux
i need to create an ssh connection between two linux machines running centos v5 but the latency could be as high as 30 seconds

4200797
freebsd	linux
i figured out what the issue was i was first getting a econnrefused which on linux i can just retry the connect after a short pause and all is well but on freebsd the following retry of connect fails with einval

4200831
min	max
you have selected buy and selected min 100 and max 200

4200871
passenger	webrick
i checked the logs and also tried running using webrick instead of passenger and apache

4200880
int	chars
cmain.cpp in function int evma_send_file_data_to_connection long unsigned int const chars

4201042
google-chrome	firefox
it of course works fine with firefox and google-chrome

4201099
width	height
i want a fixed top pane that has a fixed height and the width stretches and shrinks as the page is resized

4201105
stdout	fflush
if you fflush stdout after every output call that you want to see immediately that will solve the problem

4201105
stdout	fflush
alternatively you can use setvbuf before operating on stdout to set it to unbuffered and you won t have to worry about adding all those fflush lines to your code

4201131
put	get
ie the entire list dictionary is get and put

4201131
put	get
the examples i have come across appear to put individual item in the cache as opposed to entire collections with regions being used for bulk get operations

4201156
hide	show
it hide them when they aren t needed and show them when they are

4201174
put	get
trying to get full coverage from integration tests is a bad idea to put it mildly

4201315
integer	unsigned
you should also make it unsigned using the u suffix as i ve shown to avoid the issues of left shifting a signed integer

4201325
fflush	gets
so there are situations where printf won t fflush even if it gets a newline to send out such as

4201325
stdout	fflush
as to how to deal with that if you fflush stdout after every output call that you want to see immediately that will solve the problem

4201325
stdout	fflush
alternatively you can use setvbuf before operating on stdout to set it to unbuffered and you won t have to worry about adding all those fflush lines to your code

4201330
maven-jar-plugin	pom.xml	maven-assembly-plugin	pom.xml	maven-assembly-plugin	maven-jar-plugin
the pom.xml includes configuring the jar plugin maven-jar-plugin and configuring the assembly plugin maven-assembly-plugin

4201373
expander	grid
place a grid inside the dockpanel and put each expander into its own column

4201420
spaces	delimiter
if you are storing more than one email in a field you should add a delimiter like a spaces or a pipe

4201478
svg	vml
look into raphaeljs which uses svg w3c recommendation and vml as a base for creating graphics. it is completely browser-independent and allows image rotation by arbitrary degrees

4201539
int	double
if you try to read the first four bytes of that double as an int you are not going to get back what you think

4201543
cout	cin
and for that you can use the standard library s facilities like cin and cout

4201545
integer	unsigned
there are other minor exceptions like being able to reinterpret a signed integer as an unsigned integer. you can find more in both the c standard c99 6.5 6-7 and the c++ standard c++03 3.10 if i recall correctly

4201585
typedef	struct
1 when they have declared the typedef struct which is the tag name or the name of the

4201597
typedef	struct
the struct type is struct channel_t and the new typedef is channel_t

4201597
typedef	struct
no typedef is required when defining a struct

4201606
equals	gethashcode	equals	tostring	tostring	gethashcode
you could always create a custom struct of course taking the integer value in the constuctor and maybe a custom conversion operator overriding the tostring method and probably equals gethashcode etc

4201609
typedef	struct
the typedef line is just a typedef it doesn t define the struct

4201612
integer	unsigned
you can simply use int or if it must not be negative uint unsigned integer

4201626
hide	show
just add hide show functionality to the tab bar controller where you need to

4201634
int	chars
you can use padleft int totalwidth chars paddingchar like

4201659
int	double
the new value may appear to be garbage but it s simply the result of interpreting the first sizeof int bytes of the double 3.1416 trusting there to be a useful int value there

4201659
int	double
if you want the two things to be independent - so setting the double doesn t affect the earlier-stored int - then you should use a struct class

4201673
int	chars
ed s answer describes the floating part but how about we examine how int and chars are stored first

4201673
int	chars
if an int is 32 bits and each of the chars is 8 bits then r should correspond to the to the left-most byte g the second one and so forth

4201684
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
but i need this to work in all 5 major browsers firefox internet explorer 7 and 8 opera google-chrome and safari

4201693
google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to figure out why the front page of my blog renders differently between google-chrome and firefox

4201693
google-chrome	firefox
it appears broken in google-chrome but renders without issues in firefox

4201741
google-chrome	firefox
this should fix most of your google-chrome related issues and firefox for me

4201744
post	get
use post instead of get if you have huge data

4201758
versioning	upgrade
when the ipad os versioning gets upgrade to 4.0 it will most likely support multisampling because the hardware is indeed capable of supporting multisampling

4201813
int	double
be careful to ensure that you aren t going to get int overflow there though - the max value of must be less than the maximum value you can store in a word or double word if your using longer int types

4201827
firefox	safari
this functionality currently works within firefox however in safari by pressing combinations such as command + + or command + 1 it does not do the intended functionality and instead does the functionality inherent to the browser

4201827
firefox	safari
i am currently using the preventdefault function which is why this works in firefox but i am not sure what this does not work in safari

4201833
inherited	subclassing
when stating that a is a subclassing of b this restricts a to necessarily inherited all characteristics of b but not the other way around

4201856
stdout	stderr
can a ui application access data coming to stdout and stderr on all platforms

4201878
pull	push
it has plenty of space and i was curious if i could use it as a push pull clone point

4201888
put	get
and i want to use the same expression if i press tab as much i get to put sprintf but not the rest of the string i used before 0.18f 0.18f 0.18 n output1

4201907
mp3	wav
for actually recording a beep from the pc s speaker to a wav mp3 -- i don t know if that s possible

4201954
getter	setter
i d like to see the class declarations properties with field access annotations without getter and setter will probably suffice

4201966
stdout	stderr
best practice imho is for a library to not print anything to stderr or stdout because they may not even be present

4202043
updatepanel	onclientclick
because of the button being within the updatepanel and provided the childrenastriggers updatemode properties are set correctly it is the buttons onclientclick event that will be fired on the server side when you click the button

4202048
ssl	https
cause your https servers are in tcp mode as they should be for ssl so a layer 7 rule wont work

4202073
qstring	qdir
for deleting you can call bool qdir remove const qstring filename

4202111
google-chrome	firefox
so i recommend that you first test in firefox or google-chrome

4202146
instances	transient
castle windsor creates multiple instances of grand child objects using transient lifestyle

4202234
udp	tcp
for this reason many streaming applications use udp instead of tcp as an underlying protocol

4202256
packets	pcap
if the use of windows is not crucial i have successfully used tcpreplay on a linux machine run as root to read arbitrary packets from a pcap file and send them out on a network interface

4202289
implements	extends
the driver - which implements driver it doesn t extends drivermanager - simply registers an appropriate instance using drivermanager.registerdriver

4202323
mvp	presenter
the mvp architecture i m using has the presenter create listeners and define the view interface but view objects are singletons

4202359
google-chrome	firefox
i have checked and found the same behaviour across google-chrome 6.0 ie8 and and firefox 3.5

4202361
hex	binary
i d use a more efficient method to convert the binary mac to a hex digest in typical code but i used this one for brevity

4202387
folder	directory
this was iterating over the entire directory tree of 33 000 files in each folder

4202392
width	height
i am using the android g1 default web browser and i am developing in javascript - i have trouble getting the real visual width and height when i zoom in or out on a web page

4202413
getter	setter
if there annotations are on a getter then only the getter are considered for persistence and the state is accessed via the getter setter

4202436
folder	directory
i have an wordpress setup into blog folder under my site directory

4202513
qtreeview	qmainwindow
when i resize the qmainwindow the two qtreeview s get resized with an 1 1 ratio between them

4202528
int	chars
i am trying to copy the memory value of int into the chars buffer

4202530
numericupdown	maskedtextbox
the easiest way would be to use a maskedtextbox use the mask property or a numericupdown control

4202545
int	chars
you are copying the byte representation of an int into a chars array

4202627
g++	gcc
can anyone tell me how i can make the build process use g++ a not gcc

4202638
getter	setter
data binder will read such annotation and call the getter and setter methods to set the title of the north component for you

4202658
uiview	subviews
the subviews you add could be either plain old uiview or your own special subclass of uiview

4202700
ssl	https
this is why https and ssl was invented not only for encryption but also to verify that users are who they say they are

4202724
instances	transient
those are semantics of transient - each time a new instances is provided

4202744
mp3	ogg
looking at generated source of your page you load as first source an ogg file then a mp3 file in this exact order

4202852
viewmodel	caliburn
in the previous example if your textbox was called ordernumber and your viewmodel property was called ordernumber caliburn assumes they must be the same thing and automatically binds them for you

4202895
junit	testng	ant	pom.xml
probably you have figured this out but when compiled and if using ant or mvn you can pass arguments to your junit or testng from inside the pom.xml file

4202919
folder	directory
i wrote this code it s supposed to be a clipart browser locked to klip folder under current directory

4202941
post	get
i would like to use powershell to look thru a textfile get all values and prefix and post fix these values with a character

4203005
atomic	compare-and-swap
and the compiler doesn t provide extra functions to wrap these operations c++11 standard has atomic operations including compare-and-swap has div ldiv et al for getting quotient and remainder efficiently

4203005
prepare	execute
you re artificially restricting its choices regarding register allocation cpu instructions etc. so it may take longer to prepare the cpu registers with the values needed to execute your hardcoded instruction then longer to get back to an optimal allocation for future instructions

4203045
put	get
i can get the exact url select customername it is accessing and put it into a browser and it works without issue

4203075
trie	tree
find or implement a trie or prefix tree which will basically start at a root node and descend for each character the user has typed - the results are all valid endpoint nodes below the node reached at the end of descending the user input

4203216
trie	tree
use a radix tree wiki or trie wiki if you are concerned about performance.the radix tree is more memory efficient compared to a trie

4203237
fasta	blast
see fasta and blast

4203256
oncreate	setcontentview
if in your applicaiton oncreate you set setcontentview r.layout.main

4203270
pop-up	dialog
in the dialog that pop-up select

4203272
post	get
what i want is to get lists of the post and do a small quick calculations of the rating and then sort those from highest to low and take 5 post only

4203279
google-chrome	safari
this causes trouble in some browsers google-chrome or safari which don t show the thumbnail inline

4203301
for-loop	arrays
i have a for-loop with one function in it which gets me only the latest value from the arrays

4203325
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
also note the for-loop change...you should never use a for...in loops to iterate an arrays use a normal for-loop for that

4203331
toolchain	binutils
cross-compiler toolchain are not an easy thing to setup though because you need way more than just the compiler binutils libraries etc

4203349
google-chrome	safari
i have checked this in the different different broswers like ie 6.0 7.0 google-chrome safari mozilla but unable to find the solution

4203365
boost	stl
we use the stl and boost 1.39

4203442
for-loop	while-loop
when i have a simple program that computes squares from 1 to n implemented using for-loop and while-loop the behaviour is not the same

4203445
post	get
i need to send data by get method because by post it will get real messy as i have to show many pages of search results

4203452
operands	decrement
well the operands are evaluated from left to right and in each case the result of a postfix operation is the value of the variable before the increment decrement whereas the result of a prefix operation is the value of the variable after the increment decrement.

4203482
getter	setter
this is also a difference in actionscript 3 getter setter are functions in c# you define them inside the variable

4203496
post	get
passing the originating page withi post get

4203502
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
however my browser i tried safari firefox and google-chrome does not set this cookie

4203548
firefox	safari
problem map.jpg does not display in any browser firefox safari or textmate preview

4203581
xsd.exe	svcutil.exe
both xsd.exe and svcutil.exe operate on the xml schema file .xsd

4203604
openfire	ejabberd
me and my team were working on the exact same problem - only that we use openfire instead of ejabberd mostly cause we have java skills but are not familiar with erlang

4203686
post	get
sure post will work but i really feel a search as a get and not a post

4203698
width	column-count
a good method would be to check for column-count support with modernizr then create two additional container elements each one-third the width of the parent then using javascript we can watch for expansions and pull the necessary number of elements to the other two to maintain even sizes

4203721
typedef	struct
these struct just like the iterator struct are there just for our convenience in order to reuse the typedef needed for algorithms

4203728
mouseup	mousedown
some are mousedown and mouseup or a variation on that

4203747
rss	feed
it looks like twitter has retired rss feed and now only exports data as json

4203755
post	get
even if you dislike to post when it is really a get it will work

4203755
post	get
if you will must stay with the standard definition of get post etc

4203755
post	get
than maybe consider to post a query that query will be stored on the server with a query id and request the query later with get by id

4203771
nettcpbinding	net.tcp
configure nettcpbinding in your iis site and set enabled protocol as http net.tcp using advanced setting .it should work

4203820
pull	push
see here for some more information on gwt and push which is actually pull

4203836
namedtuple	dictionary
some collective nouns are lists dictionary tuples sets or namedtuple and you don t need to do very much work

4203849
post	get
as petermmm previsouly said you could do this with a post create and store the query result and then use a get to retrive the query but it s more pratical do only a post and retrieve the result

4203864
textarea	textbox
it just needs to work on textarea and textbox no other checking is needed

4203906
union	distinct
you will have to use a union but if the tables are distinct consider using a union all which will be faster

4203916
rss	feed
i have created a rss feed for my blog it validates fine

4203940
glibc	tcmalloc
so what i want is basically to make glibc to use tcmalloc instead of glibc s malloc

4203946
superclass	subclassing
the superclass is account and i have two subclassing - currentaccount and savingsaccount

4203952
for-loop	while-loop
and now we know that for-loop is faster than while-loop

4203965
implements	extends
i don t want to keep any default implementation forcing all extends classes to implements this method

4203988
superclass	subclassing	abstract-class	superclass
this will force all subclassing to implements it even if it is implements in a superclass of the abstract-class

4204083
glibc	tcmalloc
alternatively before using any glibc functions load the tcmalloc library using dlopen

4204083
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
dlsym the malloc realloc and free routines and initialize a struct gmemvtable with them

4204092
emacs	aquamacs
aquamacs 2.1 emacs 23.2

4204093
ubuntu	linux
i have an application which is designed to run on both ubuntu linux and android

4204094
mouseover	mouseout
i had a similar problem with chrome i think i seem to remember using mouseover and mouseout instead

4204161
google-chrome	firefox
note google-chrome in this case refers to firefox s user interface

4204190
hide	show
when i then instead hide the #addform div on init and right after show it again it s the same problem

4204193
mouse	keyboard
an element can gain focus via keyboard commands such as the tab key or by mouse clicks on the element

4204249
uploadify	swfupload
so i have tried both swfupload and uploadify component

4204263
post	get
if you need to handle this originating page - form page - originating page then in reality it will look like this originating page -- get -- form page -- post submision -- form page 2 -- get redirect -- originating page

4204291
boost	stl
since you use stl and boost performance might be a pretty big deal

4204291
boost	stl
vc2010 supports rvalue references and move semantics which even if you don t use it in your own code speeds up boost and stl code significantly

4204291
versioning	upgrade
but if at some point you upgrade to a recent versioning of boost you ll get the benefit

4204302
superclass	subclassing
and i was wondering if it were possible to share functionality for some common functions between subclassing by implementing them in the superclass

4204322
pypdf	pdfminer
for splitting however you will have to stick with pypdf as pdfminer doesn t support that

4204331
postgresql	mysql
i don t know how to do this in postgresql but in mysql you could create database view pointing to a table in another database

4204427
unsigned	short
the second one casts the same negative number to unsigned short that s why it passes

4204482
put	get
if you put the whole pattern in a group you will also get the separators

4204517
width	height
the content should be scrollable so that the set width and height will not be changing

4204542
helpers	actioncontroller
so yes if you derive your class from actioncontroller base all helpers will be included

4204569
filtering	grouping
i trying to make a simple image gallery where i have several radio button grouping to filtering the search results. i am pretty new to jquery and started learning it today so please be patient.

4204571
width	height
set content div height and width

4204584
innodb	myisam
that s not good for myisam but i don t know about innodb and others

4204642

hash	md5
looking for a method or to be pointed in the right direction so i can return an hash equal to the hash returned by formsauthentication.hashpasswordforstoringinconfigfile asdf md5

4205014
profiling	debugging
there are also frameworks that extend cuda to enable a smoother development process like managed cuda which has features like debugging and profiling

4205020
waitpid	fork
similarly programs that know they re finished and just want to run another program don t need to fork exec and then wait waitpid for the child

4205046
int	double
clearly this makes using a long or double in your looping variable less efficient than an int in the java memory model but implementations may vary in performance

4205150
sorting	filtering
we php project data locally stored in a json-variable locally processed sorting filtering no paging up to 1000 records at once were faced with the same problem and did not find a solution yet

4205426
public	protected
look up how public protected and private work

4205430
width	height
i figured that as i was checking the value of a single pixel width and height are 1 and giving it a gl_int as type gl_rgb as format a single pixel should take up a single int 4 bytes hence i passed a pointer to an int as the data argument

4205460

4205574
submit	submission
my code pauses the submission and returns validation result currently just a dummy function which returns result true but then the submit action is not performed

4205645
int	chars
you could analyze your current code by printing out the value of int ae1.charat 0 and seeing which unicode chars that is

4205725
mouse	keyboard
by using .keypress you ll be checking the value each time the key is pressed mouse or keyboard and it should work fine across most browsers

alternatively use a relativelayout with the scrollview set to layout below the title or with a top margin on the scrollview equal to the height of the title bar

4206070
put	get
the underlying java program has basically a few classes to get put list and remove the file from the server

4206072
folder	directory
you can do it in the project manager and then adjusting the properties so that the file is published to the application folder copy to output directory copy always

4206073
nsmutablestring	nsstring
bear in mind that an nsstring could actually be pointing to an nsmutablestring

4206083
pull	push
however for your problem at hand i strongly recommend looking into git another nice version control system that does not require a centralized host all checkouts are treated equally so you make changes on your laptop and push them to the desktop or you make changes on your desktop and push them to the laptop or you pull changes from the laptop to the desktop and vice versa

4206169
google-chrome	firefox
xmlhttprequest should be easily support for extensions for both firefox and google-chrome

4206169
google-chrome	firefox
and websockets support should also be support for extensions in both google-chrome and firefox 4.0 and onwards

4206219
hash	md5
but i am not getting the correct md5 hash for the input i provide

4206226
jobs	cron
as a possible alternative to using cron jobs i found the sleep function

4206246

i use jquery plugins like flot and jqplot for plotting and charts in asp.net mvc web applications

4206612
int	double
i even tried changing the binding property s datatype to int string and double

4206616
width	height
if you didn t set width and height values for your images the browser would have to download the images first to discover their dimensions and it would slow page loading for people with crappy connections

4206616
width	height
for the past few years i ve been using css i always put a width and height declaration in my img tags in my html

4206723
width	height
css is parsed before the page is loaded so specifying the height width in css will work just as well as specifying it inline

4206723
width	height
one thing to keep in mind is that inline styles and that includes height and width declarations always trump css in specificity

4206859
intersect	contains
you basically want to check if the frame of the subviews inside the uiscrollview intersect the scrollview s frame if you only want to determine partial visibility or if the frame is contains in the other frame if you want to determine full visibility

4206859
intersect	contains
however in order to check if the subview s frame intersect and or is contains in the scrollview s frame you need to translate it from the local coords inside the scrollview to the global coordinates outside the scrollview

4206874
jobs	cron
this is why legitimate cron jobs were invented

4206956
post	get
you can get your custom post query and ordering using either one of the following functions techniques

4207209
accessor	ivar
since you d have to do that every time you want to assign the ivar it s normal to create an accessor

4207209
accessor	properties
if you use properties you can use synthesize to create the accessor

4207246
width	height
there are several images in the email which are arranged using width and height attributes of the img tag

4207246
width	height
but on outlook 2007 it gets messed up and the images shows up in random sizes even though height and width are given explicitly in the html code

4207266
typedef	struct
typedef struct omp_lock_t lock

4207292
htmlcleaner	jsoup
use the jsoup htmlcleaner with a configuration specified by a whitelist

4207306
concave	convex
if those points may not define a convex polygon you need a concave hull algorithm in step 1

4207330
width	height
outlook 2007 seems respects the actual width and height of the image over the declared width and height of the image in cases where the declared width or height of the image is close to or equal to 0

4207330
width	height
and outlook does not respect the width and height css attributes at all . your best bet is to re-size the images in question so that they actually have the height and width you declare rather than re-sizing them

4207333
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this will work for all modern browsers except ie firefox safari google-chrome etc... now to get ie to behave you will need the following

4207385
jquery	jqmodal
i have this little piece of jquery jqmodal code which works fine

4207386
subtract	add
i m trying to build a single query that can add subtract seconds from a datetime stamp

4207467
int	chars
the two valid mains are int main and int main int chars any thing else may or may not compile

4207485
post	get
for instance a function that executes a sql query is a sink and get post variables are sources of taint

4207498
google-chrome	firefox
i ve ran this code in firefox ie google-chrome and they all caught the error so i assume you mean catch the miss spelling

4207501
submit	submission
alternatively intercept the form submission using javascript and submit it using xhr iff the server-side validation succeeds

4207535
sys	subprocess
then there are the os sys subprocess and dircache modules

4207553
backgroundworker	dispatchertimer
however having a backgroundworker invoke partialemployees.clear on your ui thread will have the same effect as using the dispatchertimer so you need a different solution than the one you are going for

4207553
backgroundworker	dispatchertimer
the solution is to break your work into smaller portions and do them one at a time either from a dispatchertimer or a backgroundworker

4207565
children	parent
parent children siblings etc -

4207580
width	height
the bottom right adorner and the top right adorner seemed to appear about the width of the and height from the side of the canvas when ever moved

multiplying	add
both libs add and multiplying where compiled before and are present in the same directory

4207687
glibc	newlib	openbsd	freebsd	libc	newlib
if you really need a self contained c library i would consider newlib or uclibc or freebsd s openbsd s libc over glibc

4207693
keydown	keyup	textchanged	keyup
for instance a textbox is a control that is designed to capture and then visually represent text that was entered by using the keyboard and it uses keyup and keydown in its own logic to capture keystrokes then also raises its own textchanged event if the text actually changed

4207693
keydown	keyup
you can still generally add handlers for keyup and keydown to a textbox or any related control that is intended to process text input

4207693
onkeyup	onkeydown
custom controls can implement their own similar override behavior for key events by overriding onkeydown onkeyup

4207693
onkeyup	onkeydown
if your custom control processes specific accelerator keys or has control or focus behavior that is similar to the scenario described for textbox you should place this logic in your own onkeydown onkeyup overrides

4207713
jboss	glassfish
o servlet 3 is supported by glassfish 3 but not much else yet will be part of tomcat 7 probably jboss 6

4207733
addition	multiplication
the final multiplication therefore involves the addition of up to 2 5 partial results each roughly 2 18 bits long

4207740
innodb	myisam
innodb or myisam

4207780
button	checkbox
do you think it s a good idea to use svg instead of raster graphics for ui controls like checkbox button and such

4207844
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
i can t find anything to confirm whether properly constructed queries work faster on a case-sensitive vs case-insensitive database although i suspect the difference is negligible but a few things are clear to me

4207881
prepare	execute
to do that we need to work around two limitations of mysql a to execute dynamic sql inside a stored procedure it needs to be a prepare statement

4207914
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
use the developer tools in google-chrome and safari or firebug for firefox and check out the profiles section

4207985
put	get
isready yes by the time they get put in the operation queue then a serial

4208063
hide	show
hide the currently visible menu and show the one to be made visible

4208082
pop-up	dialog
so i want an intent to start an activity that simply brings up a dialog pop-up box telling the user how to use the app

4208108
hide	show
it is exactly the same as patrcikâ s code with the hide and show functions

4208128
margin	text-align
i don t know what an asp.net repeater is but in ie if you are centering a block level element using the margin rules margin 0 auto then the parent element needs to have text-align center

4208131
sharepoint	splist
since you re building a sharepoint web part you should access the list and its data via the splist class

4208136
children	parent
for another thing i may have gone overboard in saving references to both parent and children in these classes. but i hope it gives you ideas that you can start working with

4208157
dictionary	map
using attributes to model a map or dictionary whose keys are xml names and whose values can sensibly be represented as strings good

4208180
vbscript	vba
how to submit form data by using xmlhttp or serverxmlhttp object at which uses vbscript but is easily converted to vba

4208239
mouseleave	mouseenter
to be sure here independent of initial mouse position you have to split your .hover to explicitly call .slidedown on mouseenter and .slideup on mouseleave like this

4208303
wordpress	joomla
drupal has a pretty horrible security record see the cve numbers quoted in another comment as do the other two major php-based frameworks wordpress and joomla

4208326
mouseleave	mouseenter
the .hover method accepts 2 functions representing mouseenter and mouseleave

4208329
uilabel	uitextview
find uicontrollers that draw nsattribute string because uilabel uitextview doesnot support nsattributedstring.

4208362
sorting	grouping
sql is very powerfull at sorting and grouping so let sql do his job and dont move it to the client

4208367
stdio	fflush	stdout	stdio	stdout	fflush
the reason that the fflush stdout is needed is that since the process is duplicated by fork that means that the buffering done for stdout by stdio is duplicated as well

4208367
stdout	fflush
the n at the end of that first print statement may make it go ahead and fflush stdout but this isn t guaranteed

4208382
children	parent
to show child categories remove parent 0 and likewise change it to a category id if you just want to display that categories children

4208383
switching	screens
a qstackedwidget manages a number of same sized screens that you can switching between each having its own set of display widgets and buttons

4208387
post	get
let s pretend that you had the task of creating a url a single web page which receives input get and or post and must clean and safely store that input to a database

4208399
pull	push
supported platform s this will push or pull you toward different code structure if you abstract the different platforms differently

4208404
ostream	istream
it would appear that there is a lot of extra unneeded information here the crux of the issue is that there is no streaming operator to got from an istream to an ostream

4208426
for-loop	loops
if i use a for-loop inside the while loops i would just be lining up the same records x times for each while loops

4208456
bmp	png
when using the system.windows.controls.openfiledialog control to browse image folders windows 7 it will show preview thumbnails icons for jpg png or bmp image files

4208457
google-chrome	firefox
in ie the print button shows but in firefox and google-chrome the print button does not show

4208457
google-chrome	firefox
i need to be able to issue a print command to the reportviewer the same way it is done from within the control but only in firefox and google-chrome

4208486
folder	directory
i know there is a way to set if files directory can be seen and the folder that the file dialog looks in but haven t come across a way to set the file extension

4208580
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in google-chrome firefox but when i try it in ie the text fades out but the background color remains the same and just disappears without fading out once the text fade has finished

4208617
put	get
one pattern is to put persisted objects directly under com.mysite.common and mashups of persisted items that get transferred over the wire in com.mysite.common.dto and of course the client gui code is in client

4208636
google-chrome	safari
it s worth noting that window.opener doesn t work if the file isn t loaded through an http connection in google-chrome though it works fine in safari

4208678
memcpy	malloc
if you can get say dozens of times improvement on heavily used functions like malloc or memcpy

4208726
children	parent
i don t see why z-index affects ff but it has the following effect since .abs_znone has no z-index it has the same stacking context as its parent .fix_z0 and .fix_z1 would have a z-index in relation to any children of .fix_z0

4208789
portrait	landscape
the problem is i can only snap a pic in landscape mode in order for the bmp to be displayed right side up - is there a way i can rotate it to right side up if the pic is taken in portrait mode

4208793
width	height
if not then you re probably out of luck since forced perspective can trick even the best of algorithms that detect human height and width

4208820
pexpect	subprocess	post	get
from my old post i get to know there is pty and pexpect which could make the subprocess thought it is interacting with pseudo-tty

4208869
button	checkbox
what i would like to have happen is once a checkbox is clicked it makes that container visible then the next and back button when clicked only go to the next visible container

4208877
versioning	upgrade
unfortunately the team i am creating this for cannot upgrade to a newer versioning of outlook so if there is a 2003 quirk that may be affecting it

4208913
min	max
and even weirder when i try c min max ...

4208938
hide	show
and you can do the reverse hide panel a and show panel b by doing this

4208946
children	parent
these behave differently because #byidname div refers to any children of type div with parent #byidname

4208951
printf	fgets
alternatively you can convert your program to be unicode-aware but then you can no longer use a lot of standard library functions such as fgets and printf and you need to use wchar_t everywhere in place of char

4208966
width	height
if you add padding to an element you must decrease width and height accordingly

4208983
hide	show
then make a function to navigate back forward through the array and show hide the containers they reference

4208983
button	checkbox
or have a button to start the wizard that loops through the checkbox and removes the containers from the view stack that are not checked

4208993
user-controls	tabcontrol	tabcontrol	tabitem
it has a tabcontrol where each tabitem is a user-controls and it does this by applying the mvvm pattern

4209015
public	protected
then on construction each class provides a protected constructor for use by subclasses and a public constructor for non-inherited instance creation

4209015
public	protected
the protected constructor in each class does not add this to the container of instances while the public constructor adds this to the container

4209050
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
so my first thought was that i was being blocked by the server with their clientaccesspolicy.xml or crossdomain.xml

4209060
webkit	gecko
i ve looked at web rendering engines like webkit and gecko that seem too complex latex doesn t seem to have a c++ api ghostscript looks the most promising so far

4209092
hash	salt
then for your mapping of business object to viewmodel it s straight forward except for the costhash you want to calculate the sha256 hash or other hash of cost + private key + predicable salt value such as the id of the receipt itself

4209092
hash	salt
this would allow a person to easily transpose both the cost value and the costhash value from a different receipt however if you add in the id to be part of the salt the hash for 10 for receipt 1 will be different than 10 for receipt 2

4209099
rsa	aes
while it may be interesting to roll your own it is unlikely anything you can come up with will be as well vetted as aes rsa or sha

4209099
post	get
post it on a public server and try to get as much publicity as possible

4209099
rsa	aes
people everyday are researching ways to break aes rsa and sha and that provides a level of assurance that is impossible with a homebrew cipher

4209121
maven	pom.xml
we are using maven can i somehow reuse the version as defined in pom.xml

4209136
stdout	stderr
if it is good for you to read a mixture of stdout and stderr use processbuilder as following

4209136
stdout	stderr
now read from the input stream that contains both stdout and stderr

4209138
post	get
it is very easy to request get post with invalid data

4209172
width	height
make height and width of the div auto so it gets the height and width of the image

4209291
rss	feed
try saving the contents of the rss feed in a local file and see if the problem persists when loading from a local drive

4209317
hash	salt
for example credit card information or american social dingsbums numbers fall under certain laws and must be stored securely within in the database passwords must be salt and hash so not even db admins can retrieve the user s personal password again etc etc

4209363
int	double
so you say int i double d float f string s etc

4209365
google-chrome	firefox
ie is significantly more fussy about code correctness than firefox and google-chrome for html xml received via ajax especially

4209365
google-chrome	firefox
if firefox and google-chrome are handling an ajax request that ie isn t it is usually due to a parse error in the returned html xml

4209414
udp	tcp
or use udp instead of tcp

4209465
google-chrome	firefox
firefox is slow but google-chrome dosent have firebug which i find almost a requirement when developing with javascript

4209480
google-chrome	firefox
this is what i got up with after some help from my original qustion here jquery in internet explorer find image problem works in firefox and google-chrome

4209482
put	get
whenever i try to put a breakpoint in i get an exclamation point over the breakpoint saying this breakpoint will not currently be hit

4209490
ssl	https
i ve never dealt with ssl https certificates but i need to fix this issue asap

4209545
post	get
they therefore specifically don t want a response body so don t need to provide the list of potential choices you would for 300 to a get or post request

4209549
jboss	geronimo	jboss	glassfish	glassfish	geronimo
interestingly though it appears most major app servers support some mechanism of turning off delegation to isolate the application from the app server if necessary because of conflicts or otherwise websphere - parent-last glassfish - jboss - geronimo -

4209564
int	chars
it assumes that the string will only contain valid chars and that the string won t represent a number that s too big to fit in an int variable

4209616
accessor	properties
self is used to access class instance properties an accessor

4209631
getter	setter
the difference is that 1 is guaranteed to be using the property named myobject and therefore will trigger the getter and setter functions

4209631
getter	setter
the second one accessed the the instance variable and is not guaranteed to use the getter and setter functions

4209631
getter	setter
if your ivar has the same name as the property it should use the setter and getter functions

4209669
children	parent
in my object graph i have a standard parent + children relationship

4209674
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
take a look at the system.threading.waithandle class derived classes of interest are manualresetevent and autoresetevent

4209689
ant	maven
usually most of the gui for ant or maven are part of the ide

4209689
ant	maven
i use intellij that has an excellent support for ant and maven

4209691
inherited	properties
it means that you can establish a parent-child relation between two objects and immediately the child inherited all parent properties

4209691
children	parent
when you change the value of a property in the parent object you will see the new value in its children too

4209702
typemock	moles
this is a clr limitation. typemock or moles get around the limitation by wedging themselves in at the profiler level

4209710
websphere	ibm
this code works against active directory on aix using ibm s 1.5 jvm but not on the same machine with the same vm when run inside websphere 6.1

4209718

4210126
cvs	svn
i did this a few years ago with cvs and jira then svn and jira

4210148
atexit	main
then register this on startup as an atexit function since you ll want it to be called if something calls exit rather than returning from main

4210148
stdout	stderr
i don t understand why vs s output window is so slow and i don t understand why it doesn t capture stdout stderr but since i ve settled on using the above i ve found it less bothersome

4210162
super	abstract	super	extends
if your app contains several activities why not put this method in an abstract super class extends activity and then have all you activities extends it

4210361
post	get
using get instead of post isn t always possible when the amount of data exceed the maximum url length

4210361
post	get
the advantage of this is that the user won t get those annoying warnings about resending any post data you described and that multiple submissions of the same data are less likely to occur which means for example fewer double postings

4210369
children	parent
i m having some trouble figuring out why i can only get the children of one parent in my treeview to be added

4210385
rss	feed
any rss feed advertised by your site will not show up in the address bar on browsers that support this

4210407
getter	setter
thus core data adds methods to use in getter just as methods exist for use in setter to act as kvo hooks

4210407
getter	setter
this is why the standard pattern for implementing core data getter and setter prior to the existence of property and dynamic looked like this

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
problem in firefox safari google-chrome and ie

4210523
for-loop	loops
since this is a non-standard for-loop using a while loops might be more appropriate as there are fewer preconceived ideas about how they work people looking at your code are more likely to read a while statement than a for statement as there is usually a model of how a for-loop should work in their head

4210556
width	height
is 8 191 pixels in width or height

4210576
nsmenu	nspopupbutton
nspopupbutton takes an nsmenu full of nsmenuitems

4210631

apparently the easiest way to do this is to use script to redefine the alert function to something that doesn t pop-up a dialog

4210812
hash	salt
that means they have access to the hash passwords and salt

4210822
hash	salt
you should use a separate pseudo-random salt for each user and then store that salt with the password hash for that user

4210822
hash	salt	pbkdf2	hash	pbkdf2	salt
i would also recommend using a system like pbkdf2 or bcrypt rather than a simple salt hash

4210834
int	chars
to find out loop through the string you get in and print out each chars s int value and then do the same with your string that s hardcoded and see if they are the same

4211006
google-chrome	firefox
tested in google-chrome 8 and firefox 3.6

4211066
children	parent
my problem is that the children s attributes are still being validated despite the parent attribute validating as true

4211158
expander	grid
for instance opening an expander that contains a grid with maybe 6 label and textbox controls goes from near-instantaneous to 3-4 seconds and there s then a visible delay between the time it renders the grid s second column the editable controls and the first their labels

4211158
expander	grid
if i drop back to 3.5 everything goes back to the way it was there s virtually no lag between opening an expander and seeing its contents and the labels in the grid render so quickly that you can t see it happen

4211205
google-chrome	firefox
what actually happens is both the inner div and the content div match the outerdiv div rule despite that one of them is clearly triple checked in an inspector firefox and google-chrome a child of the inner div not the outer

4211214
firefox	safari
in safari firefox

4211231
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox the onbeforeunload event fires but in google-chrome it doesn t and it seems to error out with an unsafe javascript attempt to access frame before any events are fired

4211237
jdom	xerces
the standard xml parser that comes with java does not allow you to set a feature to provide a canonical version or understand xml space if that is going to be a problem then you may need a replacement xml parser such as xerces or use jdom

4211348
sdl	soil
i had it working partially with the soil library but i ve moved a lot of code to sdl and i d prefer to use img_load instead

4211379

4211560
superclass	subclassing
i should mention that when using subclassing a onetoonefield is automatically created from the subclassing to the superclass

4211595
unsigned	short	int	chars
this is often considered something of a wart because in many cases it causes unsigned chars and unsigned short values to be promoted to int

4211595
unsigned	short
this is exactly what you re seeing - u16_varlow and u16_varhigh and unsigned short 5 are all promoted to int before the subtraction and comparison which then happen using int

4211595
unsigned	short
if you wish to be certain that an expression will use unsigned arithmetic you must do it in unsigned int not unsigned short

4211855
inherited	subclassing
note the dictionary will check for an exact match on types so if you want to handle subclassing you ll have to write some additional code to see whether base types are listed in the dictionary hint if you match a base class or even if you don t go ahead and add the actual derived type to the dictionary so you won t have to recurse through the inherited tree again

4211883

basically post and get are two different way to pass variables to a script

4218091
post	get
while the post method can be submitted with forms or ajax calls and it is pretty safe at least more than the get

move	drag
first i feel like there are a lot of conditions that have to come together for this to work and i wonder if i ll get so lucky trying to move some telerik drag and drop code into mvvm

4218833
onchange	onblur
i think that either onchange or onblur events on the input fields are better to use then setinterval

when i turn its linkscanner and online shield both features off post requests from google-chrome and safari that did not work at all start to work

4218937
put	get
simply put the best way to balance security concerns versus performance is to worry about security first get some load from real customers not whiteboard stick figures being obsessed over by some architect and get real metrics from your code when you suspect performance might be an issue

4218991
folder	directory
3 in the past with other projects i ve worked on we kept a separate directory next to the tags trunk and branches with svn called configurations that had a base directory that contained a template of what the configuration file s should look like and developers folder and a servers directory

4218992
internationalization	translation
i installed the internationalization module and the views translation module among many others

edit looking at your site if it is the navigation area that you re talking about you could adjust the markup so that you have an inside each that is expanded to the full width and height of the

4219176
mouseover	mouseout
mapped to mouseover and mouseout

4219183
libevent	epoll
notice that one of the versions he wrote was in c using libevent epoll which is what ape uses as well

4219259
post	get
bonus points if the script can access the http request stuff url host get post params and cookie

4219300
inherited	properties
class inherited doesn t mean to hide or to replace one class s properties value but that the derived class is a specialization of the base class it inherited from

4219317
puts	gets
ok so i have this script and what it does is makes an ajax call to a page every time the link is clicked gets the html element from the ajax puts it into the maincanvas element then assign drag and resize features to it

4219351
width	height
it seems as though you don t want to use css to set the width and height properties for the canvas element

4219359
post	get
you can specify in php to send back only wanted part of page when specific get or post data is present and use .get or .post to get them

4219369
width	height
when looking into the code a little deeper i found a portion that was subtracting the x and y from the desired width and height even thought i wasn t dragging the adorner yet

4219414
put	get
note that i put that drupal_add_js into hook_init -- i did that because if you don t the script could get lost when using drupal s aggressive caching feature

integer	unsigned
with n value bits an unsigned integer type has 2 n values in the range 0 through 2 n -1 inclusive

4219565
unsigned	short
or if the hexadecimal value makes more sense to switch to unsigned short

4219592
xslt	xquery
however there ar related technologies such as xslt and xquery which allow the transformation of xml

4219706
width	height
method then set a fixed width and height

4219712
codeigniter	yii
codeigniter is ok but if you want an alternative i recommend you to give a try to yii

4219723
matplotlib	mplot3d
i have been using mplot3d part of matplotlib for some various 3d plotting and it has been performing the job admirably

4219723
for-loop	arrays
my current approach is a very ugly brute-force do a for-loop then check if you re in an odd row or not that builds a new arrays out of the old one but i am hoping there is a more elegant way of doing this

4219750
justmock	typemock
i believe that you can replace the implementation of a class like random using tools such as justmock or typemock

4219753
zoo	xts
popular favourites are zoo and xts both of which have plenty of documentation

4219753
zoo	xts
and do search here for r xts or r zoo to search within the r tag

4219819
put	get
you can put the enum definition and a method to get the size using sizeof in a class in it s own file and click on resharper options.

4219825
post	get
note the only input is from the msg variable which could be from get post or a cookie .

4219910
pecl	pear
looked for documentation on how to add this to pear pecl no luck

4219918
width	height
but i continually find that the easiest and most reliable way is to wrap my embeds spawned from js iframe whatever the widget may use in an div which i then constrain the width and height on

4219921
children	parent
in each of these cases you look at the parent object and count the children

4219923
affinity	processors
process and processthread objects have a processoraffinity property of intptr type that can be directly manipulated to read change affinity for up to 64 processors

4219946
post	get
however iis manager doesn t allow me to see anything server output except log which record only get and post actions

4220090
post	put
update i realize i described this wrong - it doesn t have to actually post the status it can take them to twitter ask them to logged in if not skip and then put the status update inside the tweet box and require the user to press tweet to send it

4220099
hide	show
another way around is having the heavy code taking time to run asynchronously in separate thread then in the main thread show only the please wait and have the separate thread hide that message once done

4220154
post	get
when i create a new post and enter text into the body i can t get it to recognize anything other than pure text

4220261
folder	directory
universe x is the main directory of this svn project with the other folder being part of the tree

4220349
cdr	cons
i m not allowed to use lets loops or whiles and can only use basic car cdr setq cond cons append progn list.

4220380
addition	multiplication
if you re doing a typical shift-and-add binary long multiplication you could build some 64-bit shift and addition primitives from 32-bit operations then use the same method

4220390
cos	sin
then you use sin or cos functions to calculate x y coordinates of your quad corners properly

4220427
getter	setter
if i have a synchronized getter setter method for each variable then this will basically lock the whole class instead of the individual field until that method is set

4220431
folder	directory
however it hasn t actually made a folder in the realprofessionals directory called footer

4220444
submit	submission
you aren t doing anything to prevent the default action of submission the form so it submit it to the url specified in the action attribute although since you failed to include that mandatory attribute it uses the current url instead

4220445
maven	m2e
this is doable whether you re using the maven eclipse plugin or the m2e plugin just make sure to install the maven integration for wtp from the m2e extras

4220463
terminate	timeout
so in the first and second case the script will terminate with a timeout error because that s the defined behaviour of max_execution_time

4220465
getter	setter
if i have a synchronized getter setter method for each variable then this will basically lock the whole class instead of the individual field until that method is set

4220466
put	get
i wouldn t put the const keyword but that is the only way i can get strings like

4220469
udp	tcp
you ve struck lucky with the requirements - because you re going from udp - tcp it s actually a lot simpler than doing udp - udp

4220478
children	parent
using the parent and traversing the children nodes won t do it as there might be other siblings which are not selected inside this parent

4220486
public	protected
method visibility access control public private protected

4220489
gdal	ogr
another approach might be to look at the gdal ogr library and utilities

4220540
mouseover	mouseout
i am using jquery events like mouseover and mouseout

4220540
addclass	removeclass
when a user fires the mouseover on the target element this element receives a new class with removeclass and addclass

4220569
wymeditor	fckeditor
you can look into a simpler markup language like redcloth very easy to implement but also somewhat limited or you can go all-out wysiwyg like fckeditor or wymeditor

4220581
cldc	midp
all of the core decoding code in core is java 1.2-compatible and compatible with the j2me subset of java midp 2 cldc 1.1

4220605
serializable	deserialization
then implement the serializable and deserialization of the guid field in the property get set of the new property

4220611
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested it in firefox and google-chrome

4220618
mouseleave	mouseenter
that is bind .hover to elements with the class .project and simply add and remove the .selected class when the mouseenter first argument and mouseleave second argument events are triggered

4220620
mouseover	mouseout
edit karim s hover solution is better than doing it via mouseout mouseover

4220622
atomic	compare-and-swap
value.compareandswap v v + 1 is equivalent to the following except that the entire block is atomic see compare-and-swap for details

4220676
width	height
right now the divs are floated left and the anchor tags inside them have background images width height and display block

4220697
rss	feed
i am using the lazytableimages sample code to aynchronusly load images in my table view from an rss feed

4220768
int	chars
void lua_setfield lua_state l int index const chars k

4220799
google-chrome	firefox
so while it s true that mozilla firefox and google-chrome both rely on network-enabled geolocation via google s location service database that s not a requirement of the standard

4220813
django-haystack	django-sphinx
thanks to django-sphinx it s about as easy to set up as django-haystack

4220854
client-side	server-side
secondly there aren t really the concepts of server-side and client-side in git

4220867
websphere	ibm
for all redirect responses ibm websphere automatically adds header as below

4220887
hide	show
the first one show a little spinner the second one hide it

4220887
hide	show
when i click the link the spinner show but it doesn t hide

4220928
folder	directory
so the external class folder you add in eclipse should contain the directory foo which should contain the subdirectory bar which should contain myexternalclass.class

4220942
hash	md5
i have a legacy schema that contains tables with primary keys of type binary 16 -- its a md5 hash of the other columns

4220951
outputstream	inputstream
inputstream and outputstream are streams of bytes

4220954
verilog	vhdl
bits are packaged in bytes and apart from vhdl verilog i have seen no language that allows you to append individual bits to a stream

4220965
ubuntu	linux
i am using linux ubuntu 9.10

4220978
instances	transient
what i would like to do is create a transient instances of the entity map the new values from the dto then have nh generate a sql statement using only the properties i have changed

4220996
typhoeus	httparty
many other http client gems are available including httparty and typhoeus

4221016
boost	eigen	eigen	ublas
one exception may be boost numeric ublas which is does its job but eigen does it remarkably better

4221031
postgresql	mysql
with that being said you could also use mysql postgresql or some other database back end to deal with the flow of data between scripts

4221034
scheme	racket
many shared web hosts allow you to build and run arbitrary programs on your account so you can compile racket guile whatever saving the binary in your home directory and then have all of your scheme files executed by the shell by putting something like #

4221058
put	get
a sneaky way that you might be able to get this to work is to load the pdf in google doc viewer and then put an invisible div over it to intercept interaction

4221065
free	malloc
because of this structures passed to threads are normally dynamically allocated say using malloc and the thread can free it once it has completed

4221111
nunit	mstest
option 2 - customise the default workflow template and replace the mstest testing activity with an invokeprocess activity that calls the nunit command line

4221161
setcontentview	findviewbyid
i m almost sure that your problem is using findviewbyid r.id.false_view without calling setcontentview r.layout.blabla_whatever where blabla_whatever.xml contains false_view

4221161
textview	imageview
unless you show a completely different layout you wouldn t need to use different imageview nor textview to show the result

4221161
setcontentview	findviewbyid
if you insist in having different layouts make sure to call the setcontentview r.layout.noface_layout before using the findviewbyid method

4221196
prepare	execute
i m updating an existing application which uses a factory to build prepare statements and then execute them later which works for the rest of the system but i ve been tasked with adding a call to a statement which uses an ntext and i cannot figure out how to properly prepare the statement

4221212
uiview	subviews
the custom getter examples always have primative types or simple objects is the problem because there is another uiview object within headerview as a subviews

4221225
int	chars
i have a few questions about converting chars to int

4221251
post	get
i would after creation of the record redirect back to the same page after adding the new get variable except i would not be able to pass post vars thus making error and success messages a complete pain in the ass

4221265
int	chars
the conversion from chars a 2-byte type to int a 4-byte type is implicit in java because this is a widening conversion -- all of the possible values you can store in a chars you can also store in an int

4221272
int	chars
if c rules are anything to go by your chars can be automatically coerced into an int without a cast in your first example as the conversion does not involve a loss of information

4221272
int	chars
however an explicit cast is required in your second case where there is potential to lose information since a chars is smaller than an int

4221301
ggplot2	aesthetics
when you add an aesthetics mapping that creates a legend such as ggplot2 will use the variable name as the title of the legend---in this case que_id

4221301
width	height
when the tikzdevice tries to calculate the height and width of the legend title que_id it passes the string to latex for typesetting and expects latex to return the width and height of the string

4221342
multiplying	add
add the fixed value to the base price then multiplying by the percentages value

4221343
equals	gethashcode
and of course you should never override equals and not override gethashcode

4221371
width	height
if it is a vga screen i have to multiple the x y width and height by 2 for each control added manually

4221380
width	margin
assuming the buttons are supposed to be next to each other on the same line they should not each be centered using the auto margin but placed inside a div with a defined width that has a margin 0 auto

4221395
implements	extends
but if you want to access the listadapter and get a value out by providing a string than you will have to extends listview and implements that functionality yourself

4221403
pdcurses	ncurses
on windows you can use pdcurses that is compatible with ncurses

4221410
pull	push
after doing that and activating version control on the project in idea idea allowed me to push and pull from the repository successfully

4221422
width	height
to calculate the width and height of the far plane based on the camera position the width height of the viewport and the fieldofview angle

4221469
apache	cherokee
i recommend cherokee web server very easy to load balance across different servers and benchmarks proves faster than apache

4221499
int	chars
then a chars array is setup you can use int if this is too short

4221500
mp3	ogg
as long as the stream has ogg vorbis source and mp3 it should be good

4221548
jobs	cron
some components may be tied to scheduled timers like cron jobs or windows scheduled tasks

4221604
saas	iaas
in such do i need any middleware in addition to the iaas setup and the saas application

4221648
dlsym	dlopen
to use the dlopen dlsym dlclose

4221660
qfiledialog	qdir
i added a add files button that works with qdir and qfiledialog and loads files into a listwidget

4221711
opera	google-chrome
seems to work in google-chrome but not in opera

4221733
postgresql	mysql
maybe facebook but unless you re creating a facebook-competitor just use mysql postgresql or whatever you are most comfortable with

4221798
saas	iaas
in such do i need any middleware in addition to the iaas setup and the saas application

4221810
perl	tcl
tk which was written in tcl and has bindings for python perl ruby lisp and a few others

4221810
kde	gnome
they have their advantages and disadvantages tk looks good on some platforms but not others and there aren t too many bindings for it gtk looks great on gnome desktops but so-so elsewhere and qt looks good in kde but okay elsewhere

4221889
kerberos	ntlm
this method works for both ntlm and kerberos authentication

4221913
getter	setter
assuming that doesn t work i think the next best thing is probably to subclass listproperty and manually extend it with getter setter and iterators based on the get_value_for_datastore and make_value_from_datastore functions for lists with fuzzydateproperty members

4221953
getter	setter
i ve been working with getter and setter to avoid the prospect of using global variables

4221966
cpython	pypy
your question seems to expect the pypy interpreter is running on top of cpython while executing code

4221995
put	get
i would put another column on the datatable with the name tobedeleted or something but the tables get displayed in the program via a grid

4222003
mdpi	hdpi
density ldpi mdpi hdpi nodpi no auto-scale

4222035
stdout	stderr
- call the batch script as a subprocess and then save stdout and stderr to a file

4222035
stdout	stderr
however the problem is that the stdout stderr file is not being actually written to until the entire batch script has finished running or errors out

4222064
getter	setter
you just negated your use of private variables with getter and setter by using you just made me a global variable by not using var

4222068
qtcpsocket	qtcpserver
i am using qtcpserver and qtcpsocket class in qt ..i am writing on socket and reading from socket on server side but my read fails

4222068
qiodevice	qdatastream
qdatastream out block qiodevice readwrite

4222077
awt	swing
also have a look through the appropriate swing and awt parts of the api

4222131
coff	omf
i ve added to the compiler search path the folder that contains the files needed - ucdl.h and ucc12.lib c++ told me i needed to convert the .lib from coff to omf so i did

4222139
post	get
there are only two ways get send data back to the server the query-string and form post values

4222201
getter	setter
they re just a bit of syntactic sugar for the . access and the ability to have synthesized getter setter methods to save you the tedium of writing your own

4222248
width	height
instead of keeping multiple arrays of x y width height values keep an arraylist of ellipse2d object so you don t have to keep recreating those objects either

4222308
dbcontext	objectcontext
internally dbcontext uses a protected objectcontext that you can also use inside your inherited dbcontext class efcodefirst

4222347
perl	tcl
i m not sure if this is what you mean but android has sl4a scripting layer for android which supports lots of scripting languages among them python perl jruby lua beanshell javascript tcl

4222412
x86	64bit
make sure you are compiling for the x86 target instead of anycpu especially if you run on 64bit systems

4222426
button	checkbox
for your to-do list example i would use an nstableview with a checkbox button cell in one column for the â œdoneâ property

4222436
inherited	subclassing
the one thing to realize is that admin peoplecontroller will inherited any actions that admincontroller has defined just as anything defined in applicationcontroller becomes available in all subclassing

4222504
implements	extends
public class loginserviceimpl extends remoteserviceservlet implements loginservice

4222537
width	height
there may be browsers that allow you to create a of the given path by that you could check if it s a real image or not if not the onerror-event should fire on the image and it will have a width height of 0

4222609
g++	gcc
assuming you re using gcc to compile you should use the g++ executable to compile your source code not the gcc executable

4222638
strophe	smack
i have an xmpp application where two clients interact 1 a bot programmed with smack scala java and 2 a gui chat client programmed in strophe javascript

4222649
serializable	deserialization
i believe the idea is that when you don t serializable a property deserialization does not matter because the property simply isn t there in the to be deserialized data

4222662
simplexmlrpcserver	xmlrpclib
python has libraries that handle rpc using xml to pass parameters and results which frees you from dealing with binary format issues which are xmlrpclib on the client side and simplexmlrpcserver or docxmlrpcserver on the server end

4222676
typedef	struct
in plain-old c whenever you define a struct without a typedef you have explicitly use the struct keyword when creating variables

4222684
qtableview	qtablewidget
but as you are willing to show the file location and file size i would use a qtablewidget or qtableview

4222713
hide	show
anyone know how to disable hide notification bar at the top which show battery and other things in android

4222751
hide	show
i am looking for a way to show hide desktop icons programmatically in objective-c under mac os x

4222765
folder	dir
the public dir contained the welcome aboard rails index.html file but i deleted it created a controller called home with the view index. i then went into the config dir and uncommented root to to point to home#index but the website still just points to the public folder of the rails app showing its contents

4222765
put	get
instead it s looking for index.html in the public dir because when i put an index.html file in there it shows it and if i remove it i get an error 500

4222769
hide	show
i am trying to create an application which show the desktop hide all application even the finder

4222773
unsigned	short	int	chars
you could also use signed unsigned chars short int long long long etc

4222819
nvarchar	sqldbtype
the problem is that sqlparameter looks like it defaults to nvarchar if no sqldbtype is present

4222836
hash	md5
that said if you want to obscure the order that urls were added to the shortening service you could use the output of a cryptographic hash function such as md5 or sha1 which is considered irreversible infeasible to derive the input from the output base-64 encode that and take eight characters for example

4222849
post	get
i need to build a code where i have to make the content disposition automatically.means i need to fetch some text fields some image fields some sounds and all of the request i have to take with the post request i can not use the get request

4222901
typedef	typename
by the way the c technique for obtaining a full fledged typename is to use typedef

4222901
typedef	typename
since class names are full fledged typename in c++ such typedef is not necessary in c++

4223004
cakephp	kohana
im kind a new in kohana 3 i use to work in cakephp they have app_controller to init global setting controller for all controller

4223076
folder	directory
for php projects the build is very simple simply copy entire folder to www directory

4223089
i2c	spi
besides that in general you should learn i2c spi 1wire and try to interface sensors with such interfaces

4223143
min	max
will match x between min and max times

4223194
try-catch	exception-handling
the application is possible to crash because of unhandled exception-handling even if you have all functions wrapped in try-catch block because of multi-threading operations

4223210
vsto	add-in
if your goal is to develop a vsto add-in that supports both office 2003 and office 2007 then you ll need to develop on a system with vs2008 + office 2003

4223444
mongoid	activemodel
also mongoid makes a huge use of rails 3 features such as activemodel so i won t expect they will continue to support rails 2 for a long time

4223477
hash	md5
you have to define the uniqueness you want and then you can do a md5 hash of the key values defining your user for instance ip

4223497
implements	extends
since that makes more sense to me in the context of this domain i should be able to monitor carriers whether or not they re timed but mc is richly implements class and i will have to copy-paste all the methods into classes which used to extends from mc

4223497
getter	setter
timedcarrier extends carrier with a bunch of member variables and getter setter methods

4223497
getter	setter
monitoredcarrier extends carrier with member variables getter setter methods and a bunch of methods which work with the monitor

4223508
hash	md5
the chance of clashes here would likely head towards the chance of an md5 hash collision the point at which it s acceptable

4223509
post	get

imagemagick	graphicsmagick
edit i just compared the sample vbs scripts that are included with imagemagick and graphicsmagick both named simpletest.vbs

4229233

stdout	stderr
if your script reads input or writes output to stdout or stderr you need to handle this on separate threads using process.getinputstream ...getoutputstream and geterrorstream

4229508
stdout	stderr
the script does not produce a large amount of output on both stdout and stderr

4229508
stdout	stderr
if it does then since the program reads all of stdout before stderr the stderr buffer may fill up and block the process from completing

4229508
stdout	stderr
in a real implementation you would read stdout and stderr in separate threads hint wrap the loadstream method in a class that implements runnable

4229934
inherited	properties
inherited would be if you had specialised derivatives of product that have either extra properties or different behaviour

post	get
it looks like you re trying to get all post for thread_id 54 but you re not joining the two tables and you re not getting any data from the tf_threads table other than thread_id which i presume is also present in your tf_posts table

4232831
folder	directory
note also that you don t need to put int in system32 it s better is you put it in the rcurl directory ms no longer recommends putting libraries in system folder because of dll hell

4232841

have you tried the instead of width height in px ie

4232920
postgresql	mysql
i must say that there are many features i have gotten used to in sql server that are not present in mysql and postgresql

4232962
translation	localization
i assume the main reason is that you don t have to care about translation or localization files during development as the main language is in the code itself

4233004
implements	extends
first create a view class that extends abstractexcelview and implements the buildexceldocument method

4233005
phpunit	simpletest
the purpose was to provide better control and introspection of mock object invocations than that provided by phpunit and simpletest

4233018
google-chrome	firefox
but if i try to view it using firefox or google-chrome the whole listbox is showing

folder	directory
if you go to those directory listed you should see a folder named cache

4233121
sitecore	umbraco
you could try umbraco or sitecore too

4233138
int	chars
if i set the first chars within the b portion of an instance of mytype then i also am setting the first byte of the int to that same value

4233142
int	double
all c# types including primitive types such as int and double inherit from a single root object type

4233142
int	double
java also has several primitive types int long double byte etc - however they are special in that they are not object-oriented and they could not have been defined using the language itself

4233142
int	double
at the same time java also has object-oriented primitive wrapper types int long double byte etc often called boxed types

4233142
int	double
and the list above actually stores an array of pointers to boxed int objects which is double the size and substantially less performant than the c# version

4233192
trie	tree
pure speculation but quite likely that it tokenizes the page into words with their associated ranges then it puts those words into either a radix tree or a trie and does a prefix search within the tree

4233224
versioning	upgrade
if the database already exists and no versioning upgrade occured these methods won t be executed

4233273
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome this would work

4233295
hash	salt
the database answer is that the salt and the hash are different quantities and so you should ideally store them in different columns

4233295
hash	salt
however it is not uncommon to denormalize a database to improve access speed - concatenating the hash and salt in the same column would be an example of denormalization

4233295
hash	salt
one reason to keep the salt and hash separate would be that you envisage searching for one or other of them

4233326
accessor	properties
this is non-trivial as you ll need to learn enough about il emit to generate the properties accessor and there s a bit of a learning curve

4233332
put	get
if we put all of this together we get

4233339
width	height
the data is definitely a bitmap object and i am able to display get the height width etc and access some pixels using getpixel

4233339

in the future you can look up such things with tools such as firebug for firefox or inspect tool for google-chrome

4233433
abc	subclassing
in order to use an abc you must create a subclassing of it and implement each and every pure virtual member function in the derived class

4233433
public	protected
beyond the scope of this article but a better rule of thumb is a base class destructor should be either public and virtual or protected and nonvirtual

4233474
ready	each
it should be executed each time network is ready

for the fading action jquery s fadein and fadeout should work

4233735
google-chrome	firefox
all works fine in ie and google-chrome it gives the right div where is it hovering over but in firefox event.target returns a div that is not even close to the mouse it is a div behind that div that actually captures the first click it is set with a relative position

4233752
hide	show
you can create a div and hide in the html and then you can use settimout and cleartimeout of javascript to show for few seconds here is an example

4233760

the problem is i have a uisearchbar in the header of the uitableview and the sidebar covers the clear x button of the uisearchbar

4233878
innodb	myisam
myisam and innodb are the most commonly used engines

4233878
innodb	myisam
myisam is slightly faster than innodb and implements the fulltext index which is quite useful for integrating search capabilities

the thread that receives the messages from the client like through a socket get the message and put it in the queue

4233927
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
note that an unchecked-exception is one derived from runtimeexception and a checked exception is one derived from exception

4233931
post	get
post variables are never set in a get request so doing the foreach first time on a page is useless

4234022
min	max
defining max in a system header is an indication that the implementor was incompetent and it s possible that certain versions of the environment have incorrect macros for example ones which do not properly protect arguments with parentheses but i ve even seen a max macro that was incorrectly performing min instead of max at least once in my life

4234029
width	height
the value is based on the width of containing block if the containing block has a horizontal text mode otherwise the height

4234297
folder	directory
the -force flag is needed for the cases when the directory have hidden folder like .svn

4234362
client-side	server-side
you either need to add an auto-post-back to your control and a server-side event handler to the control to make it call your c# function on the server or make a client-side javascript function to handle the client-side event

4234394
client-side	server-side
i haven t a server-side so i have to evaluate them in my gwt client-side application

4234402
children	parent
there are also some useful things jdo does via annotations such as the element dependent true annotation which saves you quite a bit of work as it allows you to delete a parent object and jdo will delete all its children

mvvm	delegatecommand
i think i need only wrap my methods with delegatecommand variable and create for these variable properties and this properties bind on ui controls but i am absolute beginner in mvvm

4234446
imperative	declarative
however its performance comes from the fact that it can be early bound during compile time but that is its biggest drawback as well this approach cannot for instance handle dynamically loaded assemblies and it is much more error-prone since it is imperative and not declarative

4234513
int	chars
the substring method is supposed to return a new ministring formed of the chars between the position in the target ministring specified by the int parameter and the end of the target ministring

4234541
free	malloc
if you are using c instead of c++ there is no new or and you have to use the functions malloc and free instead

4234541

4234646
opera	firefox
in opera and firefox the th has a height of 38px instead of 39px it seems that webkit has a bug here which reports the incorrect height on the th while still applying the same rules as the other two browsers

4234651
hide	show
what i did is to have my javascript hide the nojsdiv and show maindiv

4234658
division	multiplication
this assignment is meant to familiarize you with the idea of hooking up events to html objects with using some of the common operators multiplication division assignment etc and to declare functions with parameters return values and to use them all together

4234663
addition	multiplication
as addition to case 3 compiler may care about number of significant bits in and optimize further operations to lower-width ones like replacing 16x16 multiplication with 16x8 one as lower byte is always zero

4234674
folder	directory
this will copy the file s into your project directory and they will also appear in the resources folder in xcode

4234705

it sounds like what you are looking for is an md5 hash

4234783
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i don t know if it works in ie6 but it does work in the latest firefox safari opera google-chrome ie7 and ie8

4234786
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
it will likely answer a number of questions including what salt is how to prevent rainbow attacks why md5 isn t an ideal solution for a password hash it s too fast and no longer requires a significant crypto breakthrough what can happen if data is compromised why plain-text is not stored etc

4234816
min	max
a rotation of -10.0 should output 350.0 and not 0.0 as min max would do

4234823
int	double
i get an error saying unsupported operand types for - str and int i tried the same call with single quotes instead of double and with no quotes at all

4234831
jar	war
you can ensure the order of deployment if you bundle your webservice war and ejb jar into one single ear file

4234853
phong	shading
if you calculate phong shading per pixel you will need to send the camera position to the fragment shader with each vertex because the fragment shader has no clue about the screen being divided and you have 9 different camera positions

4234876
int	double
your function prototype gets templated on and it looks like you re performing this call on an object with type and passing a and an int when it probably expects a and a double to correspond to the initial templated type of the data object

4234878
int	double
the templated type t in this case is double as is shown in the error message and yet you are trying to pass and int as the first and second argument respectively

4234922
hide	show
this keeps your show and hide code out of our js and lets css do its job and style the page

things like uibutton uislider uitextview uilabel uialertview uitableview uiwindow and so on

4234990
int	chars
i do not know exactly what the chars and the int are used for

4234990
int	chars
if one of those refers to something you have passed in and is getting called back to you then you can map them back to your original this or a struct containing this plus some other chars or int

4235035
google-chrome	firefox
also it is very jumpy in the jfiddle using firefox demo but it doesn t do that at all when i test it on my desktop or if i look at that demo in google-chrome

4235049
hide	show
it sounds like what you re after is to load all this content directly and then using jquery to just show and hide stuff

4235049
hide	show
then just use jquery to show the you want visible and hide the others

4235054
division	modulo
modulo is a bit weird for floating point - it returns negative for negative so you still have to have a branch and it involves a division which is slower on some machines as in i ve not found a machine where is significantly less expensive than going round a loop with a couple of subtractions two or three times

4235073
centos	linux
i have the scripts below to download install or update java on linux os such as centos

4235084

4235446
firefox	safari
basically testing a site with firefox and safari they behave differently

4235446
firefox	safari
did some digging and the version that is working firefox has the following additional http headers while safari does not so my guess is it does not check for the newer version

4235459
for-loop	loops
the way to continuously get inputs from the user is by using a while loops not a for-loop in which you change i all the time

4235478
octal	decimal
if you re wondering why it says 169 instead of 251 it s because java prints out the octal base-8 character escape sequence whereas d in the c standard library core foundation and foundation prints out the value as decimal base-10

4235478
octal	decimal
or use calculator.app s programming mode to convert 251 from octal to decimal

4235492
firefox	safari
perhaps firefox and safari are sending slightly different strings

4235503
profiling	debugging
from getting the clojure zip file to debugging and profiling

initially make all droppable disabled then during the drag start routine make droppable and add a revert invalid option to the draggable so that it move back when not put in a valid cell if that is what you want

4238476
move	drag
incidentally you would probably be better having the routine you have in the drag event under start and reverting on stop as the drag event fires continuously as you move

4238764
floating-point	integer
what you probably mean is that the result it is getting is not what you expect and the most likely reason for this is that all your variables are int so it is doing integer arithmetic but you probably want to get floating-point results from your divisions

4238764
int	double
i suggest changing your local variables to float or double so the int will be automatically converted before doing the arithmetic

the best solution i found for something like this if they are all equal children of the parent view is to patch their views onto a uiscrollview with paging enabled you can add a page control at the bottom to make it clear and for navigation then add the views of the controllers to the page view as they come onscreen remove as they go offscreen

put	get
regarding introducing names rather than using lambdas i think what i typically do is if i am tempted to put a short comment describing the intent of the code but a good identifier name may do the same then i may factor a one-time lambda into a named function in order to get the readability benefit of the identifier name

4240873
division	multiplication
for multiplication and division ensure the operands are positive cast to unsigned calculate and adjust the signs

4240901
hash	salt
the point of salt is simply to make rainbow table attacks harder as you no longer have a 1-to-1 mapping between passwords and hash

4240915

4240940
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
similarly but easier in firefox 4+ also in google-chrome 5+ and safari 5+ you can use the formdata interface that helps to construct such requests

to complicate matters the canvas can be scaled using the layouttransform and i d like to include the view-area in the scrollbars so not only the min max bounds of the children are taken into account by the scrollbars but also the min max of the current view-area

4241121
mako	formencode
that means that you re learning many useful libraries that can be used in you other projects for example sqlalchemy webob formencode beaker mako and so on .

4241248
hide	show
and i m trying to show it and hide everything else in the page s constructor and hide it and show everything else in page.loaded handler

4241268

there is something definitely odd in the way viewwillappear gets cancelled when you puts views within views

4241293
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
works in ie 7 8 google-chrome firefox safari and probably in ie 6 and opera although haven t tested on them

4241297
cfstring	nsstring
using some clever magic apple can do this because they write both the cf and objc runtimes instances of types like nsstring nsarray and nsdictionary are by default really instances of cfstring cfarray and cfdictionary

4241311
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome ie8 firefox this works correctly

int	chars
also you ll know what the max length for the score chars array should be based on whatever you re using to store score int

4241513
subscript	superscript
from those for lines with no superscript or subscript just use ctlinedraw and forget about it

4241513
subscript	superscript
for those with superscript or subscript use ctlinegetglyphruns to get an array of ctrun objects describing the various glyphs on the line

4241513
subscript	superscript
if none that you want to superscript or subscript are included just use ctrundraw to draw the thing

4241513
subscript	superscript
use cgcontextshowglyphsatpoint as appropriate having tweaked the text matrix for those you want in superscript or subscript

4241513
subscript	superscript
i haven t yet found a way to query whether a font has the relevant hints for automatic superscript subscript generation which makes things a bit tricky

4241513
subscript	superscript
if you re desperate and don t have a solution to that it s probably easier just not to use coretext s stuff at all â in which case you should probably define your own attribute that s why ns cf attributedstring allow arbitrary attributes to be applied identified by string name and use the normal nsstring searching methods to identify regions that need to be printed in superscript or subscript from blind

4241548
post	get
i ll come back and post a follow-up if when i get that working

4241703
g++	gcc

4241743
mef	prism
on an application that i am currently working on we re using wpf with mvvm prism with mef and wcf data services

4241743
mef	prism
if you stick with prism 4 with mef modular design patterns and entity framework 4 you should be able to come up with a good solution that is modular without being tightly coupled

4241750
width	height
but then i realized that the problem is that because my svg scales due to changes in width of the page i can t set a good height percentage because height may or may not be affected when the window s width changes due to the svg s aspect ratio

4241764
g++	gcc
just using gcc with -lstdc++ won t help because the gcc and g++ frontends can use different linker commands

4241764
g++	gcc
on mine gcc adds --as-needed when calling the linker while g++ doesn t.

4241854

4241975
retaincount	dealloc
removed my original text try adding an nslog of personlistarray retaincount to your dealloc to figure out which is the case.

4242007
ostream	istream	std	ostream

4242020
postgresql	mysql
if you are doing this with open source i would seriously look at postgresql as mysql s future looks uncertain now its owned by the world largest comercial database vendor

4242023
int	double
i therefore need compare to return a double not an int

4242030
inherited	subclassing
if you don t want to inherited all the fields you re not designing a subclassing

4242087
superclass	subclassing
all you can do about that is to make that variable private to the superclass so subclassing do not see it

4242124
int	double
it would especially go up in flames if you started to use double s instead of int s on contemporary implementations. it may however point to one

4242144
firefox	safari
when i try to change the src attribute of embedded movie quicktime it strangely works locally in firefox but doesn t work on server in firefox doesn t work in safari either locally or on server and it doesn t work in ie

4242149
converter	multibinding
so i use a multibinding which passes the value converter the userid and a dictionary look up table which is exposed by the underlying viewmodel

4242163
hide	show
if you are just trying to toggle visibility you could probably just add the normal class for the div styling and toggle it using the jquery hide show methods

4242167
mouseleave	mouseenter
the .hover method binds handlers for both mouseenter and mouseleave events

4242172
getter	setter
you cannot remove these fields but you can override the getter and setter to do something other than the default this depends on their access modifiers but they will probably be protected or greater

4242175

the advanced and production installation instructions in the book describe how to topologically isolate the webroot directory so you can make folder containing php files readable only by you

4242185
pop-up	dialog
so it just pop-up on the phone screen in a dialog

4242192
put	get
get all the products features in category with one sql query and then iterate with php each feature and put it in product

4242216

at least on fatxx and ntfs filesystems case-insensivity is imposed

4242240
mouseup	mousedown
so i want to record the yposition of the mousedown and the mouseup and move a div accordingly

4242240
mouseup	mousedown
i tried recording the mouse positions using two variables one to be recorded on the mousedown event and one to be recorded on a mouseup event.

4242240
mouseup	mousedown
but right now the problem is that the variable value is not carried through so on the mouseup the value of the mousedown is back to 0

4242247
haskell	scheme
it is definitely nice to know a little bit about haskell or scheme because they are more radical in some ways

4242247
haskell	scheme
of course you can write some code in haskell or scheme but as a .net programmer you ll probably find writing f# code more fun.

4242252
jquery	jqtransform
i am using the jqtransform jquery plugin to change the look and feel of my form elements

4242275
mouseup	mousedown
the ystart you use in the mousedown function is different than the ystart you use in the mouseup function

textblock.foreground and textblock.fontsize can be used as attached properties and will inherited from a parent value

4242340
inherited	properties
the settings for these properties will need to be removed from the itemtemplate to avoid overriding the inherited values

4242376
min	max
it has it s own unique validation rules which define the fraction digits min and max etc

4242385
uipagecontrol	subviews
in the case of uipagecontrol it relies on subviews that have been added to uipagecontrol

4242385
uipagecontrol	subviews
but because you know it has to be either drawrect or subview-based you can get away with simply removing the subviews of the uipagecontrol and then your drawrect override will work as you d expect mostly you have to do a little bit of extra work to make sure you redraw at the right times

4242436
uinavigationbar	uinavigationitem
uinavigationbar accepts an array of uinavigationitem objects each of which contain properties about a given level of the navigation hierarchy

4242441
mousemove	mousedown
rather than beginning the drag operation in a mousedown handler you can save some initial state and instead commit to dragging in a mousemove handler where you can check against systemparameters.minimumhorizontaldragdistance and systemparameters.minimumverticaldragdistance to see if there has been enough movement to begin a drag operation

4242452
mp3	wav
if you re just looking to compress some wav files to mp3 format you could check out this sample project

calloc	malloc
c difference between malloc and calloc

4242499
calloc	malloc
is there any situation where you would prefer malloc over calloc

4242499
calloc	malloc
i know both malloc and calloc allocate memory dynamically and that calloc also initializes all bits in alloted memory to zero

4242499
calloc	malloc
from this i would guess its always better to use calloc over malloc

4242511
calloc	malloc
calloc and malloc are functions that do different things use whichever one is most appropriate for the task you need to accomplish

4242562
memset	calloc
in the c++ version it allocated some memory with calloc then used memset to initialize the memory again in what seemed to me a fairly transparent attempt at producing results that favored java

4242574
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
it works and sends fine in firefox google-chrome opera etc.

post	get
you want the post redirect get pattern

4242690
put	get

accessor	properties
implement the array accessor methods plus addtracksobject and removetracksobject which are technically set accessor methods so kvo will ignore them for an array properties for your convenience

4242958
accessor	properties
as i mentioned kvo will ignore addfooobject and removefooobject when foo is an nsarray properties considering those only nsset-property accessor so you need to implement them on top of insertobject infooatindex and removeobjectfromfooatindex because those are array accessor which means kvo will react to them

4242962
tax	shipping
shipping app design frontend tax checkout shipping.phtml

4243129
hash	md5

in other words public protected package-private and private variables are all treated in the same way

4245842

you can do this using pyglet s opengl bindings or using pyopengl s

4246325
pyopengl	pyglet
transitioning your code from pyglet to pyopengl is fairly easy so this is not a decision you need to worry about too much upfront

4246325
pyopengl	pyglet
pyglet s opengl bindings are automatically generated and are not as friendly to use as pyopengl

4246325
pyopengl	pyglet
then when optimising replace just the small percentage of performance-critical pyopengl calls that lie within your inner render loop with the pyglet equivalents

4246384
put	get
if you put everything in one table and then use something like a datatable to hold the results from select from mytable then the entire thing would get replicated into ram removing any benefit

4246897
innodb	myisam
unlike innodb myisam has built-in full-text search

innodb	myisam
myisam is still widely used in web applications as it has traditionally been perceived as faster than innodb in situations where most db access is reads

4246897
innodb	myisam
while writing updating data into a innodb table only that particular row is locked whereas in myisam the entire table is locked

4246900
innodb	myisam
there are some features that are only available using myisam like full text search but unless you need these i would go with innodb

4246902
for-loop	arrays
i think that the nativeptr.write function can be only used to write single value at a time so if you want to copy an arrays you ll have to use a for-loop

4248749
emacs	aquamacs
if you re going to use emacs on the mac i d recommend using emacs.app not aquamacs

4248749
emacs	aquamacs
aquamacs does not follow standard gnu emacs conventions and you ll find it harder to create a portable environment or use other people s extensions

4248759
folder	directory
you can only access the files directory that are located in the isolated storage that is assigned to your application and you can get a list of those via getdirectorynames for folder and getfilenames for files

4248786
listview	gridview
return a bindable list of attribute name value pairs which you can bind to a listview a gridview - whatever you like

4248791

pop-up	dialog
in that pop-up menu i open a file dialog when pushing a button and the when pushing the button closes the pop-up

4248822

it s not html5 canvas based it uses vector svg vml graphics instead but it will work on most browsers even older ie

4248961
disk	ram
pay attention to your hard disk access light it s furiously blinking while windows chucks pages out of ram to make room

4248974
client-side	server-side
my goal is to architect a maintainable system that exposes a large subset of server-side functionality to the client-side javascript without unnecessary code duplication

4248974
client-side	server-side
server-side it makes sense to do a oo-style call but client-side book.settitle 1234 foo makes sense where 1234 is the book s id due to the lack of state

4249053
gcov	lcov
also do note that gcov itself does not do any reporting you need something like lcov to then actually generate the statistics from gcov generated files

4249056

you don t have to worry about any of the low-level stuff serialization queueing routing etc. until you need to tune tcp udp etc. as for small packets vs

4249103
equals	gethashcode
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value

4249103
equals	gethashcode
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values

4249137
equals	gethashcode
you can call gethashcode to determine if the items are not equals but if two objects return the same hash code that doesn t mean they are equals

4249157
post	get
the disadvantage is that even though you re trying to execute a get request due to the batch it travels as post request over the web and thus it won t be cached

4249167
uiview	subviews
the viewcontroller initializes a uiview chain controller view subviews in the viewcontroller

touch1 and touch2 are both cgpoint and point is a cgrect

4249228
freebsd	linux
linux containers and freebsd jails are a better alternative to chroot

4249248
equals	gethashcode
the only time you would call gethashcode inside of equals was if it was much cheaper to compute a hash value for an object say because you cache it than to check for equality

4249248
equals	gethashcode
in fact in my application i decided that having identical hashes was close enough to being equals that i didn t even bother to implement the equals overload causing the c# compiler to warn me that i was overloading gethashcode without overloading equals

4249276
put	get
you can just put a line at the very beginning of main.js.php to get php to send the correct mime type

4249297
width	height
don t set the width height to zero that s ugly

4249349
put	get

4249357
decoder	encoder
it also has asynchronous decoder and encoder

4249360
postgresql	mysql
then pick a database - mysql postgresql or whatever you are comfortable with

in conjunction with the server-side language you will need to learn at least the basics of databases mysql postgresql or what-have-you and ajax

4249388
width	height
the only way i can think of to narrow down the amount of possible product images is by their size or width height the right product image is usually a bigger picture

4249509
ord	chr	int	chars
from the book i was using i had the impression that ord and chr were standard functions for converting between chars and int but it seems evident that i need to import them or something

4249524
width	height
any possible width height attributes or css style rules are not representative of the actual dimensions of the images themselves because they define the constraints in which to display the image which could be of a different size

4249532
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried to using this css rule with many different format tweaks with both inline styles and linked style sheets specifying media and not specifying media with ie8 google-chrome 7.0 and firefox 3.6

4249648
mouseup	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown
it looks like the best way to do this would be to register a mousedown event on the parent div that in turn registers a mousemove event on the div until a mouseup event is triggered

4249648
mouseup	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown
the mousedown and mouseup events will define the start and end of the time range and as i follow mousemove events i can dynamically change the size of the range so that the user can see what they are doing

4249662
submit	submission
you must call submit on its own to trigger the submission event

4249705
temp	tmp
if the script looks at the directory and sees that there is a filename with the string of tmp or temp it should continue with the script but if it does not see any filenames matching a string specified in the shell script it should quit

4249907
width	height
i want the modal window to be positioned in the dead center both vertically and horizontally but i don t know what the width height of the content inside the modal window is going to be so i can t set fixed values

4249920
width	height
specifying a width and height for all images allows for faster rendering by eliminating the need for unnecessary reflows and repaints

4249924
width	height
by specifying height and width it helps so that the browser doesn t have to calculate it

4249927
width	height

4249951
comparator	comparable	superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
the class declaration is straightforward enough make sure that anytype extends a type that is comparable to anytype or any superclass up anytype s inherited hierarchy in case anytype is a subclassing of a type and doesn t need to change its comparator method in order to function

4249980
dlsym	dlopen
the â œupdateâ i made suggests it right the main plug-in bundle is loaded locally rtld_local so nobody can see any symbols there unless using explicit dlopen followed by dlsym

4249997
jobs	cron
all this can be wrapped and called in a similar manner by a cron wrapper which will be the only script called by the cron in the system which will decide what are the current php cron jobs to be executed

hide	show	mouseover	mouseout
i have a workaround that show a div when a menu item gets mouseover but hide both only when the div gets mouseout

4250061

your first iteration will cast the string value to a number using standard php casting as an int value to the first non-numeric chars which is the x giving a start value of 0

4250108
hash	md5
i m not familiar with python but it appears the they are returning the hex value of the md5 hash in the javascript version of the algorithm

4250118
getter	setter

4250123
awt	swing	swt	swing
that would depend on which ui toolkit you are using awt swing swt

4250131
inherited	properties
this should work fine according to the docs on properties value inherited

4250156
getter	setter
now you access your fields through property methods getter and setter methods

width	height
you should be able to get the width and height of an element after the content is loaded try using jquery helpers for that - width height

4250160
width	height
the margin-left and margin-top should be negative one half of the width and height of the box respectively

4250199
post	get
if you change post to get you must change the php variable to

4250201
audiotoolbox	avfoundation
instead of using avfoundation you should probably look into using coreaudio or audiotoolbox

post	get
or you can use _request which works with either post or get

4250243
ubuntu	linux
i m on ubuntu linux

4250248
postgresql	mysql
for the database it depends on your needs if you need a true relational database then something like mysql postgresql sql server oracle etc

4250279
width	height
note you should also add a check to make sure the width and height are valid numbers not -1

4250289
min	max
problem solved it was a combination of source data being slightly misformed and the schema not being restrictive enough needed to define min max occurs for the record types

4250328
hash	salt
john the ripper can be used to break salt sha1 hash

4250331
fgetc	fread
for one thing the fgetc fread etc functions create buffers in the o s anyway

4250448
webrat	cucumber
authlogic flash notice does not show up in cucumber webrat step

4250449
equals	gethashcode
one thing that might be going wrong is that gethashcode is not overridden alongside equals which the framework guidelines dictate should happen

4250452
pull	push
the idea here is you push this runnable onto a queue that the edt pull from

4250456
iequalitycomparer	iequatable
when not given an explicit iequalitycomparer the distinct and other linq methods will eventually default into using the iequatable implementation on the type

4250463
move	drag
its purpose is to notify the user that while the shift key is held down the drag and drop operation they are about to perform is going to copy the node s and not move them

4250500
width	height
you could have a model with a hidden state comprising more or less static parameters such as camera height camera tilt or lane width and dynamic parameters such as camera yaw lateral displacement of the camera within the lane road curvature etc

4250502
postgresql	mysql
you really need to move to an actual server database like mysql or postgresql

postgresql	mysql
don t be if you are using postgresql or mysql innodb databases then you are completely protected from concurrency shennanegans

4250952
children	parent
perhaps this is oversimplified but you could just add the x number of entities as children of a parent entity and this would cause them to be in the same entity group

4250952
children	parent
basically create an owned one-to-many relationship between the parent entity and the children which are the objects you are trying to persist

4250965
put	get
i just wanna get the auto incrementing column id and put it into an array like like

4250970

what i d like to do is in the didselectrowatindexpath method of the pageviewcontroller uitableview delegate push a new uiviewcontroller onto the uinavigationcontroller on top of the pagingviewcontroller

4250995
domxpath	domdocument
domdocument s loadhtml method works well with invalid html fragments so you can use domxpath this way

lisp	scheme	haskell	scheme
the other two biggies are the miranda family of which haskell is the major modern representative and the lisp family where common lisp and scheme are the two big reps

4251087

but it s really not all that different from a traditional singleton with the exception that you lose objective-c 2.0 properties instead you have to use traditional accessor methods

4251093
unix	bsd
on many unix systems linux bsd you can use the resolver functions to obtain the list of dns servers man 3 resolver

4251179
innodb	myisam
mysql has a number of database engines but youâ re most likely to encounter myisam and innodb

4251211
versioning	upgrade
it s also worth just trying to just upgrade everything to the latest versioning php pdo etc

4251219
lan	intranet
for the private intranet on your company s lan it tends to favor webforms where upstream bandwidth from browser to web server is free plentiful and fast

4251222
google-chrome	firefox
as a side note tosource is not supported by ie or google-chrome and you should avoid it s use as you can turn a json object into a string by passing it to json.stringify which is native in ie8+ firefox and google-chrome

4251227
google-chrome	safari
again the issue only occurs in google-chrome and safari

4251246

4251346
post	get
an http request can be any of the http verbs but the primary two people use are get and post

4251346
post	put
when you send information to the server you can do so either through the use of the url to request a page or within the body of the request post put delete for instance

4251346
post	get
i say this because the difference between a get request and a post request is if data is included in the body and the verb used but the client usually knows how to deal with that

4251346
post	get
so we don t always have to post back to the server to get data

4251347
google-chrome	firefox
i tested it in ie8 firefox and google-chrome

4251377
folder	directory
otherwise i recommend installing codeigniter in a folder under the root directory and modifying its config file to point to it

4251399
int	chars
in this case int is wide enough to hold all the values of your unsigned chars so your values are promoted to int

4251434
bytearrayinputstream	bufferedimage
you need to save the bufferedimage to a bytearrayoutputstream using the imageio class then create a bytearrayinputstream from tobytearray

4251488

4251575
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
sortedset t sortedlist t and sorteddictionary t all seem to be missing

4251581
hide	show
if you need to hide the window when the program runs your best bet is to create a class that derives from applicationcontext and show the notifyicon

4251651
slideup	slidedown
you can also use the jquery slidedown or slideup which is essentially the same as show

4251680
typo3	templavoila
templavoila works by giving you an interface to map typo3 content or instructions to generate content to blocks of markup in your html file

4251680
typo3	templavoila
there s a piece of typo3 documentation called futuristic template building that explains pretty clearly how to go from a static html page to a typo3-ized site with templavoila

4251680
typo3	templavoila
don t be scared by the word futuristic into thinking that templavoila isn t fully baked yet -- that doc was written six years ago when templavoila was pretty futuristic but today it s quite mature and in use on typo3 sites all over the world.

4251680
post	get
this should be enough to get you started but if you hit roadblocks or can t wrap your head around it feel free to post your questions back to this thread and i ll help you out

4252012
ubuntu	linux
i m using ubuntu and i was looking for an assembler compiler for linux and i foung gas

4252046
getc	gets
if so and i think in most cases it can be implemented then you can just have a separate thread that reads them at highest possible speed and stores them in a buffer with stalling when the buffer gets full so that you normal process can use a synchronous getc on that buffer

4252069
google-chrome	firefox
in ie7 ie8 firefox and google-chrome it appears correctly

4252237
sproutcore	cappuccino
i don t know much about sproutcore but cappuccino has column sorting resizing and moving

4252244
versioning	upgrade
the application works just fine with the old driver however we d like to upgrade to the newer versioning since another app on the same server needs this newer jdbc and it s difficult to have different versioning of the same jdbc deployed on our server we uses jboss

4252250
processors	hyperthreading	cpu	processors	cpu	hyperthreading
they ve been relatively fixed at 32k for around a decade or more they may be shared between virtual cores in a hyperthreading cpu and some older cheaper processors might have 16k so the most you should do is around 8192 for in-place operation on floats

4252289

int	double
your requirements on int accuracy from using a double representation means that c 60 30 is all but too big being around 1e17 so that assuming you want to have c m n for all m up to some limit and all n m your table would only have around 1800 entries

4257433

4258535
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works in ie safari google-chrome and firefox

4258541
onmouseover	onclick
if you want to use this kind of behaviour i ll suggest creating 3 divs over the image each with separate onmouseover handler and leave tag around the element to get onclick behaviour

4258541
onmouseover	onclick
as second alternative you can extend divs not only with onmouseover event handler but also with onclick event handler and process clicking within single function

4258557
implements	extends
as currently implements my page extends based on the text but if the text is too long the page looks ugly

folder	directory
i want to automatically trawl the directory that the user has uploaded images to and selected and then automatically create image instances for each image in the folder

4258639

one trick you can do especially with udp multicast or broadcast is have several programs listen on the same port via so_reuseport so that when anyone sends out a udp packets to that port all of the programs receive it

4258641
mouseout	mouseleave
the mouseleave event differs from mouseout in the way it handles event bubbling

4258765
post	get
but in the production environment which has the images on s3 we cannot get any of the images to copy over from the original post images

4258775
ant	maven
given your commitment to the ant build process and there s nothing wrong with that except for the goodies you re missing out on i d suggest that you mirror the maven approach but do it within ant

4258775
maven	pom.xml
essentially you perform a full build including functional tests if you ve got em to verify your artifact then maven tags your subversion repo and finally it runs over your project pom.xml files and re-versions them to the next level up as snapshots

4258775
maven	pom.xml
in terms of a build process hudson works merrily with maven and will build and test the artifacts your jars wars ears etc in the sequence you specify in the maven pom.xml

4258795
put	get
one of our clients wants to put the app we developed for them up under their own company name but they ve only just sent off for enrollment and as such they want to put the app up under our name until they get their enrollment though

4258910

well you could override the onkeydown int keycode keyevent event 1 and or onkeyup int keycode keyevent event 2

4258938

i have a c# program that we constantly update and it gets reinstalled and it seems that since i ve upgrade the project from vs2005 to vs2010 and .net from 2.0 to 4.0 i m getting this strange error where its trying to reference the old versioning of the dll from the last install

4258951
width	height
there are a number of possible methods but here s one start by rendering the full string in a div that has width that you are looking for then measure the div s height

4258993
hex	binary
at this point i m guessing i would have to convert the mac or ip address to either hex or binary and to a comparison that way

4259025
folder	directory
the csc.exe executable is usually located in the folder under the system directory

4259028
google-chrome	firefox
when i run on the production url it works fine in google-chrome and firefox but in ie the selection of the listbox is not sticking resulting in the above validation error message

4259048

well i renamed the new mysql s data directory to data.backup and then i created a symlink from where the new mysql s data folder was to var mysql where the old data file is and so far so good.

4259109

4259158
google-chrome	firefox
internet explorer google-chrome and firefox all have good debuggers javascript consoles available to show this information

4259207
hide	show
i assume you have to show and hide the text field dynamically based on changing conditions in the form otherwise you d just make it an to begin with

4259207
hide	show
keep your code that show and hide the field as it is but also catch the onsubmit event

4259216
google-chrome	firefox
it has to work in firefox 3 and google-chrome

4259238
google-chrome	firefox
should work fine in firefox and google-chrome

4259290
disk	ram
blockquote ram disk is not an option for security reasons - we don t want that anyone with access to the machine would be able to view the data blockquote

4259296
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
however apple only supports this on quicktime x on osx and even then only in safari or standalone not in the quicktime plugin used by google-chrome or firefox

4259359
width	height
set the height and width using dp instead of px

4259384
superclass	subclassing	accessor	superclass
no because it isn t only subclassing behavior you need to take into account â superclass implementations and even the behavior of code generated by the framework synthesized accessor and the black magic used to implement kvo can also cause trouble

4259404
post	get
i found a lot of post and tried to implement the delegate methods regarding authentication but they won t get called and after 6 hours in google i don t get what i ve done wrong

4259434
width	height
note that the application has 100 for both width and height

4259450
qtcore	qtgui
also usually qtgui is within the qt include directory where you ve got others like qtcore and such

4259462
move	drag
that is click the widget to move release the mouse button drag the widget and click to drop

4259513
strdup	malloc	strdup	strncpy	strncpy	malloc	strcpy	malloc	strcpy	strncpy	strcpy	strdup
instead of strncpy use strdup which is like doing a malloc then a strcpy

4259518
google-chrome	firefox
i m using firefox with firebug or google-chrome

4259535
rss	feed
i want to send a notification out every time the rss feed is updated with a new post

4259547
put	get
but i can t get my head round where i put this in the iqueryable or iqueryprovider

4259549
strdup	malloc	strcpy	malloc	strcpy	strdup
what s happening is that this code allocates and copies in one go using strdup rather than malloc followed by strcpy

4259582
min	max
there are also 2 nested if statements to prevent it from ever going over the max number or pictures or under the min number of pictures

4259626
setcontentview	findviewbyid
you re mixing two different contexts in your calls to setcontentview and findviewbyid

4259639
webclient	httpwebrequest
i originally tried using the webclient class but i switched to the httpwebrequest to try some of the suggestions i found while researching the issue such as setting keepalive to false preauthenticate true

4259685
ftpwebresponse	ftpwebrequest
edit since you re using the ftpwebrequest response library you ll want to have your ftpwebrequest object dump its results into the ftpwebresponse object and then read the entire stream with code something like this

4259691
post	get
to get the cookies to work i had to modify some code post snippet from httpconnection.java

4259709
width	height
setdimensions height width maxheight maxwidth topbottom leftright padding preserveaspect

4259735
multiplying	add
you can add to or multiplying the amount

4259768

when talking about active directory i ve got this answer which describes active directory as an implementation of ldap + kerberos + a few other miscellaneous bits and pieces

4259768
kerberos	ntlm	kerberos	ldap
ldap kerberos ntlm sspi etc

4259803
google-chrome	safari
i was using google-chrome and it won t work outside safari apparently

4259835

with firefox 3.6 and google-chrome latest the layout behaves as supposed

4259849
google-chrome	firefox
i tested in firefox 3.6 and google-chrome 8 both on linux

4259857
google-chrome	firefox
hi i m trying to create a toolbar using ul and li elements everything works good on ie8 but when i render the page in google-chrome o firefox the elementos does not show in horizontal way

4259875
keydown	keyup
note that the keyup callback function fires after the input has been inserted into the input field while the keydown and keypress fires before the change is made

4259919
width	height
set the maximum width height of an image that can reside in the pixel cache memory

4259929
int	double
if i can pass an int into fnc taking double as an arg why cannot i do it with template

4259940
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i believe the problem here is that you re adding the uitabbarcontroller as a subview of another uiviewcontroller

4259940
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
uitabbarcontroller descends directly from uiviewcontroller

4259945
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox and ie8 on google-chrome and safari the labels are working as they

4259945
google-chrome	safari
as i said before it works great on google-chrome and safari but

4259964
google-chrome	firefox
here s an updated link which i tested in ie7 google-chrome 7 and firefox 3.6.1.2

4259964
google-chrome	firefox
another caveat with this approach google-chrome firefox will return rgb 255 0 0

4259967
int	double
what you re getting is whatever data happened to be on the stack in the place the compiler decided that variable should go interpreted as an int or a double

4259997
google-chrome	firefox
original actually works as expected on firefox and google-chrome for me

4260063
getter	setter
or using the magic spring approach - have the param1 property defined with getter setter

4260068
ant	maven
doing the build in a jvm language like ant or maven avoids all this

4260087
django-registration	django-mailer
this fork of django-registration integrates with django-mailer which uses background processes to send mail instead processing it during the http request

4260113
jsf	jspx
jspx and jsff refer to jsp fragment and jsf fragment respectively

4260154
jobs	cron
this often causes cron jobs to fail the first few times you run them see my law on cron jobs -

4260154
jobs	cron
simple debugging writing messages to some file in tmp is also often a way to get your cron jobs running

4260154
jobs	cron
in many cases it makes sense to run cron jobs as a special user

4260154
jobs	cron
don t run your cron jobs as root unless they absolutely must have root access it s better to run things as special users that only has limited permissions in the file system

4260194
screens	hdpi
what is the proper way of sizing the dimensions of an image in a hdpi screens vs a ldpi screens

4260263
g++	gcc
g++ gcc 4.4.3 20100127 red hat 4.4.3-4

4260267
jobs	cron
let s say i have 10 scripts that i want to run regularly as cron jobs

4260270
internationalization	localization
you might want to investigate using cakephp s internationalization localization features to abstract away the distinction between english and russian terms for top left right bottom and everything else

4260292
background-image	background-position
if not you can try to set the image as background-image and make use of the css-attribute background-position left center

4260303
min	max
the idea is to do a depth-first traversal and pass min and max values bottom-up instead of top-down

4260303
min	max
the tricky part of the implementation is taking care of how min and max values are passed bottom-up

4260303
min	max
please note that i did not initialize min and max values as they are initialized in the bottom of the tree

4260319
submit	submission
i m able to use this jquery code to prevent double submission of the submit button

4260377
uinavigationbar	uinavigationitem
you need to set up a custom stack of uinavigationitem objects and push them on to the uinavigationbar

4260395
google-chrome	firefox
the problem was seen in firefox 3.6.12 but the same code running on google-chrome was fine

4260427
screens	hdpi
for example if the current screens s density is high the platform loads resources that are tagged with the qualifier hdpi and uses them without scaling

4260432
nhibernate	automapper
i m using fluent nhibernate s automapper and automatically generating the database schema using schemaexport

4260458
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
jquery ajax .load not working in ie6 ie7 ie8 - working in firefox safari google-chrome

4260473
portrait	landscape
i have an app i would have two xibs one for portrait and one for landscape

4260483
boost	stl
if you want to store heap allocated objects in stl containers and have them be destructed upon removal wrap them in a smart pointer like boost shared_ptr

4260489
width	height
other downsides you d have to be careful to declare image height and width a good practice anyway but it may get cumbersome when you just want to get things done

4260531
jpanel	jdesktoppane
a jdesktoppane should sit inside a jframe s contentpane instead of a jpanel

4260543
range	max
the second key fails for too many elements in the in range apparently the max is 24

4260554
portrait	landscape
chapter 5 provides great information on supporting landscape and portrait mode

4260568
width	height
if the container for the listbox is a grid with fixed width and height then it will give the listbox a fixed size

4260583
goto	break
some see break and continue as a goto in disguise

4260586
submit	submission
when you submit the form the servlet would handle the form submission and call code in your business project jar

4260612
google-chrome	firefox
this issue is for both firefox 3.6.12 and google-chrome

4260613
rss	feed
my idea was to download the data somehow maybe rss feed and then format it to .ical and then use some sort of api on googles side to import it

4260635
post	get
like the down voted answer below you might not actually be sending post variables because you re passing the params in with a get format

4260704
width	height
you will also have to use match_parent for both width and height of your layout

4260726
junit	testng
i m familiar with junit and heard testng might be a solution to some of junit s annoyences - its insistence to create a separate instance of the test class per test thus forcing me to use static field for objects i want to reuse between tests

4260762
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
it has two sub-viewcontrollers one for the left panel and one for the detail right panel to which i need to send the appropriate messages viewwillappear viewdidappear viewwilldisapppear and viewdiddisappear

4260762
viewdidload	viewwillappear
my initial approach was to call them in the setter of the sub-viewcontrollers calling viewwilldisappear to uiviewcontroller about to be released and viewwillappear to the new uiviewcontroller set but this one is executed before viewdidload and therefore i presume is wrong

4260786
google-chrome	firefox
and screenpic of firefox ie google-chrome appearance

4260788
hide	show
instead you would put both of the visuals in the same template and show hide them based on the state

4260812
put	get
i m not sure where to put it or how to get it there

4260831
scheme	racket
if you install a scheme implementation i am using mit scheme edited to add that this also works with racket using mzscheme it may come with a symlink named scheme - this is what emacs looks for i think

4260843
portrait	landscape
i ran into a similar problem when i wanted to show an image fullscreen in landscape mode and it s default position in portrait mode

4260857
folder	directory
i think the good way would be to make the folder 2 either a level up or an external because if it s not used for the build it has nothing to do in the code directory

4260908
google-chrome	safari
if you would use css3 animations you are losing a lot of audience since only google-chrome and safari currently support css3 animations

4260913
junit	testng
some tools support junit but not testng

4260930
innodb	myisam
it could be related to having innodb and myisam tables together

4260930
innodb	myisam
if you copy the database files the myisam will be fine and the innodb will show up but fail to work

4260947
punctuation	words
the simplest answer is to remove characters that don t matter the apostrophes and punctuation in your example normalize other characters to words separators the slash in your example and downcase the lot

4260950
superclass	subclassing
however you cannot cast an instance of a superclass to a subclassing

4260952
folder	directory
i have several folder which contain simple text files and are at various depths within the directory

4260953
jobs	cron
they re like cron jobs except mysql handles the scheduling itself

4261003
typedef	struct
use typedef on your struct to shorten simplify your declarations

4261007
inherited	properties
this is definitely doable just make sure that the object owns the properties and it s not inherited from higher up in the prototype chain

4261013
onresume	onpause
i d like to add for the sake of completeness is that you should set things up so you register for changes in your preferenceactivity s onresume method and unregister in the onpause method

4261035
inherited	properties
now you have access to that properties in any controller that inherited from your base controller

4261069
inherited	properties
however the main change is that i was trying to have my repository inherited from nhibernatecontext as well as access the linq properties off a isession object

4261096
inherited	properties
this statement will go up in the prototype chain also enumerating over inherited properties a thing that sometimes is not desired

4261096
inherited	properties
also speaking about inherited properties if you for example extend the array.prototype object like some libraries as mootools do that properties will be also enumerated

4261096
inherited	properties
when you want to enumerate only the own properties of an object the ones that aren t inherited you can use the hasownproperty method

4261162
hide	show
if i hide the modaldialogform snapshotdialogview in the code before calling the fontdialog.showdialog the font dialog show ok

4261277
ubuntu	linux
i rather doubt there s something similar available for ubuntu linux

4261282
ant	maven
if you have a decent build tool ant maven that can automate this renaming for you both at the jar and tag level the better

4261293
junit	testng
the spring testcontext framework located in the org.springframework.test.context package provides generic annotation-driven unit and integration testing support that is agnostic of the testing framework in use whether junit 3.8.2 junit 4.5+ testng 5.10 and so on

4261302
getter	setter
it think tween requires public variables or getter setter in order to change them

4261352
floating-point	fixed-point	floating-point	fractions	fixed-point	fractions
maybe this sounds complicated but if the probabilities are stored as fixed-point fractions you won t have to deal with floating-point so it may be not much code

4261431
listview	gridview
if you use a listview with listview.view set to a gridview then you get a pretty similar look as windows 7 explorer

4261431
listview	gridview
listview with gridview to the right

4261431
listview	gridview
listview with gridview to the right

4261465
integer	fractions
see i want to write a function that takes a float number parameter and rounds the float to the nearest currency value a float with two decimal places but if the float parameter has a zero fractions that is all zeroes behind the decimal place then it returns the float as an integer or truncates the decimal part since they re all zeroes anyways.

4261470
viewdidload	viewwillappear
as for your current problem of the ordering of viewwilldisappear viewwillappear and viewdidload just do

4261503
ienumerable	iqueryable
this causes the subsequent filtering operations to use the where extension method on ienumerable not iqueryable

4261507
width	height
width height alt filename.jpg

4261513
ienumerable	iqueryable
use iqueryable instead of ienumerable

4261527
width	height
but as far as i can see the only result of modifying the width or height of either picker in a negative direction results in a cropped view rather than a scaled stretched view of the widget

4261528
hide	show
i don t really want to create multiple panels and show hide and populate form fields based on the state...i would rather set a single property on the page...lets just call it

4261532
google-chrome	firefox
i am having a coding issue with google-chrome and firefox

4261532
google-chrome	firefox
the page i m building has a menu that is placed with an anchor and it shows fine in ie but not google-chrome or firefox

4261542
int	double
if you are inputing strings in the textbox and parsing it as int or a double you ll get such error

4261553
mouse	keyboard
but i want something that does not include the separator at the end because i will end with notebook computer keyboard mouse that 2 last characters should not be there

4261596
min	max
run through some tests have a totally random player as a foil look at short-term gain loss max min operators try mutating the agent s strategies using a genetic algorithm download an xcs classifier and see if it is useful to derive strategies.

4261641
int	double
i am not sure if you can pass float double as a template param its supposed to be a int only

4261695
opera	firefox
my navigation bar is off in firefox and opera

4261695
google-chrome	safari
it looks fine in safari and google-chrome

4261770
yacc	bison
you should look into using lex and yacc also known as flex and bison respectively

4261784
google-chrome	firefox
in ie firefox it works fine but in google-chrome the popup appears over on top of the parent window

4261818
google-chrome	safari
ie only dose it on first page view google-chrome and safari doesn t do it at all

4261819
folder	directory
if i run the tests from any other folder it fails because it is searching the include_path directory and home myname php is not one of those paths

4261827
pop-up	dialog
it successfuly makes the browser to pop-up a download dialog also giving the option to open it with the associated application if it s installed

4261829
int	double
or you can find some common interface or supertype that these element must have in for example - and you can store various objects that have common number superclass bigdecimal biginteger byte double float int long short

4261829
super	extends
extends is generally used when you re going to consume read from the object in your method super is used when you re going to produce write

4261838
width	height
the images are a collection of screenshots some are full screen some about 2 3rds width and height and others are small search boxes

4261866
versioning	upgrade
as for the delta pack i manually downloaded it from website and added the directory in the target definition file which in my opinion is tedious when i want to upgrade the delta pack versioning next time

4261905
nsurlrequest	nsmutableurlrequest
additionally you can set the user agent used by uiwebview by swizzling - nsmutableurlrequest setvalue forhttpheaderfield or probably overriding - nsurlrequest valueforhttpheaderfield

4261943
quicksort	mergesort
if you need to write your own implementation for homework say then you should use one of the standard sorting algorithms like mergesort or quicksort

4261944
jsf	jspx
jspx is used for regular jsf pages

4261959
querypath	phpquery
or better yet use querypath or phpquery which are easier on the eyes

4261963
free	malloc
the closest thing i can think of is malloc hooks unfortunately free does not take the cell size as a parameter

4261985
qstring	qbytearray
fromascii fromutf8 fromlocal8bit qstring qbytearray the works

4262002
min	max
you could easily evaluate min max mean std deviation w o needing to store any significant amount of memory

4262007
japplet	jdialog
like jframe and jdialog japplet is a top-level container

4262045
hide	show
can anyone think of another way to implement that would allow me to dynamically show hide columns with razor

4262063
comparator	comparable
the comparator method of the comparable interface typically offers the default comparison if you want to provide another you should write a comparator object

4262064
equals	gethashcode
yes if you override equals and gethashcode methods your custom key comparison will start working

4262064
equals	gethashcode
overriding equals and gethashcode

4262094
comparator	comparable
instead of implementing comparable in song pass a custom comparator to your collection of choice

4262158
integer	unsigned
sometimes i have to convert from an unsigned integer value to a float

4262215
hide	show
you could run the algorithm each time with all nodes past present future show and just hide the ones that are not extant at the particular instant

4262297
hide	show
hello i have site where i show hide divisions that are loaded by default at start

4262322
getter	setter
a getter on thing1.a which touches the prototype chain followed by a setter of .a

4262339
button	checkbox
today i tried to write a program which checks some checkbox for me on a webpage and then clicks on a button

4262341
nginx	lighttpd
i am replacing lighttpd with nginx on my development server

4262362
button	checkbox
one approach would be to write a bookmarklet where you create a bookmark that runs javascript code and the other would be to avoid the web browser altogether and instead just send a request directly to the web server that looks like it would if you had checked the checkbox and clicked the button

4262408
getter	setter
method never used inspection is good in plain java programming but is annoying for getter setter methods required by application containers jsf jpa etc

4262416
floating-point	integer
in your specific example you can see that c# unlike vb overloads the operator to mean either integer or floating-point division

4262416
floating-point	integer
this means that the compiler works out whether to do integer or floating-point arithmetic based on the type of the numbers used

4262434
getter	setter
so the setter function is ok but the getter function return arr

4262449
jobs	cron
update the stored data regularly with the help of cron jobs and task queue

4262474
peer	p2p
in structured p2p networks dht you have to take the filename and creates a key by passing it through an hash checksum function - now you got the key the next step is finding the peer that stores this key the network is organized the routing process is based on the key

4262537
free	malloc
to catch malloc free you have to do linux-specific things as in other answers but the same trick could solve your problem that you don t have the size in the free hook assuming that you don t want to hunt around for the size that was stored by the real malloc

4262544
hide	show
so i m designing a website using wordpress and i want to use jquery to hide show a certain element when another element is moused over

4262604
typedef	struct
there are some good reasons to use a typedef things like tuint64 which might have historically been a struct due to lack of compiler support

4262604
typedef	struct
if you do use a typedef there s no reason to give the struct a different name since they re in different namespaces iirc struct are a tag namespace

4262624
width	height
i have some irrlicht code that generates a rectangular mesh given a width and height

4262631
next	except
calculating the next place would be the same except add 27 instead

4262653
mouse	keyboard
the browser dom and events are notoriously bad at consistent and predictable performance - particularly when handling keyboard or mouse events

4262679
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested on ie firefox and google-chrome with no result.

4262692
min	max
unless there s something else on your database server you can set sql server s min and max memory to the same value

4262728
profiling	instrumentation
profiling cprof cover eprof fprof instrumentation + a couple of distributed systems for doing the same

4262794
innodb	myisam
to do this you need to use mysql not sqlite with the innodb engine not myisam and the field in question needs an index on it

4262803
submit	submission
getting ready to submit my app to the apple s itunes store and got puzzled by a question during the submission process export laws require that products containing encryption be properly authorized for export....

4262805
gdal	ogr
gdal ogr s bindings do tend to segfault occasionally when objects go out of scope and are garbage collected

4262805
gdal	ogr
i can t reproduce this segfault with another shapefile on windows xp and the following version of gdal ogr

4262825
hide	show
if you take a look at the ipad dropbox app it has a nifty show hide arrow that is exactly what i am after

4262847
hash-collision	key
by placing hash-collision into buckets and keeping separate arrays in the bucket for key and values you can both reduce the size of the table proper and take advantage of cpu cache speedup when searching a bucket

4262871
uiview	subviews
i m adding a subviews to the uiview of my mainviewcontroller that is presented in a similar way as a uimodalviewcontroller with the formsheet-style

4262934
submit	submission
additionally its generally considered better practice to have the event bind to the tag s id using submit rather than click since submit will catch non-clicked submission ie using the keyboard enter button etc

4262956
serializable	deserialization
you need to solve this problem in two parts serializable deserialization and the atomic writing

4262967
inherited	properties
i was facing scenario where i created a custom control that inherited from selector which is meant to have two itemssource properties horizontalitemssource and verticalitemssource

4262972
ubuntu	linux
should you need to have a secure connection and some administration i would highly recommend going the linux route by installing a small vm via virtualbox and an ubuntu server install

4262973
peer	p2p
true p2p isn t really possible since the flashplayer can t accept incoming connections from peer only mediated connections from a common host service

4262997
width	height
i have successfully got them all lazy loading nicely and appearing when downloaded in the custom uitableviewcell i created which has a uiimageview cellimageview width 320 height 100 inside it

4263022
cpu	processors
if the application is cpu intensive however you d benefit much more from getting a better processors

4263044
nginx	lighttpd
you can arrange iis and tomcat in 2 different ip addresses or you can setup reverse-proxy nginx lighttpd mod_proxy etc. to port 80 and then set iis to use port 8080 and for tomcat port 9090

4263070
post	get
when i try to insert to the file though i get the error at the end of this post

4263071
submit	submission
now when i don t select any radio button the submit button still causes the submission event to reach the breakpoint in the onsubmit method

4263088
openlayers	proj4js
actually openlayers uses proj4js to transform between different coordinate systems

4263101
hid	keyboard
my first fear is that there is the hid protocol to be spoken to the keyboard and it will not divulge its secrets until i utter the proper incantation

4263109
trie	tree
write or use an open source implementation of something like b-tree trie suffix tree prefix tree

4263124
google-chrome	firefox
ex firefox use multi-threading for their tabs while google-chrome use multi-processes .

4263128
cpu	processors
profiling indicates that almost all of this cpu time is spent calling the various initializecomponent methods of all the different usercontrols - no one control appears to be vastly worse than any other they all seem to take between 0.2 and 0.5 seconds on my dev machine with a fast processors and good graphics card

4263173
stdout	stderr
in stevens unix network programming he mentions redirecting stdin stdout and stderr which is needed when setting up a daemon

4263174
folder	directory
as long as that attic folder is there cvs has memory of the directory

4263174
folder	directory
the only other thing i can think of is to restore that directory from cvs just delete the contents which puts them back in the attic and commit what you actually want in the folder in the head

4263179
viewdidload	viewdidappear
i solved this problem by adding a slight delay to the uialert the below is within my viewdidload method it also works fine within viewdidappear

4263199
stdout	stderr
and you should be careful about the terms used stdin stdout and stderr are actually file handles rather than file descriptors although there is a correlation between those and the file descriptors

4263212
width	height
seems like the core video s cvpixelbuffercreatewithbytes allows width and height to be 320 and 480

4263217
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox safari google-chrome ie cross-browser issues

4263217
google-chrome	safari
since safari is built on top of webkit just like google-chrome i expected it to work just as well

4263254
width	margin
i had a tab navigation with fixed widths on each tab and a right margin all totaling the width of the container div

4263294
google-chrome	firefox
it works well under ie 8 and firefox 3.6 but fails under google-chrome 7

4263357
google-chrome	firefox
here s the final code that appears to work as expected in ie 8 firefox 3 and google-chrome

4263418
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the following code works on windows ie7 ie8 google-chrome firefox 3.6 and on mac firefox safari

4263427
google-chrome	firefox
with no doctype specified the heights are perfect in google-chrome and surprisingly even ie6 but not in firefox

4263460
eazfuscator	dotfuscator
how close would this be to what a c# obfuscator like dotfuscator or eazfuscator would do to my app and what else could i manually do on a reasonable amount of time to make my code as obfuscated as possible

4263477
memcpy	memmove
either create your object s at that location or memcpy memmove them to that location

4263481
ienumerable	iqueryable
list supports adding an ienumerable collection and an iqueryable collection is also an ienumerable collection so you should be able to use addrange here

4263523
executable	upx
everything worked fine i tried to compile them with vs 6.00 and vs 2010 both them gave me a big size exe 75 kb and 65 kb i am sure that the pre compiled executable are not used other tools to compress except upx for one of them according to the help inside the zip why these size are different for me

4263528
button	checkbox
checkbox are meant for multiple selections whereas radio button are meant for single selections

4263589
hide	show
for example when i click a button call red it will hide red channel and show only blue and green

4263591
google-chrome	firefox
if you use a recent doctype such as html 4.01 or xhtml 1.0 or 1.1 then consistently in firefox google-chrome and ie 8 the button is actually 2 pixels shorter than the text box

4263591
google-chrome	firefox
you probably would want to use a standard compliant doctype because without them the box models between firefox google-chrome and ie can be quite different

4263659
multiplying	add
to multiplying two large integers in this form simply add the exponents element-by-element

4263660
children	parent
i d like to have a gtktreeview that has parent with no checkbox and all of the children have checkboxes

4263738
tabcontrol	tabitem
i am using tabcontrol in some specific condition tabitem s header contains symbol

4263739
altera	xilinx
but most of fpga manufacturers xilinx altera etc ship tools to program their chips

4263752
post	get
please post it as a comment or you might get downvoted

4263787
verilog	vhdl
this one is in vhdl instead of verilog but might still provide at least some inspiration

4263844
post	get
then how can i get the model class name through the variable post maybe some method called model_class_name

4263927
subclass	abstract-class
if i try to subclass the abstract-class its asking to implement the argument constructor and not allowing a no-arg constructor to be written

4263980
put	get
so i put my code in this forum and hope to get an answer for it

4263985
client-side	server-side
but if you know it happens at an exact time i would pass a variable from a server-side scripting language that contains the server time to javascript as you can t rely on the the client-side clock

4264017
eventlet	gevent
gevent and eventlet use the greenlet library for coroutines greenthreads greenlets

4264042
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve been making a plugin for browsers safari google-chrome firefox in macosx

4264042
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome i can get what i want but in safari got a error code -25204

4264065
post	get
i can t seem to get it so that when a date changes in the div that 2 events will be called to post in a different div

4264068
vb.net	vb6
i have a vb6 application which i need to convert to vb.net 3.5

4264082
uitableview	nsindexpath
uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

4264109
submit	submission
then on the submit event just cancel the form submission and run your ajax code

4264112
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
functions like max min sum and count are aggregate-functions meaning that they take a scalar argument but execute once for each row accumulating results every iteration

4264154
int	double
c99 â 6.5.2.2 6 if the expression that denotes the called function has a type that does not include a prototype the int promotions are performed on each argument and arguments that have type float are promoted to double

4264237
subclass	abstract-class
one way to test abstract-class is to implement a concreate subclass of it only for testing

4264268
cvs	svn
i used svn cvs for a long time just as a place where my code stored is

4264314
free	malloc
since you mentioned c++ i ll go with and operators but it s the same with malloc free

4264369
nullreferenceexception	argumentexception
if you throw an argumentexception within the catch of nullreferenceexception it will not be caught by the argumentexception block here at all

4264392
nullreferenceexception	argumentexception
argumentexception and nullreferenceexception both inherit from systemexception so how about using

4264414
move	drag
then trigger their corresponding drag drop events when the bars are move around

4264429
128bit	64bit
on intel 64bit chips that will mean it is aligned to a 128bit double

4264429
int	chars
the way you did it was to offset the chars ptr so by 1 byte rather than the int ptr by 4 bytes

4264474
equals	gethashcode	equals	icomparable	icomparable	gethashcode
to compare 2 instances you can implement system icomparable of t interface but i think in your case since you going to map instances probably in hashtable or dictionaly containers you need overrride gethashcode and equals methods

4264496
mouse	keyboard
pressed means either by mouse button pointer still within button regions or by space button on keyboard

4264497
width	height
steinberg s algorithm denoted as m in the paper estimates an upper bound of the height h required to pack all the items such that it is proved that the input items can be packed into a rectangle of width w and height h

4264549
portrait	landscape
for example i ve got one landscape view that i push a portrait view on top of

4264549
portrait	landscape
but when i pop the view the view underneath it which was in landscape is now in portrait which it shouldn t be

4264551
bash	zsh
for zsh you d probably want to set null_glob option -g switch so it doesn t report errors if there are no hidden dirs in bash it works by default

4264572
post	put
you can read the http request body via fgets stdin if your requests will accept xml as a post put format

4264575
for-loop	arrays
what i would like to be able to do is pass 5 and 6 via an arrays let s say and have a for-loop that runs through the arrays

4264659
post	get
now don t quote me on this but i m pretty sure u cant because when you download the program threw a website its not registered with the market and that s where the update come from and again i m not to sure but i m pretty sure you ll have to contact android market and email them and see if u can get it on the market or post the program with the update every time you want it to update the program

4264676
post	get
and you will be able to get the result inside the success event of the ajax post as json_data.result

4264679
stdout	fflush
to fflush the buffer call fflush stdout

4264707
for-loop	arrays
you may put some additional checks in the for-loop to be sure that your index is in bounds of your arrays but it is not necessary if you form set correctly

4264865
width	height
in order to overcome this problem set the width height to 0 in its css property

4264868
implements	extends
the trick is to implements a contentprovider which extends searchrecentsuggestionsprovider

4264900
sudo	passwd
note that sudo will ask for a passwd unless you configure it otherwise

4264913
firefox	safari
works as expected note i tried only on safari and firefox or remove overflow hidden from container if you defined for clearing purpose just change clearing method

4264937
try-catch	exception-handling
if it must-run do it before the try-catch block away from something that could throw an exception-handling as your intention is almost certainly functionally the same

4264969
stdout	stderr
unless the stream you re using is stderr or sometimes stdout it will be block buffered by default which means that no writes will happen until the buffer is full typically 4096 bytes or more

4264987
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
most browsers in current use support an iframe onload attribute including ie5.5+ firefox safari opera

4264990
textview	imageview
here the returnedbitmap should contain the image of imageview and textview but this bitmap contains only bacground bitmap of relativeview bgblack

4265014
int	double	int	chars
eg chars a double b chars c int d could be reordered to double b int d chars a chars c thus saving 10 bytes

4265047
width	height
as far as suggestions for change go 1st thing to change is the width height of the applet

4265061
post	get
jsonp is strictly a get request made by creating a tag you cannot post cross-domain and get the result back...it just doesn t work that way

4265069
bash	zsh
with bash 4 or zsh you can use globstar to match recursively

4265154
quicksort	mergesort
quicksort and mergesort is longer and seems more complicated but it is o n log n

4265193
qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsitem
void qgraphicsscene removeitem qgraphicsitem item

4265214
translation	localization
then i would take care of the localization as part of the normal localization process the time zones would be translation with the rest of the ui

4265221
hide	show
i have iframe elements in my page when the page is loaded the iframes will be re-sized and i have a button for each one to hide show it

4265229
perl	tcl
any script language should work lua tcl perl

4265234
config	ini
look at short tag config in the php ini you use in those situations and also see if processing .phtml is set up

4265244
super	abstract	super	extends
so i ve created an abstract super class with two constructors and every entity except organization extends this class

4265285
ostringstream	std
check out std ostringstream

4265293
innodb	myisam
i recommend you set innodb as your default storage engine because it is important that you don t mix operations on tables with different storage engines within a single transaction innodb and myisam tables for example

4265360
folder	dir
note2 i am ok also with another folder target dir in program files

4265364
onclick	onfocus
note between onclick and onfocus the latter is the best event to handle because it is device-independent

4265369
folder	directory
you need to create a placeholder.txt file in each empty directory if you want the precompilation tool to generate these empty folder

4265376
google-chrome	firefox
this piece of code works well in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie version 8 no other version tested

4265440
hide	show
now there s no visible property to use in order to show one and hide the other

4265502
x86	64bit
the problem is that there will possibly be both x86 apps and x64 apps and x86 apps cannot access 64bit registry

4265512
svg	vml
use svg vml graphics

4265515
codeigniter	cakephp
both sound very promising but i d also like to hear the advise from their users hopefully this would get a decent feature comparison like the thread about cakephp vs codeigniter on so

4265548
jibx	axiom	jibx	xom	xom	axiom
ideal for efficient conversion of a xom tree to soap axiom jaxb 2 jibx or xmlbeans for example when incrementally converting xquery results via an unmarshaller perhaps in combination with a streamingpathfilter

4265606
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
the problem occurs in google-chrome and firefox ie doesn t support rotate and opera i haven t tested

4265620
post	get
when i get value in vm from view to controller post some value is null only some value that is shown on view is not null

4265693
for-loop	loops
so assuming 2 does send its data before 1 for example the receiving loops in 0 shown above won t initiate until the source tag proc in the mpi_recv command is matched to the processor 1 because the outer for-loop forces this ordering

4265710
google-chrome	safari
however if you run this code in google-chrome or safari you get an interesting bug

4265710
google-chrome	safari
i have done this in google-chrome and safari on 3 different computers one on a completely different network altogether

4265710
google-chrome	firefox
if you still can t see the error then run it in google-chrome and firefox side by side

4265710
google-chrome	firefox
if google-chrome seems to finish earlier than firefox then that is the freezing glitch in action

4265717
put	get
a component will create that derived from tdlgprintersettings and it s name is equal to your default component that you put on the form so you will get an error

4265776
opera	firefox
the following code brings up the alert in firefox opera desktop browsers

4265777
hide	show
i would like to create a tab view just by hide and show div element with mootools.i am stucked by using mootools and got confused

4265784
uiview	subviews
i can get the animation working fine however the issue is the subviews of the uiview are expanding past the bounds of the uiview

4265815
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended
there i implemented methods touchesbegan touchesmoved and touchesended in order to rotate my circle when user drags it left or right

4265815
touchesbegan	touchesended
everything works fine but when you try to drag it with one finger very fast from one side to another and in opposite direction methods touchesbegan and touchesended are called different number of times

4265815
touchesbegan	touchesended
for example touchesbegan was called 1 time and touchesended 2 - 3 times

4265875
put	get
lastly you could use modify instead of a get put pairs

4265957
jar	war
and i want that when war is building the jar will be moved to another directory not in war web-inf lib but to war web-inf servicejars

4265961
int	double
it s good to start with a default choice of int for int double for floating-point numbers and decimal for decimal-precise numbers

4265961
int	double
then make changes to that choice either as an optimisation float takes up less space than double so if you are storing a very large number of them that might be a reasonable choice to better match some outside-imposed criteria or because it won t suffice when you need to use long rather than int

4265980
stdout	stderr
this means that both stdout stderr 1 and 2 and the new file descriptor returned from open can be used interchangeable which will cause all output going to stdout and stderr to go to the file you opened

4265989
rss	feed
update program is a rss reader that just checks a twitter feed and parses the data into a list box with some additional information based on the hash tag

4266014
persistent	transient
i have a ejb timer thats persistent by the container and would like to know if the transient timerservice it s not serializable will be injected again when the ejb is deserialized

4266038
onkeyup	onkeydown
override onkeydown or onkeyup and when back button is pressed if isclicked is true set it to false i assumed that pressing back with isclicked true means closing the dropdown view

4266107
post	get
using graph api how to do like unlike a post as in graph api we get a link

4266193
int	double
imho there was a change between tr1 and c++0x with regard to adaptors between random number generation and consumption of random numbers -- mt19937 produces int normal_distribution consumes double

4266243
ibatis	mybatis
and while you are at it why not just use a simple dao framework like ibatis now mybatis which is a pleasure to use for both simple and complex projects

4266244
rss	feed
one guess is that your constantly creating new objects when polling your rss feed and even though you not end up using most of them they still reside in memory until the garbage collector comes around to collect them

4266287
width	height
the width of the div is fixed but the height can vary

4266330
filesystems	xfs
some modern filesystems xfs for one allocate inodes dynamically as needed

4266342
filesystems	xfs
if you are actually designing a new filesystems rather than just creating a volume you should consider the idea of allocating inodes dynamically like some other common unix filesystems jfs xfs reiserfs

4266351
outputstream	inputstream
just obtain an inputstream of the blob using resultset#getbinarystream and write it immediately to the outputstream of the http response along a correct set of headers

4266359
division	modulo
integer division and modulo

4266359
min	max
comparison throughput of compare min max is 8 operations per clock

4266362
hide	show
you have to first show the box and on second click you have to hide it if is it so

4266392
jar	war
i built a war archive with the jar command and put it in the webapps folder of tomcat and it s working in this way

4266436
min	max
i was originally using percentage heights but these led to large gaps at points and using max and min heights proved tricky for dragging elements out of context

4266437
pull	push
dev b has taken a couple of snapshots of dev a s code during development and when dev a published his final code to the central repository dev b was able to pull the extra changes merge with them and push all of his changes back to the central repo too

4266529
s-function	simulink
i have a c++ routine that i would like to pack in a simulink s-function

4266560
put	get
i now create an int buffer and copy the pixels to it then use get and put to extract the pixels

4266560
put	get
it s also much quicker to use get and put instead of the get setpixel from the bitmap class

4266579
children	parent
i have a maven multi-module project one parent project with three children

4266608
portrait	landscape
incorrect image size landscape portrait the img has the width property set to 480 so in case the user wants the landscape mode the image fills the whole available width

4266629
children	parent
rule the xml is invalid if any child node - children of parent has iner text length more then 256

4266668
children	parent
or if the parent can contain other things as well as the children then having a container for the children is useful

4266677
inherited	subclassing
it is not inherited by subclassing

4266698
getter	setter
if that turns out to be the case you assign the proper access possibly via getter setter and accept that changes to it will be difficult

4266726
getter	setter
the question is asking do you really understand what the modifiers give you and how they can be accessed and not to blindly make everything private and create setter and getter because that is what your lecturer book manual taught you

4266727
public	protected
any private can be changed to public or protected and so on and the program will compile and run just as it did before

4266759
installation	upgrade
i have a straightforward installation of sql server 2005 express with a named instance sense and a single database sense on which i wish to perform an in-place upgrade to 2005 standard edition

4266843
addition	multiplication	subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication
the 2-complement representation just works for addition subtraction and multiplication

4266869
rational-numbers	floating-point
python uses floating-point representation rather than rational-numbers

4266869
rational-numbers	fractions
take a look at the standard library fractions module for some details about rational-numbers

4266881
integer	unsigned
i just tried this and for byte -12 signed value it returned integer 244 equivalent to unsigned byte value but typed as an int

4266900
min	max
agregates min max count.... on other fields

4266903
gif	png
for me it just made the file size bigger when used on png s and gif s

4266903
gif	png
i have done this to my png and gif files to reduce their size

4266903
gif	png
-colors 50 reduces the number of colors in the image to 50 this is the only way to really reduce the size of a image stored in a lossless format like png or gif

4266927
opentype	woff
well woff is a new font standard as you know like truetype opentype but which is designed specifically for use on the web to be embedded in html

4266927
opentype	woff
woff is compressed - smaller download sizes compared with raw truetype or opentype fonts

4266945
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
edit i ve tested this working on firefox safari and opera except for the innerheight check

4266945
wav	ogg	mp3	ogg	mp3	wav
chrome doesn t support playing wav audio files only the mp3 aac or ogg vorbis formats.

4266999
floating-point	fractions
the nature of floating-point numbers means that it makes no sense to check if a floating-point number is rational since all floating-point numbers are really fractions of the form n 2 e

4266999
floating-point	fractions
however you might well want to know whether there is a simple fractions one with a small denominator rather than a big power of 2 that closely approximates a given floating-point number

4267003
width	height
note the limitations mentioned in the top of that page - the mousewheel no longer works and the calculation of the width and height seemed a little strange

4267030
children	parent
in this case you can either use the sender to get the instance or on your form you can refer to the other form via the parent property and its children if the other form is another child

4267048
hide	show
i tried my hand at a very simple hide show accordion type plugin for faqs and was successful at getting it to do what i wanted

4267082
google-chrome	firefox
i m developing a small-business oriented online app and decided to support only ie8 firefox and google-chrome

4267090
tax	shipping
my problem is to show the tax and grand total including tax fields to appear in the cart because the tax is calculated once we know the shipping address

4267154
getter	setter
the only real difference is that it decorates the property getter and setter with the attribute

4267163
getter	setter
in the second case the c# compiler will generate a field for you and generate a getter and setter to access it

4267175
getter	setter
the difference is that you have control over the getter and setter

4267192
put	get
if you want to put some logic in the set or get part you won t be able to do it automatic properties

4267193
hash	md5
also i dont think you should store password in session depends on your program logic but usually password should only be used to compute its md5 hash and never be used afterwards

4267205
int	chars
but chars - int is an integral promotion whereas unsigned int - int is a conversion

4267251
google-chrome	firefox
in ie firefox i can do this if i use blur but for google-chrome i need to use change

4267255
google-chrome	firefox
i m programming a web site in asp.net using vb and i need to upgrade it so all of the functions will be active for google-chrome and firefox as well

4267255
google-chrome	firefox
sending mails when using the website with internet explorer works perfectly fine but in google-chrome and firefox the mails are not sent the to list remains empty

4267258
unsigned	short	int	chars
unsigned chars short int or unsigned

4267281
post	get
works great and i got get graph api working so that i m able to post stuff to ppl s walls using the facebook.api me feed function

4267289
performanceanalytics	chron
the functions in performanceanalytics only fail when using chron as the index

4267289
xts	chron	zoo	chron	zoo	xts
i ve suggested to you before that you should not rely on chron for your zoo xts index values

4267305
width	height
fitstart scales the image proportionally but neither the width nor height will exceed the size of the view and the image will as you said have a top|left gravity

4267327
copying	overwrite
i want to create an assignment operator that will copy the contents of array m but not to overwrite it when i change it after the copy i think this is accomplished by not copying the actual pointer but only the content don t know if i m right

4267336
mvp	presenter
if you want to be adventurous you can play with django which is the python framework for building web apps though they prescribe to the mvp model view presenter pattern

4267366
for-loop	loops
when i run this code however notice the nslog statement in the for-loop all it ever does is say that the current loops value is 0

4267374
firefox	safari
edit i just tested it in safari and it is fine so far it only seems to be firefox

4267379
google-chrome	firefox
the same exact setup works perfectly with google-chrome suggesting perhaps a bug in firefox

4267402
getter	setter
instead your class needs to force the user to call a getter setter by forbidding direct access to the variable and offering appropriate public getter setter methods in its place

4267410
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
at the moment i ve been stuck with an issue for 3 days where my ria renders fine in google-chrome firefox 3.6 opera and internet explorer 8 but fails when running internet explorer 8 in ie7-mode or with a real ie-7

4267410
google-chrome	firefox
this is the sort of thing severly lacking in the js-world in my opinion not so much for firefox or google-chrome obviously as their debuggers are a bit more helpful

4267441
submit	submission
and you need to prevent the default behavior of your form submit action submission the form via post

4267484
submit	submission
the submit event doesn t happen instead of submission but before it thus your form submit normally after the javascript is executed

4267506
google-chrome	firefox
this would probably explain why google-chrome allows the xhr but not firefox

4267506
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome considers the subdomain part of the same origin but firefox does not

4267511
initializer	class-method
when python initializer a class it essentially carries out the above procedure for each of the class-method

4267517
folder	directory
i d like to list all files from a remote folder let s say www.mysite.com folder and this folder is already configured through .htaccess for directory listing

4267550
postgresql	mysql
due to using postgresql it seems like the queries have been made unnecessarily complex when compared to mysql due to the need to include all the columns for the count columns grouping

4267708
maven	pom.xml
i m all done except that i m still looking for a way to write a maven goal in theapp s pom.xml that can put common s xml files in config

4267761
viewdidload	dealloc
a lot less to maintain and you don t have to worry about the mechanics of memory management either other than implementing init dealloc viewdidload viewdidunload

4267767
width	height
ticket size height 4 width 10

4267769
versioning	upgrade
also don t forget that if you upgrade a project certain behavior of the newer versioning will be suppressed by means of property sheets

4267846
hide	show
another workaround would have been to render them all to the page and just show hide each form through jquery

4267868
rtp	sip
i am using the pjproject1.6 and i could send the sip packets through the sip packets to the proxy server and the rtp packets or not pass through the server

4267868
rtp	sdp
i have checked in proxy server rtp proxy is running and when proxy server sends 200 ok the sdp packets from pjsip includes the ip address of the proxy server

4267885
google-chrome	firefox
while it is running fine on firefox and google-chrome

4267892
addition	multiplication
since the easiest way is to convert the integer to a string for manipulation operations and back to an integer for addition multiplication operations i used the following approach

4267892
int	chars
since a string can be construed as an array of chars 1 the operations that work on a string also need to be aware of the fact that converting a chars to an int is different than converting a string to an int

4267918
children	parent
so as long as your widget has a parent and that you destroy that parent you don t have to worry about the children

4268019
affinity	processors
i am wondering whether it is possible to set the processors affinity of a thread obtained from a thread pool

4268019
affinity	processors
the first one is related to processors affinity of pooled threads

4268068
put	get
to put it plain and simple here s what i get

4268086
hide	show
i would like to set its visibility dynamically show and hide the whole menu

4268094
persistent	transient
i have a many-to-many relationship between a persistent object retrieved by a query and a newly created transient object created with new not yet persistent

4268094
persistent	transient
however if i manually persistent the transient object before doing the association it seems to work

4268131
affinity	processors
it s very very rare to need to set processors affinity

4268131
affinity	processors
what i would call processors affinity where a thread needs to be run consistently on a the same processors

4268169
width	height
in short to make your job as a developer easier because you don t have to go through all the children and re-adjust their width height x y thus answering your 4th question too

4268194
lisp	scheme	haskell	ocaml	haskell	scheme	ocaml	scheme
like haskell miranda lisp scheme ocaml javascript and so forth

4268211
cublas	cula
i also know that the middle-range gpus cannot compete with high-range cpus in double-precision computation - mkl on a 8-core xeon will be faster than cula or cublas on an 300 gpu

4268216
tax	shipping
this is doubly beneficial when an address is supplied by the shipping and tax estimate form then the cart can still go back to the 3-line output automatically which is smooth

4268262
cos	sin
don t i have to do some sin cos kung-fu

4268285
multiplication	modulo	division	multiplication	division	modulo
modulo is evaluated at the same precedence as multiplication and division

4268297
addition	modulo
the modulo has precedence over the addition operator and hence 2 5 gets calculated first resulting in 2 and then 3 + 2 is calculated resulting in your answer 5

4268324
filtering	grouping
add indexes for columns you are frequently filtering or grouping for

4268327
flexunit	cairngorm	cairngorm	flex
flex libraries frameworks flex 4 sdk core library for flex flexunit flexmonkey blazeds spring blazeds integration cairngorm 3

4268376
jobs	cron
there is no cron function in php but you can run php scripts as cron jobs

4268414
removeclass	fadeout
afaik i dont think you can add a fadeout to a removeclass

4268427
google-chrome	safari
i m trying to align an input button with a link class button but in safari and google-chrome there is like 1 pixel difference at the top and i can t figure out why

4268433
for-loop	loops
to answer your question you need to loops over every bit using a simple a for-loop and check to see whether the i th bit is set

4268446
public	protected
as you know php class has private public and protected keywords

4268473
getter	setter
i m not sure of any disadvantages other than declaring something protected or private may mean a little more work writing a getter and a setter method

4268524
folder	directory
i deleted a common folder from the root directory of my svn store and it turns out i need it.

4268530
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i want to create my own container view controller something like uinavigationcontroller or uitabbarcontroller

4268557
implements	modifiers	public	protected
obviously you don t need modifiers like private protected or public to implements this behavior but it leads to better structured code and clearer interfaces

4268557
public	protected
public members can be accessed from outside code protected members can be accessed form inheriting classes and private members only from the class

4268570
implements	extends
the above is used with the built-in lime test suite but i m sure you can extends implements it appropriately in your bdd bootstrap

4268576
entitydatasource	detailsview
i have a page with a detailsview control is connected with entitydatasource

4268623
google-chrome	firefox
to both elements fixes this problem in google-chrome and firefox

4268667
int	double
the following code can t be compiled because there are two double get_item int methods in the class

4268683
submit	submission
i am trying to disable the form on my site when the user click the submit button to stop duplicate submission

4268707
post	put
i ve found a good post describing post put differences post vs put

4268717
rss	feed
then whenever you are refreshing the rss feed you loop through all entities and call updateshoulddisplay

4268723
mongoid	mongomapper
that line would pass your time object as a string take off the to_s to send it to the type parsing layer in your orm mongomapper or mongoid as a time object

4268739
pull	push	squash	branch
the only other course of action after such a special push followed by a squash on the remote side would be to rename your current branch and to pull the remote branch in order to reset the local version of said branch to what is on the remote side

4268776
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome safari

4268786
put	get
for a put i d return the same view that you d get if you did a get immediately after

4268791
hide	show
then add a link just above or below that div to show the div and hide the add comment link using js like jquery

4268816
hash	md5
i am trying to make a multi user login system for my java program at the moment i am compairing the username and password to md5 hash stored in a text file

4268823
google-chrome	firefox
i ve built a site in ci and have a login system which works fine in firefox but not google-chrome or ie

4268823
google-chrome	firefox
i ve noticed that it doesn t seem to be setting a cookie in google-chrome but it does in firefox

4268890
hash	md5
md5 is a one way hash algorithmic you cant decrypt it back best way is to compare the encrypted string to validate things

4268894
boost	allocator
boost interprocess containers are standard containers with custom allocator

4268894
boost	allocator
so the allocator classes relevant to boost interprocess involve extra arithmetic at dereferenciation

4268926
inherited	properties
i have inherited some existing projects where the developer was using dependency properties rather that inotifypropertychanged for wpf change notification

4268964
datediff	difference
you may also tell the datediff tsql function to consider the difference in days in month in hours in minutes in seconds etc

4268975
put	get	post	get	post	put
forgive the flippancy but if you are doing rest over http then rfc7231 describes exactly what behaviour is expected from get put post and delete

4268988
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
subclassing uinavigationcontroller or uitabbarcontroller is an excellent way to handle device rotation issues but i wouldn t recommend doing that specifically to share subviews from multiple view controllers

4269019
ant	maven
the code generation should run from maven or ant and take the java source code as input

4269061
superclass	subclassing
anyway i recommend you to subclassing writerappender and create your own jtextareaappender that would pass in your custom outputstream to superclass

4269069
pow	math.h
pow is from visual c++ 2010 math.h library

4269076
puts	gets
to do that i m using a customized uitableview which gets data from an array and puts cells with pair indexpath on the right and with odd indexpath on the left

4269094
int	chars
values int 169 chars â

4269156
int	double
it wouldn t be practical for pow to check for special cases like int roots and besides 1 3 as a double is not exactly 1 3

4269184
move	drag
the problem is when i move on h2 i want to see a little hand to show this can drag and drop i guess it could implement directly use jquery

4269195
updatepanel	scriptmanager
criticism tinymce will not interoperate 100 smoothly with the asp.net scriptmanager and updatepanel controls at no fault of the tinymce script

4269237
filepath	unc
i gave iusr_machine_name full rights to the unc share and as i step through my asp.net page s code behind onto the file.openread filepath method it throws an exception access to path 10.32.16.24 repositories repository0001 vol00001 ktappb01_024655001_0.pdf is denied

4269273
hash	salt
i m trying to figure out if it is alright to store passwords that are encrypted using the aes algorithm rather than storing passwords that are salt and hash with sha1

4269273
hash	salt
i get the impression that most people think that hashing salt passwords is the more secure way of handling passwords but i can t figure out a way to comply with current company operations when using hash passwords

4269319
fileoutputstream	filewriter
note that filewriter isn t generally a great class to use - i prefer to use fileoutputstream wrapped in outputstreamwriter as that lets you specify the character encoding to use rather than using your operating system default

4269334
nsstring	nsdata
note that a defaultâ s value can be only property list objects nsdata nsstring nsnumber nsdate nsarray or nsdictionary

4269340
post	get
yes each computer as long as their on the same network can establish a server instance with inbound and outbound post get

4269369
onclick	onmousedown
it will work if you use onmousedown instead of onclick

4269540
jinternalframe	jlayeredpane
i have a jlayeredpane and inside the jlayeredpane is a jinternalframe

4269540
width	height
what i need are the bounds x position y position width height of the content pane in the jinternalframe

4269572
try-catch	exception-handling
suppose i want to wrap code that can throw exception-handling with a try-catch block that logs the exception-handling and continues

4269601
udp	tcp
basically i want to send and receive data using socket connection through tcp udp protocol between two emulator and the two emulator are running on the same pc

4269613
udp	tcp
my current aim is to stream device status accelerometer over the network over udp while also maintaining signaling and delivery-guaranteed-event button pressed connection over tcp

4269670
put	get
this creates really bad code and if i put this as a member of the class i will get a circular reference because the data table bean has to inject the calendar and the calendar has to inject the data table

4269708
post	get
correction to roy s post the day from the function will always get the month value

4269826
put	get	post	get	post	put
plus wcf data services and odata supports all crud operations using the http verbs get post put and delete and merge which is new for this protocol i believe

4269826
post	put
if in your iphone app you can create http requests using post put and delete verbs methods then your service will support that

4269892
postgresql	mysql
sorry but oracle sql server mysql postgresql are all good databases

4269897
put	get
if the state changes after you put them into the map you won t be able to get them out again at least not by their original values

4269934
put	get
so i need to check the partners-certi for the issuer get this from the internet put it into my trusted certi dir in openssl etc....

4269994
do-while	break
the do-while false loop is a way of making a block that you can break out of in languages that will not tolerate an anonymous block

try-catch	exception-handling
it could just as easily be a function and use returns or a try-catch with exception-handling

4270002
matlab	simulink
i do not see any sense anyway starting today a new project in matlab except if you are using simulink

4270009
postgresql	mysql
after mysql postgresql is the most used open source free as in beer database

4270019
addition	multiplication	subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication
is there a clear abstraction to represent mixed fractions so that you can perform addition subtraction multiplication operations on it

4270070
post	put
you should try jquery.ajax with async false if you want to wait for the result or put other code inside the function given to post

4270073
icu	gettext
however if you want to solve this problem because this is extra challenging and you are looking for creative cross inspiring ways to do that you might want to look into something called choiceformat example would be one from icu project or you can look up gettext s solution for plural forms problem

4270079
integer	fractions
well i think you can turn it into an improper fractions by adding the fractions part with the integer do the operations using the methods mentioned in the page you linked to and transform it back to a mixed fractions by doing this

4270094
youtube	vimeo
also it only works with youtube it does not affect vimeo flash embeds for example

4270111
put	get
i ve put calls in the actual markdown function and they never get called

4270118
put	get
so i just created dummy implementations of the assignment and copy constructor put them in the private of the class but it still warns me about assignment operator not able to get generated

4270129
for-loop	loops
the continue within the for-loop will skip within the for-loop not the foreach loops

4270167
loops	while-loop
use a while-loop only to loops forever and that means probably never

4270180
folder	directory
the public folder is used to publish static resources but just for that so that every requests that points to a static source under root of the url eg yoursite.com static_img.jpg is forwarded to the real file residing in that directory this is not true for normal ror views

4270185
int	chars
sourcepacket is just a small class which takes a const chars and an int during construction

4270186
width	height
what i would like to do is check the dimensions of every picture and load only bigger ones certain width height in the browser

4270216
width	height
you can get image sizes with the php function getimagesize which will return an array containing the height and width along with some other meta information

4270216
width	height
if the height and width match your criteria you can add them to an output array that you can convert to json and send back to your jquery script

4270216
width	height
you can check their width by using the method and their height by using the method

4270245
width	height
you definitely need to load them all first there s no way to get the width height without doing so

4270258
width	height
i think after getting the images you can loop on them and get width and height of each one and by that you can get which is bigger than others

4270258
google-chrome	safari
in safari google-chrome

4270296
google-chrome	firefox
no content-type is set in the response and google-chrome defaults it to text while firefox and ie render it as html

4270309
cpu	affinity
you can use the taskset command to set the cpu affinity of a process which will limit which cpus it is allowed to run on

4270309
cpu	affinity
to fetch the cpu affinity of a process run

4270311
for-loop	arrays
tried to pseudo-code the solution to the problem went as far as store each listbox item in an arrays with a for-loop

4270331
subtraction	addition
then when you want to do addition and subtraction you can find the lcd faster and you can work in one representation

4270331
division	subtract
or you can save the value you get from floor numerator denominator and subtract it from the raw division which will give you the fractional component 0 x 1

4270337
google-chrome	firefox
it would not work in firefox or google-chrome etc

4270337
google-chrome	firefox
when you do retest in google-chrome and firefox and ie and the tinymce suddenly appears

4270343
virus	botnet	trojan	virus	trojan	botnet
i m not seriously advocating vigilantism of course but in theory you could wage a war against any botnet using the same tactics that a virus worm trojan uses

4270362
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
when uinavigationcontroller pushes a new uiviewcontroller on to its stack it will ask that controller for whatever buttons should be displayed

4270373
put	get
for those interested in how the page previews get chucked on the page here s the function that loops through all the images in memory and put them up

4270402
client-side	server-side
the cookie is read server-side and then ideally as much of the facebook access as possible is done client-side ajax calls to the graph etc.

4270426
mbunit	mstest
it would be great if mstest had something similar to what mbunit has had for a long time

4270427
put	get
put a time command around the whole call as well as prefixed to unzip to get your differences

4270457
vsto	add-in
- if you re new to add-in development vsto can be - well less than enjoyable

4270471
width	height
the answer is simple if you set the layout width or layout height of your listview to wrap_content the listview will try to measure every single view that is attached to it - which is definitely not what you want

4270471
listview	gridview
generally speaking avoid setting wrap_content for listview or gridview at all times

4270503
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the element is currently supported by the latest versions of mozilla firefox google-chrome safari and opera

4270515
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
we re having a series of browser plugins developed for us for firefox ie7 8 9 google-chrome and safari supported on windows xp and up and on mac os x 10.5 and up

4270557
opera	firefox
ie firefox 3.6+ webkit and opera support it

4270560
post	get
as the title may possibly suggest i m wondering what s more secure for ajax requests post or get

4270571
hide	show
i had a situation where i needed to do more than just show or hide the one element

4270579
post	get
your choice of using get and post depends on the data sent

4270581
post	get
it s almost trivially easy to inspect the contents of both post and get values

4270582
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
but that would work in safari firefox google-chrome and opera

4270611
post	get
there are no security differences between post and get used in ajax

4270611
post	get
the only difference is that post payload is in the body of the request and get payload is in the query params of the url

4270663
width	height
you have both layout_width and layout_height set to wrap_content in addition to setting explicit values for width and height

4270667
hide	show
ocr tools often show the bit-map to hide the text they get wrong

4270669
children	parent
adapter children ----- adapter parent

4270669
children	parent
the selected parent node and its children is reloaded in the nsoutlineview

4270711
chunked	transfer-encoding
you should use http 1.0 because 1.1 servers typically respond with the transfer-encoding chunked which are the parts prefixed by hex numbers

4270768
width	height
preset height width affects

4270768
width	height
3 it will handle height width other properties automatically

4270768
mouse	keyboard
i think i ve done it right to work with keyboard mouse

4270804
pop-up	dialog
edit2 actually now i can directly right-click the jar or even the project and select the right main when a dialog pop-up and it s all good

4270899
jsf	wicket
for the web tier we looked at various java web frameworks and eliminated component-based ones such as jsf wicket

4270932
config	ini
the config is entirely external to your program and consists of using an environment variable to point to an ini file

4270932
keystore	jks
the ini file in turn points to the keystore which can be a jks or ibm s kdb format such as that used by qmgrs

4270973
hlsl	glsl
i m developing visualization applications and games for desktops using hlsl glsl nvidia cg for shaders and mostly c++ as the base language

create edit in jquery ui dialog pop-up

4271010
uiview	subviews
in particular i have a map view and i have been trying to add a second subviews to the superview not the mkmapview. the problem is that while both view can be seen any touches to the uiview that is not the mkmapview pass through to the map

4271039
apache	nginx
on the server i ve got php perl python apache and nginx and can use any of them

4271133
postgresql	mysql
sql server mongo oracle sybase postgresql mysql

4271236
variance	kurtosis
and as far as i remember mean variance skew and kurtosis are just functions of the first 4 momenta

4271249
public	protected
you limit the manipulation of the class s private internals to what s allowed by legal usage of the class s public or protected members

4271257
draggable	droppable
just because an element is draggable does not mean it can not be droppable as well

4271259
google-chrome	firefox
tested in firefox google-chrome and ie7

4271262
public	protected
to class b in whatever public protected private section is appropriate

4271306
swift	objective-c
but when working with nsstring whether in swift or in objective-c as far as you are concerned you should treat it as an ideal string

4271320
hibernate	gilead
i m not sure what spring hibernate and gilead are for .

4271374
post	get
code i can t get the code to post i think it s too long for so requirements the source is available on google docs

4271407
trie	tree
almost anything that s a tree or trie and a few things that aren t in fact

4271483
hide	show
i will be exploring the javascript show hide options further and will try to remember to extend this answer further when i get those done

4271516
lua	scheme
scheme lua ruby and python are all lexically scoped

4271518
uipickerviewdelegate	uipickerviewdatasource
it will probably make sense to have its delegate also implement uipickerviewdelegate and uipickerviewdatasource

4271539
rss	feed
you create your app online then customize it by adding rss feed tabs videos etc .

4271558
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
yes and goto s w if statements can do everything a while loops for-loop list comprehension or an arrays map filter reduce can do

4271595
getter	setter
therfore you do not have the convenience clr property getter setter see msdn for details

4271630
vb6	vba
smacks of historical vb6 vba forms to me

4271648
button	checkbox
checkbox radio button and are os-level components not browser-level

4271657
getter	setter
self.property accesses the getter setter method created manually or by synthesize

4271664
maven-dependency-plugin	pom.xml
this ll create an attached artifact common-config.zip which you can expand with the maven-dependency-plugin inside theapp s pom.xml putting the files in theapp s target config directory which may not be suitable depending on how you re creating your final distribution

4271669
post	get
but it allows you to do additional gymnastics like adding a form wizard to the admin site or splitting everything into multiple forms and rendering them in a single html form element in the templates doing custom handling of get post requests etc

4271680
accessor	properties
if you re already using properties to access your instance variable then you can just edit the accessor method and everything should just work

4271710
lisp	scheme
just like writing in lisp means writing in some dialect like common lisp or scheme actually writing straight-up ecmascript might not only be pointless but unusable in the dialects although i think actionscript 3 and recent javascript apply the whole ecmascript standard

4271712
fast-forward	merge
seeing your edit your merge back into trunk must have been a fast-forward

4271779
width	height
since that didn t work for you what you will have to do is create a 1px width 1px height .png of color #000 and opacity at 50

4271867
getter	setter
you almost always want to access variables using the synthesized setter getter even if you aren t doing anything special with them at the moment

4271867
getter	setter
if as your application develops you find that you need to be doing further validation formatting of variables then you can just implement the required setter getter method and if you have used the synthesised methods this code will get called

4271941
waitpid	posix
here is a description of the posix requirements on waitpid

4272031
getter	setter
i ended overriding the setter to assert that the object being set is of the appropriate type and creating a new read-only getter like this

4272033
accelerometer	gyroscope
i m doing some math on both gyroscope and accelerometer data combined and i d like to low pass filter the resulting data

4272058

4272105
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

postgresql	mysql
if you re using mysql or postgresql you can get a query plan by adding explain to the start of the query and running it in a terminal

4272225
postgresql	mysql
see the mysql documentation or postgresql documentation for more information

4272263
firefox	safari
i ve a problem with a lightbox i ve done in safari and firefox

4272281
mouseover	mouseout
i imagine you could use getcomputedstyle to figure out what the value of a property was on an element and change it with an external stylesheet defining different rules for #foo and #foo hover but you are probably better off writing logic that does the right thing whatever that might be when the mouseover and mouseout events fire

4272295
tarfile	zipfile
file manipulation open tarfile zipfile ...

4272302
listbox	icollectionview
by using a custom icollectionview implementation the article derives listcollectionview for convenience you don t have to do anything to the listbox except set the itemssource to be a collectionviewsource object bound to your dataset

4272311
qscrollarea	qwidget
firstly you probably should create the qwidget and qscrollarea somewhere else and keep a member variable pointing to them for reference

4272313
min	max
i guess if your comparator for the avl tree built on the interval list was f length-of-interval you could get it in o logn or maybe faster if your avl implementation has fast max min

4272322
getter	setter
as donnie suggests in the comments getter and setter are just like any other methods

4272322
getter	setter
if it says that the method is a getter or a setter at least you ll know if it s attached to a property

4272337
disk	ram
i would definitely try to locate the bottleneck by running a few counters in windows performance monitor for cpu ram network disk system on web server and db server while running jmeter

4272371
put	get
or in other words what you put in is what you get out

4272397
put	get
to get around this you put as the first line in your program

4272415
pop-up	dialog
now when eclipse starts up it pop-up the discovery dialog but then pop-up an error dialog with unexpected exception

4272415
pop-up	dialog
when i close that it pop-up another dialog that says something like could not find any connectors

4272424
implements	extends
they are produced because you have some kind of reference to the dependency hardcoded in your code such as calling new for some class extends or implements something either directly or indirectly or a method call using the direct reference.method notation

4272443
put	get
users going to journeyfx.com will see the under construction page while if you put journeyfx.com index.php you ll get wp

4272488
getter	setter
one fact i don t like in struts 2 in comparison with spring-mvc is that you have to add getter and setter for every property you want to get in the actions

4272506
width	height
if i re-size the window bigger the x y positions from either mouse events seem to be restricted to the original window width and height

4272561
stdout	stderr
if you want to enable this globally you ll want a terminal feature not a process that you pipe output into because a pipe would be disruptive to some command two problems are that stdout and stderr would appear out-of-order and buffered and that some commands just behave differently when outputting to a terminal

4272576
capitalize	capitalization
i know there are use cases where having the correct capitalization of place names would be valuable and lowercasing strings is easy enough if you have to do that so we re considering how to provide capitalize names without impacting current customers who might be relying on the data in its current format

4272635
uitableview	nsindexpath
uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath is called when a cell is requested

4272668
apache	nginx
i need to convert following nginx rule to apache configuration

4272689
getter	setter
supplying public getter and setter

4272692
hide	show
also the use of jquery hide show can be very useful in hiding optional elements and thus reducing the negative impact of a very complex form in terms of ux user experience usability

4272735
do.call	lapply
furthermore i have a feeling that there has to be do.call in there somewhere and maybe even an lapply but i do not know how that will go through the whole data frame

4272788
post	get
this is a post all about it and how to get t

4272854
uiview	subviews
they re much bigger than the uiview of which they are subviews

4272884
post	get
i ll post an exact example when i can get back in an hour or two

4272915
width	height
for instance in many apis instead of passing x y width height all over the place they use rectangle objects

4272986
serializable	deserialization
i can post my serializable or deserialization methods if needed

4273006
children	parent
we are creating an inner join with children which produces multiple rows selecting those rows that where the child is in the childlist grouping by the parent and seeing if we got the expected number of rows and only returning those parent

4273017
strlen	strcpy
for example strcpy strlen etc.

4273022
concave	vertex
edit the polygon is concave so we need to check for that -- i think the o n 2 algorithm of trying every vertex pair is feasible as n is small

4273048
post	get
the client that we re using is supposed to do http get s to request information and http post s to update or create new information yes we know about http put...

4273057
allocator	stl
i know the stl will throw on a memory allocator error or if the contained type throws in its constructor assignment operator

4273080
public	protected
as other have said you need to make a private protected setsize which can set the the size without condition checking and a public one that performs the condition checking

4273135
fiddler	pac
i had to go into fiddler options - connections check use pac script

4273175
perforce	svn
perhaps if i could actually make an exact distinction between a head a ref a commit a branch a stem a gnargel and a whizpoo some of this might be a little easier but to an ordinary mortal with only 10 years experience of svn perforce and rcs it all looks like rather cranky black magic

4273187
post	get
i envisaged a small script probably vbscript that can run quietly in the background logging the load times of a page or number of selected pages from the site then either posting the data to me or i get the user to post the log to me after say a week

4273201
distance	polygons
if the distance on a diagonal is equal or less than any of the rectilinear distance you have a square that fits in the polygons

portrait	landscape
the uitextfield in question is 243 wide in portrait and 360 in landscape

4273333
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in google-chrome and internet explorer but in firefox there is a small delay between the page height changing and the scroll position changing

4273344
width	height
try setting the group s width and height to 100 and ensuring that the content of the group is taller than the scroller

4273372
comparator	comparable
be careful though- any two prioritizedrule-s will have to be comparable to each other which is why i m recommending prioritizedrule be an abstract base instead of an interface because that s where the comparator implementation needs to live for consistency

4273372
equals	compareto
your compareto does not need to be consistent with equals unless you try to keep your collection in a sorted set which can never end well prioritizedrule can t be aware of enough to make itself consistent with equals

4273400
x86	64bit	16-bit	64bit
for x86 processors this is generally 16-bit processing code this generally jumps into the operating system code from here and upgrades to 32-bit 64bit mode depending on the operating system and chipset

4273495
width	height
the child divs are of variable width and height - that is they re populated using dynamic data which i have no control of

4273495
width	height
now sometimes what happens if that the last child div has a massive height with a wall of text because it is forced into a small width by the other divs

4273511
jflex	cup
another option is jflex and cup

4273541
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended

what has worked is putting the chmod chgrp commands into a bash script and teaching the designer how to run it

4273562
maven	pom.xml
i see how gradle can deploy to a maven repository automatically generating the pom.xml required to do it

4273670
maven	m2e
i ve just set up a brand new installation of eclipse helios and have configured m2e to use an external v 2.2.1 installation of maven

4273678
children	parent
the reason is that the closeing and closed events are raised first with children and lastly with the parent

4273697
post	get
i m a little confused about whether i should be using a get or post here

4273717
button	checkbox
anyway you could use radio button checkbox with the tag and style the label to look like a button

4273746
width	height
as long as you are letting the content decide the height and width you are going to run into problems

4273750
folder	directory
move that file to a different directory undersubversion and do not check out the new folder

4273754
post	get
if you are altering state use post - otherwise use get

4273754
post	get
and don t forget when talking about caching with get post that is browser-caching

4273795
post	get
they recommend using get primarily for retrieving information and using post for updating information

4273808
ubuntu	centos
but on centos 5.5 not ubuntu

4273813
multiplying	modulo
unfortunately the divide and modulo each iteration adds up especially moving to large integers - but it seems i could just use multiplying

4273869
int	chars
for int and chars it is easy but how to do it for vectors of ixmlinf derived class in a generic way vec is a different type from vec

4273895
portrait	landscape
i have a subview in navigation controller when the ipad simulator rotate to be portrait or landscape the main view is autorotate fit into the ipad orientation but the subview is not

4273897
onresume	onpause
instead of using startservice you can call bindservice in onresume and unbindservice in onpause

4273918
post	put
i m sorry i haven t got time to post neither a full solution or a tested one but this should at least put you on the right track

4273962
maven	m2e
the dependency resolver in m2e is not using the external maven installation it has to use the embedded maven version

4273962
maven	m2e
so i d recommend to get the latest version of m2e as well as maven 3.x version to minimize the difference in dependency resolution

4273972
width	height
you can get a pretty good guesstimate by taking the width and height of the image and then parsing the file extension of the src attribute

4273972
gif	png
i use gif 8bit jpeg png 32bit

4274038
daemon	cron
but honestly cron is fairly lightweight and unless it needs to be real-time or whatever that means to you writing php into a daemon is more work than it s work

4274055
put	get
i need to serialize a c struct to a file in a portable way so that i can read the file on other machines and can be guaranteed that i will get the same thing that i put in

4274072
qapplication	qwidget
qwidget must construct a qapplication before a qpaintdevice

4274157
selenium	sahi
the ones that come to mind are sahi and selenium

4274361
int	double
as you see my x field and y field has double type but when i print those points their value will be int how can i keep their value and use them in my functions with double type

4274372
int	double
your double values are being cast back to int

4274395
int	double
if you store an int into a floating point type like a double then it gets stored as the floating point equivalent of that int which is the same as putting .0 at the end

4274395
int	double
because the value you are storing into it will always be an int you re always going to end up with a whole number in your double unless you do some other mathematical processing on them which causes them to change

4274451
oncreate	ondestroy
in oncreate add the open call in ondestroy the close call

4274501
client-side	server-side
on the server-side certain events can happen that the client-side javascript framework needs to be notified about and vice versa

4274535
system.in	system.out
you need to copy the input and output between the subprocess streams and system streams system.in system.out and system.err

4274556
width	height
they give the element for the button a span in this case a fixed width and height and add the background to it with css

4274634
button	checkbox
vista and windows 7 applications can use the new taskdialog features which extend the standard messageboxes to support a checkbox at the bottom along with all sorts of other goodies such as command links custom button text footers etc

4274650
ubuntu	linux
specifically in ubuntu or any linux os

4274666

i have multiple elements in multiple views that i am using jquery toggles to show or hide them

4274742
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i ve looked at browsers like firefox opera google-chrome and internet explorer and the text is only correct centered by default in opera and google-chrome

4274765
jstl	taglib
i am trying to read a properties file form jstl using taglib but i can t access it

4274870
g++	gcc
previously i use gcc to compile then i got the error message when i switch to g++ the error messages are gone

4274878
hide	show
when this happens update all plugins to show hide their advanced properties

4274892
hide	show
i tried hide show but i think it is not working for me

4274902
sproutcore	cappuccino
i d like to avoid large frameworks cappuccino echo2 sproutcore claypool

4275018
width	height
in your case i recommend you specify the concrete width height for containter because it ll be hard to pretend the size of the screen on many machines

4275035
children	parent
parent has many children and child has one parent

4275067
cpu	hyperthreading
ah now it seems like you re talking about hyperthreading where partial redundancies within a cpu core are used to fake an additional core

4275110
getter	setter
you have various options in struts2 to avoid these getter and setter one of them id modeldriven interceptor

4275152
bids	ssis
despite being able to use a 64bit ssis run-time bids 2005 cannot use the 64bit oracle drivers

4275168
slideup	slidedown
i have 3 sections on a form which slidedown when a checkbox is checked and slideup when the checkbox is unchecked

4275168
button	checkbox
if i uncheck the checkbox to slide the content up and then recheck it to slide the content back down again the text in the button disappears and leaves me with a tiny button which still works but will not inform the user of what it does

4275173
post	get
also from what i can see your form contains only store name and state text fields so those are the only values you can expect to get back in your post action

4275174
int	double
ok so i have this tiny little corner of my code where i d like my function return either of int double cstring to clean up the code a bit

4275227
folder	directory
if isfolder the node is a branch in the directory tree a folder

4275263
maven	m2e
you also can specify your maven 2.2.1 installation as the maven installation for m2e

4275333
devise	cancan
using devise for authentication and cancan for authorization on a new rails 3 app

4275397
listview	gridview	gridview	repeater
if it has to be a running total than you could use a gridview repeater or a listview to create the table and sign up to the control s onitemdatabound onrowdatabound event to calculate it

4275466
maven	m2e
especially m2e which does use maven 3 internally seems to be affected with it update-snapshots does not work when the snapshots are not unique

4275466
nexus	artifactory
i also did test various other configurations first replace nexus with artifactory - same behaviour

4275467
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
that s the easy part but i want the player to work for i.e versions 6 firefox safari and google-chrome

4275483
nodevalue	innerhtml
it s nothing to do with the standards-compliance or otherwise of innerhtml or that only a single text node is legal within a element you get exactly the same behaviour if you try to change the nodevalue property of a text node contained within the element

4275517
children	parent
i know that inheritancetype.joined works without defining discriminator column but it s quite ineffective because then hibernate needs to create joins between parent and all children instead of just parent and one child when using information in discriminator column

4275579
opera	firefox
opera mobile and the mobile version of firefox for android also supports svg

4275581
public	protected
assume that i have a public class a and an abstract class b such that b only contains protected methods

4275599
put	get
put simply i have 2010-11-24 and i want to get just 24 from that

4275610
public	protected
those public methods will simply call the protected methods you are trying to test

4275624
octal	binary	octal	hex	octal	decimal	hex	binary
it s just a convention used in c and c-like languages to distinguish between different bases 0x10 hex versus 10 decimal versus 010 octal versus 0b10 binary

4275634
many-to-many	one-to-many
personally i doubt the extra table model would be helpful unless you think that one-to-many will become many-to-many in the future

4275694
treemap	treeset
but you know if i were you i would instead use either treeset or treemap which are perfect implementations provided you give them a valid comparator which you already have written in one form or one another

4275713
disk	ram
1 quite heavy needs lots of disk space around 5+ gb and good amount of ram

4275718
children	parent
the getchildren .add internally adds the current component as parent of the children

4275731
put	get
so when i try to run my app i get force close but when i put manually

4275741
google-chrome	firefox
why is it only apparent in ie and google-chrome and not firefox

4275746
udp	rtp
since the rtp packets are contained in udp my socket is initalized with the following parameters

4275746
packets	multicast	udp	rtp
something goes wrong while i can receive standard udp packets addressed to the multicast group 224.1.0.1 the rtp packets are not received the first time but sending them again makes the trick

4275746
udp	rtp
the code is exactly the same read same executable for the rtp scenario and the udp scenario

4275809
installation	downgrade	uninstall	downgrade
go to about eclipse - installation details - installed software and uninstall the plug-in you want to downgrade

4275811
gridview	rowdatabound
the index variable comes from the rowdatabound event of my gridview like so

4275832
int	boolean
the reason for this is because the boolean data type is stored as a 16-bit signed int

4275889
draggable	droppable
there s a good reason why i have the one datepicker tied to a div i need to be able to drag items onto it using draggable and droppable which turns out to be impossible using a popup datepicker

4275931
superclass	subclassing
i d guess that it is down to the fact that the mapped superclass cannot have its own table and so is persisted into the table s of subclassing and if there are multiple subclassing of the mapped superclass then the relation back from the other side doesn t have a single fk to follow to get to the mapped superclass information

4275931
superclass	subclassing
in that way most jpa implementations will allow it but typically when there is a single subclassing of the mapped superclass

4275933
jstl	taglib
the use of scriptlets those things is indeed highly discouraged since the birth of taglib like jstl and el expression language those things over a decade ago

4276002
instances	transient
if i instantiate this class as a singleton in castle windsor in asp.net then presumably all attempts to access this class by transient web calls will read from the single instances of the reference data in memory

4276061
google-chrome	firefox
i wish to run my web application for translation in all the three browsers namely firefox google-chrome ie

4276065
post	get
you should write a small web service simple php asp page that handles authentication through http get post and only submits requests you permit avoid someone sniffing the username password and then drop the database or modify it

4276113
mef	prism
in a prism v4 mef mvvm app i got a view containing a tabcontrol

4276153
portrait	landscape
i m creating an app for ipad that works both in landscape and portrait mode

4276162
rss	feed
i m trying to create a rss feed in symfony

4276181
width	height
it has to the be the width of the keyboard and the height is adjustable

4276226
post	get
i have managed to use xmlhttprequest in the past using the get method but am struggling with post

4276294
versioning	upgrade
setting up upgrade versioning of a1 in iis6 this worked - so no compatibility issues between forms auth in different .net versioning in iis6

4276325
width	height
i want a table to have fixed width but dynamic height because content may be of various length

4276346
int	chars
when i check allocations in ddms i see that .tostring not totally unsurprising allocates a chars array on each conversion from an int to a string

4276377
children	parent
you can use simple observer pattern where you parent components are observing their children

4276386
client-side	server-side
you can use a customvalidator and perform the regex match server-side and also on the client-side as well if you want

4276402
int	boolean
expr can be a boolean expression a boolean literal variable or anything castable to a boolean an int

4276409
rss	feed
i want to convert a xml find having atom feed into rss feed

4276426
filtering	grouping
and grouping by a value which you ve already filtering by

4276430
google-chrome	safari
but wonder how it will work on safari and google-chrome searching the same.

4276430
google-chrome	safari
got it on safari and google-chrome as well

4276477
spweb	spsite	spweb	splist	splist	spsite
i know that it is very important to dspose the spweb and spsite the splist object belongs to

4276479
filtering	grouping
you can always grouping table and other filtering components to one customcomponent for easier abstraction

4276483
versioning	upgrade
the solution was simple to upgrade grails to a more recent versioning such as 1.3.5

4276532
client-side	server-side
i create my proxy using a channelfactory object and found that in addition to specifying usedefaultwebproxy for the binding server-side it was also necessary to specify the option client-side

4276674
stdout	stderr
you in fact can scrape stdout and stderr

4276677
textview	imageview
here the text is written in a textview and remaining 5 boxes are 5 different imageview and the images should be clickable

4276683
mongodb	bson
mongodb stores everything in memory anyway and works in a similar vein being a key-value based system however i believe mongodb is more flexible as it allows for storing bson objects within themselves

4276683
mongodb	bson
just for clarification mongodb uses bson a specialised form of json for storing all its data which includes objects within objects.

4276686
pop-up	dialog
whenever the dialog appears the first fields gets focus automatically hence the datepicker pop-up

4276734
put	get
if i use phpmyadmin to put a â symbol into a row when i display it on a utf-8 charset page i get the good old question-mark-diamond

4276737
children	parent
when someone goes to i create a model for the view with 2 objects - a list of all the messages to show in the proper order of parent and children

4276742
opera	firefox
this is not a cross browser solution but this worked in firefox and opera not in ie8 -

4276800
folder	dir	folder	directory
dir in visual basic returns a string representing the name of a file directory or folder that matches a specified pattern or file attribute or the volume label of a drive

4276819
jobs	cron
also if you have access to things like cron jobs they might be the solution you re looking for

4276884
post	get
please use http post instead of http get to send passwords to your website

4276998
public	protected
i understand what public protected private accessors mean in java or php for instance

4277046
folder	directory
pathtofile is correct becuase the variable is used in previous lines to move the video from the resources folder to the documents directory

4277065
webclient	httpwebrequest
while the example uses webclient this blocks on the ui thread when processing the completed thread so you will probably want to consider using httpwebrequest instead if your processing of the returned xml is anything but trivial

4277069
ubuntu	debian
i m looking for a cms running under mono framework this is needed to have it deployed on linux-based ubuntu debian machines

4277074
objectdatasource	detailsview
when issueing the update method using a detailsview with an objectdatasource i get the following error

4277076
easyhook	detours
maybe easyhook or detours

4277158
int	boolean
since php is a loosely typed language and you are using these variables in a boolean context the || they are silently converted to bool - and both are converted to false resulting in a int 1 as result of your expression - which is again silently converted to string 1 since echo is a string context

4277179
put	get
you are assuming that put actually succeeds in putting the data in the cache and that right after the blocking of the call to put that the data you put in is the data you get back with get

4277195
width	margin
one of the solutions is to give the a fixed width so that it can be centered to its parent by margin 0 auto

4277261
hash	salt
if you just want to verify data integrity you can use a salt hash with a secret salt that you store along with the data

4277261
hash	hmac
see for example the hash message authentication code hmac

4277285
width	height
i tried setting customized textview as the indicator of tabspec setting its height and width to different values but no matter what its height and width value is it s always set to the default height and width value

4277291
post	get
here is my implementation and it works for post and get

4277321
post	get
but then you may want to use post instead of get because of the url specifications which are limited in character usage and url length

4277349
x86	64bit
i was trying to run some drivers coded for 32-bit vista x86 on 64bit win7 amd64 and it was not running

4277358
put	get
in short when i get a queue-event onmessage imessage receivedmsg i put the message into an internal queue out of which x threads do their thing

4277369
cvs	svn
cvs and svn can be frustrating even after you get a good hold of the concepts

4277453
serializable	deserialization
also test and measure serializable deserialization may be slower than the normal methods of object creation - note that you d probably be deserializing twice from session to string then string into object of that class

4277453
serializable	deserialization
if you want to go the serializable deserialization route try memcached instead

4277459
put	get
if you want to do it without ajax you can get the values when the user accesses the page and put them in a javascript array

4277548
maven	pom.xml
i have a similar situation with the assembly plugin where if assembly and jarsigner are in the same pom.xml the order is fine but if jarsigner is in the parent pom.xml then the order is bad maven 2.2.1

4277557
hide	show
most of the solution are based on preloading the div the contains the information you want to show against the button click hide the div itself and show it only when the user press the button

4277562
redhat	fedora
the problem at the moment im compiling on ubuntu but my server is running fedora redhat

4277562
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu uses boost 1.42 and linux latest at this very moment is 1.41

4277573
children	parent
so as you can see the problem is that nhib does not update child a composite-id after its parent was saved and the attempt to save children fails

4277746
children	parent
i ve been using a function i made when i first started programming or shortly thereafter at least to do the simple but extremely useful task of organizing an array based on parent and children

4277777
processors	hyperthreading
it s definately not the case that the number of hardware threads is twice the number of cores -- amd processors don t have any sort of hyperthreading yet and hyperthreading may be turned off in the bios as is usually was for pre-nehalem processors as it really didn t buy you very much in practice

4277806
rss	feed
they also have rss feed for each topic

4277807
put	get
if you get gcc 4.6 and build it with -std c++0x you can put it in a union

4277837
post	get
as you can see from the dtd fragment the action attribute is #required as is the method get or post

4277840
children	parent
what i was hoping i could do next is in a single query update the under_post_count fields for all those categories identified and all their parent with the number of distinct posts assigned to each category or any of it s children

4277843
postgresql	mysql
however when i changed the database from mysql to postgresql 8.4 i couldn t handle concurrent access anymore

4277855
google-chrome	firefox
clicked windows web browser google-chrome the other options of course were default ie firefox

4277894
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
whereas i ve got the described behaviour in firefox and google-chrome ie and opera throw always false with the notable exception of the comparing the version which gave me true in ie although he couldn t retrieve the value of the select tag

4277982
google-chrome	firefox
all this works fine in firefox and google-chrome

4277982
post	get
silverlight makes the post http request receives a 302 response and automatically does a get http request of the specified redirect url and returns that to me i know this because i used fiddler to watch the http requests going on

4278020
google-chrome	firefox
anyway in firefox you can look into the error console in the tools menu and in google-chrome you can open the javascript console in the tools menu

4278053
put	get
i have 153 markers and need to generate a static map with them but when put them in the url i get an error like this

4278140
hide	show
for an ajax-call that doesn t use ajaxstart ajaxstop which is what you re using to show hide your spinkner i think theres no information about that in your question just set global false like this

4278229
move	drag
howerver regardless of the user executing a copy action drag with ctrl press the action remains a move

4278265
post	get
you can see from this example serialize works well over the fields to be sent by post or get

4278283
opera	safari
i have few image backgrounds 1650x1050px and they are fading smooth only in safari opera

4278283
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome and ie7 8 you can see frames of fade like taking pictures

4278331
free	malloc
now while the application is active this data is always persistant so i never free the malloc data

4278351
free	malloc
strictly following the c standard you should free everything you ve malloc d before the application terminates

4278403
opera	firefox
good browser + a debugger plugin both firefox and opera will suffice

4278444
bufferedreader	bufferedwriter
my code in cdef class that doesn t inherit raw iobase rather reimplements it s functionality python code gets my object wrapped in bufferedreader bufferedwriter - this one seems to work and less messy than the previous option

4278470
action-filter	onactionexecuting
in action-filter onactionexecuting

4278470
opera	firefox
for example action logoff works well in opera ie but there is a problem in firefox

4278490
cakephp	kohana	codeigniter	cakephp	codeigniter	kohana
i haven t come across an official name for that yet but most mvc frameworks for php kohana cakephp codeigniter fat free and etc. calls that routing

4278495
std	ostream
i m using a third party code which has its own implementation for std ostream operator to handle the third party s type

4278506
firefox	safari
and of course the website should be fully compatible with firefox safari internet explorer etc

4278571
jstl	taglib
in case of a basic jsp servlet webapplication the basic approach would be using jstl fmt taglib in combination with resource bundles

4278571
jstl	taglib
a theoretical alternative would be to supply a bundle with a custom control to load those files as utf-8 but that s unfortunately not supported by the basic jstl fmt taglib

4278624
folder	directory
when i try clean up my folder is marked as ok green circle but if i go to the parent directory and come back the red circle reappears

4278642
serializable	deserialization
however the exception is serializable into a soap fault element and regardless of the type of the exception thrown in the service the exception is converted into a soapexception while deserialization

4278665
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
ie6+ firefox2.0+ and newer safari google-chrome and opera

4278671
x86	64bit
this was because i had got it from program files but being a 64bit machine the wizard got it from program files x86 and now it works

4278722
google-chrome	firefox
after googling a lot i have tried various ways to get innnerhtml of an iframe but none is working at least in google-chrome 7.0 and neither in firefox 3.6

4278722
google-chrome	firefox
can someone please help as to what is the right way to get innerhtml of iframe which works in most browsers like firefox 3.0+ and ie6.0+ and google-chrome

4278749
queue	fifo
it revolves around a fifo queue data structure which stores pending urls

4278779
easyhook	detours
i am trying to do some hooking in c# i d rather not use detours or c++ so i have been using easyhook

4278792
getter	setter
the first disadvantage of this approach is that it makes my domain model anemic - the majority of methods are just getter and setter and most of the business logic is in the service layer

4278821
google-chrome	firefox
they work fine in full ie as well as firefox and google-chrome so the items correctly hide but they never hide when viewed through the wpf webbrowser control

4278830
jstl	taglib
use the following with a little help of jstl functions taglib

4278875
int	chars
the only part of this that some people find counterintuitive is that ch must be defined as an int not a chars for the code to work correctly

4278882
integer	fractions	multiplying	subtract
for the fractions part repeatedly multiplying by ten and subtract off the integer parts to form the decimal string

4278889
disk	ram
i do not want to create any files on disk whatsoever all must be in ram

4278914
gif	png
so try put yours data into to gif png etc

4278922
lisp	smalltalk
but i d like to have a more interactive way to employ a testing - fixing - compiling cycle repl like in lisp or smalltalk where one can immediately execute code in interactive mode

4278969
put	get
each time i call it 48 times per second so i want to put it into some thread and limit its output capabilities but i need to get notified when that thread will try to output some message which is important for me

4278982
apache	nginx
as far as i m aware the webserver apache nginx provides the based on the claimed location of the requesting user agent

4279048
onfocus	onblur
i know i can listen for window.onblur and window.onfocus but i m trying to figure out how to address users that open link in background tab window and the code starts running without either the onblur or onfocus events being called

4279052
subclass	accessor
basically a subclass could choose to override your accessor and then you d be sending a message to a subclass object that is not yet initialised

4279069
matplotlib	mplot3d
as for 3d - you could try matplotlib s mlab or mplot3d

4279108
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
what really matter is that selecting the same words of the same document must give the same result on google-chrome safari ie firefox

4279135
ready	each
i wrote this to avoid having to watch images load on the page i rather the page loaded then when each image is ready they fade in nicely

4279143
innodb	myisam
i have innodb myisam and memory tables mixed

4279213
fadein	hide
or hide them but do a fadein on the complete ones immediately

4279239
onfocus	onblur
you can only notice when it get or lost focus using onfocus and onblur as you said

4279319
opera	google-chrome
i m primarily interested in a solution that works with firebug but if there s something for the dev tools of google-chrome or opera i d like to hear about it as well

4279340
width	height
image width image height colour depth bits per byte

4279340
multiplying	add
multiplying this by the number of simultaneous users running the script and add the overhead of all your other php stuff and you ll find you re probably using a lot of memory

4279377
int	chars
string find returns a large positive int to indicate invalid positions the size_type is unsigned so you will always enter the loop unless a match is found starting at chars position 0 in which case you probably do want to enter the loop

4279404
spaces	delimiter
i was surprised git show-ref uses spaces as field delimiter while git ls-remote uses tabs for the same kind of output.

4279428
gridview	repeater	gridview	formview
formview gridview repeater etc.etc. and then bind your data to that control

4279499
required	placeholder
where the addfield function has a format where you can name the field define the label shown to the user which initially will be portuguese but we would like to be multilingual in the future and the type of input element and options for that input element such as required true or placeholder cereal waffles toast etc.

4279503
nsstream	nsoutputstream	abstract-class	superclass
most of this is in the abstract-class nsstream which is the superclass of both nsinputstream and nsoutputstream

4279507
public	protected
final might make a difference for protected public class fields

4279516
chipmunk	pymunk
i took rabbyt as an opengl wrapper for rendering my sprites and using pymunk chipmunk for my physics

4279532
width	height
saving the x y width and height of the window when you close it and loading the data when you open the window

4279536
client-side	server-side
if you are a beginner then i would recommend learning more and more client-side and server-side in order to know what to debug

4279537
installation	upgrade
a cloud-based relational database sql azure with the azure platform is similar to a regular relational database such as sql server except that you don t have to worry about licenses installation hardware upgrade customizations disk allocations where to store your transaction logs etc

4279543
post	get
currently i m able to get the number of post in a category with the following query

4279543
post	get
and i can get the number of views for each post with the following query

4279546
sqldatasource	detailsview
one way to do this is to use a datasource control such as a sqldatasource and use it in conjunction with a data control that will bind to the previous datasource control like a detailsview

4279554
postgresql	mysql
postgresql timestamp is not unix timestamp and mysql s unix timestamp is not postgresql s or oracles timestamp

4279554
subtraction	addition
you can do addition subtraction all with php date objects

4279563
vb.net	vb6
since you re familiar with vb6 i would suggest you to consider asp.net mvc using vb.net as a programming language

4279591
int	chars
i am trying to get the int equivalent of these chars s that are in the buffer to compare

4279622
typedef	struct
typedef struct citizen

4279631
sorting	filtering
baiscally the map contains multiple-rows from a table and all the rows are added to the array list now i need to display them in a swing application in the form of a table and perform sorting and filtering on them

4279633
min	max
define r as a rectilinear region from x min y min to x max y max

4279633
width	height
the paper uses 21 as a heuristic meaning divide the height and width by 20

4279658
stdout	stderr
if you reassign with stderr stdout you get a warning while stderr.reopen nul w goes without saying

4279667
width	height
function newpopup url popupwindow window.open url popupwindow height 700 width 1200 left 1 top 1 resizable no scrollbars no toolbar no menubar no location no directories no status yes

int	chars
if you just want to convert single chars to int you can use c - 0 which is equivalent to c - 48

4279725
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that while firefox and explorer call as i want google-chrome makes a call to

4279762
google-chrome	firefox
in my opinion google-chrome is behaving correctly and ie firefox are not

4279830
public	protected
with protected you can redefine the functioning of a class by overriding it without making this method part of the public interface

4279830
public	protected
another thing - protected methods are common methods that can be reused by subclasses but again don t need to be part of the public interface

4279857
superclass	subclassing
the most frequent use i see is actually to let a superclass use a subclassing s internals

4279857
superclass	subclassing
if you want your superclass to access the logic of a subclassing but don t want it to be publicly exposed you have no choice but the protected modifier

4279882
width	height
yes you can specify the width and the height of your images

4279939
int	boolean
for regular list items you may just return false for the boolean isenabled int position method

4279947
udp	tcp
since you re using udp you re not really going to get a stream because udp is not a stream-oriented protocol like tcp

4279984
ravendb	couchdb
i m trying to see if a specific algorithm can be translated to the kind of map-reduce index ravendb couchdb uses ie pre-computed map-reduce which means the indexes are refreshed on insertion and updates not when performing the actual query

4279989
webclient	webrequest
update i have changed my code to use webclient class instead of webrequest upon suggestion

4280002
webclient	webrequest
by the way you should use the webclient class instead of webrequest

4280069
post	get
i get the general impression that the switch from the 1.1 template to the 2.0 template in xcode has caused some confusion for everyone so as a result there isn t much helpful on 2.0 if there is anything really good and informative out there like 71squared s videos on the 1.1 template except for 2.0 your welcome to post a link to it

4280091
width	height
you can t inspect the width height of the graphics object

4280092
width	height
since the phone s resolution is at max pixel count 960x640 you can scale your image down maintaining aspect ratio so that width and height never go below the upper bounds on the 960 or 640 size so your image would be 1333x1333 scaled down which now reduces your memory footprint from 16 mb per image down to just over 7.1 mb per image

4280099
ostringstream	std
it would on flush data check some thread-local variable to see if the data came from the thread that calls the library then route it somewhere else into a std string std ostringstream instead of to the regular cout cerr streambufs

4280099
stdout	stderr
if it s using c s stdout stderr i think it d be harder to do properly but it might be doable still

4280133
post	get
my application would then post this data in order to simulate a login get the returned authentication cookie and be able to work on their site as if logged in

4280133
submit	submission
with example 1 submission the login form is a simple case of posting uname something passwd somethingelse to login.php however in asp.net because all inputs are wrapped in a global to submit the login inputs you have to submit the global form and therefore all the inputs

4280151
hide	show
when form inside guest_details section is submitted then hide the section guest_details and show first_start section

4280239
centos	linux
i don t know if centos has a recent enough version of the linux kernel for this to work though

4280245
int	chars
there is nothing built in to the standard library to turn a chars into an int

4280245
int	chars
this is because most int s don t fit in a chars

4280245
strtol	atoi
you can easily use these by copying each char into a the first element of length 2 array with the second char 0 and using this as input to either atoi sscanf or strtol

4280245
int	chars
best yet would be to change the interface so that your routine doesn t receive an array of chars but an array of int

4280256
innodb	myisam
decide whether you want your table engine search be innodb or myisam

4280302
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in modern browsers firefox google-chrome safari javascript create canvas element to create the font text

4280349
int	boolean
and even if it worked sequentially the first set would return a boolean which won t work against the int that follows

4280353
int	boolean
a b evaluates into a boolean so int int int would evaluate into int boolean and you cannot compare and int and a boolean

4280359
folder	directory
the problem is the .svn folder appears to have been accidentally deleted from users jack mysite.co.uk images png as such triggering the error svn users jack sites mysite.co.uk images png is not a working copy directory .

4280365
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
in my appdelegate i create a uitabbarcontroller and uinavigationcontroller dynamically

4280430
public	protected
the fact that languages exist which do not have a protected access modifier and even languages that do not have access modifiers at all where all methods are public and those languages are generally considered to be some of the most pure oo languages shows that you do in fact not really need a protected access modifier

4280482
getter	setter
in my humble opinion having getter and setter methods is indicative of poor object-oriented design

4280508
put	get
but as you can see microsoft yet again are being incosiderate a oles in their role of service providers to bother explaining a little more or at least put link somewhere people are worring and get white hairs

4280512
dictionary	map
by map here i mean a programming map with keys and values like map in the stl or dictionary in python

4280512
children	parent
and 2 children each adding an element to the parent map

4280522
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
html link with padding and css style active does not work in google-chrome apple safari opera mozilla firefox

4280547
post	get
when listing post by tag in post-date order you need only get a handful of groups

4280555
google-chrome	firefox
to browsers firefox google-chrome etc a valid mouse click is one which is pressed and released on same element

4280600
minimum	max
the consecutive numbers must be from minimum length of 3 and a max of 5 numbers

4280612
inherited	properties
the only way for a value of a properties there to be assigned to an element inside is if that element has the rule whatever-property-it-is inherited which is buggy in older versions of ie

4280659
for-loop	arrays
is there a way to make this code cleaner by listing the names of the variables in a string arrays and perform the function with a for-loop

4280666
width	height
setting the width and height to 100 might solve your problem but it s difficult to guess

4280671
move	drag
select oldpath folder r-click drag and svn move to new location

4280796
mouseup	mousedown
the real problem here is that a click event only seems to fire if the mousedown event target matches the mouseup event target

4280796
mouseup	mousedown
with hover the text node moves away before you click so the mousedown event target is the anchor tag and the mouseup event is also the anchor tag so the link is followed

4280826
xml-rpc	json-rpc
try xml-rpc or json-rpc

4280851
width	margin
do not put any margin in between them and no border all having same width

4280885
openssl	m2crypto
importing m2crypto version 0.20.2 on python 2.6.5 fails when m2crypto was compiled against a recent openssl versions 0.9.8x or higher on mac os x 10.4.11

4280885
openssl	m2crypto
even though the compilation works against these openssl version m2crypto fails to import because a missing symbol _pem_read_bio_ec_pubkey

4280885
openssl	m2crypto
if i compile m2crypto against openssl version 0.9.7l or 0.9.7m it works just fine

4280927
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
i am loooking to know how to use a symbol table and add subtract multiplying divide and mod a list of elements and declare variables

4280932
onchange	keyup
example form has textbox intended to put an email address into it and onchange keyup events are attached to it

4280932
google-chrome	firefox
when user starts typing an email address if google-chrome or firefox autocomplete box pops up and user clicks one of the options the box gets filled with the value focus stays within the textbox so no change event firing and no key was pressed no keyup event

4280950
minimum	max
and your subset constraint consecutive numbers sets must be from minimum length of 3 and a max of 5 numbers

4280961
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
using the mentioned javascript extensions plugins the big sized table poses no threat to the google-chrome browser taking a few seconds to load however opera firefox and internet explorer have a hard time running the function or end up asking for user interaction to stop the script from running

4280988
int	double	int	chars
for my projects i usually define a lot of aliases for types like unsigned int chars and double as well as std string and others

4281016
uiview	subviews
once the uiview instance is released it wil also send a release message to all its subviews which includes the scrollview

4281022
gridview	sqldatasource
2 textboxes 1 button search 1 gridview 1 sqldatasource

4281022
gridview	sqldatasource
gridview should be hooked up to sqldatasource which in turn should take 2 parameters textbox values

4281050
addclass	removeclass
in the second loop you ll do the same logic you ve got although i d use addclass and removeclass referring back to the saved key row for each cell

4281082
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome

4281085
scheme	racket
i ve been working on learning racket scheme for a while

4281100
awt	swing
this probably won t work in new versions of the jdk that allow awt and swing components to be mixed

4281111
opera	google-chrome
of course i d have to implement the same for opera and google-chrome then assuming there are similar services for them instead of just reusing the user script

4281118
google-chrome	firefox
tested in google-chrome 8 firefox 3.6 and ie 9

4281149
udp	tcp
i m sending messages via tcp and udp from clients to the server while the server written in c++

4281163
scheme	racket
i ve been working on learning racket scheme for a while

4281164
udp	tcp
you want to send information via tcp or udp that includes sensitive information email address password and ip

4281164
udp	tcp
instead you should avoid udp because it is very hard to do crypto properly over udp and simply use ssl over tcp

4281186
folder	directory
you cannot open and read a directory use the isfile and isdirectory methods to distinguish between files and folder

4281192
post	get
i suggest you follow the tutorial at in a brand new project and try to get that working if you cannot you can post the specific errors and issues you re running into

4281226
yslow	pagespeed
analyze your page using pagespeed or yslow for more information

4281230
children	parent
when i create a new parent transient object and add new children and trying updated evict merge then logs show me this after flush hibernate session

4281230
children	parent
order is good but children doesn t have parent id in insert

4281230
children	parent
everything works fine when parent is persisted in database then children always have a good id

4281230
persistent	transient
any ideas what should i do to get id from transient object from persistent is ok

4281248
children	parent
as long as elements are part of the page flow a parent can t be in front of it s children

4281249
width	height
i m looking to tell the image to have a max height but fill out the width

4281289
codeigniter	cakephp
im just moving over to cakephp from codeigniter and i bet its right in front of me but i can for the love of god not figure out through the manual nor search the internet how to access relationship data

4281371
sorting	grouping
...but it didn t work because after grouping by week they re grouping by week but within the week they re no longer ordered. so you correctly added a sorting grouping thus

4281384
serializable	deserialization
serializable deserialization process

4281394
single-quotes	double-quotes
i find it interesting that the as.formula conversion made the single-quotes around the letters into double-quotes

4281472
uiview	subviews
add an iboutlet propertyfor your custom uiview to the uiviewcontroller and additional outlets for any subviews you wish to access

4281478
hide	show
create a div and show hide it with the message

4281489
queue	fifo
i understand that it s a problem when one of the rx queue runs over hw fifo sw buffer

4281507
public	protected
an interface is used to describe the public contract of your api so it s very strange that you want a a private setter and b a protected implementation

4281507
getter	setter
the private setter at the interface level does not make any sense see mark heaths answer if you want a property with only a getter on the interface

4281507
public	protected
the protected implementation is also weird since by implementing the interface the property is public anyway

4281542
width	height
if you are using em s or ex s as font size units then since it is a value based on height you can assume using a certain ratio that it is almost near the equivalent of a character s width

4281568
vb6	vba
i m not necessarily a c++ programmer but have primarily used win32 functions in the past in vba vb6 and most recently c# projects

4281583
put	get
i m newbie in emacs...i ve a few days and i think emacs is awesome but i get a error when i try install auto-complete...i install it from the installation works i use the makefile ...but when i put this lines inside my emacs.d

4281607
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
if you really need a sortedset you can also implement the inotifycollectionchanged and inotifypropertychanged interfaces yourself

4281636
put	get
so you have to decide how much effort to put into tracking these changes and how much benefit you will get

4281652
post	get
the action link isn t going to trigger a http post nor will it pass in the values of your form fields just a http get and not passing through any form data - ideally you d use an input submit button to post the data

4281683
caliburn.micro	mef
i m using read learning caliburn.micro and trying to update the template project from mef to windsor which is where i ve come across the issue

4281686
google-chrome	firefox
this works neatly on my google-chrome but you will run into a couple of cross-browser issues for ie and firefox 2

4281738
nsobject	ivar
nsobject has one ivar the isa pointer

4281738
ivar	subclassing	nsobject	ivar	superclass	subclassing
so any subclassing of uiviewcontroller will take up as much memory as is needed to store all those ivars and all ivars of its superclass uiresponder no ivars and nsobject one ivar

4281754
geocoding	geocode
now what i want here is to geocode the ip address of the user and get the latitude and longitude automatically after geocoding the ip and save it to the database

4281871
aggregate-functions	sum
i don t see any aggregate-functions count sum avg etc being used in the query you posted

4281874
spweb	spsite
spsite spweb objects would be disposed of at the population stage using statements work well

4281912
for-loop	loops
the second clause in the for-loop in your case is a conditional that is evaluated prior to each entry of loops body

4281926
postgresql	mysql
in my mind this is a generic term which would include any sort of database including relational databases such as mysql oracle postgresql sql server etc hierarchical databases such as ims network example idms object-oriented nosql and others

4281926
postgresql	mysql
examples would be oracle mysql sql server postgresql

4281931

i succesfully managed to get it in firefox google-chrome opera and even ie6 but fail on ie7 haven t tried ie8+ yet

4281935
width	height
iâ m also thinking of connecting cell height and width with my drawobject size too

4281942
inherited	properties
when you use the shorthand font properties and you leave off some of the values those values aren t inherited they are reset to their initial value

4281960
post	get
when you have posted the request the browser will get a response from the server and then the post is done

4281974
post	get
this was all working fine i can add get any type of post or comment and add get any type of location via one of these two repositories

4281990
ready	each
also it probably doesn t help that you ve nested two document ready handlers within each other

4281994
google-chrome	safari
thinking jquery because user might be in ie safari google-chrome or fox

4282074
fadein	fadeout
i use jquery to fadein and fadeout on mouseover

4282078
put	get
i usually put 3rd party jars in the lib folder at the root of your project folder same level as src assets etc and they seem to get picked up when building the apk

4282165
hide	show
i want to show the first 9 so therefore hide from 10 - 100

4282165
hide	show
my next request to have in mind is obviously to hide 1-9 show 10-18 hide 19-100

4282182
vb.net	vb6
vb6 has been obsolete for quite some time now and superseded by vb.net

4282207
hash	md5
in my project i have a user table where password is md5 hash and stored as binary 16

4282209
vb.net	vb6
in addition to the syntax vb.net and vb6 share the idea of canned programming where the developer just combines existing building blocks to create small applications very easily

4282224
put	get
when i put a file over any area where there s not text i get a no cursor and the drop event does not get triggered

4282237
google-chrome	firefox
if fill in the form in google-chrome or firefox then it sent following request

4282252
vb.net	vb6
vb6 has since been superseded by vb.net

folder	directory
the problem is that javah generates the header file on the directory that the command was executaded which you specified the bin folder

4282300
cpu	hyperthreading
the windows cpu scheduler as of windows xp is supposed to be able to distinguish hyperthreading virtual cores from real cores

4282300
cpu	hyperthreading
hyperthreading was a good idea when were with single cpu systems but is now just a complication that can hurt performance in this multi-core world

4282300
cpu	hyperthreading
instead of completely disabling hyperthreading you can use programs like process lasso free to set default cpu affinities for critical processes so that their threads never get allocated to virtual cpus

4282314
portrait	landscape
when i run that application at the first time in portrait orientation of iphone simulator the custom alert view orientation is landscape but when i rotate the device into landscape left the custom alert view orientation is landscape

4282335
drawimage	putimagedata	drawimage	todataurl	putimagedata	todataurl
in firefox 3.6.8 i was able to workaround the slowness of putimagedata by using todataurl drawimage instead

4282348
drawimage	todataurl
instead i got it to work well using todataurl drawimage instead

4282359
portrait	landscape
in portrait mode instead of using the popover i have another table view thatâ s connected to the same controller that has the info for the view that appears in landscape

4282394
post	get
then you just pass the specification to your post repository and get back the result

4282403
gif	png
you can try to reduce inter-pixel noise to produce larger areas of the same color which will compress in gif png images very nicely

4282403
gif	png
saving a gif png is a lightweight operation

4282441
post	get
you might what to try some workaround use javascript to parse document.cookie and inject session cookie into flash with flashvars then send the session cookie via post get

4282475
awt	swing
swing programs should override paintcomponent instead of overriding paint . â painting in awt and swing the paint methods

i m trying to build a custom dropdownlist wich show hide a second set of dropdowns based on it s selection

4282608
key-value-coding	kvc
key-value-coding kvc means accessing a property or value using a string

4282634
noexcept	throw
and for reasons of optimization opportunities nothrow-specifications are not deprecated in the upcoming standard they just don t look like throw any more but are called noexcept

4282643
ssl	https
the client can not be relied up to have a certificate to allow bilateral ssl authentication however unilateral authentication where the client checks to see he is hitting the correct server is possible so https connections can be established

4282643
cas	openam	cas	shibboleth	shibboleth	openam
research has been carried out on sso + saml implementation openam shibboleth cas all seem to provide a too complete solution which caters more for a portal type architecture like cas or from a system where the initial saml identity token is received from another sever altogether and then brought to the system like googles implementation of saml for some of its services

4282651
for-loop	arrays
release it after the for-loop that goes through that arrays where you currently have the second

4282652
button	checkbox
all i wanna do is replace that link button with checkbox

4282688
portrait	landscape
on an iphone a portrait advertisement is 320 x 50 points and 480 x 32 points for a landscape advertisement

4282688
portrait	landscape
on an ipad a portrait advertisement is 768 x 66 points and 1024 x 66 points for a landscape advertisement

jar	manifest.mf
use the class-path attribute of the manifest.mf in the ejb and web archives to refer to these jar files

4282732
atomic	compare-and-swap
and then of course for some purposes there are lock-free algorithms or data-structures which make do with just a few atomic instructions such as compare-and-swap but this isn t really a general-purpose replacement for locks

4282739
folder	directory
i navigate to the directory with the shell and it shows the empty folder also it doesnt strip away the clsid

4282741
post	get
i would bind post to the location at creation time so that for each location i can get through a repository a list of associated post

4282745
hide	show
it goes into this show hide cycle because the mouse is entering leaving

4282843
pthreads	fork	stdout	stderr
i have this program that fork and creates three pthreads pipes for the child s stdin stdout stderr

4282843
stdout	stderr
after forking the child and parent closes the appropriate ends of their respective pipes such that the child can only read from the stdin pipe and only write to the stdout and stderr pipes and the opposite is true of the parent

4282843
stdout	stderr
next the child process closes and dups the child s stdin stdout and stderr to its open pipe ends and then uses execvp to execute the program whose name was passed in as the parent s program arguments

4282860
inherited	subclassing
extensionmethods let you define set of methods to a class without subclassing another benefit over inherited

4282868
cstdio	iostream
if you re using c and or the cstdio system from c++ instead of iostream you should use sscanf

4282913
httphandler	httpcontext
the httphandler responses by its processrequest httpcontext context method in which you can modify the parameter context to tell what do you want to send back as an response

4282913
serializable	deserialization
so you need systematized serializable deserialization standards for example you serializable your array of person object into json strings and write it to the reponse and you deserialize them back at client side using some json utils

4282952
tax	shipping
if you are sending stuff there are a lot more considerations than just shipping costs you may need to fill in specific tax forms for some countries and depending on what your site is selling you may need special processing for some countries try sending coffee to thailand -- you need to obtain permission from thier ministry of agriculture

4282963
children	parent
you will also want to create an index on the parent column so that you can quickly do a reverse lookup find all children of a given user

4282991
unix	aix
i would like to create tables from some csv files in unix aix and send them as mail message body

4283040
superclass	subclassing
you have overridden mark this with override the function gl10 gl boolean useglutils boolean usemipmap method in the subclassing so each time this method is called on an instance of class b the overriding method will be invoked instead of the one in the superclass

4283042
vbscript	jscript
write wmi script in jscript or vbscript on your choice

4283056
superclass	subclassing

maven	pom.xml
i have a scala project based on the a simple scala project 1.2 archetype that i ve imported into netbeans 6.9.1 as a maven project wtih existing pom.xml

4283237
udp	tcp
netcat is the tool usually used to do this but it can also be done with the dev tcp and dev udp special pathnames

4283258
post	get
troff s output is an intermediate form all its own which you need to pass through a post processor to get to the target output format

4283282
hash	md5
now if you want to encrypt decrypt easily look into using md5 hash

4283372
cvs	svn
since i started using tortoise svn i don t see it s icons on files and folders and also if i left click on them i don t see svn in context menu still see cvs

4283377
getter	setter
as we know scala generates getter and setter automatically for any public field and make the actual field variable private

4283381
cvs	svn
svn and cvs are both version control systems but are pretty apart and don t mix

4283381
cvs	svn
if you had a connection to a cvs it is not normal to show anything while using svn as is totally another system

4283407
actionscript	mxml
first if you are going to set the dataprovider from actionscript i would remove the binding from the mxml or you could just update the property that is bound but i do not know it s type so i will assume you have no problem removing the binding from the mxml tag

4283495
wicket	stripes	tapestry	wicket	tapestry	struts	tapestry	stripes	struts	wicket	struts	stripes	jsf	wicket	jsf	tapestry	jsf	stripes

neither get or post will hide your database name

4283577
getter	setter
scala allows you to define your own setter and getter if you need more than the trivial versions

4283581

it took me a bit of fiddling to get it to work renaming targetname seemed sensible as i wanted it to apply to several text boxes but i had tried that when i put it in the grid.triggers section

4288959
sdl	xlib
looks like you are confusing window manager sdl and xlib with rendering library opengl

4288959
sdl	xlib	glut	sdl
just pick a window manager sdl glut or xlib if you like a challenge activate double buffer mode and make sure that you got direct rendering

4289008
inherited	properties
i think you can pass an instance of your settings object from one dll into another dll say at app startup and then access the setting using the item properties of this class setting classes are class inherited from applicationsettingsbase

4289024
quicksort	heapsort
as we know the quicksort performance is o n log n in average but the merge- and heapsort performance is o n log n in average too

4289157
querypath	phpquery
the simplest possible api is querypath or phpquery

4289160
width	height
i tried experimenting with width and height and position and overflow values but couldn t make it work

4289163
castle	common.logging
i would like to use common.logging to remove dependencies on a specific logging framework but i m not sure how to wire up the ilog interface using the castle castle ioc container

4289164
int	chars
my problem with this design is that value column in item_attributes table needs to use varchar data type since the value s data can be int chars varchar

4289164
int	chars
then i would add 3 more columns to item_attributes table int chars varchar

4289164
int	chars
itemid | attributeid | value | int | chars | varchar

4289173
post	get
if i understand the question correctly the only way to get to render the welcome template is via post

4289180
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
and now it looks good in ie6 and 7 also but the funny thing is that the line-height didn t change in google-chrome or firefox or opera or safari

4289196
width	height
my solutions was to use javascript code to get width and height of the page offsetheight and offsetwidth

4289209
mouseup	mousedown
first what it does correctly is fire mouse move observers starting from a mousedown and ending with a mouseup

4289209
mouseup	mousedown	titlebar	window
the particular test observer i have just puts the proper mousedown + mouseup coordinates in the titlebar of the window see code + xaml below

4289209
mousemove	mousedown
now if i release the mousebutton the mousemove event observers start up again and continue until i either generate a new mousedown or press and release alt again

4289209
keydown	keyup
or separate event streams for the keydown and keyup events and i ll figure out the interleaving in my code

4289225
post	get
as a response on a post or get request you get back what the server will send you

4289230
onstart	ondestroy
i ve got 2 buttons which call onstart and ondestroy on a service

4289251
entity-relationship	diagram
some people call data models entity-relationship diagram which is what you appear to be doing

4289251
entity-relationship	diagram	entity-relationship	entities
the entity relation diagram is a schematic of the entities and relations only that s why it is called an entity-relationship diagram and not a data model

4289271
implements	extends
turns out the trick is to extends layoutpanel and implements the acceptsonewidget interface

4289279
fadein	fadeout
at the moment it wont because the fadein wont start until the fadeout has finished

4289315
mouseup	mousedown
i have a little wpf app that draws some dots in a canvas and then tracks mouse moves after a mousedown happens inside any dot until a mouseup on the canvas

4289322
min	max
i m using a wpf slider control i m guessing the silverlight version is similar that s set to horizontal and has a min value of 0 and a max value of 5

4289336
allocator	stl
i ran your code in vs 2010 and i believe that the allocator you see are only visual studio stl debugging facilities as all the 8 bytes allocator are issued from _string_val constructor

4289348
spaces	delimiter
if you only want numbers delimiter by word boundaries spaces period comma you can use b

4289454
public	protected
when a class b inherits extends from class a an instance of class b inherits all the functionality from class a and has access to protected and of course public methods and attributes via parent

4289454
inherited	properties
inherited is often used when classes share certain properties

4289454
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
for example i can have a class person that holds information such as name and subclassing customer partner that inherited the properties name but add some custom functionality

4289463
children	parent
killing the parent process leaves the children alive so the whole process group should be killed

4289489
disk	ram
python s memory limits are determined by how much physical ram and virtual memory disk space your computer and operating system have available

4289503
free	malloc
that s not a problem on macos and linux because the malloc free system is multi-threaded

4289503
free	malloc
my concern is that the malloc free system in 3.4.5 is not multi-threaded

4289505
factors	mean
do some quick stats possibly by compressing lots of images with different jpeg compression factors to find out what the mean compressed size and its standard deviation is for a given quality level

4289512
sproutcore	cappuccino
sproutcore has a better data store api than the one cappuccino has

4289512
sproutcore	cappuccino
sproutcore makes use of bindings better than cappuccino currently does

4289512
sproutcore	cappuccino
for example in sproutcore you can implement incremental loading with bindings and arraycontroller very easily where on the other hand in cappuccino its not as straightforward

4289512
sproutcore	cappuccino
i have found more real world applications written on cappuccino than on sproutcore

4289512
sproutcore	cappuccino
despite the fact that i have no experience in objective-c and i much prefer the pure js syntax i will probably go with cappuccino on my current project and hope sproutcore comes out with a better table view in the future

4289525
int	chars
this converts each pair of hex chars into its int representation

4289539
margin	text-align
remove the absolute positioning add text-align center to the div add a top margin to the span to center it vertically

4289617
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
but then i need to call so it makes sense to call this in the viewdidappear or viewwillappear method

4289617
put	get
but i put it in those methods and find out also via nslog that they never get called

4289622
hash	salt
using salt hash vs reversible encyrption presents its own challenges in implementation but you can be assured that stealing the password list is of little value if properly implemented with a strong algorithm multiple rounds min password standards and random per record salt

4289623
put	get
if i put an onmouseevent on #mapbox it triggers it but i can t get it to work for the #tile divs

4289641
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have noticed behavior where if a parent controller like uinavigationcontroller or uitabbarcontroller never get s viewwill didappear called on it it won t call it on the child controllers either

4289641
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
so make sure that in the code where you create the parent controller you call viewwillappear show it then call viewdidappear

4289673
folder	directory
they compile and run fine but however i find that each has its own folder in the war directory after compilation

4289688
hide	show
i ve created a baseactivity there is a member dialog activity context as member and two methods to show and to hide progess dialog

4289857
postgresql	mysql
usually you do this kind of thing in a query but mysql isn t very good with intervals it would be very easy with postgresql

4289879
post	get
i need to while in the artists sample post be able to get from wp the category

4289883
int	boolean
the method in question doesn t really play nicely with our expectations and fails the pols principle of least surprise because you can reasonably expect a boolean value being returned and get an int or a nil

4289901
many-to-many	one-to-many
some of these relationships will be one-to-one service to provider but most will be one-to-many or many-to-many multiple contacts at a company would have the same address

4289939
stringbuilder	stringwriter
i ve also tried calling inplacerenderview to try to get it to write to a stringwriter and the stringwriter also seems to get nothing back - the stringbuilder that returns is also empty

4289968
firefox	safari
there are no http html css or js errors reported by the browser and yet no vml is generated in ie 8 firefox 3.6 or safari 5

4289998
pecl	pear
to install a pear pecl package that is in a state other than stable you have to specify the full spec for the package

4290032
subtract	add
neither add nor subtract nor divison nor multiplication

4290046
google-chrome	firefox
the following needs to remove url portion of string previously returned from .css background-image on an element object in the dom which works perfectly well in firefox but not in google-chrome

4290046
google-chrome	firefox
i discovered this was because google-chrome removes the from url picture.jpg however removing from the regular expression causes firefox to then break because firefox replaced with but still understands the regular expression

4290086
width	height
or i want to change the contents in the table and also change the height and width of the table inside form

4290102
int	double
int xgeom sqlite3_rtree_geometry int ncoord double acoord int pres

4290195
punctuation	words
if it s only words without punctuation you can use a bit of regex magic

4290208
put	get
to put this all together you could have javascript upload the file within an iframe and get the result

4290212
post	get
here the get view model is a subset of the post view model so using one view model is fine but if the data for the get and the data for the post differed greatly you could use two different view models such as

4290261
folder	directory
additionally you will probably want to set up library directory to include mysql s lib folder as well so that later on your builds can find the mysql libraries to link against

4290275
yacc	bison
c++ is not parsable using a lalr 1 parser such as the parsers generated by bison and yacc but it is by all means parsable after all people use parsers which have no problem parsing c++ every day

4290277
implements	extends
this example implements actionlistener to extends abstractaction

4290307
mouse	keyboard
i m trying to get a user interface to work and i need to have it scroll one way if they are using the mouse wheel and another way if they are using the scrollbar and another way if they are using a keyboard

4290347
mvp	presenter
mvp is the model view presenter pattern

4290375
x86	64bit
note that on a 64bit install you should look in program files x86

4290378
subtraction	addition
for example you can overload the addition and subtraction operators from within your something class like this

4290398
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome hence i assume safari too fires only mouse down events

4290413
put	get
type in your e-mail get the encoded version put it in your site and it will display your proper e-mail and bots won t be able to grab it as its just code although it echos out the real result

4290421
for-loop	loops
for this case you may want to use while loops instead of for-loop in python

4290439
yacc	bison
i don t know about vs2010 but i ve used this win32 port of lex yacc flex bison on vs2005 without problems wstreett lex-yacc lex-yacc.html

4290486
put	get
i put this together relatively quickly but hopefully you ll get the idea

4290507
erlang	ocaml	erlang	scheme	haskell	ocaml	haskell	scheme	ocaml	scheme
you ll find beautiful concepts and new ways to program in scheme haskell ocaml clojure erlang etc.

4290534
google-chrome	firefox
this code can be draggable on firefox but cant on google-chrome

4290553
gnupg	gpgme
i recently used ruby s gpgme module to do some pretty cool stuff with gnupg

4290604
128bit	64bit
you can configure the processor to connect to either a 64bit or 128bit axi interconnect that provides flexibility to system designs

4290650

4290798
macports	homebrew
i would strongly recommend you try homebrew which is a great replacement for macports

4290843
int	double
yes you can store a 32-bit int number in a double 64-bit floating-point number without precision loss

4290843
int	double
these errors will likely be small enough so that they get rounded away when you cast your double value back to int mdash

4290843
floating-point	integer
how it s done see this document ieee standard 754 floating point numbers by steve hollasch for details on how an integer can be stored as a floating-point value

4290843
floating-point	fractions
to summarise somewhat inaccurately a floating-point value consists of three parts a sign bit a fractions part called the mantissa and an exponent part

4290843
int	double
you can store the int value in the fractions part of the double which is 52 bits wide which is more than wide enough for a 32-bit int

4290844
google-chrome	firefox
this code word-wrap in firefox but in google-chrome i cant word-wrap

4290849
gridview	checkboxlist
i have a gridview which i have a list bound to - i want to be able to allow filter of the data based on multiple checkboxlist

4290856
outputstream	inputstream
try getting first the outputstream and then the inputstream

4290922
int	double
as long as your int value fits in 52 bits of a fractions part called mantissa see all calculations on int values using double will behave completely ok

4290922
int	double
back to int encoded in double - even division operation is precise as long as the result is int value

4290940
for-loop	loops
the problem is that you are doing fopen inside the for-loop so every time loops runs your file gets re-written

4290978
touchesmoved	touchesended
i am using a timer to check that a user is tapping and holding and invalidating the timer in the touchesmoved and touchesended events

4291048
int	chars
as i understand gcc maintains that chars will be byte-aligned and int 4-byte-aligned in a 32-bit environment

4291055
super	implements
in super trivial un-grouped result sets you could theoretically use an index for having but i ve never seen a query optimizer actually implements in this way

4291127
post	get
login.php takes get or post parameters username and password and return true if login successful and false otherwise

4291292
typedef	struct
note that unreal and still need to be in the file that includes your main function not in the header file which should contain only the struct definition and optionally the typedef if you plan to use that in other modules

4291297
post	get
if you can do the request with a get instead of a post you can use jsonp

4291315
getter	setter
create all the object that i need with all getter and setter

4291328
unix	bsd
strings.h comes from the bsd branch in the unix evolution

4291502
for-loop	loops
the for-loop loops over an iterable

4291511
viewdidload	viewwillappear
however one small note the first view controller from tabbar still will be loaded although for a very short time so its viewdidload and viewwillappear will be called after startup

4291528
google-chrome	firefox
that means i can install addons firefox google-chrome and run exes on the machine

4291588
struts	stripes
its not a standard practice or valid as per the j2ee spec i know using most of the java web development frameworks like struts spring mvc stripes you can do this

4291632
getter	setter
in the modelviewinterface i only have the getter methods no setter methods and my model implements this interface

4291668
boost	stl
stl doesn t boost does

4291688
width	height
i replaced the relative size ont he viewstack with a static width 1200 height 800 size and that did the trick

4291725
openbsd	linux	openbsd	netbsd
readlink -f is available on gnu linux cygwin etc. netbsd â 4.0 openbsd â 2.2 busybox

4291725
solaris	aix	opensolaris	aix
it is not available unless you ve installed gnu tools and you ve made sure they re in your path on macâ osâ x as of 10.6.4 hp-ux as of 11.22 solaris as of opensolaris 200906 aix as of 7.1

4291785
int	chars
i think it is returning the ascii value of the chars 1 instead of the int value 1

4291841
versioning	upgrade
generally all your changes will probably be custom modules and each module has it s own versioning and set of applicable install upgrade scripts

4291841
versioning	upgrade
whenever you increase the versioning number in a module s config.xml file magento automatically finds and runs the corresponding upgrade script

4291864
int	chars
first of all if your main concern is about storing large amount of chars in a string as far as i know the only constraints for it are the string length method which returns an int so you are limited to max_int chars and you jvm memory which you can change as pointed by martin

4291870
draggable	droppable
i am having an issue related jquery draggable and droppable

4291870
draggable	droppable
container has 30 which are draggable and droppable into selected

4291882
hash	salt
also see secure hash and salt for php passwords

4291956
lan	localhost
the application is now tested on the localhost and accesed by any clients on the same lan

4291971
multiplying	transpose
long story short instead of mat3 gl_modelviewmatrix you have to multiplying by an inverse transpose of that

4291994
gdk	cairo
i have a canvas gdk drawing area which i can draw into it using cairo but i need to save contents of my canvas into a buffer which in my case is a gdk pixbuf

4292020
post	get
data sent from an correct form with the correct action-url - the params get serialized and send via jquery - i encounter an actioncontroller methodnotallowed with the additional info only get and post requests are allowed that re-routes to applicationcontroller#index with method options

4292055
ninject	spring.net
i have currently looked at spring.net ninject unity and structuremap i tend to have no preference in the configuration whether its xml or fluent interfaces

4292056
folder	directory
i created the indent folder in my .vim directory and pasted an html indentation-plugin into .vim indent

4292219
subclass	abstract-class
or you define a abstract-class handler and let the specific subclass to handle specific type or just pass the event to the chain

4292223
post	get
here is another so post showing how to get data from an sql server into an excel spreadsheet

4292240
post	get
maybe you should post a link to the original source so that you can get more specific advice on how to build it

4292257
mdpi	hdpi
however even after reading through what the android dev guide has to say on the issue i m unsure as to why i should provide different graphics for ldpi mdpi and hdpi

4292261
width	height
use the large image s width and height as your input

4292261
width	height
if your image dimensions do vary a little order them according to their most varying dimension either width or height

4292266
single-quotes	double-quotes
notice the single-quotes enclosing the double-quotes around

4292284
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

4292289
nsoperation	nsinvocationoperation
after reading the apple article linked to below i discovered that for my needs right now nsinvocationoperation does exactly what i need and saves me from having to create separate nsoperation objects for each process

4292351
lynxos	irix
hpux irix lynxos 3.0.1 usg-unix-v indicates some sort of unix system

4292368
free	malloc
my program should work 24 7 and it does a lot of malloc -s and free -s

4292392
mdpi	hdpi
but if you provide both a hdpi mdpi and ldpi graphic it would require a bit more space

4292392
mdpi	hdpi
first of all if you anyhow provide a hdpi graphic adding an mdpi and ldpi graphic which both are less than the hdpi graphic in size there is approximately 3 4 6 scaling ratio will increase the size but far from triple it more close to double

4292420
free	malloc
if your program has so many malloc and free calls that you get this kind of fragmentation using mmap for each allocation will be hopelessly slow

4292420
free	malloc
then to confirm that the cause of the problem is fragmentation i would wrap all calls to malloc and free with your own wrapper that increments and decrements a total allocated byte count variable so you can at any point compare the theoretical and actual memory consumption

4292420
free	malloc
each call to malloc or free incurs a good bit of overhead especially in a threaded environment where synchronization locking is necessary

4292427
decimal	ieee
the size of a float is platform-dependent although a maximum of 1.8e308 with a precision of roughly 14 decimal digits is a common value the 64 bit ieee format

4292507
qmainwindow	qvboxlayout
i tried to use the qvboxlayout but it tells me that i cannot change the layout of my qmainwindow since it already has a layout

4292507
qlayout	qwidget
qwidget setlayout attempting to set qlayout on hcgwindow which already has a layout

4292534
folder	directory
now all i want to do is to svn update my working directory only for the files in folder but not its subfolders

4292534
folder	directory
be aware that on the svn server repository folder now contains new files file3 file4 that i want to see in the working directory after the svn update

4292535
ubuntu	linux
as far as i can see there are only few viable as opposed to 5 ways to screencast your linux desktop alternatives for desktop capture in linux ubuntu note i typically use a laptop as target for desktop capturing

4292539
websphere	ibm
ibm websphere portal otb will handle the basic security - user log in and the portlets that they can see spring security can do the same thing

4292539
websphere	ibm
ibm websphere portal otb can handle the theming or re-skinning the portlets based on what company the user is associated with

4292539
websphere	ibm
ibm websphere portal can provide re-use of portlets not sure i buy this since so far each customer has demanded their own screen layouts along with the data collected and how it is displayed

4292539
websphere	ibm
ibm websphere portal can help with time to market - that is start with a base reference implementation and then show them what can be changed in a 45 - 60 day turn around

4292547
gridview	objectdatasource
i am using a gridview and a objectdatasource

4292565
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties

mergesort	heapsort	quicksort	mergesort	quicksort	heapsort
worst case for quicksort is actually worse than heapsort and mergesort but quicksort is faster on average

4292700
quicksort	heapsort
a quote that summarizes the quicksort vs merge heapsort

4292700
quicksort	mergesort
quicksort is implemented well it is typically 2-3 times faster than mergesort or

4292709
setinterval	settimeout
however you can use setinterval or settimeout to watch for element changes and use it to react accordingly

4292711
udp	tcp
it s really easy use it but it uses tcp instead of udp

4292736
draggable	droppable
i would suggest to use sortables because its somehow the same like draggable and droppable on both div s

4292804
int	chars
the fgetc function shall obtain the next byte as an unsigned chars converted to an int

4292804
int	chars
as long as you store the return value in an int and not a chars it is sufficient to check for eof because it is guaranteed not to represent a valid chars value

4292830
draggable	droppable
i have some draggable and droppable divs that clone themselves when they are dragged over to there container

4292830
draggable	droppable
i am saving the position of the div s in a database however if i insert the exact same html dynamicly and reload the page the div is no longer draggable droppable etc

4292873
post	put
when you use the local form rails will post the data but add the extra _method field to emulate a put

4292873
post	put
don t know if you are using jquery-rails but this takes care of setting the _method parameter and the put post verb translation for you in your ajax calls

4292898
hide	show
if i add a check to the site.master to show hide a menu item based on role there are no roles listed for the user anymore

4292926

when i check the contents of the zip isdirectory does not register the 4 folder as a directory

4292953
free	malloc
3773 address 0x8 is not stack d malloc d or recently free d

4292982
hash	salt
the db s key would be a hash of the password salt with a nonce

4293004
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
works great in safari firefox and google-chrome but displays freak out boxes on ie8

4293041
hash	md5
another trick is to generate a md5 hash for your password

4293041
hash	md5
and for long phrases evolve your md5 hash by combining each 16-byte block with the previous hash -- making the entire xor key random and non-repetitive

4293142
versioning	upgrade
you can always have your versioning upgrade if something will feel more right to you at later time

4293142
versioning	upgrade
don t forget to upgrade versioning versioning also

4293151
uploadify	swfupload
uploadify which is similar to swfupload does not send cookie when uploading files

rss	feed
i get this error trying to fetch my rss feed using wordpress syndication feedwordpress

4293265
typedef	struct
a matter of style really but you typedef a lot of struct to nice human-readable names and yet consequently add the struct keyword anyway

4293265
calloc	malloc
if you use calloc instead of malloc you get zeroed memory

4293280
alloca	malloc
a place where alloca is especially dangerous than malloc is the kernel - kernel of a typical operating system has a fixed sized stack space hard-coded into one of its header

4293283
x86	mips
just remember that assemblers are specific to their platforms and some of the concepts that apply to x86 don t apply to other platforms such as mips or ppc

4293288
getter	setter
so far i ve found the only way to do this is to explicitely ask for a getter setter of the object while it is still attached to the session ie

4293380
profiling	debugging
aall java profiling i know have that ability since the java debugging interface jvmti is inherently network-capable

4293416
int	double
alternatively calculate everything in cents since an ieee double can accurately represent int up to 53 bits in length which is enough to hold even the entire us sovereign debt for at least another 10 years probably

4293535
dictionary	map
most dynamic languages provide a built-in hashtable or dictionary or map or table or whatever you want to call it

4293562
nsmutablestring	nsstring
in fact this is the entire point of using nsmutablestring instead of nsstring

4293582
children	parent
for example in a min heap if the parent node was 10 and its children was 8 and 3 what would be the better node to swap with

4293619
perforce	cvs
but thankfully it is supposed to work out-of-the-box with subversion cvs or even perforce -- not just visual source safe -- so there s a good chance you wouldn t have to write any perl yourself

4293630
nstimer	nsrunloop
it was created because of a memory cycle between nsrunloop and nstimer by design

4293664
client-side	server-side
you can t detect this server-side you can however present a message client-side with the tag like this

4293676
allocator	stl
the leak you are seeing is not actually a leak but pre-allocation which is basically where the crt or stl keeps around allocated memory incase you need it again for faster allocator time

4293736
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome safari firefox and ie display render fonts differently

4293741
postgresql	mysql
i only know of postgresql and mysql

4293748
gif	png
however they ve become less concerned with bandwidth over the past couple years as they ve increased their server capacity to god-like proportions hence the larger logo files for example their old logo here is a roughly 8.5kb gif file that looks like crap and their current one is a 25+kb png so i suspect they ll eventually come up with a more standards compliant and cleaner home page

4293760
google-chrome	firefox
ok this code works in firefox but doesn t work in ie and google-chrome

4293765
jquery	simplemodal
i have the login view showing up in a modal dialog using jquery simplemodal and when the user fails login - it works fine - the error goes back to the modal

4293773
width	height
if the image has not been shown yet height and width return zero meaning i cannot resize the image

4293789
getter	setter
code templates and generation getter setter

4293789
jquery	scriptaculous
it also has full support for html css and javascript including code completion and integrated documentation for popular framworks like prototype scriptaculous or jquery

4293789
client-side	server-side
well netbeans comes with a client-side monitor to examine http messages and an ajax-ready environment to use with server-side scripting language you prefer

4293807
rss	feed
is it in a separate thread or do you just want something to happen periodically polling an rss feed or something

4293817
ssl	https
i m trying to create a link to a page that requires ssl and the routes are properly set up to require it to be https but i can t figure out how to get link_to to behave properly

every time you call getwritabledatabase oncreate method is called

4293861
portrait	landscape
as portrait not landscape

4293876
inherited	base-class
maybe let them all inherited one base-class

4293916
nsstring	nsdata
like nsstring nsarray and similar core classes nsdata is a class cluster instead of single class

4293922
width	height
elements have height and width properties that are automatically populated by the browser when it determines the dimensions of an image

4293922
width	height
accessing the height and width properties directly should allow your code to work correctly

4293961
freebsd	linux
posix does not provide a solution to this but at least linux and freebsd do if reads start failing open the fifo again while keeping the original descriptor open

4293961
freebsd	linux
this works because in linux and freebsd the hangup state is local to a particular open file description while in posix it is global to the fifo

4293979
int	double
they basically let you implement a generic class for any type and then when you initialise a variable of this class you specify what type string int double etc. it applies its stuff to

4293986
nsdateformatter	nsnumberformatter
allocating nsdateformatter or nsnumberformatter is relatively slow and

4294002
nsmutablestring	nsstring
an nsmutablestring is an nsstring so your code is perfectly correct except for some syntax errors you missed the on each nsstring and the on the if statement

4294022
division	modulo
you can use the modulo which returns the remainder after division

4294026
shadowing	named
i refuse to use the named dict since it shadows a builtin and shadowing builtins is stupid

4294031
chunked	transfer-encoding
seems to be official cassini does not support transfer-encoding chunked requests

4294051
fgets	strlen
if the strings are really humongous like 42 mega bytes worth you may be better off reading character by character and keeping count with num_chars than using fgets first and strlen later

4294070
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
the code below should work with firefox and opera and google-chrome

4294099
inherited	properties
i ve worked with the camera before in smaller projects but what i d like to do this time around is write some generic attachable code and have each of these entities properties apartment and tenant inherited from the attachable class to have all of the necessary code out of the box

4294106
uipickerviewdelegate	uipickerviewdatasource
to populate your picker use pickerview titleforrow forcomponent from uipickerviewdelegate and numberofcomponentsinpickerview from uipickerviewdatasource

4294140
subtract	add
its a big plus if he can count add subtract and think in terms of hex instead of decimal

4294170
int	double
is for strings and pointers i and d are for int and f is used for floats and double

4294172
put	get
what will they want to learn from it and how much effort are they prepared to put in to get that information

4294255
ddms	adb
try to call reset adb menu item from ddms devices tab

4294282
put	get
i tried to put the xml file in the project direction java src pachage and inside the pachage of servlets but all of tese tries get the same result

4294287
button	checkbox
ok not just checkbox but also radio button

4294293
jar	war
if you include it in your jar war file you should be able to load it easily with class.getresourceasstream or classloader.getresourceasstream

4294303
np-hard	np-complete
it is not easier than the np-complete problem since it can be reduced to it in polynomial time which makes the problem np-hard

4294306
button	checkbox
you can always re-skin the checkbox radio button using css just like any other form element such as button

4294318
getter	setter
i needed to change the propety getter setter to return the correct enum type

4294338
put	get
to get rid of empty words we can put a filter on the explode so that empty entries are removed

4294338
explode	implode
the new words are added all at once by taking the list in and doing the opposite of explode which broke a line down in to individual words we implode the list of words in to a single piece of text each word separated with a newline n

4294348
post	get
in that case could you post some idea of what information you re trying to get from the user

4294349
profiler	yourkit	yourkit	jprofiler
i don t know netbeans but i know both yourkit profiler and jprofiler to be very powerful tools for these kinds of analyses

4294355
keydown	keyup
after switching to fullscreen not working keydown and keyup

4294375
equals	gethashcode
i need to implement equals and gethashcode for the instrumenttest class

4294375
equals	gethashcode
note if you define an iset of composite elements it is very important to implement equals and gethashcode correctly

4294419
post	put
i did take up the various suggestions of formatting the date on the client side or more specifically reformatting it. as google fodder i have put a full explanation of this at the end of this post

4294430
nsstring	nsdata
i need to store some raw bytes from nsdata object into an nsstring basically a null encoding but i am not sure how to do this

4294433
width	height
so boundingrect returns a rectf that has a width and height of 11px although width and height claim it s 10 for both

4294435
sat	np-complete
this involves getting a known np-complete problem like sat the set of boolean expressions in the form

4294435
sat	np-complete
that is given some input x for sat or whatever np-complete problem you are using create some input y for your problem such that x is in sat if and only if y is in your problem

4294435
np-hard	np-complete
footnote in step 2 prove it is np-hard reducing another np-hard not necessarily np-complete problem to the current problem will do since np-complete problems are a subset of np-hard problems that are also in np

4294439
put	get
it s hard work - but if you re willing to put the effort in you will really get a tremendous amount out of it

4294468
hide	show
to show and some reason hide the title words

4294470
hash	md5
note that the resulting md5 hash of using this won t be the same as your sample code because it is at least partially independent of the particular image file format used to save the image

4294470
hash	md5
to use it you would need to store the md5 hash of the image data somewhere independent of any image file where it could be retrieved when needed -- as opposed to generating it by reading the entire file into memory as binary data like the code in your question does

4294486
aggregate-functions	sum
excluding the grouped column category_id and the evaluated columns columns returning results of aggregate-functions like sum max etc

4294499
wav	caf
you can convert a wav to caf with the built in terminal utility

4294578
post	get
all i would need to do to exploit this is to get a user to click a form that sends a tainted q post variable

4294578
post	get
if i can get a user to click that thinking that he s clicking some innocent link then i can post arbitrary data to the search that then gets echoed into his page and i can hijack his session or do whatever other nasty things i want

4294578
post	get
post data isn t inherently more secure than get data

4294614
put	get
i ve tried to do similar things before and i m starting the get the idea that you can t put expressions after an as statement

4294643
cos	sqrt
cos alpha x1 x2 + y1 y2 sqrt x1 x1 + y1 y1 sqrt x2 x2 + y2 y2

4294651
qtcpsocket	qtcpserver
we are using qt the client has a qtcpsocket and the server a qtcpserver and a pointer to a qtcpsocket

4294726
.htaccess	httpd.conf
your .htaccess or httpd.conf

4294753
super	self
super and self don t work here

4294758
for-loop	loops
i ve got a question about calculating big o running times for a series of loops that are nested in an outer for-loop

4294760
filtering	grouping
however linq is more about grouping filtering and converting data

4294827
post	get
ive tried using curl as well as file_get_contents so both as post and get requests

4294854
wordpress	joomla
i am new to joomla and don t have any developer experience with it i use wordpress

4294855
post	get
examine the form s returned get or post values

4294862
post	get
then otherwise it won t handle the requests coming from link_to as it is a get request not post

4294879
implements	extends
those lines would work fine inside an activity but it doesn t to complain as it is a thread it doesn t know about the activity class because it doesn t extends it but implements runnable

4294888
getter	setter
i would like to know the way to declare callback to reach its instance s setter or getter

4294897
put	get
put all the above together and you ll get something you can use like this

4294897
inherited	properties
if you do this then your component will inherited the mxmlcontent properties described above

4294901
getter	setter
if you declared a property for your instance variable and then synthesized it in your implementation file your getter and setter are automatically created for you

4294946
factors	matrix	factors	mean
scaling a vector in 3d space using a matrix would mean putting the scaling factors on the diagonal of the matrix

4294954
postgresql	mysql
based on selection variable my script chooses a sub routine for either sqlite mysql or postgresql

4294954
postgresql	mysql
but considering the mysql vars have nothing to do with postgresql or sqlite i wanted to set private vars in the sub routines

4294958
scheme	racket
racket emphasizes its large libraries as batteries included while ikarus scheme touts itself as compiling fast code

4294958
scheme	racket
if you re just learning scheme racket is a good choice with its friendly interface and specific environments for various scheme books

4294958
r5rs	r6rs
also you probably don t need to find a r6rs implementation when most implementations target r5rs and most textbooks were written for r5rs and earlier

4294995
hash	md5
md5 makes only one pass over the data so if two prefixes with the same hash can be constructed a common suffix can be added to both to make the collision more likely to be accepted as valid data by the application using it

4294996
uiview	calayer
attached to my avplayer there is a calayer that is used to display video on my uiview

4295013
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended
this main layer handles touch events touchesbegan touchesmoved and touchesended

4295014
ant	maven
i m using ant but from the looks of it this was the approach maven took everything under src or test

4295052
getter	setter
it is supposed to be more efficient for the jpa provider to access the field directly rather than via getter and setter

4295073
post	get
i get post with regardless or vice-versa if in the if statement

4295080
post	get
based on your comments try the following sql where clauses and see if you get the correct post

4295089
hash	md5
md5 is a 128-bit hash so there are 2 128 possible hash

4295089
hash	md5
the attacks on md5 allow collisions to be found with significantly less than 2 64 hash and significantly less than 128 x 2 64 bits of storage

4295107
performselector	delegation
try casting the delegation to its class type first then invoke performselector withobject afterdelay

4295107
performselector	delegation
assuming that your delegation is of type id you need to tell the runtime that the object in fact does inherit from nsobject where the performselector withobject afterdelay method is defined by casting it to it s class type

4295115
aptitude	phpize
if you get an error saying the system canâ t find phpize then you may need to install the php dev package this is how you do if your os has aptitude you might need to use some other method to install the php dev packaes â

4295122
backgrounding	multitasking
it all works fine when the app is in the foreground or when the app is in the backgrounding but not completely closed from multitasking bar

4295152
toupper	uppercase
if you don t care about the case of the character being read that is s and s will do the same thing you can convert selection to uppercase before your if -block or switch -block using toupper

4295170
datediff	difference
if your calculating the time diff using two dates you can use the datediff function to calculate the difference and get the timespan - but if you already have this remember a timespan can be represented as a number of units of time so use isnumeric using a custom function

4295170
min	max	range	max	range	min
place in the min and max possible numbers just to be safe and when validation occurs using this attribute it will return false if its not a numeric number anyway so you get bad string validation from that alone and you are also able to validate the range of possible values of the timespan - if range isn t important then just set the upper limit to a safe value like several million minutes or something eg long.maxvalue or integer.maxvalue

4295174
subtract	add
initially you set position and orientation both to 0 then add or subtract from position when a key is pressed and add or subtract from orientation.x and orientation.y when the mouse is moved.

4295206
rtos	ecos
otoh rather than redo everything it may be useful to start with an embedded rtos such as ecos or l4 to draw some features from

4295224
post	get
i was told that after if i remove the protocols such as http get and http post from my web.config it should work

4295225
integer	unsigned	unsigned	short
in short size_t is never negative and it maximizes performance because it s typedef d to be the unsigned integer type that s big enough -- but not too big -- to represent the size of the largest possible object on the target platform

4295225
integer	unsigned
also because size_t is unsigned you can store numbers that are roughly twice as big as in the corresponding signed type because we can use the sign bit to represent magnitude like all the other bits in the unsigned integer

4295225
integer	unsigned
according to this fantastic article type size_t is a typedef that s an alias for some unsigned integer type typically unsigned int or unsigned long but possibly even unsigned long long

4295225
integer	unsigned
each standard c implementation is supposed to choose the unsigned integer that s big enough--but no bigger than needed--to represent the size of the largest possible object on the target platform.

4295357
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
then you ll be able to write it to an objectoutputstream and read from an objectinputstream

4295387
lxml	beautifulsoup
it s generally accepted that lxml is faster than beautifulsoup ref

4295400
g++	gcc
you need to compile with g++ not gcc

4295460
width	height
the problem is that when the user clicks the button the panel content shows but it resizes that portion of the screen to be the full width and height of the screen so other elements inside the table view are now shifted way off of the screen

4295492
xrange	enumerate
this should be near optimal with minimal memory usage thanks to the use of the enumerate and xrange generators

4295500
postgresql	mysql
php has support for connecting to oracle mysql postgresql ms-sql and various others

4295504
google-chrome	safari
in general it might take a bit more logic since for example the string safari is found in the user-agents provided by other browsers than safari including google-chrome

4295588
integer	unsigned	hex	binary
so -1 in a 16-bit integer which has the highest unsigned value of 65535 would be 65536-1 65535 0xffff in hex or 1111 1111 1111 1111 in binary

4295594
hide	show	mousehover	mouseleave
basically create a tooltip on your form give that to your control via a property show the tooltip when your control received a mousehover event and hide the tooltip when you receive a mouseleave event

4295630
put	get
just in your situation you should use the get and put methods for string and for integer

4295757
super	self
super foo self .__getattribute__ attr binds the __getattribute__ method of the nearest superclass formally the next class in the class s method resolution order or mro to the current object self and then calls it and lets that do the work

4295763
next	except
this will result in contents_chopped pointing to the same string except the first char will be the next after n

4295776
nsobject	nsmanagedobject
it is interesting to note that nsmanagedobject is effectively a root class in that it does some pretty seriously custom stuff but it is a subclass of nsobject so subclasses of nsmanagedobject are inter-operable with the rest of the system

4295800
switching	screens
this was the only way i could guarantee it would work if the program switching full screens to from windowed

4295806
min	max
q3 q4 note that the elements passed to min and max are already sorted

4295830
put	get
again it s really depend on what you really want to know about the user and how much fiction you are will to put in to the sign up process to get these info

4295997
hide	show
in xaml i want to show hide elements based on the mode

4296015
wordpress	joomla
it is very easy to use having example for many programming languages as well as some modules for different content management systems wordpress drupal joomla

4296081
width	height
if u want to change height and width

4296110
fputcsv	fgetcsv
call fgetcsv to read the data from the file into an array and fputcsv to write one of these arrays modified if required to a csv file

4296121
shadowing	named
note that naming a local variable strlen thus shadowing the standard function of that named is going to more than a little confusing for someone who looks at your code later

4296174
width	height
do the same for location height width etc or any other property that you feel that will change on the original item

4296204
quicksort	bubble-sort
you may be able to do better than 13 by just hard-coding the tests that a common sort algorithm - but not an o n 2 algorithm such as bubble-sort or even i suspect quicksort

4296245
folder	directory
the non-default layouts go inside a folder named after the module so my directory structure looks like this

4296324
chunked	transfer-encoding
transfer-encoding chunked

4296391
fast-forward	merge
that will make any subsequent merge after the initial rebase a fast-forward one

4296402
express	node.js
if you use express high-performance high-class web development for node.js you can do this

4296448
serializable	deserialization
a good way to speed up the serializable deserialization process would be to replace the internal default php serializable with something like igbinary

4296448
memcached	apc
there are a couple of notes about that in theses slides presented by ilia alshanetsky a couple of weeks ago at the forum php 2010 in paris apc memcached the high performance duo

4296471
rss	feed
the problem i have is that site with the rss feed of which i want to get images is of a type img src http......

4296503
hide	show
using tutorials i have managed to hide text and show it as captions but what i really want to do is show the full text and just highlight the current part

4296546
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in all browsers i tested in windows platform firefox opera safari google-chrome ie8 works fine but in internet explorer 7 it doesn t work

4296606
symfony	lithium
i have done less with lithium but certainly in symfony 2 everything well nearly everything is a plugin making the framework modular and much easier to manage

4296606
symfony	lithium
neither symfony 2 or lithium are production ready at present

4296606
symfony	lithium
symfony is aiming at march 2011 not clear on lithium s 1 dot oh date

4296640
integer	unsigned
what you get stored is the integer -8536 which converted to an int and then to an unsigned int is 4294958760

4296640
unsigned	short
you need to either declare snum as an unsigned short so it can store the value you want or convert it to an int instead of an unsigned int

4296656
button	checkbox
then when the user wants to send mail he presses a button and than i need to access the checkbox and i m having problems with this the sub doesn t know the checkbox object

4296658
postgresql	mysql
i m creating a tiny activerecord library using pdo and i m planning to support mysql sqlite and postgresql

4296682
interpolation	splines
otherwise any decent spreadsheet software should be able to do splines interpolation and give you a nice smooth graph

4296731
cos	sin
when it switches from clockwise to anti clockwise it uses the same value in the sin and cos which is timer 1.5 .this causes the anti clockwise motion to begin from a different position on my planet

4296733
unsigned	short
no there is no implicit cast to unsigned short before the cast to unsigned int

4296733
unsigned	short
in cast 2 you first convert using an explicit cast from short -8536 to unsigned short 57000 since that is the same bit pattern as -8536 but interpreted as an unsigned number and then from unsigned short to unsigned int 57000

4296733
unsigned	short
in cast 1 you convert directly from short -8536 to unsigned int

4296740
free	malloc
what free does is not free the memory held by the pointer completely but actually makes it available for later use if we call a malloc after calling free

4296740
free	malloc
an evidence to this is you will be able to access the memory location after calling free and before setting the pointer to null assuming you haven t already called malloc

4296741
post	get
other possibility is to use post method instead of get

4296760
put	get	post	get	post	put
i think it s better to put them in the body post then the url get

4296777
matplotlib	scipy
numpy is a matplotlib dependency so you can import those two functions from there if you don t have scipy installed

4296805
client-side	server-side
you can t for instance do any scripting of the client s browser with any server-side language which is why you see so much client-side code around

4296822
post	get
but when i get to the post method for home index my selectlists and selectlistitems are null whereas the string for containing the button info contains the correct data

4296835
width	height
i could change the width height and the position of the dialog using getwindow .setattributes params

4296859
junit	mockito
of course if you have programmed to an interface and are planning to write junit tests for your code you can look into a mocking library like mockito to do that job for you though the job of creating the data would yours to lookout for

4296945
uiview	subviews
then you would animate a uiview to replicate the opening of the folder tell the view to scale vertically or similar add the subviews title field current objects inside the folder etc -- then when you release the view being panned you would animate it to scale down into the folder

4296961
google-chrome	firefox
i have found that without exception firefox and google-chrome just don t render the font well regardless of format

4296965
getter	setter
getter and setter constructor destructor if possible

4296991
x86	mips
these may very different between x86 and mips

4297007
google-chrome	firefox
is it really compatible with firefox and google-chrome browsers or i will find my self in deep troubles

4297021
getter	setter
those are the usual setter and getter

4297027
implements	extends
for one it s usually preferable to implements runnable rather than extends thread but regardless i don t think that you ll want to have your filters or pipes extends thread or implements runnable but rather have each pipe be used in a new thread

4297035
put	get
but the default visibility for a class what you naturally get is private and particularly if i have inline-style methods i generally put any private data in front

4297084
aggregate-functions	sum
using sum which is an aggregate-functions within your derived table is going to give you exactely one row back - unless you start to group by another column

4297094
put	get
on all the videos on ted there is a widget thing with an inputfield that says tweet this we ll add the url later you put stuff in a box it get s a tiny-url and get s pushed to facebook

4297097
int	chars
int 5 does not do what you think it does it specifies an int field with a display width of 5 digits numbers shorter than 5 digits will be padded with space chars

4297111
persistent	transient	ivar	subclassing
the standard solution is to add the ivar which holds transient data which does not persistent in the database in the subclassing representing the entity directly as in

4297132
post	get
if i were you i will issue a get access using a browser to the exact url you are issuing your post request and see what you get

4297163
int	chars
you are comparing a signed chars with the value -86 256-0xaa to an int with the value 170 0xaa

4297176
iboutlet	ibaction
you ll need to add the mediaplayer framework to your project in xcode and open up mainwindow.xib in interface builder to add the uiview and uibutton iboutlet and hookup the ibaction to the uibutton

4297196
mouseover	mouseenter
in addition to this you should as mentioned by others use mouseenter instead of mouseover because the latter will fire when you hover over any element with the one you specify whereas the latter only fires once per element or children

4297235
spweb	spsite
you are trying to create a new site spweb using the createsite method which creates site collections spsite not sites

4297264
width	height
but i can t set the height of a row only width of a column

4297271
for-loop	loops
1 to explain what i meant by moving the line outside the while loops i m also changing to the more suitable for-loop at the same time

4297280
public	protected
... they are defined by using one of the keywords public protected or private followed by a normal variable declaration

4297288
getter	setter
i am not sure if i understand your question correctly but if you are trying to get some code executed every time the setter or getter is invoked there are basically two ways to do that

4297288
getter	setter
1 you can overwrite the synthesized getter and or setter like this

4297288
getter	setter
this of course only runs you code when the setter is invoked not the getter

4297326
addition	multiplication
this uses addition instead of multiplication to traverse the array

4297335
for-loop	loops
if you use a while or repeat loops instead of a for-loop the you can include another conjunct in your stopping condition that you set mid-loop

4297342
xts	chron	zoo	chron	zoo	xts
this is clearly documented --- xts and zoo objects are formed by supplying two arguments a vector or matrix carrying data and date posixct chron .

4297352
hide	show
an easy way out would be to simply hide your label in the applicationwillresignactive method of your app delegate and then update and show it again in your applicationwillenterforeground method

4297371
post	get
i am using the post redirect get pattern in my application

4297371
post	get
in case i want to display a message at the get stage i can store it as as session variable at the post stage when it is decided what message should be displayed for example

4297378
int	boolean
here are some problems findbugs finds which pmd doesn t equals method fails on subtypes clone method may return null reference comparison of boolean values impossible cast 32bit int shifted by an amount not in the range of 0-31 a collection which contains itself equals method always returns true an infinite loop etc

4297393
fgets	strlen
in both main and findword you should not use strlen sizelineinputx right after reading the file with fgets - there may be no 0 in sizelineinput2 and you will have strlen read beyond the 512 bytes you have

4297393
fgets	fgetc
instead of using fgets use fgetc to read char by char and check for a newline character and for eof too

4297436
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
in this case viewdidappear behaves more like viewwillappear ..

4297456
unsigned	short
unless mentioned explicitely as unsigned both int and short are signed

4297459
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox and opera have this problem except ie6

ferret	sphinx	xapian	sunspot
seems to me as if most of the known methods sunspot sphinx ferret xapian arenâ t yet ready for rails 3

4297470
xapian	sunspot
after some reading iâ m almost sure that iâ d like to use sunspot or xapian

4297485
inherited	properties
however instead of placing the ui in the vm where properties would propagate several layers manually i used an attached properties named showadvanced which propagates down via properties inherited

4297485
hide	show
you can t show them for one and hide them for another

4297501
folder	directory
i don t have include directory in my www folder

4297538
getter	setter
here is a pretty light way to define a class close to your c# definition it has a default constructor but uses public fields instead of getter and setter which might be a problem i don t know

4297542
int	chars
so the first line defines a general template the next group of lines specializes it for the type form type1 type2 which are parameterized on two types hence the specialization has a non-empty template parameter list and the main instantiates the template for the concrete type chars int a function taking an int and returning a chars

4297545
int	chars
the instantiation matches the specialization which extracts the component types chars and int of the compound type a function chars int as type1 and type2

4297560
jobs	cron
for people who are using shared hosting like me go look for cron jobs in your control panel and then set your automated task there

4297563
int	chars
type1 is chars and type2 is int

4297563
int	chars
for that reason obj var1 is member variable of type chars and obj var2 is member variable of type int

4297601
innodb	myisam
most popular storage engines are myisam and innodb

4297620
portrait	landscape
for example if they are landscape images they are ok but if they are portrait they are rotated 90 degrees and again shown as landscape

4297635
jquery	scriptaculous
you can achieve something similar using css and just about any library whether extjs or jquery + jquery ui prototype + scriptaculous yui closure or any of several others or even without a library if you want to work unnecessarily hard

4297666
width	height
the main image that the markers and hitboxes get overlaid on is 50 width and height of the page

4297670
width	height
the main image that the markers and hitboxes get overlaid on is 50 width and height of the page

4297670
width	height
this means you have to find out what the actual width height of the image is at runtime via javascript and then adjust the pixel values you use for absolutely positioning everything else to account for that

4297670
width	height
if you can t i d recommend using a library like jquery prototype yui closure or any of several others for discovering the actual computed width and height of the image

4297673
post	get
you ll need to query post to get the first child of the post in question

4297678
client-side	server-side
node.js is server side javascript that can run your client-side code on the server-side

4297678
client-side	server-side
you client-side code will run on server-side with little or no modification as per node.js folks

4297678
client-side	server-side
when you run your client-side ajax code on server-side and that ajax code contains a get request the node.js framework loads the requested data from the file system a file or db or xml or whatever and returns the data set normally as if the request actually came from a client-side call

4297685
inline	inlining
closure compiler is inlining a function but the code size is smaller if that function is not inline i only care about code size - this is for js1k

4297787
versioning	upgrade
in the case of a library the versioning number tells you about the level of compatibility between two releases and thus how difficult an upgrade will be

4297796
debian-based	ubuntu
i think it is debian-based so if you are used to ubuntu it should be an easy transition

4297811
haskell	scheme
in implementation terms tail recursion might cause a stack overflow where iteration would work but 1 some languages guarantee this will not happen scheme haskell and 2 many compilers will handle this as an optimisation anyway gcc for c or c++

4297814
put	get
create a resource model such that your applications can put and get messages where the uri contains the destination node and add a parameter for a reply address

4297828
width	height
you can also put in the linear layouts fill parent on both height and width and put layout weight to first 1 to second 0.5 and third 1 and it will put them in the percentage of height you show us in the picture..

4297843
udp	tcp
you run it on both sides of the connection and it can measure bandwidth either way with tcp or udp and has many tweakable parameters

4297851
oncreate	onstart
my app goes through the regular flow oncreate onstart and onresume

4297851

4297873
serializable	deserialization
i m trying to do custom serializable deserialization of an object as well as compressing decompressing the serializable data with deflatestreams

4297882
subtraction	multiplication	division	multiplication	division	subtraction
in this case jcomeau_ictx s won t work because it can only deal with subtraction not multiplication and division and these stack-based solutions are overkill

4297892
int	boolean
even just string boolean datetime and int would be fine

4297929
int	double
if the object returned was not an int if it is a float double byte etc it was boxed to an object and can only be cast back to its original type

4297962
stdout	stderr
2 1 will redirect stderr to stdout

4297965
rss	feed
it loads two rss feed and on each rss feed it contains two items with a title an image and a link

4297965
rss	feed
so two rss feed and 4 images downloading

4297965
rss	feed
so two asynctasks objects are called to load two rss feed and 4 asynctasks to load 4 images

4297967
versioning	upgrade
in the case of a library the versioning number tells you about the level of compatibility between two releases and thus how difficult an upgrade will be

4297977
getter	setter
dot notation in objective-c is short-hand for calling an objects getter setter methods

4297993
accessor	properties
all of the properties of the item are protected and i ve created accessor and mutators for them

4297996
tapestry	wicket
since a jsp is just a servlet in disguise it s always possible to write web applications without jsp and there are options using frameworks like wicket and tapestry or template engines like velocity to make java web application development without jsp pretty easy

client-side	server-side
as mentioned by the other answers they are commonly used for server-side and client-side scripting respectively

4298137
mouse	keyboard
that is it executes in the client web browser in this instance and has access to resources on the client computer such as the actual keyboard and mouse inputs etc.

4298143
cucumber	autotest
this is what controls whether autotest includes the cucumber tests or not

4298176
java.util.date	simpledateformat
the reason i ask is that simpledateformat parse will convert a string to a java.util.date but if you re using this object with an sql database i suspect you ll need the latter the java.util.date

4298187
move	drag
for example if a user clicks on a and drag downward shortening segment ag point b would would down an equal amount shortening bc point f would move to the left shortening both af and fg finally point e would also shift to the left to stay in line with point f

4298219
children	parent
it has to do with parent-child relationships between objects and what happens to children when you delete the parent

4298219
children	parent
one scenario says that children have no life outside that of their parent so they should be deleted when the parent is deleted

4298219
children	parent
the other scenario says that children should persist beyond their parent so they should not be deleted when their parent is deleted

4298230

4298461
post	put
i ve put together a very simple static page which i m trying to population with forms and user-generated content from storify with the aim of showing readers what s going on with the recent snow but also a means of allowing readers to post their own pictures report problems

4298518
hide	show
if you want content to be initially hidden and then only show with javascript your best bet is to hide it with css and then alter it with javascript after page load

4298518
hide	show
there we use an inline style to hide the paragraph and then use jquery s show to show it show sets the display style property

4298539

nfa	dfa
to convert your regular expression to dfa generate nfa first see for example and then convert nfa to dfa

4298732
short	base
while there s a lot to be said for the philosophy that a great developer can pick up almost any language in short order there s a practical side that goes to the fact that if you have a ton of .net or java coders you re best served in starting from that base

4298766
uigesturerecognizer	subviews
i can only handle the double tap on the main view but not for the subviews and can only do it on the transformgesturereconizer.h but then not choose the view tapped i think because subclass of uigesturerecognizer

second wpf will not use your property getter and setter to access your dependency properties that s why there should not be any additional logic beyond getvalue and setvalue

4299006
cos	sin
to switch direction you need to subtract the sin cos results

4299023
keydown	keyup
or you could roll your own version of getkeystate and remember what keys are presses in keydown and reset the flag in keyup

4299062
firefox	safari
this works fine in firefox and ie but safari returns

4299066
google-chrome	firefox

4299160
put	get
now the question is can i get that to use a class that s not in a namespace as the mvc class is by default otherwise i ll have to modify the t4 template to put it in a namespace and include that

4299161
iconvertible	iequatable
for instance it could probably do well to implement some interfaces such as icomparable iequatable iformattable and possibly iconvertible as well if you re keen so it can better interact with the rest of the framework

4299167
put	get
in first example you can only put strings as keys and integers as values but in second example you can put anything to the map and the compiler can t help you to get type safety

4299199
bindparam	bindvalue
use bindparam bindvalue with value type booleans don t exist in sqlite but work if bound with param_bool .

uiview	uiwindow
the finding positioning code form above came from this questions and answer iphone - get position of uiview within entire uiwindow

4299719
google-chrome	firefox
of course you need to make sure that you don t use any google-chrome specific stuff but the same hold true for things that only work firefox like nosuchmethod etc

4299777
width	margin
you should know the image s width to place it to center using margin auto css property of the div

4299790
kde	gnome
if you don t use kde you search for something similar in gnome

4299791
width	height
on image s onload event you should take its width and height then resize the image keeping aspect ratio then centeralize the image using javascript

4299799
opera	firefox
why is it that internet explorer firefox mozilla opera may display the same content differently

4299838

for deployment on linux the easiest way is perhaps using passenger and either apache or nginx for a web server whichever you re most comfortable with if you have no preference go with apache

4299855
google-chrome	safari
webkit-based browser google-chrome safari

4299869

4299952
portrait	landscape
..this works well in my app editing custom landscape portrait navigationbar

4299957
getter	setter
at first glance i d say that given readable_qty is a virtual attribute it isn t in the database and has instance methods as setter and getter you should remove it from the attr_accessible list

4299968
hide	show
i ve looked through the code and it appears they re using the fbml static application for the main tab and there s a ton of javascript to show and hide the tabs that i highly doubt was all written by hand

4299977
portrait	landscape
my app is in landscape and the screen generated by the paypal lib is portrait when i move back from the paypal screen to my app the views are still all in landscape but the status bar moves to portrait thus leaving a space where the bar usually sits and cutting off the left hand side of the view with the status bar

google-chrome	firefox
actually there is a method to upload files with ajax xmlhttp with firefox 3 and google-chrome it s also possible to upload multiple files without using forms and iframes

4300017
mousemove	mousedown
if the global variable i is never used anywhere else then the value of i will always be equivalent to allpoints 0 .length inside your mousemove callback because you re creating a closure around the i variable which will be set to allpoints 0 .length by the end of the mousedown callback

4300017
mousemove	mousedown
also be aware that testest will be hoisted to the top of the mousedown callback so the value of testest inside the mousemove callback will always be the last value that was set inside the mousemove callback

4300033
jobs	cron
offline requests such as task queue tasks and cron jobs have no user as far as systems like sdc are concerned

4300132
inherited	properties
i found the answer myself for the ones that could want to know how do i resolved this issue was just decalring a grid with xaml with the column and row definitions required next i created a class inherited from button that contained the x and y properties i needed then i just created an array of this objects and programatically defined the properties size span etc i needed and positionated them with mygrid.children.add the object and then simply changed where in the grid i wanted them to display so whenever i needed to acces or change a properties for this buttons i just accessed to my array and voila

4300142
cvs	svn
i donâ t like using git itself though itâ s far better than svn or cvs but github is such an awesome site that iâ ve considered switching just to use it

4300158
hide	show
i haven t created any styles for you but what the code above does is it hide and show the foo and bar divs depending on what you click on

4300166
keydown	keyup
then you override the keydown and keyup event messages in order to capture them

4300174

4300179
min	max
it can be reduced to min cut problem which can be found by any max flow algorithm

4300231
google-chrome	firefox
after looking at your code for some reason i can t see it moving in google-chrome nor does it draw on firefox 4b7 but by looking at your code this line may be an issue

4300231
google-chrome	firefox
learn to use the debuggers google-chrome ie and firefox have good ones but i tend to prefer to use firebug perhaps due to experience with it

maven	cargo
imo the best way to have an ear war deployed on any application server is to use maven to build an ear and cargo maven plugin for redeploying

4300284
for-loop	loops
you need to remove the row in the catch block and change the foreach loops to a backwards for-loop to handle the removals

4300300
stdout	stderr
output has to be redirected to stderr or dev null because stdout is used for the data stream

4300338
std	ostream
- many people like to declare binary_istream binary_ostream types that can house a std ostream but being a distinct type can be used to create a separate set of serialisation routines ala

4300352
linefeed	delimiter
just remember that the row delimiter for ssis should be linefeed not crlf as binary ftp does not convert linefeed unix to crlf windows

4300355
for-loop	loops
one way you can shorten this is to use a for-loop instead of a while loops

4300382
cout	cin
this uses the deprecated header iostream.h to remove the need to explicitly find cin and cout in std

4300416
ant	ivyde
when running an ivy resolve via ivyde in eclipse which contains a packager.xml that executes a javac ant task i get the following

4300419
hide	show
then all you need to do is hide all the uls to start with apart from the root folder and use jquery to show hide the nested lists when a user clicks on the associated folder

4300467
firefox	safari
this code worked in ie firefox and safari windows7

4300479
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
and this code works fine in safari google-chrome and firefox the only exception is ie8

4300491
cvs	svn
i m interested in doing a site in drupal 7 - rather than downloading the periodic source releases i d like to grab the latest changes to drupal using a version control system be it cvs svn git etc

4300504
google-chrome	safari
running the following in the webkit console in google-chrome or safari takes 200ms

4300505
width	height
width and height must be non-negative

4300538
ocaml	scheme
my knowledge with both scheme and ocaml is pretty basic and i find both equally challenging to work with and was unable to determine which would be a better one with respect to scalability and ease of use

4300555
ubuntu	linux
whether you are using ubuntu or fedora or any other version of linux you should not find any major effects on your ability to create php applications

4300574
width	height
you need to check your width and height

4300574
width	height
without seeing the code that calculates width and height this is all conjecture of course

4300591
int	chars
i guess what i mean is how do i access a random byte in memory cast as a chars or int that i can store in a pointer for accessing later on

4300592
width	height
edit the actual answer to this is to set the position of the right-floated div to absolute height width to 16px top and right to 0

4300632
jboss	weblogic
then there are still a number of middleware-based solutions such as websphere weblogic jboss etc

4300671
int	chars
it requires an parameter and returns the number of chars consumed from the input into that int

4300708
ocaml	sml
there aren t actually that many different syntaxes in the wild c c++ objective-c objective-c++ d go java c# ecmascript php vala and many others share a lot of syntax for example as do smalltalk self newspeak and objective-c sml ocaml and f# and so on so chances are you ll pick that up very quickly

4300710
hide	show
this way you don t need to manipulate the content of the elements just show hide them

4300712
accessor	properties
the accessibility modifier of the arp_tll.dataaccess.chromosomeaddedeventargs.newchromosome.set accessor must be more restrictive than the properties or indexer arp_tll.dataaccess.chromosomeaddedeventargs.newchromosome

4300712
accessor	properties
i have tried modifying the accessibility modifiers of the accessor and the properties but i am unable to fix the problem

4300717
accessor	properties
by default access modifiers for a properties s accessor are assigned the same access modifier as the properties itself

4300717
accessor	properties
if you choose to set an explicit access modifier for an accessor it must be more restrictive than the properties s access modifier

4300729
public	protected
in your case property_access_modifier is public so that get_accessor_modifier and set_accessor_modifier must be protected internal protected internal or private

4300786
client-side	server-side
you are talking about server-side client-side browser plugins etc

4300802
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome use the same engine but you say this only works in google-chrome so this is starting out weird

4300808
google-chrome	firefox
for some reason the download button shows up only in firefox browser but not in google-chrome or ie.

4300822
width	height
after some event triggers i want to change the customitem s height and width

4300823
superclass	subclassing
note that i didn t do anything to change the display method on the superclass but i got different display methods on the subclassing by changing the order in which i arranged the superclass

4300866
public	protected
first you have public and private protected to but i won t get into that

4300870
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this looks the the same in google-chrome safari firefox ie7 ie8 and opera

4300870
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome safari and firefox render both versions the same

4300870
background-image	background-color
i changed the background-image to background-color so i could see what was going on shouldn t have any effect on the rendering but ie7 is rather clever at making a mess of things so maybe not

4300905
ant	ivyde
if ivyde is not using the ant bundled with eclipse as plugin and referring to some standard installation or if you have defined a environment variable like ant_home then copy

4300931
post	put
note i had to put a dot before asp and itemtemplate for this post

4300932
cvs	svn
as drupal.org is in the process of moving from cvs to git i wouldn t recommend svn

4300941
entities	entitymanager
ejb 3 to play with jpa entities using entitymanager in session beans

4300946
min	max
to reference them you just need an i_min i_max j_min j_max and instead of running indices from 0 to n-1 run them from min to max

4300962
inline	inlining
unless your function is declared static it will have external linkage and the compiler is unlikely to consider it a candidate for inlining when it makes its own decisions about which functions to inline

4300969
mouseover	mousedown
set the formborderstyle none and then use mouseover and mousedown events to custom handle your move or look into the splitcontainer

4301014
spaces	delimiter
there are other control characters such as 0 null which are sometimes used as information delimiter but they won t be rendered as a spaces in east asian text - they won t appear as white-space

4301054

4301073
submit	submission
when i submit the form i wanna diable the form to be submited till the previous submission happens

4301137
getter	setter
the java bean containing the above fields and having corresponding getter and setter

4301137
getter	setter
i.e the bean s getter and setter the presence of validation annotations the ability of the dao to save the user the presence of the relevant form elements in the ui

4301142
getter	setter
normally at each point where the function is used the compiler generates cpu-specific machine code to directly call that function and for inline functions the call may be avoided and the function s affect may be optimally integrated into the caller s code which can be 10x faster for small functions such as getter and setter that simply read or write one member variable

4301150
pop-up	dialog
i have a link that when it clicked it ll open the pop-up dialog window this is done through ajax it requests to a controller name login_window

4301168
post	get
instead of detecting whether your request was an ajax request or not which can be any http verb - get post head you may wanna try and add modify routes to your routes.php for specifically handling these scenarios

4301178
implements	extends
to implements an unmodifiable collection the programmer needs only to extends this class and provide implementations for the iterator and size methods

4301211
implements	extends
and one recommendation if you plan to implements your own collection interface consider extends corresponding abstract class but not implements interface itself cause abstract classes implements methods general to the interface

4301271
integer	unsigned
indeed if anything signed integer math may be faster than unsigned integer math since unsigned integer math is required to behave predictably in case of overflow whereas unsigned math isn t

4301271
int	chars
note that in the c language chars is an odd case since all chars within the c chars set are required to translate as non-negative values so machines which use an 8-bit chars type with an ebcdic chars set are required to have chars be unsigned but an int is required to hold all values that a chars can hold so machines where both chars and int are 16 bits are required to have chars be signed

4301301
getter	setter
getter and setter - most definitely not

4301327
margin	height
in the click handler for your link use jquery s animate function to increase the height of #footer and to make the other necessary padding margin adjustments simultaneously

4301327
fadein	fadeout
set the expanded view to be display none initially and then use jquery s fadein and fadeout functions within the click handler or the animate callback to swap the visibility of the expanded and collapsed views within the footer

4301344
realloc	calloc
of course also realloc and calloc shall be implemented but memory block cannot be used by other software which expect normal malloced memory

4301344
free	malloc
another way to do this is to hash the pointer and collect memory information by hooking the malloc free functions

4301355
post	get
so my add action presents the form on get request and process it on post request

4301369
mouse	keyboard
for example i want to count number of characters entered by user when user do cut paste in editor via keyboard or mouse with context menu also

4301405
post	get
we just redesigned a web application and as a result we ve noticed a bug in chrome but it supposedly affects all webkit browsers that causes a full image js css reload after a post redirect get

4301434
factors	mean
what i mean by prime a number is to get all prime factors of the number

4301438

4301472
client-side	server-side
this works properly with asp.net mvc s server-side validation and client-side validation

4301487
wordpress	joomla
you can look at joomla drupal or wordpress to achieve this

4301487
codeigniter	cakephp

4301499
pow	sqrt
it happens for sqrt log but for others not for instance pow

4301506
onresume	onpause
another approach is to register your broadcastreceiver in your activity s onstart or onresume method using registerreceiver and unregister it in onstop or onpause using unregisterreceiver

4301524
disk	ram
databases are among the hardest technology to scale out so to get the most out of it make sure your database is running on a machine with loads of ram fast disk and no other responsibilities

sure that s probably compiled or jit d away but you should avoid division in performance critical code it s far slower than multiplying

4301639
portrait	landscape
each page is of width 768.0px in portrait mode and 1024.0px in landscape mode

4301653
google-chrome	firefox

use a debugging tool like firebug for firefox the developer tools in google-chrome webkit or the what s-it-called thingummy in ie and look at the applied styles for the div ul li

4301814
webclient	webrequest
instead of submitting through the form i.e form action ... ... i would like to dynamically post using webrequest or webclient class

4302177
inherited	properties
it s inconsistent that inherited properties type 10 shut down later than local template properties sets type 4b but then i m not sure it s reasonable to expect any particular order here

4302246
inherited	properties
perhaps you want to change the tint-color properties nonatomic retain uicolor tintcolor because uisegmentedcontrol has no background-color just because it inherited it from uiview does not mean it uses it though

4302674
public	protected
supertype s public protected and if

4302748
realloc	malloc
for an assignment i need to allocate a dynamic buffer using malloc for the inital buffer and realloc to expand that buffer if needed

put	get
the performance penalty of finalizers is that they make your objects live for longer than they need to in the first gc cycle where they re otherwise considered eligible for collection they get put on the finalizer queue - and bumped up to the next generation just like any other object which survives a gc cycle

4303316
stdout	stderr
edit paul pointed out that output might go to stderr so my solution is to redirect output to stdout and continue hacking strings

4303318
ant	maven
if you are using maven that you should learn maven if you are using ant than just rewrite the part thaht uses these libs

4303607
128bit	64bit
what i need is a deterministic csprng that seeds of a random number and a passphrase and that can produce in an indexed fashion 64bit or 128bit blocks of numbers

4303607
128bit	64bit
note the blocknumbers will be assigned and have a regular structure so for example for a 128bit digest the first 64bit of block 0 will be for the ivec and all of element 1 for the 128bit key

4303618
hide	show
i looked at google maps and it seems like they display the link in a textarea inside a show hide span

4303650
filesystems	ntfs
ads allow you to attach content to files on ntfs filesystems

4303650
filesystems	ntfs
when the file is copied directly between ntfs filesystems the streams get copied too

onclick	onsubmit
attach an onsubmit handler to the form not a onclick handler to the submit button

4303674
rtp	rtsp
in your case if you want broadcasting streaming server then you need both rtsp for control as well as rtp broadcasting audio and video

in my flex app i have a control with a fixed height and width enough to show two lines

4303866
int	chars
the only way to store an arraylist in bundle if this arraylist can not be explain as an array of any primary type int chars etc... is to serialize the data and to store it in the bundle as serializable

4303884
vb.net	vb6
this tool was created in vb6 and recently we have started migration to vb.net

4303888
post	get

i need to get a list of months that contain post in the post table along with the count of post for the month

4304761
children	parent
eg when the parent knows how to create all the children it may be a good practice

4304761
children	parent
another problem is testability if parent has lots of children it may be hard to create parent in isolation from the children but again it depends

4304794
tinyint	boolean
let hibernate use tinyint for boolean variables

4304802
int	chars

4304813
hide	show
show hide thumb grid is painfully slow in ie8

4304819
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
use either the sorteddictionary like codeinchaos mentioned or a sortedlist

4304819
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
you need some sort of update loop that will just look at the first index of the values property of your sortedlist or sorteddictionary o 1 operation and see if the system date is past that item s expiration date

4304819
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
whenever you add a new item to your main collection add a reference to it in this sortedlist sorteddictionary and provide the expiration date as the key to sort by

4304897
hide	show
now you can just set the classname of the ancestor #categories element and all the thumbs inside will show hide depending on whether they have a matching class for that category

4304902
multiplying	add
this was certainly true 40 years ago when it was first developed but i believe in more modern processors the difference between add and multiplying has gotten smaller

4304903
set	bag
i can see that it possible to get the web s property bag but not to set but can t see any support for the property bag on either the list or list item

4304911
jboss	glassfish
you can use glassfish or jboss for a free app server that has ejb support out of the box

uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
say i pass a uiviewcontroller to a uinavigationcontroller like so

4305107
spaces	delimiter
pay attention that the argument is not a simple delimiter but regular expression so in your case you can say str.split s+ that splits your sentence into separate words event if the words are delimiter by several spaces

4305116
mergesort	heapsort
the alternatives were heapsort and mergesort since java was created in the early 1990s

4305235
jboss	glassfish
so if there s room for upgrading upgrade to servlet 3.0 tomcat 7 glassfish 3 jboss 6 etc and you don t need a wrapper

4305256
unsigned	short
why not use the jchar since it maps directly to a unsigned short - then you can cast directly

4305315
base-class	subclassing
protected - the most obvious case - all subclassing can call the constructor irrespective of which assembly they reside in as long as the the abstract base-class itself is visible to them

4305315
base-class	subclassing	inherited	base-class	inherited	subclassing
only subclassing within the same assembly as the abstract base-class would be able to call the constructors - effectively only they would be able to inherited

4305315
public	protected
public - not useful behaves identically to protected

4305315
base-class	subclassing
only subclassing can call the constructor anyway since the base-class is abstract

4305315
base-class	subclassing	public	protected
however the internal modifier here serves no purpose - it doesn t prevent subclassing residing outside the assembly from calling the constructor assuming the abstract base-class is public since they can rely on protected access nor does it allow same-assembly types that are not subclassing from calling it the type is abstract

4305315
public	protected
public and protected internal don t accomplish anything because they appear to weaken restrictions but don t really succeed in doing so

4305342
gson	jackson
i have looked into gson and jackson but was unable to conceive a solution for myself

wsdualhttpbinding	basichttpbinding
i wanted to use wcf callback contracts to create a subscribe unsubscribe architecture for my services however i have recently found out that i can t use wsdualhttpbinding on windows phone 7 but only basichttpbinding

4305785
inherited	properties
a key aspect of protected members is that a class can effectively seal off inherited protected members from access by any classes other than its ancestors it would be nice if a class could both override a parent s method properties and also block child classes from accessing it but so far as i can tell there s no way of doing that without adding an extra layer of hierarchy

4305790
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
you can roll your own collection class that implements inotifycollectionchanged and inotifypropertychanged

4306160
awt	swing
you should not use an awt component canvas in a swing application

4306164
for-loop	arrays
this problem then reduces to just finding these patterns in the arrays which can be done using a simple for-loop

4306206
redmine	trac
i considered using redmine after reading this question but i d rather stay with trac if i can

4306219
int	chars	hex	binary
a big int which increments the second i have tried defining it as a chars varchar and binary but im still not getting the desired function say i try and store 0a a hex number into

4306249
int	chars
since the size of chars is 1 the padding for a and c is 4 - 1 3 bytes while no padding is required for int b which is already 4 bytes

4306264
ubuntu	linux
its been installed by default in ubuntu since 8.x and is now a part of the linux mainline

you ll want to inherited your own class from panel so that you can set the doublebuffered properties to true in the constructor

4306344
onenote	ms-office
i dont want to go the ocr route because i need the accuracy that i think i can get from some sort of ms-office automation between excel and onenote

4306344
onenote	ms-office
msdn has a developer site for ms-office and onenote but i must be blind to not see any examples or even an object model

4306353
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
i would also advise that instead of using a sqldatasource as i have you use an objectdatasource so that you can do something like

4306356
ethernet	wireless
a computer might have both onboard wireless 802.11 and wired ethernet adapters either of which could be primary at any given time or even at the same time

4306416
express	node.js
the closest thing is likely dav glass s experimental work using node.js express and yui3

4306428
folder	directory
the windows equivalent for me was to go in to the java directory and place the files in the bin and lib folder

4306501
uiview	calayer
on an iphone this isn t very different from a uiview because a uiview is then just a lightweight wrapper around a calayer

4306532
int	chars
another scenario is that in theory a pointer to int could be 2 bits smaller than a pointer to chars if an int is always 4-aligned

4306544
base	fractions
if you are trying to represent a fractions that is irrational or repeating in base 2 the sequence of bits will be rounded off at the 23rd bit

4306762
min	max
ok so if the order of the topic in wich the book will be counted doesn t matter the solution it s actually very simple you just need to do a min or max over the topic_id when you define your datasource table

4306762
min	max
you should be aware that the book is being counted only in the min or max topic it appears

4306768
filesystems	ntfs
i understand that it is the permissions issue because ntfs filesystems do not support unix permissions but how it can be that on 10.04 was everything ok

4306782
google-chrome	firefox
i made the whole development using firefox and google-chrome for testing so i knew i would have to tweak some styling because of iexplorer mostly ie6

4306795
jar	war
that repository structure is why your jar and war files end up in different folders when you do the mvn release perform which is another way of asking maven to do a mvn deploy

4306795
jar	war	ant	maven
now if you want to keep with the maven way of doing things you should write another script shell ant your choice for deployment that would get those jar and war files from the remote maven artifact repository and bundle them up the way you want and deploy it to the server s you want them installed on

4306795
jar	war
now you can change maven to sort of do what you want your are asking but you ll have to create another project module that only does bundling of the jar and war files in the way you want as an archive file tar gzip zip

4306884
filesystems	ntfs
the default mount options for ntfs filesystems probably changed between ubuntu versions

4306905

g++	gcc
edit i ve replaced g++ with g++ -fpic gcc with gcc -fpic and nvcc with nvcc -xcompiler -fpic

versioning	upgrade
an alternative would be to run my code on typhoon app engine with a newer python but i fear google won t upgrade their python versioning for a loooong time.

4307422
versioning	upgrade
i never upgrade jre an i m almost sure that the java versioning was always 1.6.0_22

4307485
hide	show
i thought it d be simplistic to implement a show e function that takes an element e to be displayed and hide everything but e

4307488
onfocus	onblur
if you want to have considerable backwards compatibility in this regard you will need to react to the onfocus and onblur events of the input element produced by the textbox control

4307518
width	height
also the other problem is to check the height as well as the width so no numbers occur more than once ordinary sudoku rules

4307539
put	get
i have had the hierarchy for the root messages that i save into table exactly same as birth put under with exception that i do get any parent_id from twitter just msg_id. actually that is basic reason for storing tweets into database to add value into parent_id column

4307587
post	get
that could be set through get post session or whatever you find fit to use

4307638

seeing as its just a boolean i considered giving each user an int and later more int as an array where each bit represents a lesson and performing bitwise operators on those numbers to get the information about which lessons they ve saved.

4307650
width	height
you need to use height and width instead either in an ie6-only stylesheet or with the star hack to target ie6 only

4307657
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
also this has to work in any modern browser ie7 firefox google-chrome safari

inherited	subclassing
about the only time that a base class object won t have the same address as its subclassing object is when multiple inherited is involved

vbscript	jscript
problem is that checkaccess returns result as out argument and i could not find vbscript s byref equivalent in jscript

4307691
width	height
1 photoshop actions could do this but i would have to pull current height multiply by 1.333333 and then put that value in the width box of the canvas resize

4307712
teamcity	nant
you can adjust teamcity for this mostly for build and deploy automation after each commit or time-based schedule or use some simple but powerful utility like nant with predefined configurations

haskell	ocaml
i spent the last 18 months getting the grip of functional programming starting with learning ocaml and for some weeks now haskell

4308137
haskell	ocaml
now some imho quite annoying proponent of ocaml quite frequently bitches against haskell being slow compared to ocaml or f#

4308137
haskell	ocaml
but according to the the computer language benchmarks game haskell oftenly beats ocaml if only by rather small fractions â there remains the problem that this benchmark takes only very specific samples

4308147
opennlp	lingpipe
for open source you can look at lingpipe and gate and opennlp

4308176
children	parent
the state of the children should drive the state of the parent

decoder	encoder
and vote for native encoder decoder in actionscript fp-1631

4308335
serializable	deserialization
if you substitute the string parameter with one of type java.lang.object then the jaxb runtime is bound to find difficulties during serializable and deserialization as no such bindings exist that determine how the runtime should perform such a process

4308350
sorting	filtering
in my project i have an ajax front end where the table contains editable controls and column sorting filtering

4308386

in your subclassing i notice that you have an announcement variable that doesn t seem to show up in your superclass

4308588
superclass	subclassing
in your dealloc of the subclassing you release announcementtext which is also released in the superclass not announcement which is probably the cause of your leakage

4308592
versioning	upgrade
ive just upgrade to eclipse 3.6 and i have a seam application running on jboss 5 with the latest versioning of jboss tools

4308606
ubuntu	linux
i am trying to create a software simulation on an ubuntu gnu linux machine which will work like pppoe

4308642
google-chrome	firefox
another thing to test would be to do a view source or inspect element if you re using google-chrome or firebug in firefox and see if the html code is being placed where it should be

4308650
post	get
check to see whether there s a configdate parameter either get or post

4308672
post	put
400 bad request itâ s commonly used when the client submits a representation along with a put or post request and the representation is in the right format but it doesnâ t make any sense

4308679
pull	push
session a would have to push data into the pipe and session b would have to pull it

4308716
addclass	removeclass
you can use addclass and removeclass

4308717
dictionary	map
what i would suggest is either using a map dictionary data type or storing the keys and values in a single object and then having an array of said objects

4308718
hide	show
the wiki will tend to contain the major features while the bugtracker will contain minor features like add a button to show hide a section or something ...but the limit between major and minor features is very subjective and will tend to get messy so i ll have a hard time searching for a feature - i ll have to search in both wiki and bugtracker or i ll have to remember if it was a major or a minor feature

4308722
instances	transient
object references an unsaved transient instances - save the transient instances before flushing

4308762
post	get
when the call completes twilio will post or get to the url with all the same variables it passes during a normal request

4308769
nsurlconnection	nsoutputstream
though i ve never used it myself from reading around the topic i think you need to use an nsoutputstream rather than an nsurlconnection which is toll-free bridged with cfwritestream

4308777
serializable	deserialization
so the problem is serializable and deserialization works fine

4308777
width	height
no errors and the dictionary has entries with what seems to be bitmapimages however their width height and

4308797
ivar	subclassing
in your subclassing setannouncementtext withsize actually does nothing to the announcementtext ivar which is confusing i guess

4308817
svnadmin	svnlook
if on the machine with the mirror repository my situation use the svnlook tool to look and svnadmin to change

4308838
width	height
the iphone4 resizes your content to fit its higher-res retina display compared to the older iphone and with that scaling i have sometimes noticed blur when using pixel values for block height width font size etc

4308845
interpolation	splines
i d like to quote introduction to catmull-rom splines to suggest not using catmull-rom for this interpolation task

4308874
width	height
the large image s width is always set to 600 but the height can be regulated as needed

4308877
width	height
the issue was that the floated divs didn t have hard width and height

4308882
haskell	ocaml
but according to the the computer language benchmarks game haskell often beats ocaml if only by rather small fractions â there remains the problem that this benchmark takes only very specific samples

4308882
haskell	ocaml
the benchmarks game reports 4 sets of results - one core and quad core 32 or 64 bit ubuntu - and you may find that the ocaml or haskell benchmark programs perform better or worse depending on the platform

4308917
typedef	struct
if you have the option to use visual studio 2010 there is highlighterr which changes the colors of classes struct macros and typedef

4308939
put	get
all i need to do is get the second line put into numbers

4308945
automake	autotools
i am using the gnu autotools including automake

bmp	png	gif	ico	gif	bmp	gif	png	png	ico
with you can either draw your own or upload a jpg jpeg gif png bmp or ico

4309013
button	checkbox
i tried to disable mousechildren mouseenabled and other possible parameters which would disable those tooltips from preventing user clicking on some button or checkbox

4309025
japplet	jdialog
it seems that while you can add actions to components you can t add them to containers such as jframe japplet or jdialog

4309037
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
when using fractional pixel values not percentages they work as suggested in the article i linked ie9p7 and ff4b7 seem to round to the nearest pixel while opera 11b google-chrome 9.0.587.0 and safari 5.0.3 truncate the decimal places

4309051
integer	fractions
as martin pointed out things break down when you get to fractions pixels but if your percentage values yield integer pixel value 50.5 of 200px in the example you ll get sensible expected behaviour

4309065
for-loop	loops
note i m using activeregion because in the spark parser activeregion gets declared as a variable and assigned the value of region in the current scope as you loops through the for-loop

4309084
equals	gethashcode
note that overriding equals means you should also override gethashcode which is another kettle of fish and can be quite difficult to do correctly

4309096
equals	gethashcode
gethashcode must be implemented in tandem with equals overloads

4309103
ubuntu	linux
update it happens when i run it under linux hardy 2.6.24-16-generic it does not happen under ubuntu 9.10

4309114
hide	show
so they don t look like tabs and when you click them nothing hide show as would be expected with tabs

4309115
google-chrome	safari
given that this works in google-chrome and safari it would seem that your markup styles are correct though

4309115
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if so then the styles you add will only affect those elements which are part of the dom at that point in time so you might be experiencing a race condition that actually happens to work in google-chrome and safari but not firefox

4309153
postgresql	mysql
i will be deploying a ruby on rails application soon active record orm and my database mysql or postgresql will be located at an external location outside of 127.0.0.1 range

4309160
children	parent
i ve created deeply nested grid layout systems where parent widths are ems and children are percents and including up to four decimal points upstream had a noticeable impact

4309163
gridview	rowdatabound
though i set the modified ds and databind on the gridview it never fires the rowdatabound afterwards

4309199
ssl	https
several security experts have said in the past that the login page should be on ssl https

4309199
post	put
i read it s possible to put the form on http but post it to https but i read someone saying that it can be exploited with a man in the middle attack

4309200
versioning	upgrade
to make sure the mapping models where correct i upgrade it to each versioning one by one 10 to 11 11 to 12 etc.. and it did work..

4309207
quicksort	mergesort
quicksort mergesort etc for small values of m and maybe do that linear search for bigger values of m

4309218
bazaar	git	pull	push
with mercurial or git subversion or bazaar you can set up a server on your machine or with one of the public sites and either push or pull updates to your production server

4309239
post	put
i read it s possible to put the form on http but post it to https but i read someone saying that it can be exploited with a man in the middle attack

4309301
google-chrome	safari
webkit is the render engine used by google-chrome and safari and is very flexible

4309307
wordpress	joomla
both wordpress and joomla create forms as straight html so you can only alter it by altering the code that creates it which quickly turns into a maintenance headache

4309323
calloc	malloc
you also shouldn t have a cast on malloc calloc etc. generally speaking it can obscure useful warnings and you need to allocate six slots like i said so you can have the null-terminator which is the zero-valued character so we don t need to set it explicitly

4309323
calloc	malloc
combine that with the indexing mode include the missing stdlib.h for calloc you should have had it for malloc too and we re good to go

4309364
firefox	safari
on firefox v3.6 safari v5 and ie9 the red value comes back as 67 all on windows

4309364
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
on os x google-chrome v7 safari v5 and firefox v3.6 also come back as 67

4309377
put	get
when you put that code into your html document you get this button in that span element in an iframe

4309410
googletest	gmock
googletest and gmock looks like nice libraries with mockingsupport however it requires every object that shall be mocked to be virtual

4309417
equals	gethashcode
the other answers have pretty much covered the fact that you need to implement equals and gethashcode correctly but as a side note you may be interested to know that anonymous types have these values implemented automatically

4309417
equals	gethashcode
so without ever having to define this class you automatically get the equals and gethashcode behavior you re looking for

4309438
width	height
the tiles have some fixed size and you want to put them on a surface of a fixed width and minimum height

4309450
children	parent
i have an abstract parent class that has a constructor that is injected with an object shared by all derived children and each child also has an injectable constructor

4309455
google-chrome	firefox
all this works on google-chrome and firefox but in ie the button seams to dont exist

4309457
valgrind	glibc
the valgrind report is a well-known issue - either a false positive or a bug in glibc

4309472
openjpa	openejb
i m using openejb which relies on openjpa behind the scenes for unit testing and found when stepping through openjpa code that it successfully persists the document object but when it comes to the section object it creates a new instance reflectively and sets all fields to null so losing the sectionnum value before linking it to the document object persisted earlier

4309506
uiview	subviews
if i were to guess i would say that they have added a uiview with a transparent background which has a uiimageview for the photo and a tableview as a subviews

4309508
getter	setter
without using spring and only using getter and setter methods i am able set a list and retrieve it using get

4309547
uitableview	uisegmentedcontrol
what i have is a uitableview with a uisegmentedcontrol with two categories one that displays all and one that when selected should display only events what were created today

4309641
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
the space in my case was caused by the uinavigationbar part of the uinavigationcontroller taking into account the status bar and it was actually overlapping part of the view that i was trying to show in the uinavigationcontroller

4309668
google-chrome	firefox
start by ensuring that what you ve just developed works in firefox and google-chrome and then verify it in ie

4309687
vb.net	vb6
also developing enterprise application is such new languages java c# vb.net rubby is easier that vb6 because they rely on frameworks every body can write c# java code that function but it requires tricks good practices and some of imagination to write vb6 strong and rehusable code

4309697
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i suggest ie 7 + 8 firefox google-chrome and safari as in order of importance

4309719
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
works in firefox google-chrome safari opera and ie9

4309774

it works fine in firefox and safari and is just an ie problem

4309823
octal	hex
unambiguous octal and hex escapes in strings like and

4309873
implements	extends
i never extends thread class but implements runnable callable interface

4309893
keydown	keyup
with keydown and keyup you ll be running your function twice for each pressed key which may not be what you want

4309923
children	parent
a parent and two children

4309949
fadein	fadeout
more details is like if we click beta the alpha will show it s fadein fadeout effect

4309954
hide	show
this would hide controllera s layout and show controllerb s layout -- or render the layout if not already in the dom

4309964
firefox	safari
i am trying to make an app with tabs at the top that link a website too each one such as a computer that uses tabs in safari or firefox

4309987
folder	directory
the long route would be to simply branch checkout into a new folder and diff redo the new changes over but i would like to avoid recoding changes or running a kdiff directory merge operation

4309991
jquery	scriptaculous
hi i have my code here in jquery for my footer chat panel and it is conflict with scriptaculous

4310031
comparator	comparable
if the class of the object implements comparable then all you need to do is properly code the comparator method to first compare dates and then if dates are equals compare values and then return the appropriate int result based on the findings

4310045
cpu	processors
user cpu time is time spent on the processors running your program s code or code in libraries

4310071
profiling	instrumentation
any profiling that inserts instrumentation into your program will inherently affect the performance in ways that might skew or invalidate the results

4310076
profiling	instrumentation
to answer your first question time the command-line utility times the execution of the whole process including the profiling instrumentation itself

4310076
profiling	instrumentation
the profiling instrumentation tries hard to separate out its own impact on the time accounting and in this case it seems that the profiling itself accounted for 2.34 - 1.18 1.16s of the runtime as reported by time

4310143
backgrounding	multitasking
-with multitasking you should call the passcode view in the becomeactive method in the app delegate too the way that your app could prompt for a passcode when in returns from backgrounding

4310160
pull	push
this would use what git calls remotes which are references to what a remote repository contains in order for you to be able to pull it into your own branch push your branch into the remote repository etc

4310169
int	chars
a phone numbers aren t actually int they are chars strings and should be stored in the database as such

4310172
pascal	delphi
in hindsight outdated books weren t as problematic as the more current books because the more current books are written for an audience that knows both pascal and delphi and thus leave out a lot of crucial info for the newbie

4310172
pascal	delphi
the delphi 5 books are equally as long as later editions but spend all of those pages on the win32 features of the vcl and some very valuable tutorials on pascal which is handy for those of us that went through our school years without learning pascal

4310178
children	parent
also you don t know how many children a parent has should you wish to resize it

4310252
post	get
here are other post that did not get me anywhere

4310274
associativity	operator-precedence
operator-precedence and associativity only affect the way operators are bound to operands

4310314
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m using fullcalendar with a json feed and as per usual it works fine in firefox google-chrome safari but ie7 is not playing ball

4310342
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
ok so i have this page and when viewed in firefox the proper results show up but when i look at it in google-chrome or safari it is way off

4310342
google-chrome	safari
so as you can see the code is a bit off and i think that maybe the problem with why safari and google-chrome are off...any suggestions

4310359
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this will get the desired result in both firefox and google-chrome safari

4310416
integer	unsigned
the values were converted from the range 0 to 65535 unsigned 16-bit integer to -32768 to 32767 signed 16-bit integer using two s complement

4310441
firefox	safari
this works wonderfully in firefox and safari but is being blocked by internet explorer 8 s protection against scripted downloads

4310448
postgresql	mysql
i use mysql and sqlite often and plan on bringing more postgresql into my workflow soon

4310482
mouseleave	mouseenter
to bind a hover event manually you have to bind the mouseenter and mouseleave events jquery s hover documentation mentions that hover actually binds mouseenter and mouseleave event handlers

4310495
children	parent
ideally you would want to encapsulate the conditional creation of the children in the parent form

4310555
int	chars
so i am assuming table with id int stringval string chars varchar whatever

4310563
post	get
when i get the new contents via post the tabs function abort and don t build the

4310587
haskell	ocaml
by all accounts both ocaml and haskell have sufficiently performant compilers and runtimes for almost anything

4310587
haskell	ocaml
if you want only very coarse parallelism at best and you intend to stick with mostly functional structures then pick based on something else like syntax i think haskell is much nicer here but that s subjective or available libraries haskell wins on quantity availability but ocaml might edge it out in the graphics department nonetheless

min	max
autoconfig false min 2 2 max 40 40 maxconnections 10 httpruntime settings 8 4

after reading this other so answer i tried replacing unsigned short d with unsigned char and unsigned short e with bool

4310738
textview	imageview
i m having a problem displaying the layout when my imageview and textview takes up more than 3 4 of the screen

4310802
firefox	safari
works on firefox and safari etc but dies after you go in and out of the various levels one or two times

4310802
firefox	safari
as i said it works fine in firefox and safari but simply dies in ie

4310806
width	height
init function cid width height

4310819
min	max
another way to look at it is 2 lines - one for max price and one for min price

4310824
for-loop	loops
use a for-loop with the f switch and the option to loops through every line in the file and store the lines in the variable i

4310856
codeigniter	cakephp
the above code is codeigniter and i think cakephp also following same coding style

4310911
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
create the objectoutputstream before the objectinputstream at both ends

4310911
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
the constructor of objectoutputstream writes a header to the stream that the constructor of objectinputstream reads so if you create the objectinputstreams first you get a deadlock

4310953
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox doesn t have problems with this but safari cries invalid date

4310963
getter	setter
for example by providing only public getter on my interfaces and leaving it up to implementors to decide upon setter and how to handle that aspect

4311006
jar	war
followed the instructions of the example i moved all the jar files out of the war module and put it into a lib folder within ear file

4311012
division	modulo
here you will get 2 as division and 10 will be yr modulo

4311051
getter	setter
this way your mutable interface has full getter and setter i don t think it makes sense to have an interface that has setter but no getter but any object that implements it will also have an immutable version of the interface that you can use for any pure-functional code

4311087
websphere	ibm
i am trying to integrate websphere portal with my custom user registry.i have completed all the steps required to implement custom user registry in portal as given in ibm documentation.i am adding my custom repository to the default federated repositories of portal 7.0.i have made the required changes under vmm federated cur properties section in wkplc.properties.i am using configengine.bat file to configure portal with user registry

opennlp	lingpipe
since you asked for pointers lingpipe already mentioned above opennlp and stanford nlp distributions

spaces	delimiter	punctuation	words
don t assume words are delimiter by spaces or that sentences are delimiter by punctuation if you re trying to support search

4311118
rss	feed
ive set the rss feed in the drupal admin to set rss feed to show 30 items per feed

4311119
nsresponder	nscell	nstextfield	nstableview
since none of the other nstableview components nscell nstextfieldcell etc derive from nsresponder i m assuming there is an nstextfield buried in there somewhere

4311131
onresume	onpause
consider stopping this after onpause has been called and to resume it after onresume

4311215
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
graphicsmagick is generally a better version of imagemagick i d take a look at that

4311268
width	height
for example to decode at half width and half height discard all but the upper-left quadrant of the coefficients horizontal and vertical frequency 4 and use a 4x4 idct on them instead of the usual 8x8

4311279
min	max
i m also looking into the max min size of the data that will be supplied

4311289
pop-up	dialog
i m able to use the javascript sdk to successfully present a login extended permissions dialog in a pop-up window with either fb.login or the following code

4311289
pop-up	dialog
and getting them to show up via javascript also require an extra click from the user for no reason -- in order to get around pop-up blockers the user has to click on something like a login button largely pointless given that by the time the app knows it needs to display a login button it already knows the user needs to log in and may as well just present the permissions dialog

4311302
min	max
push all the min max x values into a set and sort them thus creating a list of vertical regions spanning the x-axis

4311302
min	max
repeat this procedure for min max y values to create a list of horizontal regions and associate each region with the set of bounding boxes it contains

4311303
superclass	subclassing
in other circumstances you may have subclassing the linkedhashset for instance extends hashset but it still makes a lot of sense to instantiate the superclass hashset in this case

4311341
post	get
try to change the request method from post to get

4311387
pull	push
for example you could set up a bare central repository on one computer s shared folder and then push pull to from it from both computer s local clones that you use for development

4311397
mouse	keyboard
you can use chinmayee s .click approach but check and double check that everything works properly when you use the keyboard rather than the mouse or you can add a click handler to all your radio buttons that blurs and refocuses

4311468
put	get
if you put something out you can only get that output if you buffer the output using the output control â s ob_start

4311495
put	get
f is never in the g because you never put it there so no possible chance it could get there

4311578
pop-up	dialog
after a reboot and the first time the app is run it normally manages to initialise the webcam ok and get regular frames from it but the next time the app is run it fails to locate the webcam driver and also pop-up a dialog asking me to specify the video source presumably because it can t find one

4311694
width	height
i have a histogram with integer height and constant width 1

4311696
for-loop	arrays
there is only one arrays you are constructing outside the for-loop

4311712
folder	directory
so i created an endorsed directory within the java_home jre lib folder

4311714
children	parent
you can iterate through a form s mdi children using the form s mdichildren property such that when on mdi child window changes its formwindowstate the mdi parent form can apply the change to each of its children similar to the shared formwindowstate approach

4311727
content-disposition	content-type
make the script execute on a certain url with mod_wsgi then the script should set the content-type provides document type such as text plain and content-disposition provides download filename headers and send the document data

4311754
keystore	jks
keystore.getinstance jks than you can add multiple certificates with an alias to that one keystore

4311799
fast-forward	merge
this will be a fast-forward merge that should do what you want

4311877
folder	directory
after trying to look up a solution i found that windows 7 had an issue with developer stuff being put outside of users directory so then i installed it again this time in c users username folder

4311889
put	get
the only concern is that the various defaults should be grouped in a number of smaller in the sense of number of fields tables otherwise you won t get any benefit from this approach if you put all the possible settings in a single table record you will have to duplicate everything as soon as the user changes just one field and this will give no benefit at all

4311900
innodb	myisam
to be clear the ddl i have provided should work for myisam and do nothing in the dri department until you get innodb

cobertura	emma
if you are lucky enough to have excellent test coverage another option is to use a code coverage analysis tool like cobertura clover or emma

4312017
width	height
well after a while and quite a long time gazing at the code wondering what the hell was wrong with it it occurred to me that the link directly within the li.submenu was set to display block with width and height set to 100

4312022
serializable	deserialization
i don t think sub-classing feels right here like serveritem item considering serializable deserialization

4312039
portrait	landscape
i want to change the view from right to left like a page turn whatever be the iphone orientation landscape or portrait .

4312100
keydown	keyup

4312208
cstring	bstr
but in this scenario you could use cstring allocsysstring to convert it to a bstr which is compatible with pcwstr

4312209
implements	extends
think like implements an interface or extends a base class to have these properties

4312281
datediff	difference
you need to do self join and get difference using datediff function and get average

google-chrome	firefox
however the plug-ins are still registered by google-chrome and firefox

4312341
width	height
you can expose a .size property that would contain the height width of user control

4312361
implements	extends
as shown in the button table example we will create a class that extends jbutton and implements tablecellrenderer

4312395
int	boolean
it doesn t know which version of databind you re trying to use because nothing is convertible to both boolean and int

4312397
rss	feed
you could use the views data source module to re-create a rss feed of any length -

4312421
inherited	properties
i ve rolled singleton into a class so other classes can inherited singleton properties

4312423
google-chrome	safari
but when i refresh page with google-chrome or safari the cycle starts ignoring the pause command

4312431
unsigned	short
note that if your native platform does use more than 32 bits for long or 16 bits for short you have to manage the sign issue if they are signed integers because the actual type for ntohl is unsigned

4312445
getter	setter
properties automatically generate those getter and setter

4312446
getter	setter
iphone error object cannot be set - either readonly property or no setter found error comes when you have not synthesized it and still accessing its setter or and getter method

4312474
webkit	gecko
as the both styles related to gecko webkit are css you can use a class to apply it

4312498
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
like the mozuserselect styling in firefox you can use -webkit-user-select none for webkit based browser like safari and google-chrome

4312509
hash	md5
as for such storing passwords it is not very good while many crackers can use rainbow tables with precomputed md5 sha1 and other hash and they can get password based on such hash

4312509
hash	salt
to prevent it salt should be used hash salt+passwd such salt can be random string saved in database per user or for example user login something that never can be changed

4312532
google-chrome	safari
for wekbit google-chrome and safari you can add

4312549
tapestry	wicket	jsf	wicket	jsf	tapestry
not aware of jsf wicket and tapestry based apps but google wave adwords adsense are built using gwt

4312580
width	height
the problem is that when this view fly s in..its width and height changes

4312647
post	get
if you mean a list of recent post then you just get the data from the database and display it in a wall-like way

4312653
equals	compareto
the problem is even treeset.contains returns false i can still find one element in the treeset which is equals when using compareto and equals methods

4312660
integer	unsigned
but the silence value you get given is an unsigned 8-bit integer

4312678
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
opera google-chrome and safari will automatically download the whole video file even if it hasn t started to play yet

4312678
opera	firefox
opera plans to change to the firefox behavior of only loading enough to render a frame and determine duration by default unless the preload attribute says otherwise

4312684
multiplying	add
iteration is looping like you add 1+1+1+1+1 iteratively adding to get 5 or 3 3 3 3 3 iteratively multiplying to get 3 5

4312691
post	get
other approaches depending on your needs include using ajax to post get the request asynchronously or using include require to pull in abc.php if it only includes specific functioanlity.eg

4312722
piston	tastypie
you could try using something like piston or tastypie to quickly get something working

4312722
piston	tastypie
tastypie comes with a built-in shared-secret key authentication mechanism and it s not difficult to find the equivalent code for piston

4312722
piston	tastypie
edit btw i ve been working with both piston and tastypie recently

4312734
equals	compareto
your compareto and equals methods are not consistent and therfore the treeset cannot work correctly with them

4312734
comparator	comparable
see comparable or comparator for a

4312801
getter	setter
usually in my own projects i use getter and setter for any field access and i followed to do the same on my job

4312834
int	double
in order to apply number formatting you have to pass cash as a number type int double float etc

4312840
multiplying	add
multiplying and add to restore the original

4312841
put	get
you can design a window like it was a dialog and put it in your resourcefile .then use the findresource and loadresource functions to get a pointer to a dlgtemplate which contains all the dialogs layout which you can use to size you own window and place controls at the positions you defined in the dialog it s not easy though to interpret the dlgtemplate

4312864
getter	setter
you want to declare them as public getter and setter and private fields

4312864
getter	setter
this means external classes not subclasses who want to modify the variables all do so through the setter and get them through the getter

4312864
getter	setter	put	get
the benefit of this is that if you want to control how or what condition they get or set them or want to add information or even print debug it means you only have to put it in the getter and setter

4312864
public	protected
in java difference between default public protected and private

4312886
getter	setter
this is part of the general question as to why you use getter and setter

4312886
getter	setter
personally i only put in getter setter if i need to

4312886
getter	setter
in general if i can easily add a getter setter later should i need it i won t add it

4312893
getter	setter
if there is any business logic around those values or there is the potential for such logic then there is a benefit to using getter and setter even for internal calls

4312933
multiplying	add
we then multiplying 12 by the number of years difference and add this to the result giving us the full month span

4312971
getter	setter
reduces code behind bloat from getter and setter

4312977
public	protected
also i would make use of the template-method pattern that is a public non overridable getdata method which calls a protected virtual abstract method that should be overriden in a concrete implementation

4313009
getter	setter
that s my 2cent worth on why we have getter setter

4313038
maven	pom.xml
maven derives this information from the module declaration in the pom.xml file

4313052
width	height
you can then use the left top width and height css properties to see if an element is inside this boundary

4313139
superclass	subclassing
suppose that i have an abstract superclass abstract0 with two subclassing concrete1 and concrete1

4313142
innodb	myisam
however i solved the issue by using innodb engine instead of myisam

4313172
public	protected
why not roll them into a single builder abstract base class making the original abstract builder s public methods protected and the concrete subclasses override these as before

4313364
google-chrome	firefox
it does in firefox and internet explorer but not google-chrome

4313366
getter	setter
some people think that they should always encapsulate all fields by using setter getter

4313366
getter	setter
however you must or it s strongly recommended to use setter getter

4313366
getter	setter
in web applications sometimes there are requirements to use setter getter

4313366
getter	setter
if you want to add some extra logic when you set get values you must use setter getter

4313403
google-chrome	safari
i m playing around with websockets and it appears that all browsers with native websocket support i tested with safari google-chrome block some ports

4313411
opera	firefox
this solution works for me in ie firefox and opera

4313413
entities	entitymanager
if the employee vendor and customer entities and controllers are so logically separate as to need them in separate modules then i would say that clearly they should have their own entitymanager

4313433
ubuntu-server	debian
ps with installing newest 3.70uc1 version i had problem problem on one of my old debian machine but it installed without problems on ubuntu-server 9.10

4313454
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox and google-chrome but for some reason no data is added to the resultspage slideinresults is called and the empty page appears

4313455
put	get
i put together a regex to get this number but it refuses to work and i can t figure it out

4313458
tablet	galaxy
when i change my project to support android 2.2 i can still deploy the application to the galaxy tablet running on android 2.2

4313465
google-chrome	safari
but as soon as you move the cursor google-chrome and safari change the cursor style to pointer - exactly as it s expected but without mouse move

4313481
email	dkim
i m trying to sign email with dkim using phpmailer class and i can t get it to work

4313481
email	dkim
when i see the headers in my email on gmail i find that the class is successfully injecting dkim in the email header but gmail doesn t even care

4313481
email	dkim
the question is that i ve viewed the headers of linkedin email and i found out that they are using 2 dkim headers domainkey-signature dkim-signature

4313532
google-chrome	safari
the code below not working in google-chrome or safari

4313583
tablet	galaxy
create a new map api key for android 2.2 galaxy tablet

4313594
gif	png
and then there is really no need for gif support because the png file format is superior in almost every way

4313594
gif	png
the only thing supported by gif that is not supported by png is low-quality 1 animations.

4313605
gif	png
on the server the raw image data gif jpeg png is being encoded to base64 which already works fine and i need to decode this string and display the image in my flash movie

4313715
pylons	pyramid
i was planning to move from django to pylons but then i bumped into pyramid

4313715
pylons	pyramid
i read some text in pylonsbook which currently covers pylons 0.9.7 and wonder if it is a to start for pylons and pyramid

4313763
many-to-many	one-to-many
for the one-to-many or many-to-many hierarchy implement an extra table that would relate the two object

4313830
serializable	deserialization
deserialization does much the same thing as the first step by calling formatterservices.getuninitializedobject and then does much the same thing as the second step by setting the values for fields to be equivalent to those that were recorded during serializable which may require deserialising other objects to be said values

4313842
preferenceactivity	preferencescreen
i have created a preferenceactivity based on xml for preferencescreen

4313860
qimage	qwidget
using qt you can create a simple window with a qwebview this is webkit under the covers and then use qwidget render method to get qpixmap and then convert it to qimage

4313862
min	max	range	max	range	min
but if i give a min of 0 and a max of 1 in the range it always returns me 0

4313886
submit	submission
another reason for implementing a queue is that the user can submit multiple queries at the same time they don t have to wait for the first one to finish before submission another

4313892
range	minimum
you could encode the minimum maximum range into the tag property of each individual control or you could use the index to look them up from arrays

4313919
width	height
i want to add two buttons of width 133 px and 150 px each and 28 px in height on top of every view in my iphone app

4313930
spoofing	traffic
your spoofing server has to be able to listen to all traffic on the network to be able to receive the pings that are not intended to go to itself

4313930
spoofing	traffic
so your spoofing server has to listen to all icmp echo request traffic and generate an appropriate response

4313939
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
also remember array or any other memory chunk allocated with single calloc should be deallocated with single free call with same pointer as returned by malloc

4313956
ceil	floor
in favor of competitive prices you could also consider floor x instead of ceil x though

4313976
sorting	filtering
dataview should be used whenever sorting or filtering is to be applied in code

4313988
.htaccess	httpd.conf
i would now like to not use a .htaccess anymore and instead put all the rewrite logic into my httpd.conf file

4314009
maven	pom.xml
and if you are using maven add this to your pom.xml file

4314017
jar	war
another ugly solution might be to use war file overlays exploiting the fact that this mechanism pays no attention to the versions of component jar files when applying the overlays

4314028
pylons	pyramid
meanwhile pyramid is a continuation of pylons

4314036
hide	show
while not exactly the same as the photo app this technique will hide and show the navigation bar with an option to animate the transition

4314062
trie	tree
preprocess the dictionary into a prefix tree aka trie

4314070
google-chrome	firefox
i was simply confused by the way google-chrome displayed that exception and didn t recognize it as such right away i usually use firefox

4314070
google-chrome	safari
my tests have shown that google-chrome and safari block the following ports only ports below 1024 were tested

4314070
udp	tcp
the associated services are taken from the list of tcp and udp port numbers on wikipeda

4314102
kate	kde
it has ftp i m not sure about svn and is has feel similar to kde kate editor that is my first choice

4314121
jboss	glassfish
for java you will need to setup apache server your own java server glassfish jboss or tomcat it s a servlet container and that can be costly whereas php is readily setup when registering for a dns

4314245
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and i suspect safari can show attached event listeners when you select an element in the dom and then scroll down the right sidebar to the event listeners section

4314270
geocoding	geocode
my guess is because the geocoding needs a little time to return and the function continues on before returning the first geocode value

4314439
put	get
if i strip out handle_asynchronously on a mailer everything works fine...but if i put it back in i get

4314448
int	double
with two numeric types int single double etc. it adds the values together as you would expect

4314450
debian	linux
but when i try to run on debian gnu linux 5.0 i have

4314460
mouseover	mouseout
any time you only need to change css on mouseover mouseout events use this method

4314512
scrollable	panels
you can put celltable in a verticalpane and set vertical panels scrollable

4314548
put	get
i know it will take forever to get suggestions drafted tested and put into the css specs but there is no time like the present.

4314550
width	height
you can use the maxwidth maxheight properties of your buttons in concert with setting percentage based width height

4314596
post	get
there is a great blog post about how to get from concept to marketplace here -

4314611
button	checkbox
in your case you ll want to create a simple custom dialog box that includes a message a checkbox and however many button you need

4314611
button	checkbox
basically you need to define a new code-behind file that includes your textblock checkbox and button s in a panel object and you need to extend window

4314632
maven-dependency-plugin	pom.xml
i found a solution by using maven-dependency-plugin to copy resolved pom.xml dependencies and additional jar

4314638
post	get
write up a blog post describing it submit it to some popular sites like a list apart hacker news or reddit -- basically get as many eyes on your idea as you can

4314646
tunnel	packets
the tunnel interface gre0 is a normal network interface that the system s routing table can send packets to

4314659
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
it sounds like you have a uinavigationcontroller as the main vc of your app and a uitabbarcontroller as one of the vc s on its stack

4314659
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i think you should embed the uinavigationcontroller inside the uitabbarcontroller instead of the other way around or you could just choose to use another way of showing what you want to show

4314702
post	get
first make up your mind do you want get or post parameters

4314710
vsto	add-in
i m not sure if shared is required in vsto i use add-in express vsto is such a pain

4314774
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
i have crossdomain.xml and clientaccesspolicy.xml files in place in the root of the webserver but i cannot even see these files being requested in fiddler

4314818
listview	gridview	gridview	repeater
i would then like to be able to pass the notes collection to a gridview listview or repeater in the relevant asp.net page for the customer or task classes

4314836
querypath	phpquery
as your source is xml you could use querypath or phpquery to filter the initial data set

4314842
width	height
remove width and height parameters

4314870
maven	m2e
maven integration for eclipse m2e version 0.10.2.20100623-1649 this has been configured to point to maven 2.2.1 environment and not to use the embedded maven3 instance

4314878
versioning	upgrade
hopefully heroku will upgrade their versioning of bundler soon to take advantage of some of the performance improvements

4314930
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
it sounds like you have both a uinavigationcontroller and a uitabbarcontroller

4314979
getter	setter
check that appropriate getter and or setter methods exist

4314979
getter	setter
ensure that there are proper getter setter methods for the property user of the managed bean with name articles

4314979
getter	setter
check that appropriate getter and or setter methods exist

4314982
getter	setter
everyone suggest to use public getter setter but my app is too big and making a getter setter for each member would just cause maintainability issues

4314992
folder	directory
i downloaded a single dll file and added it to the bin directory of my root folder

4314995
versioning	upgrade
apropos versioning compatibility i use binaryformatter and have no problems with schema upgrade

4314998
width	height
i have drawn all the images separately in the same dimension width x height

4315003
ant	maven
if using maven there are a few ways to achieve something similar such as dropping down to ant using the antrun plugin

4315011
children	parent
you could use the children method to get all direct children of the parent element

4315026
x86	64bit
the application itself works fine under both 32-bit and 64bit windows but i can t use nunit as i get the following exception upon loading the x86 assembly

4315031
vb.net	vb6
i have inherited a frankenstein vb6 converted to vb.net winform application

4315034
folder	directory
the only dependency that i can see is in xmlrpc exception.php as it requires a file in the root directory of zend exception.php you could simply copy this file along with the xmlrpc folder keeping the directory structure the same and it should work..

4315066
tiff	png	gif	png
just add a couple files to your uses list and your application natively supports gif tiff png and many many others

4315103
rss	feed
depending on what you want to use this for you could look at the google ajax feed api which is a javascript api that will let you embed rss feed into your site

4315113
getter	setter
as well as setter and getter

4315113
implements	extends
checkitemrenderer has a label for the string and the image of the checkitem it extends container and implements listcellrenderer

4315128
post	get
it s very good at facilitating http get post requests via the command line

4315131
textwrangler	bbedit
just downloaded bbeedit and suddenly having problems executing script either from bbedit or textwrangler

4315134
button	checkbox
the excel document created as part of this project has a worksheet named start sheet which has some winforms controls like button checkbox etc and there are many other worksheets which mainly contains data

4315160
cvs	svn
then they just hg add the files they do want tracked -- hg add overrides ignore rules unlike in cvs svn

4315162
expandablelistview	expandablelistadapter
try putting this in your expandablelistadapter listview is a reference to the expandablelistview itself

4315179
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
then i want to take this information and on run-time begin to add subtract divide multiplying certain columns and place the information into other columns

4315214
boost	stl
i noticed though that when i try to check with other people the things i code using the material i learned they are usually considered non-idiomatic and superseded by an stl way to do it that is safer and easier well the book doesn t cover stl and boost libraries

4315214
boost	stl
i d be particularly interested in sources that included stl and boost stuff

4315266
lisp	smalltalk
i understand that learning smalltalk might be good in the same way that learning lisp is good for one s knowledge but i want to know if learning smalltalk-specific concepts will help me to understand objective-c more completely given smalltalk s role in its origin story

4315315
google-chrome	firefox
on the other hand firefox and google-chrome are deliberately wrong in copying ways in which user agents were frequently wrong some considerable time ago the problem started in the early days of http

4315315
post	get
for this reason 307 was introduced in http 1.1 to be clearer that the same http method should be used in this case it should be a post while 303 has always meant that one should use get

4315386
post	get
here are some examples send http post request get a cookie send a cookie

4315413
pull	push
now i can clone into my new repository and execute pull but i cannot push

4315424
min	max
i m pretty sure that you can add an attribute to the desired element defining its min and max lengths

4315486
getter	setter
you re synthesizing getter and setter for the instance variable so it s good practice to use those to access it they ll take care of retain and releasing appropriately

4315514
pull	push
these settings do not travel from one repository to the other by hg clone hg push or hg pull commands

4315524
post	get
use head instead of get or post

4315544
boost	stl
on top of all that you should read much doc about stl and boost and learn a lot about iterators

4315544
boost	stl
iterators are the key to use stl and boost implementation of containers and algorithms and if you don t know how to use them you won t write c++ idiomatic code

4315633
temporary	tablespace
you can also create another temporary tablespace with a fixed size and assign the user running the query to that one

4315710
h.264	webm
html5 enabled browsers have a tag that you can use to play a video on your site the encoding depends on the browser until now it was mainly h.264 but recently google mozilla and others joined efforts on the webm project with the new vp8 codec

4315720
getter	setter
a - create a php daemon that runs your world pipe all other traffic to either a getter or setter request file that interacts with the database

4315720
daemon	cron
b - use cron not a daemon

4315843
post	get
when i try building the code i get a long list of errors which i don t really want to post here but i will at the end of my text

4315843
qtcore	qtgui
-i usr include qt4 qtcore -i usr include qt4 qtgui -i usr include qt4 -ibuild -ibuild

4315843
qtcore	qtgui
-i usr include qt4 qtcore -i usr include qt4 qtgui -i usr include qt4 -ibuild -ibuild -o build mainwindowimpl.o src mainwindowimpl.cpp

4315886
tcpdf	fpdf
tcpdf and fpdf have nothing on the utf-8 and font support of mpdf

4315948
squash	merge	squash	branch
from other side i do not want to do squash or no-commit merge while difference are significant and could break current state of testing branch

4315974
audiotoolbox	avfoundation
link required frameworks to your target coregraphics opengles quartzcore openal audiotoolbox libz.dylib avfoundation

4315974
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
that said i actually do use a uinavigationcontroller and a uiviewcontroller with a nib file for my initial view

4315985
versioning	upgrade
we re still not using the data lists feature we just recently upgrade from alfresco 3.0 to the newest versioning but we do collect information and we do some counting calculating

4316006
rar	zip
investigate the jar file using a zip or rar tool

4316013
toolbar	tabs
the eui would be excel menus toolbar or ribbon tabs

4316020
public	protected
if foo dosomething is used outside foo.cpp if it s public or protected usually it must go in the header

4316024
children	parent
in the oo world references only go one way and there is no way for nhibernate to know that parent- children is the same fk as child- parent

4316024
children	parent
it s your job in the oo model to ensure that the parent- children collection contains the same set of references as the set of child- parent relationships.

4316034
free	malloc
although now you ll have to keep track of which elements of temp were allocated with malloc so you can free them later

4316050
pdfsharp	migradoc	pdfsharp	itext	itext	migradoc
as an alternative to itext there s also pdfsharp migradoc

4316060
free	malloc
malloc free routines or all

4316084
gridview	sqldatasource
i need to be able to generate a basic csv file of the results returned from an sqldatasource gridview upon the user clicking a button then allow them to save this file

4316131
uiview	subviews
i have successfully added a uiview as a subviews to window but it has no rotation

4316134
awt	swing	swt	swing
note that for the graphic part eclipse uses a library called swt which is a set of widgets that feel and behave in a different way that swing or awt

4316136
rss	feed
the app reads several different sources of rss feed that are outside of my control public facing built by others

4316177
fadein	fadeout
then use jquery mousevents along with fadein and fadeout

4316211
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
the standard constructor also works correctly in google-chrome opera and firefox all under ubuntu ie6 ie7 and ie8

4316239
folder	directory
structure your folder so they replicate the production server s directory structure

4316272
jar	manifest.mf
not sure this is even allowed by the spec but you may try to change the manifest.mf for the jar containing the pu adding a classpath entry pointing to the other jar containing descentity

4316294
superclass	subclassing
another approach i was thinking about was to implement the template as a superclass and then create a subclassing for each of the classes i want to test

4316304
mouseleave	mouseenter
so in this solution an interval is set to cycle through and trigger the events mouseenter and mouseleave

4316304
mouseleave	mouseenter
since you might not want the images cycling while your mouse is over an element the interval is cleared upon mouseenter and set up again during mouseleave

4316321
uniq	grep
grep -eo w+ source.file | uniq -c

4316322
next	except
i then need to move repetitively into the folders and then into the next one to perform svn commands which are the same except for some variable extension

4316322
for-loop	arrays
so there should be an arrays or list defined and then a for-loop through that list and then a variable whose name is expanded to be fed into the cp and svn command

4316331
pop-up	dialog
1 instead of redirecting them to a login page i want to cancel the current request and give the user a pop-up dialog box to login with

4316373
union	distinct
these will be distinct result sets as the libname is different so use union all rather than union

4316382
int	chars
i would never write unsigned int or long int or signed anything except chars or bitfields because it increases clutter and decreases the amount of meaningful code you can fit in 80 columns

4316400
popupwindow	pop-up
i m using jquery popupwindow to pop-up the page but i don t have any idea how to fill that form field

4316414
fgets	strtol
it would be better to use fgets and then parse it yourself with strtol and a few for loops

4316431
groupbox	panel
as well as the usual manual panel and groupbox controls

4316438
boost	stl
moreover well-known c++ libraries like stl or boost propose their code in header files only which is a sign of good design

4316466
put	get
the issue that i m running into is that if i put a listview in the itemtemplate of my hierarchicaldatatemplate i get a listview for each child rather than a single listview with content

4316467
int	chars
rough estimate 12 bytes for array header 4x5 bytes for the pointers 8x5 if you re on a 64 bit jvm each string has 3 int +3x4 bytes and an array of chars +12 bytes for header + length of the string x2 because it s chars

4316497
xslt	xquery
the good part is in this version you can mix xquery and xslt code to get best of both worlds

4316499
versioning	upgrade
i d prefer not to tamper with the library so i can fetch upgrade by just untarring the new versioning

4316516
htmlcleaner	jsoup
instead of htmlcleaner i would recommend you try jsoup

4316518
children	parent
while it s memory-hungry a user can select de-select individual files and it s pretty easy to automatically select de-select all the children when somebody checks a parent folder

4316527
firefox	safari
for example safari on windows applies some heavy anti-aliasing to make text smooth which makes it look blaringly different on firefox even on the same machine

4316579
mp3	flv
u can only embedd cue point into flv files not mp3

4316696
calloc	malloc
i have written this source code for my better understanding of malloc and calloc

4316723
calloc	malloc
as you point out calloc zeroes out the memory is allocates while malloc doesn t

4316767
free	malloc
malloc free routines or all

4316769
free	malloc
on the other hand calling malloc b a times will results in a individual objects of size b which can be free independently and which are not in an array though you could store their addresses in an array of pointers

4316797
move	drag
we already successfully made one leg of the spider in the blender has bones and armature and ik constraint so in blender i can drag the leg to move

4316801
folder	directory
i tried copying the .libs the .dlls debug versions .pdbs both to the locations which my project uses and additional library directory and to the project s folder but this must be not enough

4316856
min	max
when you use an aggregation function as min max sum avg etc you need to include every column in the select statement that are not in any aggregation function

4316869
opera	google-chrome
however it was exclusive to ie---ff google-chrome and opera handled the modal appropriately

4316872
versioning	upgrade
the upgrade license is valid from any prior versioning including express

4316881
division	multiplication
so in objective-c the normal mathematical order of operations would be applied to the expression above â the division and the multiplication would be done first the additions afterwards

4316881
implements	extends
it then extends the c syntax to provide a means for posting messages to objects and for declaring and implements the messages an object may receive

4316888
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i simply want to enforce a hard page break that firefox safari and google-chrome will listen to

4316888

changing it to 9 inches seems to give me enough margin room for printing from all safari firefox and google-chrome when i have it set to a standard us paper size

4316899
pull	push
these basic commands are pull push init commit -am message

4316899
pull	push
same key combo plus git pull or git push for pulling in changes from code repository or pushing changes to code repository respectively

4316911
getter	setter
these getter and setter methods are working fine without using spring

4316955
width	height
from what i can see looking at the jquery ui code .swap is not called directly by it the only place in the jquery framework itself that uses .swap directly are the height and .width calls when retrieving the computed height width of an element

4316955
width	height
jquery ui uses height and width functions everywhere so it is little wonder that the .swap function figures highly in the profile

4317086
serializable	deserialization
it can help find places that are accidentally creating an instance of your util class where you didn t mean for it to serializable deserialization etc

4317182
portrait	landscape
i managed to do that in portrait mode with hidden edittext but when i change the orientation to landscape the sw keyboard opens with the white text field which covers all the space above the keyboard and it shows the text user has written

4317247
freebsd	opensolaris
- can i expect the same script to run in opensolaris as well as redhat freebsd

4317251
geany	gedit	emacs	gedit
how can i configure it so that when i create and edit files in emacs the formatting looks the same in editors such as geany or gedit it seems that the indentation is never preserved correctly

4317266
int	double
in this code the x and y are the tags of the c code above they re called type constructors because they construct an xy type out of an int or a double resp.

4317292
sys	subprocess
import subprocess os sys

4317294
entity-relationship	diagram
i have to create an entity-relationship diagram based on a relational schema

4317306
post	get
i actually connect in my univ to the network through a captive portal at this url time ago i made a program to connect to it which worked perfect c++ libcurl sending an http post with the needed query string such as username and password but i think it was because there wasn t still the ssl a x.509 cert that now seems to work with a get instead of the post that used before

4317335
implements	extends
create a class that extends composite and implements requiresresize

4317337
rss	feed
from experience i ve found real world feed are often more complex than the rss parser can handle

4317366
bash	zsh
but almost every command in bash works in zsh the same way

4317366
freebsd	opensolaris
i saw zsh working on all linuxes freebsd and opensolaris

4317366
bash	zsh
why i prefer zsh z shell to bash

4317384
integer	unsigned
so the returned unsigned 8-bit integer contains all the possible values of zero amplitude for these formats

4317404
int	double
understand how to use pointers and getvalue to take in the input as a wxstring but that does me no good if i can t get the string as a double or int then i can t perform operations on it

4317410
bash	tcsh
freebsd includes sh csh and tcsh by default with bash and others in ports

4317410
zsh	tcsh	bash	tcsh	bash	zsh
once upon a long time ago mac os x used tcsh by default but it now uses bash by default and includes zsh along with most common shells

4317426
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
also if you re using firefox google-chrome or safari try checking your javascript console for errors

4317432
ubuntu	linux
by the way the only other platform tested is linux ubuntu 10.04 where it runs just fine

4317459
implements	extends
okay i agree that stinks but a t extends array and also implements ilist and i wonder if it implements ...

4317475
getter	setter
it creates the getter setter for you automatically

4317481
google-chrome	firefox
the following worked on ie8 firefox and google-chrome

4317482

i m using ruby 1.8 and linux ubuntu and slax and i need to write a script in ruby which finds out if some specific usb device is connected to the system and on which usb port 0 1 2 etc

4317555
accessor	properties
properties create these accessor and also provide things like proper key-value change notifications and atomic access

4317610
cpu	processors
if your going to implement a time based demo consider using one based on processors time and not an absolute date.the idea being the user can use your application fully for say 4 hours of cpu time

4317614
post	get
in which i will get the post entered in the text area of blog as an object in js and send that object to java server side

4317631
subclass	abstract-class
the following suggestion let s you test abstract-class without creating a real subclass - the mock is the subclass

4317631
subclass	abstract-class
in my honest opinion this is neater than using a spy since a spy requires an instance which means you have to create an instantiatable subclass of your abstract-class

4317647
put	get	post	get	post	put
in .net the httpwebrequest object is where you gather together all the pieces of info to be sent across the wire - including command http method get put post etc and byte stream

4317650
getter	setter
properties can generate getter and setter

4317650
mutators	getter
getter and properties for non-objects are mostly for orthogonality of coding style although they do have potential to be used for mutators key-value notifications etc

4317725
maven	pom.xml
i was able to configure the eclipse project and maven pom.xml to use jpa 2.0 metamodel generator in the build compile process

4317749
cos	sin
where degtorad x converts from degrees to radians cosz and sinz are the cos and sin of the z-angle from the gyroscope respectively and anglex and angley are the x and y angles from the gyroscope

4317749
portrait	landscape
the x-angle from the gyroscope measures up-down angle y-angle measures left-right and z-angle measures rotation of the phone from portrait to landscape

4317796
cvs	svn
you can also copy the .prefs files from to a folder called .settings in the root folder of your project and then add it to svn or cvs or ...

4317805
google-chrome	firefox
so text shadows in firefox and google-chrome are grate

4317845
hide	show
alternatively wrap the footer view in a wrap_content height framelayout and hide show the inner view leaving the framelayout visible

4317860
sorting	filtering
for more complex sorting filtering needs you may want to try glazed lists

4317861
hide	show
the droid-fu library has a class designed for having a loading footer show and hide listadapterwithprogress

4317888
pop-up	dialog
i ve already got the dialog box made but i m trying to add a semi-transparent gray rectangle over everything behind the pop-up again like the one used in asp.net

4317898
pop-up	dialog
the jquery dialog box pop-up like it should but when i click on the upload file button nothing happens

4317922
post	get
changing the input name attribute to match the url var name tzip to zip along with changing post to get did the trick but for some reason it s adding two additional url variables as well x 0 y 0

4317949
put	get
if there are less than 6 element left at the end they get put into a new ul as well

4317953
width	margin
when i create a new uiviewcontroller subclass myviewcontroller with xib and add this code to get the add the view to the window the contents always appear too high up by the same width as the default recommended left right margin

4317966
integer	unsigned
mysql s last_insert_id function will return the id from the latest insert on an auto_increment column on the current connection so if your column is an integer unsigned like you said it could return values greater than 2147483647

4317980
pull	push
click options and then select the allow push of a new branch or force push or pull option as needed

4318053
put	get
to get really tricky once the connection is made to the server the two computers can then be put into direct contact but that involves udp packets and some clever magic

4318103
width	height
essentially i would like to have a fluid height width listbox

4318151
put	get
specify that you allow read write sharing on the file and put a streamreader on your stream to get the same behaviour as file.opentext

4318190
portrait	landscape
each view has two nibs one for portrait orientation and one for landscape so i m searching for a method to programmatically switch nib for a given uiviewcontroller

4318207
spweb	spsite
this is happening because you have nodes present in the database but the actual spsite or spweb is not present in the content database

4318234
accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
the second one uses the properties accessor the first just uses the ivar

4318262
portrait	landscape
one for portrait and one for landscape

4318263
int	chars
it seems that subtracting 0 from the chars is casting it to an int

4318263
int	chars
convert another chars in to an int

4318284
solaris	bsd	unix	bsd	unix	solaris
this is native on unix platforms linux macâ osâ x solaris bsd etc. and installable on other platforms such as windows and android

4318300
unsigned	short	int	chars
because chars is the same as short although an unsigned short you can safely cast it to an int

4318304
int	chars
hence a chars which is a numerical value minus an int results in an int

4318320
hide	show
i would rather use animation that does the whole thing first show the control then hide it

4318336
width	height
if i give my viewstack a fixed height the scrollbars appear but i don t want to give a fixed width

4318349
int	chars
chars s are converted to int implicitly

4318359
int	chars
when you use the - operator with chars java performs the operation with the int values

4318361
int	chars
a chars just like a short or byte will always be silently cast to int if needed

4318379
profiling	instrumentation
run some time profiling on it using instrumentation

4318380
int	chars
chars is considered a subtype of int so any chars may be assigned to an int

4318391
hide	show
i want to hide the filter div if the category div is show on page load

4318446
int	chars
the reasons chars pointers are guaranteed to work like this is so that you can for example copy int from anywhere in memory to elsewhere in memory or disk and back which turns out to be a pretty useful thing to do in low-level programming graphics libraries

4318459
pop-up	dialog
you also with some non-standard browsers ie have to set the disposition of the file to get the download file dialog box to pop-up and process the response correctly with a progress indicator

4318475
hide	show
i want to show the name of the menu when the mouse goes over it and hide it when mouse goes out

4318490
public	protected
thingbase would contain all the data in a protected structure providing public read-only properties for the fields and protected read-only property for its structure

4318501
innodb	myisam
changetableengine method is used to change table engine from myisam to innodb for instance

4318501
innodb	myisam
- new engine name memory myisam innodb etc

4318536
post	put
i read it s possible to put the form on http but post it to https but i read someone saying that it can be exploited with a man in the middle attack

4318536
post	put
i read it s possible to put the form on http but post it to https but i read someone saying that it can be exploited with a man in the middle attack

4318542
int	chars
if you asked to convert between float int and unsigned chars six or seven times in a single expression well that must be what you wanted

4318561
hide	show
assuming by show on page load you mean rendered and not the show hide visibility

4318623
width	height
i bet start has negative x or y when error happens or the size.hight + y or size.width + x is bigger than height or width of the image

4318628
submit	submission
i have a html form where i enter my data and before submission i need to view my data in the html form and if i need changes change it rt there and submit

4318629
width	height
the default width and height of a viewstack container is the width and height of the first child

4318635
width	height
when reaching 1280px of width and 830 px of height which is the limit resolution less than this things go wrong i m trying to get all the elements fixed nothing floats anymore so the scroll bars show the visitor can use them and no element gets under nothing

4318645
post	get
also it looks like you re sending through post but trying to retrieve through get

4318665
hide	show
use hide .show to show and hide elements

4318710
uninstall	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
the intention of my upgrade msi is to uninstall the old versioning and reinstall the new versioning so that the old components are not left behind

4318710
min	max
i modified it so that the row with had the version min set to 1.0.0.0 version max set to the version number of the previous version and the attributes set to 768

4318710
min	max	versioning	upgrade
i modified the row with to have versioning min set to the versioning number of your upgrade versioning max set to blank and attributes set to 258

4318725
width	margin
because you re explicitly setting the widths of your container and inner divs you can center the inner div by setting it s left margin to an exact pixel length rather than using margin auto which is only needed for containers of indefinite or variable width

4318772
post	get
i won t post the entire thing they get pretty long

4318788
apache	nginx
here is a chart showing the respective performances of nginx apache and g-wan

4318794
accessor	properties
instead properties create accessor methods that manage retention and foster encapsulation

4318813
button	checkbox
for now when the delete button is clicked the checkbox is checked

4319013
post	get
right now i have it so that selecting an item from the gridview uses jquery to do a ajax post with the id to a webmethod in the code behind where it can then go off the database and get all the details of the record

4319076
inherited	subclassing
i can subclassing activity but that falls over as soon as i use a mapview and am forced to use mapactivity so not all my activities inherited from my subclassing

4319076
inherited	subclassing
where inherited isn t applicable i am tending to put generic methods and member variables into a subclassing of the application object but i m finding it s creating a mess of code as every class needs to either grab access to the application object through via context or i have to pass it down

4319101
iboutlet	ibaction
iboutlet ibaction actually mean nothing to the compiler but they let ib recognise the ivars it can send messages to or that will write to elements in a xib

4319113
versioning	upgrade
you might want to upgrade if your on an older versioning

4319123
nsdateformatter	nscalendar
you can convert its internal value into any calendar or timezone you want via the nscalendar and nsdateformatter classes

4319146
getter	setter
according to what i ve read on msdn auto-implementing properties simply take care of creating the backing field and getter setter for you and for all intents and purposes they should be the same

4319151
addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication
the ieee-754 standard requires that so called basic operations which include addition multiplication division and square root are correctly rounded

4319210
daemons	launchd
the daemons is launchd by launchdaemon the gui is launchd using loginitems for each user

4319229
valgrind	memcheck
edit if you are able to compile the program on linux you can simply install and run valgrind memcheck

4319266
put	get
they will get an awakefromnib message so that s a good place to put some code to check on what the state of the app is see if you have to do stuff with your object to bring it up to speed

4319295
post	get
you will need to change the form method from post to get and also rename the text input from tzip to zip otherwise your url will look like this

4319328
next	except
your implication is that the fsm shouldn t actually need 100 of the cpu which leads me to assume you are spending a lot of time doing nothing except checking to see if you need to move to the next state or not

4319351
for-loop	loops
i tried using a different approach creating a second 3-tiers nested for-loop after the first one so i keep the top face drawing in the first loops and the edge highlight in the second loops i know this is inefficient i should also probably avoid having a method call for each tile to draw it but i m just trying to get it working for now

4319381
colorbox	thickbox
the difference is that thickbox uses the css position fixed to align the box whereas colorbox uses a relative position

4319411
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
to make this example easier let s assume that all real internet connectivity is fronted by a cluster of k http accelerators reverse proxies such as nginx lighttpd apache which have very easy configuration just internal ips to forward to

4319411
salt	md5
my-application-php - which would depend on mod_php apache and would include generated file like etc my-php-application config.inc.php that will include mysql database ips hostnames and login password generated as md5 current source code revision + salt

4319411
salt	md5
if yes - connects to the database applies migrations to bring it up to the new version kills all older logins passwords and recreates the new login password pair again generated using md5 revision + salt method

4319411
put	get
if you ll put more details here or as a separate question i ll gladly try to get into details

4319423
implements	extends
mvc is the most extensible and if you are familiar with how things work under the covers you ll probably be better off than implements a hard to extends ms thing like odata and wcf

4319433
put	get
when i need get weather for some city i put this link

4319437
windmill	mechanize
for those more complicated tasks you might want to consider using mechanize twill or even selenium or windmill which will support more compliated scenerios including cookies or javascript support

4319442
fadein	hide
you can just chain a hide with a fadein like this

4319475
width	height
you set the width and height but not the top or left properties so they will be set to 0 by default - ie the top left of the parent component

4319477
min	rank
note that dgels_ assumes that the matrix has full rank rank a min m n

4319479
put	get
i trying to get the values of the selected cell and put that in in one text box

4319487
google-chrome	firefox
like if you move firefox google-chrome ie around your monitor

4319492
width	height
also try to ensure your texture tile width height is a power of 2 32 64 128 etc. as that could make the effect less bad as well

4319492
int	double
try to use double or better float coordinates instead of int

4319506
put	get
i m pretty sure this helper is close to what i need to do to get a proxy working but i m not sure where i need to put the proxy json on my side in order to be able to grab it with jquery

4319545
post	get
not really the right answer because you want ids in your array but i post it anyway because it s nice and short and you might actually get away with it

4319555
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
i suppose i can just add the units as they are in my methods adding matching units together and only converting in order to add subtract multiplying divide when they are requested which is great for adding and subtract

4319555
subtract	add
the example was mostly to discourage the reflexive answer that you add or subtract them piece-wise before converting at the last moment since and will fail

4319561
inherited	properties
projects tasks and sub-tasks all have a lot of similar properties so i thought i would use inherited but can t figure out how to query particular projects

4319567
google-chrome	firefox
i tested that in ie google-chrome and firefox no luck

4319578
width	height
of course i d like this to work with images of any width height and not just a square like the example above

4319668
width	height
depending on the user s browser size i want the thickbox to be a constant 500px or so width and the height to change dynamically depending on the height of user s browser

4319671
put	get
what i m looking for is an extremely basic intro - what .dll files to put what code to use to authorize and get userid etc

4319679
profiling	instrumentation
you can profiling with instrumentation via xcode if you d like to actually determine specific performance differences

4319697
pop-up	dialog
under windows 7 it fails occasionally that s another story question thread but the webcam driver also pop-up a dialog titled video source inviting me to select one

4319714
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade my report viewer control from versioning 9 to versioning 10 and now its paging controls don t work

4319775
entity-relationship	diagram	entity-relationship	entities
at this early stage it is normal to model entities and relations not attributes that s why it is called an entity-relationship diagram

4319782
getter	setter
it is easy to understand the concept of setter getter for a simple data an nsinteger for example

4319782
getter	setter
the setter for a changes the value of a and the getter only gets returns its value

4319782
getter	setter
it is then easy to understand atomic nonantomic concept since atomic will guarantee that reading a when a is being chnaged will always return a whole value getter and setter are synchronized

4319782
getter	setter	nsstring	nsdata
but what i do not clearly understand is setter and getter for properties which are pointers to objects nsdata nsstring for example

4319827
width	height
i know i could create an event handler that when i zoom in it adds width and height to each of the rectangles but then i have to worry about increasing the x and y positions of each of the rectangles so i keep the same distance between each one and so forth

4319831
hide	show
you can test it out here what this does it toggle the sibling still but then looks at its .siblings that have an id attribute and hide them if show

4319843
webclient	webrequest
my bet is that the speedup you re experiencing is not significant enough for your taste because you re either using a subtype of webrequest or a class relying on it such as webclient

4319866
debian-based	ubuntu
on ubuntu debian-based use apt-get install build-essential or search and install via yum on rhel-based systems i believe it would be something like yum install gcc

4319879
cout	cin
obviously since you want it in c change std cin to scanf or whatever and std cout to printf or whatever
