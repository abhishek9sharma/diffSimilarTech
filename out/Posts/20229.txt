of course you can add some nice show and hide animations to make it look smooth and professional

24000135

24000238
post	get
in your html you should have a element around your inputs and submit button with an action attribute the url that is in that attribute needs to map to a class that extends httpservlet it will commonly have one of two methods doget for http get requests and dopost for http post requests

24000241

google-chrome	firefox
but i can t reproduce this leak using ie10 x64 and other browsers like google-chrome and firefox 29

24000554
integer	unsigned
i think the root of the problem with unsigned integer types stems from the fact that they are sometimes used to represent numerical quantities and are sometimes used to represent members of a wrapping abstract algebraic ring

24000554
integer	unsigned
likewise should yield ring32 0x80000001 even if int happens to be 64 bits note that if int is 64 bits the compiler could legally do anything it likes if code tries to multiply two unsigned 32-bit values which equal 0xc0000001 since the result would be too large to represent in a 64-bit signed integer

24000636
int	boolean

24000769
google-chrome	firefox
the following code works on ie11 google-chrome firefox

24000792
children	parent
there will be an issue with your first approach as one of your container is left floated and one is right so the height of the parent div wrapperexampleone will collapse and will result in 0px which should be equal to the height of its children

24000817
freeglut	glew
im using freeglut and glew dont know it that matters

24000978
hide	show
currently if i select a non-rectangle option it does not hide the default div and show the hidden div

24001001
setinterval	settimeout
you are actually calling delay .fadein several times on each element returned by the selector. use settimeout or what you may want rather is to test for a condition in the setinterval body and when that meets the class is added first stop the interval then execute the fadein functions only once per element

24001076
width	height
width height ratio of the svg preserved at all time

24001076
width	height

i am using a map to store an index long long int as a key and a number density double

24002019
stdout	stderr
first i m redirecting stdout to file and stderr to stdout stdout line gets to the out.log file and stderr to pipe

24002019
stdout	stderr
thus second i m printing the original stderr to both stdout and the out.log file the -a argument means append

24002026

24002505
mouseover	mouseout
if instead of just using the tooltip applied to the image map areas you locate it based on the image and toggle it based on mouseover mouseout of the map areas i think you arrive at the desired results

24002505
google-chrome	firefox
possibly correct possibly not it seems like that either firefox or google-chrome is giving the wrong answer though but definitely the wrong answer for this situation

24002526
width	height	subtract	add
bobbel on webdeveloper.com suggests getting the width of the border by comparing the inner and outer window width and then subtract that from the inner-outer height difference to get the size of the window header for values you can add to screenx and screeny

24002716
google-chrome	firefox
just so that you are aware this behaviour is reflected in both google-chrome and firefox these are also going to be supported

24002756
getter	setter
this is highly unusual but has the benefit of allowing the functor direct access to the member variables of edge objects being compared rather than going through public getter and setter or having to friend a comparator

24002793
google-chrome	firefox
please do not tell about using id .load href function as it does not work in firefox and is very clunky on google-chrome

24002963
swift	objective-c
see apple s guide to using swift with cocoa and objective-c

24002963
swift	objective-c
this guide covers how to use objective-c and c code from swift and vice versa and has recommendations for how to convert a project or mix and match objective-c c and swift parts in an existing project

24002963
swift	objective-c
the compiler automatically generates swift syntax for calling c functions and objective-c methods

24002963
swift	objective-c
xcode also does this translation on the fly Ã¢ you can use open quickly while editing a swift file and type an objective-c class name and it ll take you to a swift-ified version of the class header

24002963
swift	objective-c
you can also get this by cmd-clicking on an api symbol in a swift file. and all the api reference documentation in the ios 8 and os x v10.10 yosemite developer libraries is visible in both objective-c and swift forms uiview

24003036
qtkit	avfoundation
i ve tried both the qtkit device as well as the avfoundation

24003047
width	height
the problem seems to be that ie is ignoring the width and height attributes on the element

24003047
width	height
the effect of width and height attributes on a element is to scale the referenced graphic to that size

24003047
width	height
therefore my first guess was that you should be able to make the adjustments yourself by a removing the width and height attributes on the element and b adding an additional scale factor

24003047
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately while the above example is a significant improvement it isn t quite right -- the sun and the hill aren t centered one above the other in ie even though they are with the exact same code in firefox and google-chrome

24003047
width	height
it seems that ie doesn t just ignore the width and height attributes it applies a default value of 100 -- meaning it scales the referenced svg to be the same size as the parent svg 500px width and height in your example before applying any transformations

24003047
width	height
so to get things to work nicely in all browsers you ll need to a tell the other browsers to scale to 100 using the width and height attributes then b factor in that scaling factor when you create your new scaling factor

24003081
rainbowtable	md5

24003306
width	height
i then make that into a 3-vector setting the z-position to be 0 for testing purposes i may well change this later on and create a vector specifying the lower left corner at 0 0 and the width and height at 1024 and 768 which are indeed the width and height of the window i create

24003308
folder	directory
create raw folder in res directory and put your sound file there

on the iterator search_disregard i manually put 4 identical values in the list so i know the end result should show me 4 but i still get 0

24003343

then just add subtract an appropriate offset to move the zero-point or change the computation offset in years

24003641
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
since getelementsbytagname returns collection whereas getelementbyid returns an object

24003662
int	double

24003691
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox 29 but not in google-chrome 35

24003738

24003803
int	double
java has no issues converting int to double implicitly - the following is perfectly valid without a cast

24003803
int	double
your call of movesvalue s constructor succeeds because this is the same kind of conversion that java invokes when you pass an int to a constructor that takes a double

24003803
int	double
an attempt of passing a double to a constructor taking an int that would cause a problem at compile time

24003809
int	double
it is the only constructor with exactly one parameter and java will use a widening primitive conversion section 5.1.2 jls to convert the int passed in movetomake to a double so it can be passed in

24003809
int	double
to get the first constructor int double to be called then you must pass a second numeric parameter also

24003809
int	double
then java will box the int into an int and either accept the double as a second parameter or widen an int float long etc

24003870
client-side	server-side
this model does the actual validation for both codeigniter server-side validation and jquery validate client-side remote .

the default first function does what i want in that it correctly interleaves stdout stderr and the log function output in the verbose.out file while sending the logged output to logged.out

24006148
stdout	stderr
the second function however does not correctly interleave the logged output with the stdout and stderr output and instead seems to buffer the logged output and it therefor ends up at the end of the verbose.out file though this output ordering is not even consistent and the logged messages occasionally occur in the inverse order in the output and the first of the messages can appear earlier in the output somewhere

24006162

each image is broken up into a bunch of packets and sent in pieces over udp tcp is also an option here

swift	objective-c
swift was made to be easy to learn for objective-c programmers and in objective-c there are no virtual methods at least not in the way that you might think of them

24014404
swift	objective-c
therefore if swift documentation says nothing about virtual methods my guess is that just as in objective-c there are none

24014416

keep in mind that when using the height method results may be unexpected because height returns the computed value of an element which does not include padding border or margin and does not take into account something like when a page is zoomed in

24014430

step 3 open command prompt and change your directory to the zend library folder

24016390

24016390
ant	maven
if you just want to do some ant task scripting then gant is probably the tool you need but for replacing ant and maven as build frameworks so as to get rid of all the xml and use groovy then you probably need to consider gradle

hide	show	mouseleave	mouseenter
note you could show hide the component with css hover instead of defining your handler on mouseenter and mouseleave

24017497
onresize	onscroll	onresize	onload
the reason to differentiate between 1 and 2 is that 1 is usually used for events that don t have interesting data like onload onscroll and onresize or it s more performant

24017508
for-loop	loops
you need loops while do-while or for-loop to do this kind of repeated stuff

most of these classes share some properties but in such a way that creating a class hierarchy using only single inherited is not really suitable

24017607

24017905

if the maps were the same type you could use a putall but since you are changing the key value pairs it looks like you are going to have to iterate over each integer get from each map then put maponeval maptwoval

24017907
textview	imageview
also elements that extends view such button imageview textview can not have children so you have to close immediately the tag

it will build without having tire object in car but when i try to put tire make into car i get these errors

24018126
getter	setter
to further gurantee the accessabilty to this properties you need getter and setter

24018217
getter	setter
so in short the entire idea of a simple property as you ve defined doesn t actually exist once the compiler has it s way - it inserts the k_backingfield value and creates a getter setter which accesses sets that backing field

24018231
getter	setter
with setter and getter for each properties

i am relatively new with java programming and i wrote some code that places a jlabel with the text set to enter text here behind a jtextfield

24018440
width	height
a quick example the current window size is width 800 height 600 and if re-sizing it should preserve the aspect

24018440
width	height
say if the window form was re-sized to width 850 i would expect the height is 650

24018460
folder	dir
the way that i ve handled this is to use the dir function to get all of the sub-folders for the target folder and load them into an array then pass the array into a function that recurses

24018527
width	height
the aspect ratio is a ratio meaning the result from height width should be the same value for the aspect to be maintained

24018527
width	height
simply changing by the same amount won t keep the aspect unless the height and the width are the same value a square

24018527
width	height
thus you need to change the height or the width by first getting the aspect ratio which is height width and then multiplying that value by the height to get the width or vice versa

24018547
getter	setter
in fact making those getter and setter abstract will ensure that your objects will be trully dateable featureable bookable etc.

24018568
inject	interceptor
inside your app config inject it s typically where i register my interceptor

24018571
google-chrome	safari
it works perfectly in google-chrome but not safari

24018629
post	get
i am unable to get my data to bind correctly on post

24018634
jlist	jlabel
i know it s based of a jlist so do i need to do anything fancy with jlabel and such

24018780
int	chars
if the string does not contain any of the chars . e or e and the numeric value fits into int type limits as defined by php_int_max the string will be evaluated as an int

24018892
int	chars
i was wondering if i could use a chars value to access to each byte of an int value.

24018892
int	chars	put	get
basically should convert the first byte of the pointed int in binary and then convert the following bytes since chars points at one only byte to decimal multiply the bytes for 10 number of digits so that i might get a number like 000000001100100 for example but something goes wrong and the result of the function is far different from binary plus i have tried to put a printf d n number1 in the function like this

24018910
getter	setter
note that jackson will work automatically with beans getter + setter pairs no-arg constructor

24018953
opengl-es	glsurfaceview
this is because each instance of glsurfaceview spawns its own execution thread and egl context and there is little support on android for making calls to opengl-es from multiple threads or contexts

24018987
hide	show	width	height
i know i can hide the problem by setting a set width and height to .grid .sortable-item and controlling overflow commented out in my example to show problem - but i don t want to just hide it

24018987
ready	each
therefore each sortable item will ultimately have 4 different versions with 4 different images in the background ready to surface when plants are sorted

24019075
folder	directory
you can also cd directly to your root folder with the command cd if you want to find out where you are at any time use the please write directory command pwd which will give you the file path to your location

24019100
swift	objective-c
swift uses arc in a similar way as objective-c does

firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	opera	safari
google-chrome firefox safari opera even ie will likely have some reliable way to handle these elements reliably even pre-html5 .

24019182
autocomplete	autosuggest
using jquery autocomplete multiple values option how can i prevent autosuggest for every new word

24019194
children	parent
another example of using a connect by would be to find all the children that roll up to a parent within a hierarchy

24019196
post	get
a good example is in luke palmer s blog post haskell antipattern existential typeclass where he explains that rather than try to reproduce an oo-like class for widgets with many instances and then store your ui widgets in an existentially quantified list you re better off making a record of the actual functions you ll use and returning that instead of retaining your original datatype - once you re existentially quantified you can t get at the original datatype anyway so you don t lose anything in expressiveness but gain a lot in manipulatability

24019229
swift	objective-c
as craig revealed within the announcement of swift it is said to be faster than objective-c by far

24019235
google-chrome	firefox
this has been working great on google-chrome firefox though i haven t tried any ie testing yet but the desktop versions of it working don t really matter much since the whole point is the navbar-header only gets shown on mobile devices

24019262
mp4	h.264
i was told that the video file has the right mp4 compression format h.264 baseline as outlined here

24019325

i would love to have an idea on how to automatically install a windows xp virtual machine on virtualbox vmware

24019395
bitwise-or	bitwise-and
| is python s bitwise-or operator not bitwise-and as your question might suggest which numpy overrides in order to make it the numpy element-wise-or

24019448
margin	height
you ll have to push the div that is hidden by the fixed header down by a margin equal to the height of the fixed header

24019486
post	put
both post and put endpoints will return the same payload

24019486
post	put
but notice that post expects password and confirmpassword while put doesn t

24019486
post	put
...but even after reloading the model ember data tries to post when calling user.save instead of put

24019489
post	put
note that if i change put to post in my route the request gets handled just fine.

24019553
for-loop	loops
what i m trying to do in the for-loop is to print the variable that is being passed through loops along with the variable value

24019577
hide	show
1 hide the element and show it again

24019577
hide	show
the problem with hide and show is that it sometimes flashes on the screen and is visually unappealing

24019584
vmware	virtualbox
not sure about virtualbox but if it works with vmware kvm etc. there is no reason it shouldn t with vb

yacc	bison
these settings are used to create the lflags flex flags and yflags bison yacc flags variables for the makefile

24019609
pull	push
so i have created a new private repo on bitbucket and because i m the owner and the only developer and i own the repo i can just make changes locally and then commit and push to my repo there are no forks without the added complication of pull requests to the owners repo

24019659
hide	show
i believe the reason this happens is because the design guidelines state that you re not supposed to hide show items in a group but are supposed to enable disable them instead and leave them visible to the user so that things don t appear and disappear from where they re expected to be found

24019671
multiplying	add
what i need to do is for each scenario multiplying the weight of the each asset by the return of the same corresponding asset and add them all together

24019707
swift	objective-c
i m trying to pick up a bit of swift lang and i m wondering how to convert the following objective-c into swift

24019709
min	max
i believe that this is because i m calculating different percentages for the top and bottom edges and the way that i am doing this may cause some input points within the quad to result in output values outside the min max of the corner output points

24019724
ubuntu	debian
actually i use it to compile different versions of code for redhat ubuntu or debian

24019736
post	get
as you may see there s no need for any post get array variables then i created a js function that calls this php file using an ajax call

24019760
fseek	ftell
you can either use fseek stock 0 seek_end to seek to the end before calling ftell or you can drop down a layer and use fstat fileno stock to retrieve the file size directly from the os

24019774
put	get
could you get the out put in the table to be

post	get
image link has nothing to do with web link i just post it so you get picture that i pass values in this way and it work fine

24019937
mktime	strtotime
essentially you have mixed up mktime with strtotime

24019961
mktime	strtotime
you should be using strtotime instead of mktime

24019978
bash	zsh
and it works both in zsh and bash

24019991
orika	dozer
the mapping between client and server data model can be handled by specialised frameworks like dozer or orika however the key generation must be integrated when performing the mapping

24020001
post	get
you can use the post to get data

24020001
google-chrome	firefox
the problem here is the security of the navigators like firefox and google-chrome

24020006
int	chars
now in java documentations they say that the method read reads a single chars as an int in the range 0 to 65535 0x00-0xffff or -1 if the end of the stream has been reached

24020006
int	chars
reading chars as int stuff aside i m still confused by the results this function gives me - i m sending int as 4 bytes i put it in byte array and send it

24020086
post	get
because the post that invoke this page has a get method so remplace it with post then it will work as expected

24020097
public	protected
this effectively makes private protected variables public

24020130
hide	show
i need to conditionally hide show columns but invisibleconsumesspace property is not working in prd 5.0.1

24020131
uibezierpath	uiimage
the memory problem here really isn t the uibezierpath but rather it s the uiimage objects which will each take up four bytes per pixel per shape

24020131
cashapelayer	uibezierpath
or use this uibezierpath to create a cashapelayer and then add that layer and a sublayer of your view s layer

24020148
int	chars
in that case it would make sense that sending an int as 4 bytes would cause you to receive 4 chars

24020157
getter	setter
you can bind the getter instance method to the field s value only if you implement a corresponding setter method for the binding to try to write changes in the value to

24020157
getter	setter
but the setter comes in handy to get those titles and tooltips recalculated through the getter

24020157
children	parent
which is a lot easier than trying to have the parent register as a kvo observer for all the children

24020242
margin	height
for a pure css solution make the position of the footer absolute have the top value set to 100 and the margin equal to the negative height so the page displays it exactly height above the bottom of the page

24020280
dsn	paradox
under the user dsn tab or system dsn if you have access click add and choose microsoft access paradox driver .db this ll open a dialog for you to fill in with the name and filepath

qthread	qobject
what you need to do is to create your class and derive from qobject then move that to a new qthread

24020356
post	get
now if you get stuck on something i suggest you post what you have tried and what s not working about it

24020373
getter	setter
the underlying private attribute _x is used to store the value for x used by both the getter and setter

24020373
getter	setter
the decorator syntax can be skipped if you want more explicit names for the getter and setter methods

24020689
udp	tcp
you would create a python script that opens a udp or tcp socket then it starts a separate process that calls the fade function

24020758
post	get
but the problem is when i do post it works right but i get the code in the .fail block that is not the case

24020773
versioning	upgrade
it seems that xcode 6.0 6a215l needs to upgrade the storyboard file to a newer versioning before it can access swift classes

24020773
swift	objective-c
if you replaced an objective-c class with a swift class with the same name you need to open the storyboard edit the name of the custom class like remove the last letter save the storyboard and then rename the class back

24020773
versioning	upgrade
this will force the storyboard file to be upgrade to a newer versioning and the new xcode to correctly write the custom class key like this

24020806
hash	md5
what i want to do is automatically hash the password when a value is inserted without having to call the md5 function

24020831
int	chars
since the role_id and function_id columns are int you have to convert them to one of the chars types in order to use the like operator

24020845
swift	objective-c
with plans to slowly retire the long-used objective-c apple has introduced a new programming language called swift for designing apps and applications to run on apple ios devices and apple macintosh computers

24020845
swift	objective-c
swift is a new programming language for ios and os x apps that builds on the best of c and objective-c without the constraints of c compatibility

24020900
int	chars
when extracting a numerical logical or chars Ã¢ naÃ¢ index picks an unknown element and so returns Ã¢ naÃ¢ in the corresponding element of a logical int numeric complex or chars result and Ã¢ nullÃ¢ for a list

24020959
folder	dir
the other less pretty but perhaps easier way is to just develop libb in the vendor dir of liba you can run install in libb s folder to get any dev dependencies

24020977
post	get
i reran in callgrind to get the full story i m not gonna post the detailed results because they are way more complicated than the cache grind ones but when we include the full call to free the result is the same a 16 more cycles are used when you don t call free

24021003
hide	show
a better design would be to add all of the views invisibly then change their opacity 0.0-1.1 to hide and show

24021007
google-chrome	firefox
tests that i run well in google-chrome and firefox appear flaky or blinky in ie9

24021016
cos	sin
if you have p1 and p2 for part 2 the segment p1p2 makes an angle with the horizon given by theta tan p2.y-p1.y p2.x-p1.x p3 is then at 40 cos theta 40 sin theta relative to p2 so consider it an offset from p2

24021032
width	height
the image looks expanded and blurry because the width and height is 50dp however the image is only 16x16

24021082
post	put
the put becomes a post and the delete simply doesn t fire at all

24021082
post	put
so the id is missing which makes sense for the put becoming a post

24021088
filtering	grouping
if the user choose all only in the standard field the view will filtering only the grouping column

24021088
filtering	grouping
if the user choose all only in the grouping field the view will filtering only the standard column

24021104
google-chrome	firefox
now when i move the slider i see that my array gets populated in firefox but not in google-chrome

24021137
ubuntu	linux
my host is ubuntu i installed the vitrtualbox to run the another guest os linux and since my traffic only has to be with in the host and guest i have selected a host only network type

24021151
trojan	virus
it could be windows or drivers or a trojan virus or some such software that has a system wide effect on other processes

24021211
implements	extends
i m unsure how effective this will be against arraylist s of varying contents though so you might be best off extends and implements your own bool equals object a method for your inner arrays

24021213
bash	zsh
finally with either bash or zsh the following works just fine with no need for bc

24021222
int	double
remember that sql only knows how to compare common datatypes like strings int double etc

24021224
cout	cin
getline cin name is being totally ignored and directly goes to the next cout and ends like this

24021225
put	get
then i would use attachmentnames to get all attachments on the document and put them in another list

24021262
onchange	onblur
forget about the enter key just attach the onblur event or onchange and use tab key to navigate them.

24021274
hash	md5
this also creates a situation where it s legitimate to use a long varchar data type for the password column even though the md5 hash is by definition only 32 characters

24021289
tolower	toupper
my guess is that one of your property names already has a first character that is lower case or that calling tolower toupper on some first character in a property name does not itself roundtrip

24021311
hide	show
i am trying to show hide asp panel based on checkbox checked in checkbox control

24021317
swift	objective-c
i have included a few objective-c classes in my swift project -- making use of the bridging header

24021317
swift	objective-c
however when i attempt to build the project the swift compiler complains because by all appearances it is attempting to compile the objective-c code

24021321
post	get
unlike post or get with push http connection you are maintaining the connection so you can receiving periodic updates from the server

24021363
getter	setter
you have to defined getter but not setter

24021378
equals	compareto
however your compareto method is always returning 0 so all your circle objects will compare equals to each other and only one will make it in to your treeset

24021418
swift	objective-c
swift will incur this penalty in fewer situations than objective-c will for instance method calls to swift-only protocol methods do not hit objc_msgsend but if the protocol is declared in objective-c or if the swift protocol is decorated with objective-c such that it can be adopted by objective-c objects as well then method calls to methods in that protocol adopted by swift objects appear to be dispatched via objc_msgsend

24021443
for-loop	arrays
i m new to vba and i m trying to add values to an arrays by going through a for-loop but i can t seem to get it to add any values

24021470
int	boolean
in objective- c ++ when a boolean value is required such as in an if or as an operand to actually take an int value and interpret 0 as false and non-zero as true

24021470
int	chars
objective-c s bool is a synonym for signed chars which is an int type while no and yes are defined as 0 and 1 respectively

24021476
ng-show	ng-hide
using combination of location and ng-hide ng-show you can hide the page

24021564
configobj	configparser
you may want to look into configparser or configobj

24021578
stdout	stderr
that will make stdout and stderr go to the same file

24021579
width	height
ideally i would need a way to convert the size of the font into height and width pixel values in pil but i am unsure how to do it

24021643
children	parent
targeting the parent then all div s gets you all the div s as they are children of the same parent just target the next div instead

24021754
oncreate	onstart
then in your activity s oncreate onstart or onresume method you would grab the intent and feed it to your intent handling method

24021754
onresume	onpause
in order to use the foreground dispatch you would register the for the foreground dispatch system in your activity s onresume method don t forget to unregister in onpause

24021805
sorting	filtering
all i had to do was ensure that i was applying the appropriate filtering and sorting parameters before the request got to the controller

24021828
post	get
i ve searched through the post how to get event or dom element of selected feature in openlayers without much success

24021862
folder	dir
my project has the similar structure but i have far more then one src folder including folder that are outside of my root project dir

24021883
for-loop	arrays
when looping over an arrays by reference you need to manually let go of the reference at the end of your for-loop to avoid weird behaviors like this one

24021922
mouseleave	mouseenter
have the mouseenter and mouseleave events of all buttons point to the very same events above

24021954
awt	swing
usually swing awt uses multiple threads so you might have a race condition here the reference to the resource is handed to imageicon in your Ã£ nitcomponents method before another thread could set the value to something non-null

24021967
valgrind	callgrind
i ve spent a little time running valgrind callgrind to profile a server that does a lot of tcp ip communications using many threads

24021971
width	height
i ve tried a couple of different things animating height and width using bottom and top but each way has had something that doesn t quite look good or work well

24021980
width	height
each of these screens have the same height and width

24021992
min	max
although the w3c documentation doesn t appear mention it the step attribute works in conjunction with the min and max attributes

24021996
cos	sin
for example helix function r t 4 cos t i + 4 sin t j + t k

24022022
submit	submission
your submit button wasn t actually submission anything

24022097
swift	objective-c
you can achieve plist-like nested structures using any type for dictionary values which is swift s somewhat counterpart to objective-c s id type but can also hold value types

24022115
google-chrome	firefox
i m having a weird problem where datetime-local inputs overflow their boundaries on google-chrome tested so far on google-chrome 35 x64 for linux but don t on firefox 29.0

24022156
vb6	vba
agvc.datetime was introduced in activeganttvc to allow millisecond microsecond and nanosecond accuracy which turned out not to be a good idea at all the next version of activeganttvc 3.2.0 will use the regular vb6 vba date coledatetime for c++ users

24022164
pull	push
it s then easier for them to push to their own remotes and file a pull request to your remote

24022168
portrait	landscape
otherwise landscape documents will be printed in portrait

24022168
portrait	landscape
for versions 8.62 and 9.05 of ghostscript both commands worked properly for pdf -- ps and pdf -- pcl for landscape and portrait

24022172
swift	objective-c
reading up on the language specification for functions for swift i don t know if swift is using the same messaging system as objective-c or something different

24022197
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
i don t actually need the guesture stuff from the tablets just the equivelent of mousedown mouseup and mousemove

24022203
post	get
i tried get instead of post but it doesn t make anything better.

24022225
integer	unsigned
go doesn t allow integer promotion and it doesn t allow you to convert a signed constant expression into an unsigned one at compile-time

24022234
post	get
i m currently coding a script which will get the latest post from my webpage to display them on my webpage

24022254
google-chrome	firefox
i have the following script which works fine in google-chrome firefox but not in ie

24022260
sorting	grouping
i use the row grouping plugin and it works better for me than the link in the answer because grouping are preserved after sorting by a different column

24022356
postgresql	mysql
i have a java application which periodically takes a resultset from one database mysql and attempts to find matches in another database postgresql postgis to be specific

24022356
postgresql	mysql
presently the application queries the postgresql database once for ever mysql record in the result set could be upwards of tens of thousands

24022416
doc	rtf
i did some research and converting doc x rtf etc.

24022430

swift	objective-c
if you have pure swift code and do not expose your classes protocols to objective-c with the objective-c decoration it appears that pure-swift method calls are not dispatched via objc_msgsend however in other cases they are

24022476
swift	objective-c
if the protocol your swift object adopts is declared in objective-c or if the swift protocol is decorated with objective-c then method calls to protocol methods even from swift objects to other swift objects are dispatched via objc_msgsend

24022476
swift	objective-c
i think getting the best performance will be dependent on keeping your code as much pure-swift as possible and crossing the objective-c swift boundary as little as possible and through bottleneck interfaces protocols so as to limit the number of swift calls that have to be dispatched dynamically

for-loop	arrays
this function queries the urls and stores the results in a arrays all in a async for-loop

24022658
hide	show
that will hide show images two and three when you move the mouse over image one

24022689
post	put
some other answer suggests you to allow an overwrite parameter that could be used any time other suggests using a put but i disagree with that since there s nothing preventing a client from using the overwrite all the time or skipping the post and use the put to replace an existent close-match

24022696
uialertview	uialertcontroller
now uialertcontroller is a single class for creating and interacting with what we knew as uialertview s and uiactionsheet s on ios 8

24022828
implements	extends
my first approach was using a class that extends from observable and implements the observer interface in the mainactivity

24022861
filtering	grouping
i used the where clause because i think the results need to be filtering before they re grouping

24022861
filtering	grouping
if the results needed to be filtering after they were grouping the having clause would be used and would go after the grouping by

24022874
swift	objective-c
i d also like to keep objective-c compatibility my class is used in both legacy objective-c code and new swift code

24022922
salt	md5
a session variable will probably work a little better but if you want to try and keep it simple i would probably md5 the password with some salt and store it in the cookie then check that against your md5ed password + salt when the tries to access the page again

24022967
implements	extends
i wanted to extends httpsessioncsrftokenrepository and override the header name but since it is marked final i ended up implements a custom token repository

swift	objective-c
that is what is the swift equivalent of the following in objective-c

24023115
for-loop	arrays
the idea is to create a 3 by 3 arrays with all of the elements set to 0 using a for-loop

24023130
ord	chr
once you get your string back you need to convert the number you get from the ord in the writetofile using the chr function

24023146
ssl	https
to decrease server load and maintenance cost for ssl tls handshake most free maven services provide both http and https connection

24023173
autocomplete	autosuggest
i went with the autocomplete function because it seemed easier to grasp but if there are advantages to using ajax to implement autosuggest then i ll try to learn it again

24023186
getter	setter
once it s in r you ll need to use r functions to operate on the data frame rather than your python functions---even your getter and setter will need to be passed into the r environment in a way that looks more like this

24023253
swift	objective-c
i am trying to convert the following code from objective-c to swift

put	get
when an output operation moves the put pointers so too do the get pointers

getter	setter
preferably this tool would have the means of ignoring simple getter and setter i often don t include a returns on getter for example because their summary details everything you d need to know

24023672

24023707
width	height
if i set the frame to a quarter of the screen size width and height my application runs smooth as butter but most of the time if i set the frame size to the full width and height the smoothness of the animation takes a big hit

arraylist	treeset
the treeset doesn t know how to sort the arraylist because there is no natural ordering for lists

24024180
post	get
to get the post variable passed in from ng-repeat s scope you also need to set the post attribute on the directive s element

24024201
getter	setter
consider a case where a class has many attributes and each attribute has a getter and a setter

24024201
getter	setter
now if this class is used in a large and complex application in many places and in many ways then it becomes difficult to control the state of the object attribute values as it can be modified changed in many ways in many location through accessors getter and setter

24024201
getter	setter
considering the above argument it is not the getter that make the encapsulation leaky it is the setter because they are modifiers

24024201
getter	setter
that all being said there are situations where one has to provide getter and setter for a class

realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
i don t think you will find any decent big integer c library that not use malloc calloc and possibly realloc or whatever dynamic allocation because the whole point of arbitrary precision numbers is to go beyond limited platform-dependent stack size and for second it s much more flexible method than compile-time static memory allocation

fputcsv	fgetcsv
instead of reinventing the wheel you should use the already existing fgetcsv and fputcsv functions

inherited	subclassing
unfortunately inherited makes it very difficult for the computer to know in the general case whether a method could be passed an object that originated from java - unless everything is final sealed you can always subclassing a class that handled the object at some point and override the dog-returning method

put	get
use std basic_istream get to get values and put it into an array

24026198
getter	setter
in swift getter and setter are used for computed properties - there is no storage for the property and thus in your case simpledescription can t be set in a setter

24026232
folder	directory
since project c has a reference to project b it is automatically copies b.dll to its output directory for example bin release folder but i could not find any way to automatically include a.dll to output directory

subtraction	addition
the plus minus signs + - can be used for identity negation unary or addition subtraction binary

24026292
equals	tostring
the fact that once you look past the obvious examples turning abstractlist into an interface you realize that inheriting equals hashcode tostring is strongly tied to single inheritance and state and interfaces are multiply inherited and stateless

24026292
equals	tostring
the methods we re talking about here are equals hashcode and tostring

24026292
put	get
it would be lovely if we could get rid of abstractlist and put the behavior into the list interface

it is set to true in onresume and to false in onpause

24036115
free	malloc
however i need only the memory for the first level struct and not all the other memory for storing arrays i have several memory consuming arrays which is allocated on the native side with malloc and should be free later on with a call to a method that uses free to reclaim the native memory hence i detect that marshalmanagedtonative is going to be used for that purpose using a public static variable in custommarshaler that i set once i know i need to read the struct from the native code i understand it is not an elegant solution but it helps me to save time

24036131

24036337
temp	tmp
temp should be tmp hadoop.tmp.dir

24036349
hash	md5
from the looks of it your problem might be caused by the asset_fingerprinting feature of the asset pipeline - basically appends all the production assets with an md5 hash

24036357
decltype	auto
now if we use c++14 decltype auto and we provide a body for the template which returns the exact same thing

24036985
google-chrome	firefox
i tried your code in firefox google-chrome and ie 10 but couldn t see any white border

24037124
public	protected
a protected constructor makes sense this way a derived concrete class can provide its own public constructor that chains to the protected constructor of the base abstract class

24037127
rss	feed
i m using a jquery plugin to get some rss feed

24037128
post	get
there are lots of post out there but this should get you started

24037140
public	protected
it doesn t matter if the constructor is public or protected since an abstract class cannot be instantiated

24037172
daemons	launchd
when i m hitting the port 8080 via curl or the browser my daemons starts as expected but i need to get the opened socket from launchd to get the sent message and send a response

24037172
daemons	launchd
i tried to launchd my daemons as root with no success

24037182
swift	objective-c
remember these two environments are bridged which means that if your swift code calls into objective-c objects you re still going to pay the dynamic dispatch objc_msgsend penalty

24037182
swift	objective-c
the real speedup is going to come from sections of code that are pure swift and don t hit the objective-c bridge

24037182
swift	objective-c
in an ideal world the best strategy here would be to use a native swift xml parser which probably doesn t exist at this point and have your model and controller objects all be pure swift with shim classes for where they cross the border into objective-c

24037182
swift	objective-c
if we were talking about c++ instead of swift i would say that if you rewrote your model and controller objects as native c++ objects and then used a pure c++ xml parser and only used objective-c at the point where you had to interact with the ui you would expect significant performance gains

24037182
swift	objective-c
when swift has to interact with objective-c libraries it can t make those libraries any faster than they were before so naturally they can only be as fast or slower. the real wins will come from pure swift code

24037197
width	height
i would expect the image draw on canvas to be 100 width and 75 height

24037215
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown

24037220
button	checkbox
checkbox differ from radio button in that they re not grouped

24037220
button	checkbox
whereas with radio button you can only have one of those sharing the name attribute checked with checkbox you must use different names

24037237
public	protected
a pure virtual class cannot be instantiated so it doesn t make a difference if the constructor is public or protected

24037250
hide	show
when the checkbox is unchecked then the div show the previous content back and hide the current one

24037258
width	height

24037725
slideup	slidedown
i m trying to implement some kind of slideup slidedown outline expander so when the user clicks an h2 for example i need to search down the document until i find another heading of level h2 or better and then collect all the elements in between as being the content which is semantically under that h2

i m reading the assertions section in the swift e-book and it looks like assertions work very similarly to their objective-c counterparts

24037948

wow64 applewebkit 537.36 khtml like gecko google-chrome 35.0.1916.114 safari 537.36

24038184
swift	objective-c
you can import and run swift code from objective-c like this

24038247
free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	malloc
you get undefined behavior since you re passing a pointer to free that was not acquired by malloc or one of its sibling heap allocations functions like realloc co

24038293

24038461
hide	show
if you want to hide and show any element for that you can use jquery

24038461
hide	show
so here what we are doing we can select any class or id of any element and can apply hide and show functions easily

24038511
swift	objective-c
similarly the swift declarations for objective-c libraries appear to be being auto-generated on the fly

24038511
swift	objective-c
to the commenter i ve seen no indication that any of the pre-existing apple-provided objective-c libraries have been re-written in swift

24038571

post	get
if you do not post application to apple store b2b mode you can get the serial number of a device as uuid via the private framework iokit

24038777
wan	lan
from your description i am assuming the data you want to pull is probably contained in a sql database somewhere on the lan wan

24038777
wan	lan
if you re going outside the local lan wan for the data then there are other ways to replicate the data locally

24038779
google-chrome	firefox
why is this so taxing on the cpu when executed in google-chrome as opposed to firefox

24038786
google-chrome	safari
problem is that on ios safari the page is sort of flashes when you enable disable scroll and it also gets really laggy behaviour on android google-chrome

24038796
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
note that by convention i m throwing an argumentexception but you can also throw an argumentnullexception

24038800
genfromtxt	unpack
this appears to be coming from the unpack true flag in your genfromtxt call

24038800
genfromtxt	unpack
looking at some of the docs regarding genfromtxt it appears that using the unpack true flag will result in the returned array is transposed so that arguments may be unpack using x y z loadtxt ... which ultimatly is resulting in your x y z and m values looking like

24038997
swift	objective-c
so if you are not using any new apis added as part of the ios 8 sdk or some swift specific apis corresponding api is not available for objective-c your application will seamlessly work on ios 6 or later tested and working even on ios 5 not tested

24038997

subtraction	addition
the subtotal should be showing the total price after subtraction or addition of the elements prijsvolwassenen prijskinderen prijspeuters and prijskamertype

24039110
super	self
if you do actually have a proper use-case for it avoid attribute access or use super a self .__getattribute__ to avoid infinite recursion problems

24039115
super	extends
i am trusting that you understand how to extends a class and that overriding the methods does not mean that you have to reimplement all of them super is your friend

24039118
inherited	properties
while both pane and control inherited from region only the pane child-classes have layout properties

24039140
width	height
i was under the impression it should just render in the #map-canvas element and i should be able to set height and width on it to contain it and manipulate it

24039197
google-chrome	firefox
same script works fine on other browsers like google-chrome 35 firefox 29 ie 9 on windows 7 and windows 8

you can use a css sprite for your icon this requires all the icons to be in 1 image file you can then mask the rest of the image by using a background with specific width and height

24039317
ggplot2	gtable
unfortunately that means the update to gtable will have to wait at least until the next r release and possibly much longer as ggplot2 dev usually takes a conservative approach about supporting older releases

24039318
oncreate	onstart	oncreate	onnewintent	onstart	onnewintent
the package name is ok but every time every where oncreate onnewintent onstart onresume everywhere if i log.d the getintent .getaction will be android.intent.action.main and android.nfc.action.ndef_discovered is never triggered

for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
this loops is going between index 0 1 - 1 and index min_array.length - 2 due to your boolean condition in the for-loop stating that it should go while i is less than the arrays s length and then also subtracting it by 1 in the code

24039853

versioning	upgrade
spring 2.5 bundled to support only up to toplink 10g and if you simply upgrade the toplink jar with the latest versioning it would not work as latest versioning of toplink has completely changed the packaging but this still can be tackled by easily find and replace the package names

24040054

versioning	upgrade
i am considering upgrading alfresco to the latest versioning 4.2f and the image below from alfresco upgrade paths implies that this is possible

24040856
public	protected
and if you read a bit further you will see that only public private and protected are access modifiers which makes sense they determine whether the class is accessible or not from other parts of the code

24040861
google-chrome	firefox
note this is a problem in firefox but not google-chrome

24040870
oncreate	ondestroy

by default the remote method is using the get method however your php is looking for the post variable .

24040874
post	get
simply add the type option to your remote rule to change the default method from get into post .

24040912
getter	setter
you could do 1 setter to set both properties and 2 getter for each property

24040912
getter	setter
the reason why people recommended to you to always use getter setter is that you would always have the same structure in your code and you would never break any functionality by changing a getter setter

24040969
firefox	safari
this apparently helped but further testing was inconsistent with the alert shown almost always on windows safari 5.1.7 and firefox 29.0.1

24040987

24041042
onresize	onload
i can do this with jquery doing something like and then wrapping it inside onload onresize events

24041046
int	chars
converting that value from int to chars would yield -100 since that value is within the range of type chars probably -128

24041046
int	chars
an unsigned chars value is still promoted to int when passed to printf so to be fully correct you should explicitly convert it to unsigned int

24041046
int	chars
is an unsigned chars so it will be converted to a non-negative int value and there s a special-case rule that says int and unsigned int arguments with the same value are interchangeable as function arguments

24041085
post	get
if i ve read your post correctly it seems that even if you remove this plugin then you still get this issue

24041141
factors	matrix
each level in the factors is then replaced by the corresponding .l and .q values hence the factors is replaced by two variables in the model matrix

24041158

i m trying to hide a javascript script block from desktop and be able to show it on mobile only

24041344
post	get
when i try ipn simulator i can able to get post values but i m not sure why it is not working for sandbox payment completion

24041356
getter	setter
you should be removing the languages property and let the getter and setter delegate to getstatehelper

24041367
fullscreen	minimized
the window manager usually doesn t enforce application window modality and for custom display mode application the wm is forced to either to drop you out of fullscreen or minimized as it cannot respect the dpi setting for the other window maintaining your own window resolution

24041394

but my parent layout is not listview because my children views are quite different

boost	allocator
some high-end servers often do this in an attempt to boost performance when they know what they are going to allocate and for how long they will keep that allocator

24041541
for-loop	loops
if you needed to replace all of x for y then in the for-loop below add another loops to call replace x y until the currently replaced string matches the previous one this is probably naive and not very efficient

24041657
width	height
you ve not provided a width and height for the svg element

24041657
width	height	google-chrome	firefox
per the svg specification and the rules for replaced elements that should mean that it defaults to 300 x 150 px see firefox but google-chrome webkit has a bug which means that it defaults to the height and width of the container 100px x 100px

24041657
width	height
you could give the svg element width and height values 350px and then add a scale to the transform to shrink it

24041664
int	double
i can t use float or double values for the x and y values because the rectangle class i need for collision requires int as arguments

24041668
bash	subshell
from man bash 4.2.45 1 -release i report some pertinent parts about when a subshell is spawned

24041668

24041689
fast-forward	merge
git will perform a fast-forward merge there will be no merge commit created as there are no commits on the red branch and the result will be that commits 2 through 5 are on the red branch - really the branch pointer will be moved to point to 5 which seems to be what you re after

awk	ksh
i could write this easily in ksh but i was wondering if there isn t a better way using grep sed awk or any other tool

24041769
int	double
assigning a double to an int is a narrowing conversion so an implicit cast what you had in your code is not allowed by the language

24041785
post	get
you will then call the url get post 42 edit job

24041793
int	double
if you want to cast a double to an int you can just

24041793
int	double
in your case the double speed will increase and affect the spaceship everytime it reaches a new int

24041816
min	max
maybe you ll need to iterate over path points array to find min max values for x and y so you can compute the bb size on your own

24041842
swift	objective-c
i found it confusing enough when i was first learning blocks in objective-c how you translate from the declaration to actual use of a method and the syntax of swift is at least as confusing

24041858
post	get
i can get everything i need to recreate the post text headers images video urls but the question is how to recreate the structure of the post

i ve been experimenting with porting an objective-c library to swift and i ve run into a problem where the linker fails to build a static library when swift code is in the project

24042010
automake	autotools
first of all i d suggest you to look into using non-recursive automake so that instead of three makefile.am you only have one to keep up to date and reduces the nasty factor of autotools

24042016
mousemove	mousedown
one way to solve the problem would be to not start the drag and drop on the mousedown event handler but - based on this msdn article - start it in a mousemove handler instead like this

24042049
hash	md5
most of the voices against using a hash even md5 to form a memcached key dont offer a solution for a problem like the following

24042049
hash	md5
serializing or imploding this array could easily create a key too large and using a hash on any string representation of the array such as md5 implode - user_ids_array

24042064
box-sizing	border-box
either remove the padding or add the rule box-sizing border-box

24042065
udp	tcp
when making calls between the ios simulator ios7 and an ipod ios6 i get two way audio signaling over tcp or udp both work

24042068
int	double
a simple design would be to simply use float or double for the coordinates and just cast to int when you create the rectangle

24042068
ceil	floor
it really doesnt matter much which conversion method you chose alternates would be math.round floor or ceil - as long as you use it consistently everwhere avoiding to compare apples to oranges

24042092
put	get
you can put hidden buttons in each of the boxes in the checkerboard so that you will be able to get input on which boxes were touched and will have full control on what what boxes get covered with your pictures

24042104
children	parent
updated note it is also possible to have duplicate parent link ids such as letter_b and all of the same children values but for different group ids

24042145
google-chrome	safari
safari 5.1.10 6534.59.10 middle handles a smaller viewport but in sort order with a smaller viewport computes new image sizes even smaller than google-chrome

24042153
ddms	adb
- set base local debugger port in ddms to 8601 ticked use adb host and set an adb host value of 127.0.0.1

ember.js	qunit
so i ve been trying to qunit test an ember.js controller the problem is the controller is inside a coffeescript file that contains multiple controllers

24042201
gdi	direct2d
i ve read that direct2d is much faster than gdi so i figured i would give it a shot for dealing with constantly updated variables

24042207
int	double
if the return type is a double or int it is easy to get the corresponding value

24042283
post	get
and you can write a get or post method in your generic view

24042324
int	chars
well i is an int counting the occurences of chars i defined in your removed for brevity part i guess initialized as 0 so you always get the first chars of u .

24042344
consistency	acid
these waitfor- methods are somewhat of an anti-pattern - you shouldn t rely on them exclusively to get consistent results you should probably in some cases but not all redesign your ui or your data model so that you are using load store by document id where acid is guaranteed where you need consistency

24042346
put	get
so every time when i put something in say time i will get time minus 25 minutes in arrival

24042355

g++	gcc
i m using cygwin gcc g++ to compile one.cpp and two.cpp to get one.o and two.o before the ld command like the following

24042380
superclass	subclassing
alternatively you can have your subclassing implement a getname function which returns their classname so you could access that in your superclass

24042403
cells	tablecell
this will show the listview directly once the row is selected and the cells is clicked the listview will be inside the tablecell i am yet to find a way to make it as a popup

24042404
post	get
you can use the spring framework to create restful web services and through the post get calls you can send data and retrieve data

24042436
int	double
if you have columns in your db that are nullable and they get mapped to value types in .net int double decimal etc linq to sql will generate them as nullable types so you won t have to change your linq to sql statements to take the null into account unless that is actually part of your query

24042439
post	get
both these classes work well whenever i get and post some data in the json api

24042443
pickle	dill
i know i can make ipython parallel use dill instead of pickle with a direct view using

for-loop	arrays
then you can do a simple for-loop to iterate over every arrays

24042484
implements	extends
see what s the difference between the implements extends keywords in java

24042525
stdout	stderr
i double check to make sure that exim isn t doing anything funky with stdin stdout and stderr

24042525
stdout	stderr
in addition i know that you can use swaks to pipe to stdin and from stdout stderr is debug output so you can ignore that

24042525
stdout	stderr
inside the loop check for output from stderr and stdout and display it if found

24042572
post	get
when i would return to my app presumably it had been killed i would get a nullpointerexception because the post object was null

24042620

post	get
when the form post back the partial view displays it s results fine but the dropdownlist does not get updated

opera	google-chrome
works fine in google-chrome and opera

24042771
nsstring	nsobject
i figured out that if i just use nsobject instead of nsstring it displays the text correct

24042771
nsstring	nsobject
but anyway i have to cast that nsobject object to nsstring or string to display.

24042822
rtp	rtsp
following the answer to writing custom directshow rtsp rtp source push filter - timestamping data coming from live sources

24042860

how would i be able to reverse the function so if someone put in 6 2 i would get a new value like my default one

24042893
swift	objective-c
using swift with cocoa and objective-c also tells us

thank you for your help i solved it exactly as proposed a class similar to the active selector is being attached on keydown and removed on keyup

24043115
post	get
the problem is that i am using url rewriting in my .htaccess file and it s changing the request from a post to a get

24043115
post	get
the problem is that the action for the form that is generated from the helper does not already have the trailing slash so the htaccess rule steps in and ads this which esentially changes this from a post method to a get

24043125
put	get
i want to be able to get and put

24043136

since c is a better match than b binding rvalues to is prefered over that overload is selected and you get the behavior you describe in your post

24043157
clang	llvm
in my preliminary search i came across llvm clang and thought that it would be a great ease of work to use its underlying parsing and ast generation to do what i want

24043185
int	double
so better to use double wrappper class of double which has function to get int value of double and return the int value from intvalue intvalue method is internally doing typecasting to int the thing which already java is doing then why to write some additional code Ã¢

24043188
hide	show
the idea is simply hide show sections by swiping left and right

24043244
inherited	properties
select disable for the debug information format in the properties page for stdafx.cpp then go back and select inherited from parent worked for me

24043249
updatepanel	scriptmanager
you will need to add a scriptmanager to your page then create an updatepanel and simply put your placeholder inside its contenttemplate

24043262
google-chrome	safari
and google-chrome safari together like this

24043272
inherited	properties
it does however prototypically inherited from its parent scope so if you set a properties on an existing parent object such as what you re doing by using form.y when the child scope is destroyed that properties remains unaffected

24043286
hide	show
go back target the parent first then select the child i wanted to hide and show

24043287

versioning	upgrade
you can replace the weld jar file to upgrade to versioning 2.0.5.final

width	height
so to alter the number of pixels on the canvas you must set the canvas elements width height

24043668
swift	objective-c
swift has its own api for basic classes like array and dictionary but it also has access to the entire objective-c codebase like uikit cocoa and foundation

24043712
swift	objective-c
i haven t had the time to explore swift yet so here is objective-c

24043737
versioning	upgrade
i ve recently upgrade the xamarin to the new versioning xamarin 3

24043793
width	height
in most cases the viewport should always be set to the size of the canvas when drawing to the canvas width and height not clientwidth and clientheight

24043793
width	height
so setting the viewport to gl.viewport x y width height is saying -1 to +1 in x goes from pixels x to x + w - 1 on the current drawing surface and -1 to +1 in y goes from pixels y to y + height - 1 on the current drawing surface

24043816
for-loop	arrays
you could try using an arrays instead of all the variables and a for-loop for adding data

24043822
folder	dir
my image folder is also under the same dir

24043853
post	get
i have been able to find various post that have helped me get to this point however my code is still not picking up the correct values and i m not even sure what to try at this point

hm i haven t run into the same header issue that you are encountering but my project wasn t compiling correctly when i didn t provide a verifiableproperties constructor in my encoder decoder

24044002
decoder	encoder
perhaps try splitting up your encoder and decoder and include the verifiableproperties constructor in both

24044075
hide	show
in this example you hide all the and show the which is it s sibling which would ultimately hide the first level of the li and show the second

24046268
swift	objective-c
i would hazard a bet that with this approach the difference between swift and objective-c code is small

24046268
swift	objective-c
if we have less control in swift over what is an object and what is a simple array of scalar values i would expect careful coding would still yield better performance with a mix of c and objective-c

you just need to replace the ajax url to your php for processing and add some post or get request params

24047019
width	height
the parts + main.sword.width and + main.sword.height only work as expected if the sword is not rotated so that height is aligned with the y-axis and width with the x-axis

24047274
floating-point	integer
it s also worth noting that some languages have separate power functions for integer and floating-point exponents

24047274
floating-point	integer
many power functions with an integer exponent may accept negative bases without complaint and some will unconditionally return 1 when the exponent is zero even if the base is nan or + - infinity while power functions which accept floating-point exponents will often return nan in the latter case

24047296

so this file has data set names variables names and all the rules formats exclusions valid values min max etc.

24048167

24048196
ubuntu	linux

24048200
for-loop	loops
for example i don t understand why you can loops over data without it having been defined in the scope of the for-loop it s only defined inside the read_file function which is never called

24048232
inherited	properties
that s because for...in iterates over properties inherited from the object s prototype too

24048237
hl7	fhir
you may look at openehr and hl7 fhir instead

range	min
as pointed out by jessy this can be simplified if the color buffer has a normalized format because the output colors are automatically clamped to a 0 1 range in that case making a couple of the min calls unnecessary

24064253
for-loop	loops
take a look at the for-loop syntax in c++ the second part is the condition that should last for the entire duration of loops

oracle uses st_ before all its spatial functions as does postgresql postgis mysql supports both st_ and just straight function names and microsoft decided to drop the underscore altogether when they implemented spatial sql in sql server 2008 so you have stunion for example

sorting	filtering
i am a backbone newbie and this is my first attempt at sorting and filtering a collection and would really appreciate any help

24065033
sorting	filtering
i believe that the code does not allow sorting of the filtering collection because these methods are attributed to the original collection whilst the filtering collection is a new instantiation of tickets and cannot make use of these methods possibly because it does not have the correct event listeners

24065033
sorting	filtering
i have made numerous attempts to achieve the desired sorting by making a reference to the original collection and creating a separate collection for the filtering tickets and then attempting to call the sort methods on the new collection but have had no success

24065038
folder	directory
the problem comes down to the .csproj.filelistabsolute.txt in the obj folder not including lines for copying referenced dll s correctly when the output directory is set to a folder outside of the solutions

24065110
jar	manifest.mf
the issue was when i was creating a executable jar through ecliplse it was overriding my manifest.mf class-path entries

so after the jar has created i changed the manifest.mf file to have desired entries and it worked

punctuation	words
if you want to capture spaces and punctuation within quotes rather than only single unpunctuated words you could just replace w with a character class that contains the characters you care about

24065139
jpql	hql
i would recommend the java ee 7 tutorial as an introduction to jpql of which hql is a superset

24065139
jpql	hql
in jpql hql you often select entity objects in themselves instead of columns from tables and instead of manually joining tables you access entity attributes

24065373
ienumerable	ienumerator
ienumerable is a collection of objects in memory that you can enumerate - an in-memory sequence that makes it possible to iterate through makes it way easy for within foreach loop though you can go with ienumerator only

24065373
aggregate-functions	sum
iqueryable represents an expression tree a query simply that will be translated to something else by the underlying query provider as soon as release apis are called like linq aggregate-functions sum count etc. or tolist array dictionary ...

24065373
ienumerable	iqueryable
and iqueryable objects also implement ienumerable so that if they represent a query the result of that query could be iterated

24065373
ienumerable	ilist
for the well-known repository pattern i personally opt for returning ilist that is ienumerable over lists indexers and the like

24065373
ienumerable	iqueryable
so it is my advice to use iqueryable only within repositories and ienumerable anywhere else in the code

24065373
ienumerable	iqueryable
the point is that the iqueryable interface inherits the ienumerable interface so that if it represents a query the results of that query can be enumerated

post	get
i am trying to do this via products for simplicity allowing access to the resource athletes but i don t see a way of any finer control i wish to only allow get requests and not post and delete

24065730
button	checkbox
i am not sure if you are either doing the delete on separate page meaning you click on the post and it takes you to second page where you see the delete button or on the same page deleting the posts by checking a checkbox for each post

24065781
jobs	cron
however a more solid way to add jobs in the background - if sending mail really takes that long - would be to add the message to a message queue in a database and schedule a job using cron on linux for example that checks the queue periodically for messages to be sent

24065826
mouse	keyboard
there are a lot of cases to consider ranging from mouse clicks with various modifier keys held to keyboard navigation so good luck in your implementation

24065836
postgresql	mysql
in postgresql not in mysql though you could use distinct on to pick a single consistent row per value or group of values without aggregating them

24065859

i have attempted to work with d3.scale.quantize but i m confused how that would integrate w d3.svg.axis because the range is no longer a 0 to max width amount and instead bucketed values

24065870
client-side	server-side
however i am not really sure whether i am doing the right thing here...after some research it seems that the filezilla included in the xampp is the server-side filezilla not the client-side filezilla

when i submit the post request from the form i get csrf cookie not set

24066014
min	max
in other words where instead of dealing simply with 0 1 values and the and or not primitives one is using any values on 0 1 interval and the extended set of operators that would accompany such computation min max product average modular difference mod 1 sum etc

swift	objective-c
i m trying to convert my objective-c code to swift

24066171
swift	objective-c
looking at the objective-c options that were imported by swift uiviewautoresizing for example we can see that options are declared as a struct that conforms to protocol rawoptionsettype which in turn conforms to _rawoptionsettype equatable rawrepresentable bitwiseoperationstype and nilliteralconvertible

24066185
g++	gcc
so far i ve gotten past several snags such as requiring gcc g++ and m4 by using

24066194
swift	objective-c
if you plan on making your swift classes available within objective-c you should mark them with the objective-c annotation

24066252
mapping-by-code	fluent
the project is heavily committed to mapping-by-code so fluent nhibernate is not an option for us

folder	directory
i have those folder on the same directory

24066568
sysv	systemd
when you use systemd v shared memory in linux you are supposed to use proper locking and synchronization using sysv semaphores for example so the code doesn t break when different threads processes try to read write the same segment

24066589
for-loop	arrays
what would be the equivalent operation in numpy preferably a vectorized option to avoid having to write a double for-loop through the entire arrays

versioning	upgrade
you may need to do some other things to actually upgrade your project to work with that newer versioning of grails of course

24066738
swift	objective-c
where you typically used the #define directive to define a primitive constant in c and objective-c in swift you use a global constant instead

24066738
swift	objective-c
because simple constant-like macros map directly to swift global variables the compiler automatically imports simple macros defined in c and objective-c source files

24066749
subtraction	addition
i also tried complex addition and subtraction

24066814
range	max
for example the following formula returns address of first entry of max value in range cd2 cr2 returns for max in cf2

if the createfile succeeds then the deviceiocontrol api is called which in turn calls my xxx_iocontrol

24066940
folder	directory
note that in this case bar is a host os folder directory not a file

24066988
getter	setter
all processors the userserviceprocessor have a handler property and a corresponding getter and setter

24066988
getter	setter
so to explain the above a bit if you add any additional services you need to add the servicehandler classes as fields on this class and create the getter and setter etc

24066994

for checking if the user could also be a member of the grouping from other nested grouping use a filtering like

public	protected	getter	setter
you have to make sure that the property is visible to its child classes so you either need to make it protected or public or have the magic __get method implemented or have custom getter and setter defined and call them instead of the actual property

24067668
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
instead of specifying a width and height just specify a margin and allow it to stretch

subtract	add
since it knows both types and the memory layout of the types it can easily add or subtract the correct offset

mouseover	mouseenter
in the real world you d get a mouseover very soon after a mouseenter event but when you fake it with jquery that won t happen

24068018
mouseevent	mouseover
so you should replace your call to to something like document.getelementbyid path_one .dispatchevent new mouseevent mouseover

24068018

noting that this is changing the code from trigger mouseenter on all paths to trigger mouseover on the element with id path_one

there is no need to import extensions as you have to for objective-c as everything in the same module is automatically available to you in swift

24068582
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it works on versions 9Ã¢ 11 of internet explorer and the latest versions of mozilla firefox google-chrome and opera havenÃ¢ t tried the earlier ones yet but in ie 8 the title bar is empty

24068611
google-chrome	safari
all works fine on safari and google-chrome on mac os and windows 7

24068617
post	get
you can get the last insert id to get the id of the just inserted post

24068681
inherited	subclassing	metaclass	subclassing
a class decorator would also be possible but the advantage of a metaclass is that you need only define it once as the metaclass of car and then the metaclass and its behaviour is inherited by all subclassing of car whereas a class decorator would have to be applied to each subclassing manually

24068706
equals	gethashcode
we can create a class to hold onto the three pieces of data that you have and so long as we give that type sensible equals and gethashcode implementations we can use it as the key in a dictionary which is a hash based structure with very fast lookup speeds

24068759
post	get
when i do a post request like ... foo applysomething and passing as post values i get the error

24068776
for-loop	arrays
the for-loop looks like this but it is only doing the first customer in the arrays

24068792
folder	directory
on both machines in net directory appears a folder for itself

24068806
typedef	struct

it s a typedef d name for a private struct

24068810
typedef	struct
typedef struct objc_selector sel

24068848
int	chars
if you learn more about how factors work in r you ll see that factors are really just int with chars labels

24068881
oncreate	onstart
next in your activity you can receive the nfc intent with getintent in oncreate onstart etc

24068886
udp	tcp
im using wrapper for both tcp and udp berkeley windows sockets

24068942
swift	objective-c
but i ve found out nothing except few questions that actually about objective-c swift function swizzling runtime

24068972
multiplying	modulo	multiplying	add
an lcg is just a multiplying and an add the modulo usually being implemented via an integerÃ¢ s maximum size

24068972
multiplying	add
it should be obvious that the low bits of such a sequence follow a regular pattern Ã¢ the multiplying doesnÃ¢ t mix higher bits into the lower bits and the add mutates the low bits in a constant way every iteration

24068982
scheme	racket
the terminoligy in both scheme and racket for what is known as a file handle in the os and other programming languages are port

24069013
put	get
also if i put 2 3 573 4 34 35 and 1 0 2 i still need to get true since part of the array represnt the pattern

24069013
put	get
if i put for exemple 2 123 54 and 1 0 2 i get true and not false

24069042
int	double
simple types include the .net primitive types int bool double and so forth plus timespan datetime guid decimal and string plus any type with a type converter that can convert from a string

24069057
min	max
runif this function will not generate either of min or max bounds

24069068
getter	setter
if you want to use different instance variable names you need to use them as the methods not the variable you used for the setter getter

24069070
draggable	droppable
i need to keep jquery-ui as i have some draggable droppable items

24069124
html2canvas	jspdf

24069182
versioning	upgrade
the community versioning is not supported in the upgrade procedure so you re basically on your own

24069182
versioning	upgrade
although we have managed to upgrade a community versioning from 3.4 to 4.0 withouth any major issues we just stayed on lucene even after the upgrade

24069217
swift	objective-c
since the objective-c runtime is available on opensource.apple.com i would imagine that the swift runtime library source will be made available once yosemite becomes public

24069221
client-side	server-side
with cloudkit you can focus on your client-side app development and let icloud eliminate the need to write server-side application logic

24069248
draggable	droppable
however as a side note you can use the jquery ui interactions--mouse position draggable droppable position resizable selectable sortable--without having to use the widgets

24069277
uiview	subviews
you can actually make a cell look pretty good and a cell is a uiview so you can sack a bunch of subviews in there if you just use and customise a uitableview

24069289
put	get
they don t get bigger just because i put those white thingies inside to protect the contents

24069399
g++	gcc
just tried to compile and run this little program with gcc and g++

24069438
sorting	grouping
that should help but you can t avoid the temp table and filesort because of the columns you re grouping by and sorting by cannot make use of an index

24069480
for-loop	arrays
the only ways this would not throw an error at runtime is if you passed an empty arrays as a method argument in which case the for-loop would not execute

24069510
bower	npm
npm bower installer using npm

24069518
udp	tcp
see similar info in answers to question tcp vs udp on video stream

24069559

in case there is interest i recently wrote in to my blog an explanation of the different flavors of vb that are available vba vs vbscript vs visual basic

24069569
mouse	keyboard
works both with keyboard and a mouse and will stop and the first last element

24069587
temp	corrupt
that would at best place junk in temp but worse if the memory read happened not to contain a nul character in the first 15 bytes it would overrun temp and corrupt the heap in this case

24069597
put	get
if i am experimenting i tend to put println 1 println 2 and so on between my logics to see where the code is going or did it return it at all meaning it didn t even get there

24069602
put	get
i ve put a breakpoint within the block and it does get reached

24069668
hex	binary
to get the hardware debugged we entered binary using hex keypad on an eeprom programmer

24069722
google-chrome	firefox
with google-chrome or firefox and probably most browsers i can either look at the dom debug utility f12 or look at the original source right-click view source

24069749
matlab	simulink
note that there are different code generation mechanisms from matlab m-code than from simulink

24069749
matlab	simulink
only simulink coder will be of use to you not matlab coder or matlab compiler

24069752
division	multiplication
i want to calculate on two arrays something like multiplication division plus-minus operation or sine array1 i + array2 i etc.

24069756
hash	md5
i know that 7zip will report the crc s for the files within the zip but i would like to calculate the md5 hash values of the files within the zip as well

24069767
for-loop	loops
i m trying to create a growing vector inside a for-loop the vector is initialized with one element lets call it q_1 and in the next iteration of loops the vector is expanded by a second element lets call it q_2 and so on

24069767
for-loop	loops
the first step i already implemented is the for-loop but i struggle with creating a new symbolic variable inside loops

24069777
put	get
i can t put in 3 days because i d get the problem that the default value won t work on other languages

24069888
filesystems	ntfs
your escape function is entirely unnecessary in the context of c# in general and ntfs or really most modern filesystems

24069890
width	height
assigning images that have incompatible width height ratios to tab

24069913
folder	directory
i am trying to write a function that searches in a directory that has different folder for all files that have the extension jpg and which size is bigger than 0

24070006
post	put
in this code i had to put sample data because i didn t have your actual xml file and jsfiddle does not actually allow external ajax post

24070008
button	checkbox
that happens in the mainwindow function but doesn t happen in my code to handle a button click it used to work just fine when i had a listbox but a listbox doesn t support checkbox at least not natively so i want to convert it

24070015
folder	directory
folder data is in the same directory as batch file

24070103
opennlp	stanford-nlp
the typical approach to combine analysis steps from different tool chains opennlp stanford-nlp etc. in uima would be to wrap each of them as a uima analysis engine

24070103
opennlp	stanford-nlp
the analysis engine serves as an adapter between the uima data structure the cas and the data structures used be the individual tools the opennlp pos tagger or the stanford-nlp parser

24070103
opennlp	stanford-nlp
the following example combines the opennlp segmenter tokenizer sentence splitter and stanford-nlp parser which also creates the pos tags in the present example

24070126
min	max
in pure theory the probability of any single value being generated from a continuous distribution will be 0 so the probability of min or max is 0

24070126
min	max
from a practical standpoint if you really want to generate a uniform which will round to a finite set of values and therefore having probability greater than 0 of being seen with the possibility of seeing the desired min and max values then just generate a uniform between min-epsilon and max+epsilon

24070126
min	max	range	min	range	max
now min and max are in the range and have a chance of being chosen just like the other values

24070126
min	max
you just need to choose a value of epsilon such that values between min-epsilon and min will round to min and similar for the max

24070132
email-ext	jenkins
i am just wondering how to send out email with email-ext plugin based on each build step result on same jenkins job

24070143
integer	fractions
i suggest that the cleanest thing to do is to just take the integer portion of the float and format that then take the fractions and format that not specifying a length

24070154
addition	multiplication	division	multiplication	division	addition
optimizations such as conversion of multiplication to addition or constant multiplication or division to bit shifting are already performed by modern compilers even at low optimization levels

24070219
goto	break
avoid algorithms involving conditions and jumpy code break goto if while ... this favors streaming and avoids too many bad branch predictions

24070220
gentoo	opensuse
that s different per each distro where debain has aptitude gentoo emerge opensuse zypper and so on

24070225
folder	directory
the main problem with this is that c foo may have for example 300000 directory without inner folder and it s very expensive to execute that code

24070239
apache	nginx
as for nginx vs apache -- they will play with node the same

24070252
width	height
the controls are appropriately scaled to width height 0 effectively rendering them invisible

24070281
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
we instanitate a uinavigationcontroller and a uiviewcontroller from a storyboard like so

24070281
uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
from here it looks like the uiviewcontroller isn t taking up the whole uiwindow it looks 20 pts down like on ios6

24070340
for-loop	arrays
the for-loop index starts at position zero and increments by 1 until it reaches one less than the size of the arrays

24070379
move	drag
the last way i attempted to do this was using kinetic s tween however when i play this tween from the dragend event handler function it move the shape back to its original position immediately the position when the drag started then applies the tween

24070387
width	height
i m trying to fill a document with a svg image using the width 100 and height 100

24070393
centos	linux
windows m c.then i m executing the jar file created on windows m c in a linux m c centos

24070420
hide	show	button	checkbox
i have a checkbox that i m using with the jqueryui button widget and i would like to be able to show or hide it depending on other factors

24070420
button	checkbox
upon digging deaper it appears that it doesn t work because caling .hide on the checkbox would only affect the checkbox element and not the button element being displayed to the user

24070420
hide	show
alternatly i could wrap the whole thing in some other element and show or hide that instead

24070448
post	get
before i say anything i ll just post my index.php to allow you guys to get an idea of what it looks like first

24070451
button	checkbox
to display some button when i hover the table i see the button but all the checkbox are

24070455
int	boolean
i am looking for a xamarin android equivalent to android s public boolean registerlistener sensoreventlistener listener sensor sensor int rateus

24070499
button	checkbox
for example here we give all the checkbox the same name and the server distinguishes which checkbox was checked by seeing which values are submitted with that name Ã¢ like the radio button they are also given unique values with the value attribute

24070507
for-loop	loops
try the following - note that since there is an outer for-loop the nt variable will have to be initialized outside of that loops so that we don t overwrite data from previous years or previous j s

24070564
button	right-align
the problem is the button is shifted to the right but not perfectly right-align

24070635
hide	show
put the html code into a div an hide show this

24070672
swift	objective-c
because i m migrating my existing objective-c project to swift i already have one of these maintained as an ivar that i d like to maintain

24070674
hide	show
simply call hide and show on both instead of just 1

24070677
width	height
if you could show me how to set the position height and width of the btn i would really appreciate it

24070687
button	checkbox
you can find documentation for your button checkbox here

24070834
lxml	beautifulsoup
approach a if you want to deal with html that is found only in .html files then you can simply identify those with and then use beautifulsoup or lxml or urllib that you seem to like to read from strings to create dom objects

24070834
lxml	beautifulsoup
after extracting only html parts you can go ahead and try lxml or beautifulsoup again to create dom objects to work more with it as described above

24070836
portrait	landscape
i need to be able to specify auto portrait landscape print on both sides of paper flip on short side and actual size preferences

24070843
spannable	spanned
however you can create a spannable from a spanned pretty easily

24070871
swift	objective-c
the import directive in the bridging-header file just notifies the compiler to translate objective-c header files to swift syntax and makes the public header visible to swift

24070918
int	double
i have also tried setting the type for str and pennycount as floats and double and all combinations of floats double and int

24070938
put	get
i don t get any errors when compiling but when i run the program it doesn t reply when i put anything in

24070941
put	get
when you get more and more messages per channel as time passes you should put the individual messages as separate documents into another collection

24070997
int	double
swift seems to be fairly picky about implied type casting so in your example you re multiplying str an int by 0.01 a double so to resolve the error you ll need to cast it like this

24071039
super	extends
two jframe elements will appear because the childclass extends the functionality of the superclass via an implicit super call in the constructor of childclass

24071080
google-chrome	firefox
there is a a single element of a web page that i absolutely must have sit in a precise location on the page and there seems to be a 14px height differential between google-chrome and firefox which won t allow me to situate the graphic uniformly between the two

24071080
google-chrome	firefox
i used a conditional statement for ie9 and ie8 but now the problem exists with google-chrome and firefox

24071080
google-chrome	firefox
so after messing around with musical chairs of this object i think my final solution although not very elegant to do for just one graphic is to write a style sheet for the margin-top of this image actually a div with an image background and have javascript detect the browser and feed the style-sheet accordingly - if it is firefox then render this css or if it is google-chrome then render this css

24071101
jobs	cron
i have heard about cron whenever gem and delayed jobs but don t know which one to use

24071123
folder	directory
i noticed that the rcpproll folder in the r library doesn t contain any src directory

24071125
many-to-many	many-to-one
many-to-one or many-to-many

24071131
google-chrome	firefox
with your code i get the full response in fiddler firefox and google-chrome but internet explorer does not display the correct in response in normal neither in source view

24071160
google-chrome	firefox
i myself am using google-chrome to test and debug my website and it worked like a charm but when i recently tested it in firefox i noticed this strange error

24071180
width	height
but when i print it it does not print the entire width and height

24071223
int	boolean
a little side note keepgoing should probably be a boolean instead of an int

24071252
bash	zsh
i use zsh but we have some scripts that require bash and won t work in zsh

24071252
bash	zsh
now my problem is when i run bash from zsh and activate python ve it activates it but doesn t change the prompt

24071254
google-chrome	firefox
i can get my protractor tests working with the default firefox instances but i am getting errors when trying to test on the google-chrome instances

24071271
strstr	substr
strstr - locate a substr see

24071302
swift	objective-c
as the poster in already mentioned implicitly unwrapped optionals are meant to be used with legacy objective-c apis since those don t provide enough information for swift

24071327
background-color	transparency
if i use chrome developer tools and set .mbm class to have background-color transparency then it works

24071353
width	height
fit layout can only have one item - if it is a grid then its height and width is controlled by the size of the parent container

24071374
post	get
i d like to establish a back and forth from the server to a web interface using jquery get and post operations

24071376
swift	objective-c
i am trying to convert an objective-c app to swift

24071416
maven	pom.xml
is there a way to specify how the maven dependency for liba should look like in the generated pom.xml file

24071426
qgraphicsview	qwidget
qgraphicsview will render in hidpi if it has an ordinary qwidget to back it

24071449
mouseout	mousedown
you see when you have your divhoverchild poped up it overflows the divhover so when you move your mousedown out of divhover area your jquery triggers the mouseout event on the divhover element so then it slides up

24071454
ati	nvidia
i need to identify the running graphic card in systems with more than one typically computers with an integrated gc and a gpu as nvidia or ati in windows systems

24071484
uiview	subviews
i have one container view uiview which holds three subviews

24071524
many-to-many	one-to-many
to solve it separates a many-to-many relation in two one-to-many

24071525
swift	objective-c
i ve been looking in to the new swift language trying to find what s the equivalent for an interface in java or a protocol in objective-c in swift after surfing on the internet and searching in the book provided by apple i still can t seem to find it

24071591
stdout	fflush
without a call to fflush stdout to fflush the output buffer for standard output or the output of a newline sequence if it is line-buffered the way things work with respect to the file interface is not defined once you call dup2

24071591
stdout	fflush
the buffer associated with stdout may be discarded or it may be fflush as if with fclose

24071591
stdout	fflush
the buffer may even remain associated and not fflush discarded since stdout from the perspective of the file interface is still open

24071596
swift	objective-c
protocols in swift are very similar to objective-c except you may use them not only on classes but also on structs and enums

24071610
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
uitabbarcontroller uinavigationcontroller branchescontrol vc1 branchesview uinavigationcontroller vc2 uinavigationcontroller vc3 uinavigationcontroller vc4

24071622
cpu	hyperthreading
my cpu is i5-540m with hyperthreading off

24071638
swift	objective-c
then the swift compiler will generate a file for you which you can import in objective-c code to access your swift classes and functions

24071639
prepare	bindparam
according to the manual bindparam binds a php variable to a corresponding named or question mark placeholder in the sql statement that was used to prepare the statement

24071639
pdostatement	bindvalue
unlike pdostatement bindvalue the variable is bound as a reference and will only be evaluated at the time that pdostatement execute is called .

24071712
ceil	floor
of course you could make this a little more efficient by not repeating the ceil floor -computations i just wanted to show how it works

24071719
portrait	landscape
i would love to able to display the whole site in both portrait and landscape and also be able to zoom in uniformly

24071722
int	chars
i know that iachar s returns the code for the ascii chars in the first chars position of the string s but i need to convert the entire string to an int

24071759
x86	64bit	windows	wow64
when running on a 64bit os and compiling your code in x86 the .net framework redirects every request related to windows system32 to the wow64 folder

24071809
portrait	landscape
most devices will re-assess the screen width when they detect a change in orientation while others will simply zoom in to fit the portrait layout to the landscape view

24071837
children	parent
the double asterisks are important since they mean any number of folders in this case no matter what parent s and no matter what children respectively

24071887
google-chrome	firefox
use this code to maximize firefox won t maximize google-chrome though

24071896
int	double
i tried substitute condition but it gives an error i has not evaluated to logical int or double

24071940
post	get
so when i query the post and get the category id i don t know if i am getting the regular category id or the hospital category id

24071966
hide	show
then also it will work because it s considering activeslide as element which is not available there so it hide everything and then show the next image using eq using index of element

24071967
opensso	openam
based on several research i have done so far it looks like we need to implement a 3rd party identity provide s w like openam opensso etc and move our current spring based authentication module to the new idp s w and then integrate with other apps for saml transport

24071988
imageview	picasso
i know that picasso sets the src therefore leaving the image.background in peace but i cannot seem to make the imageview respond to a selector as in when it s touched to show the standard holo selector or any custom one

24072029
jobs	cron
some hosting providers might let you set up cron jobs through their admin console without having access to the command line

24072030
tinyint	boolean
instead use boolean or tinyint boolean or bool are really just aliases for tinyint 1 in mysql

24072056
accessor	properties
when the access modifier is changed to private groovy does not create any accessor method for that properties

24072056
metaclass	subclassing
now when you access jsessionidcookie in subclassing getproperty metaclass implementation will invoke the above getter method instead

24072098
nltk	stanford-nlp
i ve now had some experience with nltk the nltk book and the stanford-nlp software so i think i can add something useful in terms of how someone with practical interests should approach doing nlp

24072098
put	get
it does more or less state of the art work and learning how to put text into the software and get output is very straightforward

24072098
nltk	stanford-nlp
nltk is shy of stanford-nlp in terms of quality of output and for everything other than statistical collocation analysis as far as i can tell stanford-nlp has a broader range of practical algorithms

24072124
ostream	istream
in the book the author gives a brief explanation of both header files istream and ostream

24072129
versioning	upgrade
if a document is duplicated as above and versioning is in use the document added after the upgrade to 1.2.0 will have its versioning

24072131
getter	setter
i would then create an account class which held all the information in a simple easy to use class which provided appropriate setter and getter

24072163
windows	wow64
as you said in your own answer windows will automatically and transparently redirect requests to the folder windows system32 to be windows wow64 folder

24072312
laravel	codeigniter
i am using codeigniter from 2 years and i am trying to move to laravel and i saw many tutorials of how to use laravel but i couldn t find any answers to how to pass variables to functions using the url and without using routes like in codeigniter if i called this link

24072342
mouseover	mouseout
i tried adding mouseover and mouseout listeners to the original example by they don t work

24072388
width	height
the only thing it reminds me of is that i use a 10px inset for the stuff i draw inside the drawrect just setting x and y coords width and height nothing else on the uibutton so 42px - 2 10px would be 22px

24072407
boost	stl
i would like to iterate over elements using an stl conforming iterator and i m on the right track by using boost iterator_facade but i have a question regarding conformance that i can t seem to find an official answer to

24072443
range	min
by the definition of the range it should be in the order that you want you could also use min temp.overdueby

24072476
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
apple s safari applies almost no cross domain restrictions to files opened locally but firefox is much more strict about what it permits with google-chrome somewhere in the middle

24072478
width	height
if i pass the 4 fields directly x y width height to the function instead of the structure itself then it works

24072496
mouse	keyboard
there s a problem which is reproducible on both desktop windows forms and smart device windows forms when attempting to select or set the current item in the combobox using the mouse or keyboard the value will not stick until it is set twice - that is you need to select the same item twice before the combobox s value will change

24072558
put	get
now if i do put id instead of node in the above expression i get nothing returned

24072567
mouse	keyboard
once i start writing in entry the keyboard cursor stay there even when i press with mouse on blue green or yellow frame

24072573
post	put
according to this post this code only works if put in the method viewwillappear

24072623
pull	push
they re more like an implicit temp table - they get materialized the planner can t push filters down into them or pull filters up out of them etc

24072629
rss	feed
on each run i would check a fixed number of sites and put their rss feed into the folder

24072634
post	get
i am struggling with some prototype test learn like android app that is supposed to get and post requests to a database via json rest and django

24072653
mouse	keyboard
however if you want to give them keyboard focus when clicked on you can do so by binding the focus_set method to a mouse click event

swift	objective-c
when not extending nsobject or using the objective-c directive swift defaults to static- and vtable-based dispatch

24072677
swift	objective-c
while swift is a compiled language the messaging style of method invocation adds the introspection and dynamism found in modern languages like ruby and python just like objective-c but without objective-c s legacy syntax

24072705

24072748
int	double
you may be fine with that especially if you sometimes want to use uniq with uniformly typed objects int double ... equatable

24072768
swift	objective-c
i was experimenting with porting an existing objective-c app to swift and after quite a few successful builds the project will no longer build and immediately gives the error unable to run command compileswift normal - this target might include its own product

24072768
swift	objective-c
if i simply replace the swift files with the old objective-c files it builds fine no errors at all

24072772
google-chrome	firefox
this is a website template i bought from the internet and i didn t have that many difficulties with it until now where i find myself completely stuck to a point where the contents of a specific webpage of the website are not displayed correctly across google-chrome firefox and internet explorer mostly the problem is with ie since the viewing issues between firefox and google-chrome are close to none

24072808
swift	objective-c
at first i m very very bad at objective-c don t like the syntax but now with swift i love iphone developing d

24072811
opera	firefox
it works properly in firefox 29 opera 12.17 chromium 34 and in ie9

24072877
prepare	execute
you should always check for false return value at least for prepare and execute

24072914
int	chars
also i need help converting the string into a chars for level and into an int for academic year any ideas

24072961
pull	push
if the activity is only meant to run from your code only i usually just use a static dictionary container and then push pull with the guid going into the string extras

24072970
submit	submission
i found some people said the submission should be cancelled so i deleted form and changed the type submit to type button for login button but it was not working

24072978
pygtk	wnck
right now i got the code which makes a screenshot of the active window using wnck and pygtk

24072985
pull	push
if user a tries to push changes when there are unmerged changes from user b a will be forced to pull user b s changes and resolve any merge conflicts before pushing out anything else

24073003
records	anti-join
i am attempting to a perform a fairly standard anti-join to find all records in source without corresponding rows in target but am finding it difficult to create a query with an acceptable execution time

24073017
primefaces	richfaces
it is important to note that this will render jsf and richfaces components there s no support for primefaces components afaik

24073042
fast-forward	merge
the normal case with merge is that they re merge cleanly as a fast-forward merge

24073078
stdout	stderr
the result is two things stdout and stderr

for instance double int etc. but not string

24073140
tablet	galaxy
i have a program which allows android tablet nexus 7 2012 and samsung galaxy 10.1 to interact with a forth system on pic

24073146
swift	objective-c
that s an objective-c method interface declaration which swift doesn t have or need

24073233
subscript	superscript
perhaps if there is a rule to know when a symbol will be a subscript or superscript or the spansize you have to use you can write a method to parse a given a formula privided as a string and automatically provide the formated html output

24073240
hide	show
as far as javascript is concerned you could check the width of the page and only show hide your toggle if it s mobile mode

24073260
multiplying	add
for each vertex v with a negative excess -c choose a path from the source s to v multiplying it by c and add it to the assignment

24073260
multiplying	add
for each vertex v with a positive excess c choose a path from v to the sink t multiplying it by c and add it to the assignment

24073262
fgets	getchar
the getchar and fgets methods are 100 cross-platform

24073262
getchar	getline	getchar	fgetc	fgets	getline	fgets	fgetc	fgets	getchar	fgetc	getline
it isn t terribly difficult to write one yourself once you have some experience managing memory and working with pointers but you d be better off using one of the first two methods since writing an implementation of getline would likely end up using fgetc or fgets anyway fgetc stdin and getchar should behave identically

24073288
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox are working just fine

24073312
google-chrome	firefox
the same behavior is observed in google-chrome and firefox

24073355
next	addclass
add remove the next class on the transform property not on the addclass function

24073390
width	height
if this were a regular uiview you d need 4 constraints x y width height but the label will automatically determine it s width and height from it s content so it s not ambiguous

24073412
disk	ram
the referenced item instruction or data may be resident in l1 or l2 or ram or finally on disk in which case it is loaded into main memory

24073413
inherited	properties
without constructors and their .prototype properties you can do pure prototypical inherited like this

24073423
comparator	comparable
however you should be aware that comparator and comparable are usually two opposing concepts

24073423
comparator	comparable
while the implementation of comparable allows instances of a class to compare themselves with other instances of that class with a comparator this comparison is encapsuled inside another class

24073423
comparator	comparable
decide on one of the two concepts comparable or comparator

24073424
folder	directory
while i want to save the output file in other directory like c users john smith but not in the data folder

24073429
int	chars
int getline chars s int lim

24073551
ssl	spdy
i don t know your specific configuration but in general spdy works by tunnelling your requests over a ssl tls connection to the spdy compression proxy or compatible website which means that your local proxy cannot intercept the connection without implementing a man-in-the-middle attack and understanding the spdy protocol itself

24073562
post	get
currently i am working on an app and i need to get facebook public post data as facebook give access to its public data through graph api

24073583
versioning	upgrade
the first thing you should do is upgrade to the latest versioning of maven 3

24073583
maven	pom.xml
if that doesn t work then the issue is typically that you modified the master pom.xml file master pom.xml or have a maven network proxy issue

24073593
folder	directory
look for a .hglf folder in the root directory of your repo

24073749
firefox	safari
if using 64bit then the safari and firefox buttons will not work correctly

24073751
swift	objective-c
unlike objective-c swift treats nil-references as crashes unless you make them conditional

24073762
rss	feed
the site i m trying to read from supposedly uses its own rss feed to generate its front page

24073879
wxpython	pyqt
it wouldn t be that difficult to use tkinter or some other gui like wxpython or pyqt to implement a listener or other interface to detect a keypress

24073904
textview	imageview
you just need to change textview with some imageview as per your requirement

24073923
chown	sudo
change ownership sudo chown root root localhost.key

24073937
folder	directory
there are no submodule files for these i ve also moved the folder from there directory and made another push yet they still apear

24074049
google-chrome	safari
wow64 applewebkit 537.36 khtml like gecko google-chrome 35.0.1916.114 safari 537.36

24074073
hide	show
i have a wrap panel which contains number of controls as below and depends on the scenario those controls might show hide except 2 controls which will always show and need to be in the fixed position in the wrappanel

24074079
uiview	subviews
since you are new to constraints let s start with a simpler case which is a uibutton which is a subviews of a uiview

24074079
width	height
a uibutton already knows what its width and height should be based on its content so you only need to specify its x and y location 2 constraints

24074079
width	height
this would position your button at 164 165 and the width and height of your button would come from the intrinsic size of the button based on it s image text

24074079
uiview	subviews
so let s say you had a uiview -- uiscrollview -- uibutton where the uiview has a child scrollview which in turn has a uibutton as a subviews

24074079
width	height
you would write 4 constraints to specify it s x y width and height

24074079
width	height
so we need 2 more constraints on our contentview to specify it s width and height

24074111
int	boolean
please note that preg_match returns int not boolean

24074121
hide	show
if you listen for body.controller.action you ll have the event that can trigger you to show or hide your menu item

24074126
put	get
to get your game to fill up 100 of that space you can put all graphics into a g element get the size of the svg element if it wasn t known using raphael or jquery or similar if raphael can t for some reason then scale translate that g element based on that height so it fills the screen

24074158
hide	show
i want to show an application bar on one of the items and hide the application bar on others

24074164
metaspace	permgen
i know they have replaced permgen with metaspace in java 8

24074224
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have the beginning of one of my uitabbarcontroller tabs set up looking like this where the first uinavigationcontroller is coming right of of my main uitabbarcontroller as the second tab index 1

24074224
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationitem	uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar	uinavigationbar	uinavigationitem
at this point i have actually successfully set up my entire navigation hierarchy without nested uinavigationcontroller s but could not navigate as it takes away my uinavigationbar s immediately upon being displayed however simply re-embeddings the views in navcontrollers re-established already existing uinavigationitem s

24074226
screens	tablet
i have app which need to have different screens design for a phone and a tablet

24074226
listview	gridview
the phone needs to have a listview and the tablet need to have a gridview of items

24074256
clang	llvm
i ve set up clang and cmake on windows and when running cmake-gui on the openscenegraph project source configure step the process fails with check for working c compiler c program files x86 llvm bin clang.exe -- broken

24074289
post	get
this seems to be a common problem but i m not sure what i need to change in my code nor what html i d even need to post here to get the problem fixed

24074378
swift	objective-c
complex macros are used in c and objective-c but have no counterpart in swift

24074378
swift	objective-c
therefore the complex macros that are in c and objective-c source files are not made available to your swift code

24074396
screens	tablet
i would recommend if both phone and tablet screens and totally different you can make two different apks and load on same id on google play

24074436
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari are rendering the css correctly but firefox 29 is not

24074479
int	double
i need to create a string with format which can convert int long double etc

24074653
inherited	properties
it does not force other elements to inherited that properties

24074653
inherited	properties
otherwise if the properties is inherited and the element is not the root of the document tree use the computed value of the parent element

24074663
gedit	textwrangler	gedit	nano
i ve used textwrangler osx gedit linux and nano both

24074689
pull	push
i m trying to use push pull pattern with jeromq 0.3.2

24074725
screens	hdpi
which screens size is 3.7 480 x 800 hdpi

24074726
portrait	landscape
here i done code for style.css for mobile device it the code works for mobile portrait size and when i rotate to landscape it call default css how to solve this issue

24074838
swift	objective-c
what i d say and i m highly pragmatic about this sort of thing is that if you have a block of code that is based on the semantics of objective-c strings it might be good to keep using them for a while get your code working and then evaluate changing to swift s string later

24074879
division	modulo
given two positive numbers a the dividend and n the divisor a modulo n abbreviated as a mod n is the remainder of the euclidean division of a by n

24074888
hide	show
i have noticed that if i show it then hide it then show it again the final show will look perfect from the moment it appears on screen

24074888
hide	show
however there is a flashing when i hide then show the stage for the first time so that won t work

24074917
httpresponse	request
you need to return a httpresponse object or a subclass like httpresponseredirect at every request

24074918
implements	modifiers
note that i removed the escape sequence from the dot and moved the hyphen as the last character or else you need to escape it and also implements the use of the i modifiers for case-insensitive matching

24074925
build.gradle	gradlew
gradlew overrides this value in manifest so pay attention what you have in your build.gradle script

24074970
many-to-many	one-to-many
i would like to retrieve some beans using one-to-many and many-to-many relations

24075100
getter	setter
to answer your question __definegetter__ and __definesetter__ are the old original way to create a getter and a setter for an object s property

24075100
getter	setter
instead you should use the modern form of getter and setter since es5

24075118
oncreate	setcontentview
with setcontentview in oncreate

24075145
width	height
switching values of width and height of rectangle is the same as rotating it by 90 degrees

24075145
width	height
so if the range of angles was 180 degrees instead of 90 than same rectangle would have 2 representations width height angle and height width angle+90

24075172
maven	pom.xml
all you need in your maven pom.xml to use guava is something along the lines of the following in your dependencies section

24075198
implements	extends
public class myclass extends activity implements adapterview.onitemclicklistener

24075235
int	chars
id int primary key itemid int title chars 3

24075237
min	max
what i need to do is write code that will compute the min max mean and std of numerical data found in a very large text file and i ve done that

24075276
int	double
one possible way would be to implement a method that takes a double as an argument and returns an int that represents the number of decimal places -

24075294
filesystems	xfs
so the problem is i ve got a block device for example dev sdd1 containing a filesystems ext3 or xfs mounted under mnt testdisk

24075315
nsstring	nsdata
i m not really trying to read the contents of information.plist i know i can do this by doing something like dictionarywithcontentsoffile etc etc - i am just curious about converting its corresponding nsdata to an nsstring

24075316
folder	directory
my project doesn t follow the directory structure said in jekyll doc with layouts folder and others

24075346
post	get
i would change this from a form post to a get

24075407
g++	gcc
it looks like it may not even be aware that it s compiling c++ considering that it s using gcc and not g++

24075469
inherited	properties
the good perk with inherited that you can access every protected+ properties method

24075498
teamcity	jenkins
release management is usually done from a build scheduler jenkins hudson teamcity ...

24075508
width	height
if i create it on android side with specified width and height this makes android allocate the second buffer and it s not good as i m going to have 24 bitmaps a second streaming video

24075508
width	height
pass buffer from native code and bitmap.createfrombuffer buffer buffer int width int height int format

24075554
isnull	nvl
isnull for mssql ifnull for mysql mysql has isnull too but that behaves differently nvl for oracle

24075649
build.gradle	gradlew
also even if i move script to main build.gradle and replace android.libraryvariants to android.applicationvariants pointcuts aren t work on attached .jar libraries and modules but work on gradlew dependencies such as compile com.googlecode.mp4parser isoparser 1.0.1 for example

24075663
width	height
when i resize the form in running mode windowsformhost control not set its height and width accordingly

24075729
getter	setter
what worries me about this is that looking at the code deeper i find that it seems to explicitly look in an on-disk file storage for public and private keys in the getter and setter for the publickey field on the x509certificate2 and x509certificate object

24075746
folder	directory
make a _plugins folder in your project s root directory looks like you already did then make an .rb file that requires the following

24075797
serializable	deserialization
have you considered creating an object structure for these files and serializing them java object serializable and deserialization is much faster than parsing an xml this is again considering that these 500 or so xml files don t get modified between reads

24075817
drools	optaplanner
take a look at optaplanner new name for drools planner s exam timetabling problem

24075817
drools	optaplanner
here s a video on exam timetabling with optaplanner and drools

24075923
width	height
all i have is a pointer to nv21 data the width and the height

24076028
onresume	onpause
it is due to that view is refreshed because when you hit the home button it will call the onpause method then if you open another app it will then grant some memory in the others app and instead of going back to the onresume it will go to oncreate due to the memory management of android

24076154
versioning	upgrade
you have to take in account the bruno lowagie comments and upgrade your versioning because itext 2.1.7 is an old versioning an doesn t complain with new pdfreference specifications

24076227
google-chrome	firefox
i can reproduce this issue in both google-chrome and firefox

24076240
width	height
instead it is resizing the width and height of image and container

24076263
google-chrome	firefox
i am trying to create a rtcdatachannel connection between google-chrome and firefox

24076263
google-chrome	firefox
the datachannel was created before the createoffer method but it isn t working in firefox but works fine in google-chrome

24076263
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome offerer datachannel establishment with firefox answerer does not work

24076263
google-chrome	firefox
firefox offerer datachannel establishment with google-chrome answerer works

24076282
put	get
i think you can do this using datagrid with two or three column which will differentiate among others and put a radio button in first column to select which row you want to select .for example you can see this railway site and search train between any two station then you may get the idea what i am talking about

24076293
ant	pom.xml
if you want to automatically bundle plugins with newer changes explains how your plugin pom.xml should look and contents of your ant target file

24076346
maven	pom.xml
i solved this by resorting to maven packaging and specifying my resources in the pom.xml

you are calling infowindow constructor with options for infobox but you have to create infobox with proper options instead

24076421
google-chrome	firefox
it gives me this error in firefox google-chrome works fine

24076452
width	height
what i have noticed is that the width and height of the loader is zero as was those of the movieclip when i tried adding the loader to that so that may have something to do with it but other than that i m totally lost

24076464
getter	setter
i do it without getter and setter to keep it short

24076464
getter	setter
you would do this with getter and setter methods

24076562
google-chrome	firefox
see this live in a jsfiddle which works for me in firefox and google-chrome

24076565
oncreate	ondestroy
i m registering receiver in oncreate and unregistering it in ondestroy so it will still work while second active activity is working

24076617
hash	salt
if you are storing password information to authenticate users etc. then you should store salt hash of passwords

24076676
put	get
my program needs to log information when things go wrong and i find i m having to put in a lot of boilerplate code in my node.js program to get what i d get for free in java

24076676
put	get
but to get this output i have to put in lots of boilerplate code throughout my program which is going to be a pain to police as my program gets larger and i have a whole development team

24076711

generally speaking a co-occurrence matrix will have specific entities in rows entity-relationship and columns ec

24076714
width	height
but i am getting width and height undefined

24076717

google-chrome	firefox
this issue happens in internet explorer firefox and google-chrome alike

24076762
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome it works fine in firefox when i hover over the first image in a grid of 3x2 images like in this test page the image and sometimes surrounding background images dissapear while it is translating

from i guessed + if you want to specify global metadata that is metadata about the jar archive itself or all entries in the archive might be a cryptic reference to meta-inf manifest.mf - and it seems to be

these showed up in the meta-inf manifest.mf of the generated jar file and this satisfied the current java 1.7.0_55 engine

every group element has 2 textview 1 imageview and 1 switch

24085853
unsigned	short
if time is unsigned short there is an important difference between

24085853
unsigned	short
in the second expression the assignment to unsigned short temp narrows the result to a short which is then right-shifted by 10

24085853
unsigned	short
so in the second expression high-order bits are removed by the cast to unsigned short while in the first expression they won t be removed if int is wider than short

24085853
unsigned	short	integer	unsigned
since the integer promotions might change an unsigned short into an int the intermediate value might be signed in which case overflow would be possible if the left shift were large enough

24085853
unsigned	short
if unsigned int and unsigned short are the same width no conversion will happen and you won t see the difference you describe

24085853
addition	multiplication
that s easy for unsigned addition and multiplication but trickier for shift

24085885
try-catch	exception-handling
using a try-catch you can catch any exception-handling and return something when an exception-handling occurs

24085944
implements	extends
now this this you can attach the collapsable directive to any element and it should allow you to comunicate the intents among all collapsables you shuld be also be able to group them in case you want to isolate behaviors notice that this directive doesn t cfreta a scope merely extends the xisting one to add a behavior which is bad if you have several of this in the same controller in that case a variant of this needs to be implements using isolated scopes but the idea remains the same

24085948

24086075
google-chrome	firefox
when a space is used to separate date and time components some browsers like google-chrome will treat it as local time but other browsers like ie and firefox will consider it an invalid date

24086075
google-chrome	firefox
replacing the space with a t will allow the date to be parsed but if that s all you do then google-chrome will treat it as utc while ie and firefox will treat it as local time

24086134
inherited	properties
i think there is another drawback of using the assignment form to the prototype properties you will likely wipe out the prototype.__proto__ properties prototype chain when you re dealing with the pseudo-classical inherited

24086138
post	get
basically the only thing a hacker can do is set the query string of the get request and anti-xsrf generally is only needed for post requests unless you re modifying data with get requests...tisk-tisk and if the hacker is targeting get requests they could simply provide crafted link directly to your site instead of going through their own

maven	pom.xml
in my particular case my pom.xml was missing the version and i was expected it to be inherited from the parent like most of the rest of maven does

24086461
inherited	properties
when you define a properties in the scope at a parent level it gets inherited through the prototype chain if you redefine that properties in a child scope you lose that reference

int	chars
when you do the int arithmetic on the data the chars are promoted to a 32-bit int

24086996
int	chars
promoting the negative chars value -25 to a signed int will of course yield -25 but its representation as an unsigned int is now 2 32 + x whereas as an unsigned chars it was 2 8 + x

24087477
do.call	lapply
i use lapply and do.call for this step

24087484
getter	setter
current best practice is that you don t declare instance variables at all but use properties unless you need to declare them if you have a custom getter for a readonly property or both custom getter and setter for a readwrite property no instance variable is generated automatically that you declare them in your .m file unless someone really needs to access them that you declare properties and methods in your .m file unless someone needs to access them and that you don t declare methods at all unless needed

24087488
nsstring	nsdata
if i understand it correctly you only want to convert nsdata to nsstring that you already knew it was in utf8 encoding

24088592
jar	war
when you include both the war as an overlay and the classes jar as a normal dependency you will be able to see in your dependency tree that maven is only pulling in transitive dependencies from the jar file dependency not the war

24088592
jar	war
in your case you need to find the classes jar file and install it along with the war file in your local maven repository

24088603

tunnel	vpn
try to use a vpn ssh -w openvpn etc or try to forward some ports 22 60001 etc so you don t need to use ssh tunnel

24088759
pop-up	dialog
you can select one of each from a pop-up search dialog and assign it to the entity

24088781
hex	binary
when a hex value should be presented you may set the visibility of the binary content control maybe a textblock to false and only present your hex values textblock and the other way around for binary values

24088781
hex	binary
another approach would be to use a ivalueconverter on your displayformat property and have the logic for checking hex or binary and returning the proper format

24088835
min	max
when we set the yaxis max and min the scale becomes fixed

24088901
versioning	upgrade
i have noticed instrumentation problems after upgrade to 5 versioning so need to reinstall all instrumentation

24088908
implements	extends
in order to use the priorityqueue you have to implements minpq extends the priorityqueue and you ll also need a comparator between nodes that returns the node with a minimum distance in the minpq

24088979
for-loop	arrays
the only ints left are just inside a standard for-loop to iterate across arrays

24089100
min	max
what you have to do is set the yaxis min and max to null

24089100
min	max
this lets highcharts determine the dynamic min max values

24089100
min	max
you would probably want it to keep track of the on-load min max so that when you re-enable all series it sets the min max to how it was on-load

24089129
hide	show
when user touches a button at the action bar the following method gets executed and was supposed to hide one fragment and show the other one but nothing happens.

24089136
post	get
so i ve decided to post the reason why it happens and also the solution so that many so users will get the benefit of the answer

24089155
min	max	range	min	range	max
take a look at the datepicker select a date range feature to see how you can set the min max selectable date

24089160
width	height
i think that is because the uilabel has no text in it right now at compile time so it thinks it s width and height needs to be 0

24089180
put	get
when i put this in i get the nothing

24089183

put	get
to get ads on top of my libgdx projects i had to use a relativelayout and specify put things together in a specific order

24089351
hide	show
i need to do it this way because somewhere i m using a javascript for show hide details for a selected contact so i need a unique id

24089375
onmouseover	onclick
encounters assignments to event based properties onclick ondblclick onmouseover etc. it creates a stack for each

24089434
hide	show
that way you can apply your css to all contacts and still show hide by id with javascript

24089472
width	height
i ve heard something about using but i don t know the restrictions like the maximum height maximum width and file type

24089473

24089541
comparator	comparable
using comparator instead of putting all the logic directly in the comparable gives you more flexibility in the order that things are compared in

24089590
pop-up	dialog
often i try to implement the data collection views as pop-up dialog rather than as whole pages - this makes the parent-child viewmodel relationship more correct - and ensures the parent viewmodel will be in memory when the child closes

24089593
range	max
that occasional max threshold is actually bigger than the range of small instance

24089602
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome will still fire the onclick event where ie8+ not in compatibility mode will not fire events

24089659

profiling	benchmarking
i realize there are a lot of good memory profiling cpu benchmarking and hpc packages and code snippets out there

24089677
int	chars
i want it to read all the numbers 1 by 1 and store it into an int array because the chars array is not doing the trick

24089697

that should return an html file with the style attributes fontfamily and font-size

24089778
bash	tcsh
we can see that i tcsh was called then tcsh called a bash instance

24089833

i m not entirely sure from your post what you are looking for but maybe you can use something like this to get the contents in between the quote tags

24089839
rss	feed
iÃ¢ m trying to change a list given by a rss feed

24089886

asumming that libpng is installed at drive path to libpng the directory where libpng is installed should have the following folder bin include and lib

24089978
getter	setter
to achieve this i believe that i would have to perform the operations under the property s setter but whenever i change the textbox s text the only area of the string property that is called is the getter

24090023
int	chars
you re reading the text file as a chars array so you re getting the ascii chars values of the numbers when you read it them as int 0 48 4 52

24090023
int	chars
you should parse each int chars from the line in the text file

24090058
sudo	passwd
i add the administrator user name and passwd in the node creditials sudo fields and press add nodes and get

24090060
width	height
i will need to find the width and height

swift	objective-c
i am attempting to implement some aes256 crypto routines in apple swift to kinda toy around with the interoperability between objective-c c and swift code and data types and have run into a bit of an issue and am hoping someone has some suggestions on something i ve overlooked

24090148
typedef	struct
most notably when creating a new cccryptor object really a struct behind the scenes it looks like typedef to cccryptorref for an opaque reference - the final argument to the call to cccryptorcreate is such a pointer and should at the conclusion of the function call contain a pointer to the cccryptorref

24090150
for-loop	loops
a for-loop that invokes a cursor automatically fetches the row once for each loops

24090167

int	chars
int or py_ssize_t see below this variant on s stores into two c variables the first one a pointer to a chars string the second

24090231
getter	setter
you can also use the jsonserialize and jsondeserialize annotations on the getter and setter to indicate the key and value types

24090235
cdr	cons
i can see how to write cons cdr car and other expressions in racket using only lambda expressions from sicp

24090242
ssl	https
i configured my couchdb with https using exactly the instruction given in the documentation only that i changed the ssl port to 6161

24090258
fast-forward	merge
if the merge is a fast-forward that is all commits can simply be applied atop of head without any need for merging then you would need to use the --no-ff option to force a merge commit

24090269
asterisk	pbx
instead of sms for short amount of data you could try to implement an asterisk pbx whith your mobile calling your server and then sending other dtmf digits as your data which would be interpreted by your asterisk pbx like an interactive phone audio menu from your cable company

24090269
asterisk	pbx
simply recording the call from the attached fax modem pci board or you could use an asterisk pbx server on a local computer to save the audio file and then process by your server software

24090286
many-to-one	one-to-many
the reason why it is usually plural is that a foreignkey defines a many-to-one relationship so the reverse will be one-to-many in the example each tweet has a fk to a user and thus easch user will be allowed to have many tweets

24090321
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
you can disable the tooltip setting a title with a space on webkit browsers like google-chrome and an empty string on firefox or ie tested on google-chrome 35 firefox 29 ie 11 safari mobile

24090322
cfstring	nsstring
how can i create a cfstring from a native swift string or nsstring in swift

24090323
fast-forward	merge
i have read git push only works if the remote can do a fast-forward merge with the stuff you are trying to push

24090336
min	max
you can do this with min max group by and date diff

24090438
accessor	properties
the best way in my opinion is to implement the mutable indexed collection accessor and always use those to modify the properties

24090438
accessor	properties
the existence of those accessor is what allows you to implement a to-many properties that is not of type nsarray

24090438
accessor	properties
personally i don t recommend this but once you have such accessor you can also mutate the properties by obtaining the nsmutablearray -like proxy for the properties using -mutablearrayvalueforkey and then sending mutation operations to it

24090446
cdr	cons
cons car and cdr are a close-knit set of functions very much isolated from the rest of the language

24090446
cdr	cons
one example implementation would involve requiring that each scheme-level value assuming here that we re implementing scheme in terms of lambdas is represented at the interpreter level as a cons whose car is a number representing its type and whose cdr is a value of some sort

24090446
cdr	cons
all of this is possible but it s a much more involved problem than reimplementing cons car and cdr

24090449
swift	objective-c
the issue seems to be caused by differing initializer behavior between swift and objective-c

24090453
children	parent
i do sometimes struggle with why parent elements don t always expand to contain the children

24090453
children	parent
it would affect many of the browser layouts such as parent position relative with children set to absolute or overflow auto hidden and probably a host of other layout algorithms

24090473
cdr	cons
cons car and cdr as defined here are not compatible with the vanilla racket language

24090477
post	get
if you convert that uid into hexadecimal digits as you indicated with the method in your post you will get

24090490
post	put
not all browsers support redirects when using the delete method or put or post

24090491
width	height
i had a similar problem with svg files generated by illustrator for use as background images and after much trial and error the fix seems to be just to edit each svg file and declare the width and height of the svg as attributes something that illustrator doesn t set but sketch does

24090491
google-chrome	firefox
this caused the svgs to behave the same in ie 10 11 as they do in google-chrome firefox

24090495
isotope	masonry
according to this issue request isotope masonry hide and reveal methods are mostly internal and aren t the easiest to use

24090497
free	malloc
use malloc to obtain storage for the arguments structure and have the new thread be responsible for calling free once it s done with the arguments

24090517
fast-forward	merge
i have read git push only works if the remote can do a fast-forward merge with the stuff you are trying to push

24090517
fast-forward	merge
it s also worth noting that fast-forward is really a property of a label move rather than the merge itself

24090517
fast-forward	merge
the git merge command chooses to do a fast-forward when possible and not told otherwise and that is indeed called a fast-forward merge in various places although the git merge man page says when the merge resolves as a fast-forward which is a subtle distinction

24090565
int	boolean	int	double
using basic types like strings int boolean and double

24090572
post	get
you can t - if you stored a user s list of friends under v1.0 or by checking the commenters or likes on a post something like that and later one of those friends authorises your app under v2.0 you ll get an app scoped id for the friend you can t correlate that to the ids you obtained elsewhere

24090619

24090715
post	get
edit just in case someone comes across this post later it turns out the issue was 1 fixing the parameter name as outlined above and 2 making sure the request was made via post not get

24090744
gson	jackson
option 2 if using jackson instead of gson is a possibility you can annotate serialize on getters instead of on fields and put your logic for returning

24090747
int	chars
around int 10h is a loop reading chars from message and the 0 at message end causes the loop to exit to another but endless hang loop

24090767

swift	objective-c
edit i see you are trying to use the swift class methods from objective-c

24091310
swift	objective-c
make sure your objective-c implementation file .m has the swift import

24091310
swift	objective-c
this file is not visible in your project but the import is required to use swift classes in objective-c see apple documentation

24091338
bash	zsh
as a bonus let s ask zsh and bash what they think the value of is when it s found twice

24091338
bash	zsh
imagine if security depended on a zsh wrapper filtering environment variables for a bash script

24091370
swift	objective-c
i thought it would be a great learning experiment to take a small objective-c library and convert it to swift

24091370
swift	objective-c
i think i ve done an okay job of converting and searching for answers as i m just starting out with objective-c and swift

24091374

it will work just as well for tiff png gif files too - as outputs or inputs

24091430
unsigned	short
you may have meant unsigned short in the definition of struct f00f but this is only one way to fix it of course

24091430
unsigned	short
you could also compare to short 0xf00f but if you meant to be compared to 0xf00f you definitely should have used unsigned short in the definition

24091471
ocaml	utop
i am trying to follow along with real world ocaml by setting up opam utop and the core modules as well

24091471
ocaml	utop

24091836
margin	text-align
better practise is to use css for that - for example text-align center for inline elements or margin auto for blocks

24091869
libxml2	libxslt
i ve installed libxml2 2.9.1 and libxslt 1.1.28 via homebrew and have tried using the command line tools from both my xcode 5 install and xcode 6 beta

24092065
gmp	bigint
however i would strongly recommend using a bigint library such as gmp

24092103

for example if my watermark is a totally transparent image with a text that i put over a car image then i get a more dark or nightly image with the watermark so the background of the watermark it is not blending properly

24092105
maven-shade-plugin	pom.xml
the pom.xml for this project does not contain the maven-shade-plugin as we re not doing the shading here

24092105
maven-shade-plugin	pom.xml
that pom.xml file lists just a single dependency projectabcd and includes the maven-shade-plugin

24092105
maven	pom.xml
when maven packages this second project it will pull down the orignal one grab all the original s dependencies and shade them all together in a single jar whose name will derived from the pom.xml s artifactid

i used xcode 5 as an ide for perl for more than a month and found it an excellent alternative to regular text editors like atom-editor and textmate

24092544
getter	setter
you can just add the field yourself along with the getter setter and doctrine configuration using the formats you see used for the other fields in that class this is probably the easier way to be honest

24092588
awt	swing
consider taking a look at painting in awt and swing for more details about how painting works in swing

awt	swing
the are also some differences in how awt components and swing components are painted

to create such a cyclic dependency requires explicitly establishing the cycle - usually where such is done it is with a custom class a control has a parent control and many children controls and not an array

24092972
16-bit	64bit
if you want your code to use your code on different platforms 16-bit 32bits 64bit follow apple recommendation

24092972

if you had chosen a bare int the sdk would have made your variable 32-bit wide on 32-bit devices 64bit wide on 64bit machines 16-bit wide on 16-bit machines etc

24092989
poltergeist	capybara-webkit
doing a bundle update of capybara to 2.3.0 and so bringing poltergeist to 1.5.1 with selenium-webdriver at 2.42.0 and capybara-webkit at 1.1.0 gets almost everything working

24093130
button	right-align
the problem for me though was that i m trying to make a scroller-type interface in svg with a left-aligned button for scrolling left and a right-align button for scrolling right and the inner viewboxed svg in kulpae s example would take the entire width of the scroller therefore obscuring the content of the scroller from receiving click events

24093144
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	division	multiplying	add	division	subtract
for example add subtract multiplying and division

24093144
multiplying	division
intel has also added new instructions for multiplying and possibly also for division in their latest chip design to come out in the near future

24093144
subtract	add	division	subtract	division	multiplication
x86 already had subtract with borrow and add with carry so now these new instructions do more or less the same for long multiplication and division and such.

24093155
google-chrome	firefox
i have never seen this occur with google-chrome or firefox

24093218
getter	setter
with this you don t need to define setter and getter just for assignment and retrieval purposes so you can remove sale_number and methods

24093218
getter	setter
with alias_attribute getter setter and query methods are already aliased

24093218
getter	setter
this is because you have defined alias_attribute name pname which provided the setter getter and query methods as alias to your existing pname attribute

24093218
getter	setter
but for sale_number you ve only defined a getter and setter but not the query methods

24093256
width	height
if you don t need a canvas and you probably don t just use stackpane s for the squares and make them fill the width and the height

in firefox you can configure an external app as a rss reader via edit preferences applications set web feed handler to the location of your feed reader application script

24093524
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
the fundamental difference between a for-loop and an enhanced-for loops is that the enhanced-for loops actually binds the values of the arrays to the variable itself

24093564
width	height
you can also change the size of the menu item in the measure item usually +4 for height and width looks nice

24093576

this is code in scheme programming language which is a dialect of lisp and i guess you can understand this code

24093988
width	height
the default value of length properties height width have default value auto we should know how these values works in block display

24093988
width	margin
auto width is set in such a way that the block s overall width including border padding margin occupies the parent block s width

24093988
margin	height
however height is always set according the calculated height of child elements including border padding margin

24093988
width	height
the elements like body and div fill up the available width while having only the height required for the available content

24094002
int	double
that s because without type startamnt will be int and you re printing it as double

getter	setter
a property consists of getter and setter methods which operate on the associated variable that is automatically created for you

24094259
getter	setter
you can override the setter or the getter of an auto-generated property to add additional functionality

24094273
switching	accessory
you can definitely switching an app to background accessory mode and back again

24094273
switching	accessory
the basic idea is to use the nsapplicationdelegate protocol to switching back and forth between accessory and regular app modes

24094273
put	get
so put it all together and you get the code below

24094273
switching	accessory
i have nothing in mainmenu.xib but the menu-- switching to accessory mode will mean the menu is not displayed

24094316
put	get
you can get all groups in one call and create final html tags programmically in one stringbuilder then put stringbuilder strings to a control like asp litral

24094339
superclass	subclassing
it seems one cannot declare a property with the let syntax and override it with var in itÃ¢ s subclassing or vice-versa which may be because the superclass implementation might not be expecting that property to change once initialized

24094339
superclass	subclassing
so in this case the property needs to be declared with Ã¢ varÃ¢ in the superclass as well to match the subclassing as shown in the snippet above

i want to get the length of that jtable number of rows and print that result in a jlabel

24096745
swift	objective-c
objective-c would implicitly cast nsuinteger to cgfloat but swift has no implicit casts so we have to add an explicit one

24096822
children	parent
the advantages here are that there is a single read operation for retrieving the related information and also a single point of write operations to both update parent and child entries though often not possible to write to many children at once without processing lists on the client or otherwise accepting multiple write operations and preferably in batch processing

24096825
getter	setter
get getter and the setter of a property can have different accessibility modifiers

24097322
swift	objective-c
actually your problem has nothing to do with swift equivalent objective-c code does the same Ã¢ you re just using nsscanner wrong

24097340
post	get
i want to post as well as get complex type to from server

24097385
hide	show
you should have additional css to hide and show based on classes that animate uses

24097491
velocity	thymeleaf	freemarker	thymeleaf	freemarker	velocity
you could easily use jsp tiles freemarker velocity or thymeleaf for creating views

24097495
altera	xilinx
both altera and xilinx shows flip-flop code using process constructions but

24097495
altera	xilinx
flip-flops in altera and xilinx since the reassign of data out with

24097516

alternatively you can use javascript to set the width and height to match the on-screen dimensions

24097526
avr	microcontroller
i use proteus for simulation and avr studio for coding in assembly for atmel microcontroller

24097551

24097583
folder	directory
upon compiling this project xcode will create a .framework folder in your build directory which contains a dynamic library which you should then be able to link against

24097583
swift	objective-c
in terms of using this shared object file on android i believe you will be out of luck as the swift language much like objective-c requires a runtime library which is simply not available on other platforms at this time

24097606
mp3	wav
i want to store a number of sound fragments as mp3 or wav files but these fragments are each highly repetitive a 10 second burst of tone for example

24097611
dictionary	map
other languages which can do this iterating over unordered enums might be the same languages where everything is under the hood actually a map or dictionary and you can iterate over the keys of a map whether there s any logical ordering or not

24097627
hash	salt
i can enter the email address and paste the hash and salt into the password field and can successfully login

24097664

24097682
tablet	galaxy	tablet	mdpi
i ve tested this on a few devices a nexus 10 tablet which gets the bigger version of the file from the xhdpi folder a generic tablet using mdpi a galaxy ace phone mdpi again and everything works ok

24097682
width	height
another thing that confuses me is that my xhdpi folder contains an atlas in which each individual background is about 1 2 the width and height of the nexus 10 s screen so this gets scaled up

24097682
screens	hdpi
however using google s scaling laws android supporting multiple screens after scaling each individual background image contained within the hdpi atlas is about the size of the screens of phone i m using so not much scaling required whereas i would again prefer to use images 1 2 the size of the screens

24097684
move	drag
as a horrible hack you can explicitly trigger a series of mouse events to simulate a mouse down drag up setting the clientx value based on whatever fraction of the container width you want to move to

24097684
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
for example in chrome we send mousedown to the left handle then mousemove ane mouseup to document where w is my container width and i want to zoom to the range t1 - t2 instead of the default t0 - t2

24097700
super	extends
as you extends arrayadapter super in constructor handle listitem size and you need pass your list to constructor method

24097721
int	double
use double for things that might not be int values

24097729
int	double
problem undefined reference to cv surf surf double int int bool

24097741
int	boolean
i stupidly thought if i took the boolean result of true cast to an int and left-shifted it i would end up with the lsb repeated at every bit obviously not

24097743
mdpi	hdpi
placing images in folders like hdpi mdpi automatically scales down the image so there is no guarantee that image are always will be power of 2

24097769
for-loop	loops
i prefer using for-loop instead of foreach loops for-loop is preferably faster than foreach loops when you do not have to do something to each element and can solve your problem by just using the index as follows

24097773
keyevent	onkeydown
you only use 2 references there but since its unlikely that you receive a null keyevent it comes from the android runtime and documentation says implicitly that you always receive a valid reference when onkeydown is called it has to be the reference to your webview

24097817
swift	objective-c
i m starting to add swift files to a very large legacy objective-c project that doesn t use arc

24097817
swift	objective-c
it seems like swift is emitting arc-based objective-c code

24098044
folder	directory
open eclipse.ini file which is located in your eclipse installation directory in the same folder with eclipse.exe

24098068
inherited	properties
while arrays inherited from objects they are designed for numerical indexed sequential data and only properties with numerical values will be included when you pass them through json.stringify

24098098
range	minimum
using pinv gives the minimum norm both of the solution vector and the residual l2 norm solution in the range of the given matrix

24098109
move	drag
assuming that you have move your text file data.txt to your xcode-project use drag n drop and check copy files if necessary you can do the following just like in objective-c

24098112
superclass	subclassing
you could subclassing the bytearrayoutputstream class and override the write byte b method to encrypt the data before it gets to the superclass write method like this

24098204
folder	directory
i am trying to create a symlink with the target a directory outside my script root and the link inside a folder in my script

24098302
udp	tcp
the obvious choice to establish a udp or tcp server in java is netty

24098302
udp	tcp
it can act as a tcp udp server and a client it has both functionalities

24098408
swift	objective-c
i m integrating swift code into a large objective-c project but i m running into problems when my swift code refers to objective-c classes

24098408
swift	objective-c
i can fix the problem in that individual source file by importing deletionworkflow.h and mytableviewcontroller.h before i import projectname-swift.h but this doesn t scale up to a large project where i want my swift and objective-c to interact often

24098410
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint

24098542
post	get
the native pagination requires the entire page to load in order to get to older post

24098553
int	chars
here sizeof int is 4 since you are compiling with gcc and -m32 and sizeof chars is 1 by definition of sizeof

24098560
swift	objective-c
in any case uialertview is deprecated under ios 8 and this might explain the issue when using swift although using deprecated methods or classes does not usually causes a crash in objective-c

24098577
width	height
to display images with different height and width you should align them to the same width

24098584
int	chars
incrementing a pointer to int will move it sizeof int bytes forward while incrementing a pointer to chars will move it sizeof chars byte forward

24098590
margin	height
but there is another problem too you can t set the height of an element to 100 and also add some padding margin or border

24098631
inherited	properties
also consider using o.hasownproperty prop if you want to avoid checking properties inherited from prototype

24098662
rpm	yum
diffrence is where i install the elasticsearch from rpm repository via yum install elasticsearch somehow it installed my elasticsearch in usr share elasticsearch but the config are in etc elasticsearch

24098712

24098952
portrait	landscape
this part of the code is used to avoid an exception when changing the detailsfragment from one framelayout container portrait xml to another landscape xml

24098973
mdpi	hdpi
for every app i m developing i provide mdpi hdpi xhdpi xxhpi resources also launcher icon for xxxhdpi

24098973
mdpi	hdpi
both xhdpi and xxhdpi resources can be easily scaled down to mdpi and hdpi accordingly ratio 0.5

24099003
postgresql	mysql
it support mysql and postgresql and extendable to other connectors

24099025
versioning	upgrade
in specs which appear in multiple versioning another reason sometimes arises a non-terminal ceases to be used in the main grammar but an appropriate definition for it is given to avoid breaking any other specs which refer to that non-terminal and to allow those other specs to upgrade gracefully to the new versioning of the spec containing the grammar

24099057
google-chrome	firefox
when i run this script in google-chrome or firefox i get results like

24099057
google-chrome	firefox
however- the script always renders within a second in google-chrome but takes up to 4 seconds in firefox

24099087
sudo	passwd
which means that sudo would require a passwd capistrano just doesnÃ¢ t work that wayÃ¢ unless you have setup passwordless sudo on the server

24099087
centos	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux	debian	linux	debian	centos

24099088
dictionary	map
you can also add your own map method to dictionary

24099088
dictionary	map
note my implementation of map on dictionary returns a copy of the dictionary to be more like the map method of array

24099094
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval and settimeout

24099094
setinterval	settimeout
let s look at when to use setinterval and settimeout since settimeout is probably what was intended with the code in the question and setinterval was used in error

24099094
setinterval	settimeout
there s one scenario which fits inbetween the two methods settimeout and setinterval

24099113
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari

24099171
stdout	stderr
before the while loop which does the same as -cs on the command line to set the stdin stdout and stderr handles to utf-8 encoding

24099189
readonly	temporary
in swift methods on aggregates can expressly indicate whether they will modify the variable upon which they are invoked and the compiler will forbid the use of mutating methods upon readonly variables rather than having them mutate temporary copies of the variable which will then get discarded

additionally if a rtcp packet is received with a new ssrc the rtp packets ssrc should probably change as well and thus would be handled when verifying the sequence number if the ssrc is changed but the sequence number is still valid then the new ssrc will be used

24101541
ng-view	ng-include
ng-include is just fine to load partial views for your application i assume that your index.html is kind of a master page with one ng-view section

24101541
ng-include	ng-controller
each section that is loaded can have it s own controller if you have a div with hot news that fetches stuff from the db you can just include the partial view using ng-include and let the new view have a ng-controller directive that will perform a ajax call to fetch stuff from the db

24102478
for-loop	arrays
you might benefit from using an arrays of tuples here especially if you know beforehand that the associated integers will be added to your collection in increasing order - or even if you don t then you could at least sort the arrays by the first value in each tuple and thereby break out of the for-loop when appropriate

unfortunately if all you have is a reference to a methodbase instance which i believe is the case with intercepting behaviors in the unity framework there is not real clean way to determine if its a property setter or getter

24102619
int	chars
i have taken information from similar questions to arrive at this code and from all discussions a conversion from chars to int is straightforward

24102629
put	get
i recommend that you get in the habit right now of using ansi-style joins meaning you should use the inner join left outer join right outer join full outer join and cross join elements in your sql statements rather than using the old-style joins where all the tables are named together in the from clause and all the join conditions are put in the the where clause

24102647
rspec	minitest
the documentation is pretty good and includes examples of using it with minitest rspec and cucumber

what you need to do therefore is add a line declaring that property to your class definition such as it doesn t matter if it s public protected or private but the general rule is to restrict things first and relax the restrictions only when needed

24107989
public	protected
as a bonus a private or protected variable will be considered to not exist when called from a public context so it should even be possible to set _session testing session_namespace if you for some reason wanted to

etc to either 226th or 250th items depending on whether you also want the min and max vs

they suggest sudo su - should work but it has been asking passwd some of the links i found through google is making me anxious that i can t get root access

24111506
portrait	landscape
i want the images to be scaled so that the entire image is displayed in each gridview cell even if that means leaving blank space at the top bottom landscape or sides portrait

24111511
put	get
or to put it another way the operating system has no guidance on who should get the data that the port receives

24111527
for-loop	arrays
i m then looping through the arrays and attempting to parse the data and this is where i m experiencing problems the for-loop defaults details to anyobject

24111595
width	height
check your imageview width height values and if those seem correct you probably want match_parent then check your gridview column widths

24111611
actualheight	actualwidth
you should use the actualwidth and actualheight properties of the image control

24111611
width	height
the width and height are the dimensions you want the control to have

24111611
width	height
at this point the image has not finished loading so its width and height are not accessible yet

24111611
actualheight	actualwidth
so actualwidth and actualheight will still not give your the correct values.

24111611
width	height
a better way would be to set the canvas size according to the width and height of the bitmapimage

24111616
for-loop	arrays
i have an arrays of urls that i m using a for-loop to call http.get requests

24111629
dbcontext	objectcontext
edit okay the above will not work since .savechanges false is an objectcontext method also deprecated for .savechanges saveoptions and we have a dbcontext

24111629
dbcontext	objectcontext
we know dbcontext is a wrapper around objectcontext so we can use an iobjectcontextadapter to get access to the .savechanges saveoptions method

24111681
post	get
i tried requests robobrowser -- can t seem to get the post to work but failed there as well

24111682

i know you can have an element s children divide the parent s width equally so that each element has the same width and fills the parent s width entire with the following

24111701
post	get
i m able to get data from my form and store it in my postgres database but i want to post an error for the user if the submitted form is incomplete

24111739
getter	setter
overall i would prefer the getter and setter pattern as it is simpler to code no need for a proxy class for every field simpler to understand by another person looking at your code and more explicit in certain circumstances

24111739
getter	setter
by creating getter setter methods with appropriate names it can be made more apparent that they take significant computational effort

24111739
getter	setter
getter and setter also seem more extensible

24111739
getter	setter
making a getter and setter for a new field is easy while making a proxy which forwards the operations for every property would be an error-prone annoyance

24111739
getter	setter
with getter and setter just make them virtual and override them in the subclass

24111739
getter	setter
with getter setter just call the super getter setter

24111739
getter	setter
overall getter and setter are easier to program understand and change and they can make visible the costs associated with an operation

24111885
jtextfield	jlabel
what you did is that you are trying to instantiate jlabel with jtextfield

24111885
jtextfield	jlabel
it will of course catch an exception and close the application because jtextfield does not inherit from jlabel

24111890
put	get
however as soon as i put back my old org-related scripts and reload emacs i d get 7.9.3f when i run org-version

24111893
min	max
one way to simplify things a bit is to remove the min-width portions of the queries that have both a min and a max

24111955
post	get
as a part of a scraper i need to encode kanji to urls but i just can t seem to even get the correct output from a simple sign and i m currently blinded by everything i ve tried thus far from various stack overflow post

24111971

i am positive that my c++ code is being compiled correctly with g++ as a dylib because i have tested the wrapper with other functions that return simple things like chars s and int and they work correctly

24111985
google-chrome	firefox
font weights higher than the default weight will render as expected in google-chrome and all font weights render properly in firefox

google-chrome	firefox
jsfiddle compare view in firefox and google-chrome

24111985
google-chrome	firefox
edit screenshots of the text in both google-chrome and firefox running in fedora 20

24112000
client-side	server-side
this may be ok for a client-side ui app where you might not care about threadpool starvation but this is certainly not a good idea for a server-side app where the blocked thread could otherwise be serving other incoming client requests

24112063
put	get
once you manage to get the skeleton data just find where the hand is at that time put a threshold to its position and start tracking for a certain amount time and see if its movement path fits your pattern for a particular gesture such as translation in y direction for x amount of seconds

24112065
width	height
in this example the class .content will have always a height of 50 and a width of 90 - it will change its pixel-size whenever the user changes the screensize

24112094
hide	show
i m trying to show hide fields depending on one parameter

24112098
swift	objective-c
as a workaround i will probably make the domain model + a wrapper in objective-c but would be good to know if there s a way to do it in pure swift

24112148
google-chrome	firefox
this could be taking a link from a firefox tab and opening it in google-chrome or taking a link in a google-chrome incognito window and opening it in a non-incognito google-chrome window

24112158
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox

pyenv	virtualenv
here is the cleanest way using pyenv and the virtualenv plug-in

24112202
viewdidload	viewdidappear
what you really should be doing is continuing to set the alpha of the view in viewdidload or where you create your views and then waiting for the viewdidappear method to be called

24112226
richtextbox	textblock
instead of using textblock use a richtextbox in data template

24112272
swift	objective-c
i know that in objective-c you would use but that does not work the same way in swift

24112278
google-chrome	safari
some browsers like google-chrome will accommodate these mistakes but safari is a bit more strict so the that s inside that media query is taking effect in all versions of safari instead of only on small screens

24112280
width	height
entity class just holds the x and the y coordinate width and height of an entity

24112280
width	height
image.getwidth and image.getheight are the tile-level width height

24112298
cpu	processors
some cpu s even have a montgomery multiplier the sun niagara based processors to speed up rsa operations

24112347
swift	objective-c
moreover it s not clear if this is the official swift way of implementing bit fields or if this is only how the objective-c bridge represents them

24112424

24112641
scons	toolchain
i couldn t find a way to tell scons to use the cross toolchain from the above location instead of the native tool in the usual place usr bin

24112641

inherited	subclassing	metaclass	subclassing
subclassing inherited its metaclass from parent and thus that code gets run when it is defined

24112951
metaclass	subclassing
edit as for your use case with an abstract base class off the top of my head i think you d just need to define your metaclass as a subclassing of abcmeta but i didn t test that

implements	extends
on the gmapfragment i create a gpstrack object from my gpstrack class which extends service and implements locationlistener

24113187
width	margin
that being said the reason this statement applies is because since the margin of the inline element falls within the content bounds of the float it can be said that the width of the float the containing block of the inline elements depends on the this element the element having the margin

24113187
width	margin
when the margin is specified as a percentage the width of the float is calculated without taking the margin into account because it s not possible to calculate the margin until the width of the float has been determined

24113187
width	margin
the margin is then calculated based on the used width of the float and the letter c wraps to a new line as a result of being pushed forward by the margin on a

24113187
width	margin
the width of the float is then calculated taking this margin into account remember that horizontal margins do apply to inline elements as normal

i d suggest reorganizing your code in such a way that you create the image view instance in viewdidload but then wait until viewdidappear is called to actually start the animation

24113663
getter	setter
what you need is to create a getter and setter method in your estudiantes class so you can set the values of that class fields when you instantiate it inside jbutton3actionperformed

24113663
getter	setter
create a getter and setter

24113710
getter	setter
in the action listener for your jbutton simply use the getter and setter to retrieve and store information in the swing components as necessary

24113710
getter	setter
to finally save the information back to your model class estudiantes you should use getter and setter similarly

24113710
getter	setter
with the getter and setter you can easily set and retrieve the strings to the values stored in your swing components

24113723
viewdidload	viewdidappear
i would place the gesturerecognizer code in viewdidappear instead of viewdidload just to be safe

24115061
for-loop	loops
you could also decline to use the with syntax at all opening and closing the file manually or you could move the second with to encompass your for-loop instead of having it inside and then use seek to return to the beginning inside loops

24115313
subtraction	modulo
that is essentially the one case in which repeated subtraction 0 or 1 times a special case of repeated subtraction can be and commonly is but not necessarily faster than division-based modulo

24115313
division	subtraction
a compiler is unlikely to make that optimization but it s not impossible because it only makes sense if it is known that the subtraction will only happen at most once or perhaps more than one if division is especially slow on the target but some lowish bound is still needed which is in general a hard thing to find out for a compiler

24115313
division	modulo
to give some real life numbers on a haswell 32bit signed division and therefore also modulo would take 22 to 29 cycles and a branch misprediction might take up to 20 cycles but that s a worst case and the branch should not be mispredicted all the time

24115320
for-loop	loops
however don t use a while loops when you could use a for-loop

pull	push
it doesn t have a checked out tree so it just does what the server notionally does in a centralised vcs -- records commits branches etc when you push to it and gives you the latest versions when you clone or pull from it

24115571
nsurlconnection	nsurlsession
so at this point nsurlsession should be used in lieu of nsurlconnection

24115571
nsurlconnection	nsurlsession
nsurlsession is the replacement for nsurlconnection

24115571
nsurlconnection	nsurlsession
if you re ok using the completion block renditions no progress callbacks no streaming etc. the conversion from nsurlconnection to nsurlsession is pretty trivial

24115571
nsoperation	nsurlsession
just put your nsurlsession instance in your networkmanager class and then wrap the delegate based nsurlsessiontask instances in a concurrent nsoperation subclass and you re done

24115571
nsoperation	nsurlsession
the nsurlsession network manager class can then when it receives a nsurlsessiontask delegate call use the task identifier to identify the appropriate nsoperation instance and then call the appropriate delegate method there

24115632
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
i was informed that uinavigationcontroller s are not meant to be nested like this and that only one uinavigationcontroller should be necessary but when i successfully remove which i have done at least 5 times the other three uinavigationcontroller s from the rest of the stack i completely lose my uinavigationbar s from the regular viewcontrollers

there are a few options for fixing this but generally speaking you could change the image view so it does the calculation that happens in setbitmap either the first time onsizechanged is called with a width and height greater than zero or the first time ondraw is called and both getwidth and getheight return greater than zero

24120378

when setbitmap is called and the view already has a width and a height do the calculation immediately

what i need to do is this it doesn t matter if it is with netbeans midp components lwuit or plain lcdui

24121035
min	max
you tried to change min but i suspect that you don t understand what min and max do

24121035
min	max
so when position is equal to min then the progress bar is empty when position is equal to max then the progress bar is full

24121035
min	max
and values of position in between min and max specify partially complete progress

24121035
min	max
so min and max just allow you to define a convenient scale for which to specify the proportion complete

24121035
min	max
for instance if your progress is naturally expressed as a percentage you might set min to 0 and max to 100

24121035
min	max
alternatively if you are measuring the progress of a file transfer you might set min to 0 and max to be the total number of bytes to be transferred

24121036

24121078
put	get
if it s the upper one meaning we have to take a bottom route to get from him we check if it took k bottom moves to get to him if not then then we assign the cost of getting to analyzed field as the sum of getting to field at the top+cost of the field and in the auxilary array for the record corresponding to the field the put the number of bottom moves as x+1 where x is how many bottom moves we took to get to his upper neightbour

24121208
post	put
if the same annotation is then placed on a controller method that is a post or a put the http response is 405 method not allowed note that when properly authorized the post put method returns 200 as expected

24121208
post	put
when stepping through the code you can see that the underlying security filter returns a 403 but in the post put scenario the status code is dropped ignored and replaced with a 405 much like it does when a nullpointerexcpetion occurs in your controller code

24126809
hash	md5
you could save the to a io.bytesio and take the md5 hash of its value

hash	md5
this will compute the same md5 hash as if you saved the image to a file then read the file into a string and took the md5 hash of the string

24126809
hash	md5
note that if the image was loaded from a lossy format such as jpeg then the md5 hash you obtain might not be the same as the one you would obtain from the original file itself not only because the above code saves the image in png format but because even if it were to re-save it as a jpeg saving to a lossy format will produce different data

24127708
hide	show
i would like to show hide elements inside a div block

24128128
sorting	grouping
both have the effect of the order by not being executed at all -- and so not executed after the grouping by in the first case the effect is to remove sorting from the grouping by and in the second the effect is to do nothing more than the grouping by already does

24130973
int	double
if so is an explicit conversion of the int zeroes to double zeroes necessary or is it done implicitly if myarray is declared as an array of double s

24130988
mouse	trackpad
i was able to distinguish between a scroll wheel on a mouse not a magic mouse but i suspect it will still work and a trackpad using nsevent s subtype

24131393
google-chrome	firefox
this solution will work in ie9+ google-chrome and firefox

24131393
google-chrome	firefox
you will not need to know the width of the spans but this solution will only be compatible in ie10+ google-chrome and firefox

24131467
hide	show
what you are trying to do is called responsive design the easiest way would be learn a little about bootstrap bootstrap is framework for design there is a gem for rails called bootstrap-sass for easy integration with this you can set different behaviours for different devices this is one of the functionalities of bootstrap you can hide for example your navbar in mobile devices and show another smaller in mobile

24131876
versioning	upgrade
unfortunately i can t find any way to upgrade the versioning used

24131980
imperative	declarative
the second way is switching from the imperative callback interface to the declarative frp interface provided by reactive.threepenny

24132002
min	max
as far as i see based on my research i should use min or max as an alternative to first such as

24132002
min	max
however since there can be sometimes over 100k records with the same batch_id using min or max is not as efficient as just returning the first record without any comparison

24132104
hide	show
the output of the code is a messagebox that apparently temporarily hide the page in order to show the message

24132147
inherited	properties
if the first row is set true excel inherited that properties for whole sheet unless you specifically turned it off using another code

24132195
put	get
it was fairly easy to develop my own queuing service with a rest endpoint and put get delete functionality but now that i ve crafted the code i m starting to balk a bit

24132239
robocopy	xcopy
the most important difference is that robocopy will usually retry when an error occurs while xcopy will not

24132305
serializable	deserialization
you are using ascii encoding for the serializable but utf-8 encoding for the deserialization that looks asymmetrical

24132305

24132470
portrait	landscape
i have two layouts for my portrait and landscape modes

24132470
portrait	landscape	listview	gridview
in portrait i have a listview and in landscape i have a gridview

24132486
stdout	stderr
os.system is fine for executing something you don t need to interact with but often times you need or want to be able to read stdout stderr and run the subprocess in parallel with the main one

24132488
portrait	landscape
another way to find if you are landscape or portrait mode is to instantiate staggeredgridview and listview and check if one of them is null

24132488
portrait	landscape
what the above code is doing is that it checks if mgridview is null if it is then you are currently portrait mode else you are in landscape mode

24132502
client-side	server-side
you have to include a server-side validation and a client-side validation

24132547
queue	fifo
as the name implies nsoperationqueue is a queue a fifo fifo data structure that contains operations

24132547
put	get
you wouldn t want to put a synchronous network request on the main thread which is what you get with +mainqueue because it would block the user interface but it s not necessarily a bad choice here because the request is asynchronous and the operation queue being passed in is used only to run the completion handler

24132547
nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue
for example nsurlconnection takes an nsoperationqueue and a block as parameters because it needs to wait until the connection is done before it schedules an operation created from the completion block

24132572
swift	objective-c
if you use your own objective-c types in your swift code make sure to import the objective-c headers for those types prior to importing the swift generated header into the objective-c .m file you want to access the swift code from

i have created a hadoop cluster using 3 slaves and 1 master using ambari server hortonworks

24132756
ready	each
the code would benefit from error reporting functions so that the error reporting blocks take up just one line each instead of four but writing a function to do that job is just a little more complex than you re ready to deal with

24132777
int	double
such as int and double inherit from a single root object type

also i read that in older version of asp.net mvc at least i haven t seen it in reference to more recent versions of asp.net mvc that you have to use a for-loop instead of a foreach loops

24133273
cos	sin
for other values work out how to use sin and cos to directly rotate the texture coords

24133295
min	max
so the actual safe bounds are max math.pow 2 53 -1 and min - math.pow 2 53 -1

24133296
swift	objective-c
i am converting my objective-c code to swift and was wondering what is the swift equivalent to this code

24133340
portrait	landscape
depending on the image orientation portrait or landscape it grows the longest edge first then shrinks the shortest edge where necessary while still preserving the aspect ratio

24133348
flatmap	fold
notice that fold differs from map and flatmap in that the latter two preserve the original type but change its contents

24133377
post	get
when i add new record or save changes two request are sent to the server get and then post

24133391

after many r d i found that webrtc seems to work only in google-chrome and firefox and may be in opera higher versions

24133439
post	get
so now for any given user you can do to get an array of post that user has favorited

24133439
post	get
and from a post object you can do to get an array of users that have favorited that post

24133449
put	get
the reasoning here is that you get all the selected items and put them into another list first

24133499
mouse	keyboard
i want to disable mouse keyboard events during data entry

24133512
hide	show
remember the constraint for show hide a view in to variable and remove it constrains

24133512
width	height
view has width and height for show

24133512
width	height
and replace constraint where width and height will be zero for hide view

24133518
autocomplete	multi-select
does any of the js frameworks supports this feature to do multi-select with autocomplete

blogspot	blogger
if your blog is hosted in google blogspot blogger then you don t have to worry about gzip compression of your blog because google does it by default to all the blogs

24133675
clang	llvm
you won t see this in a current clang since the intrinsics disappear when you get to ir an intermediate representation of your code that llvm uses and the ir eventually gets transformed to the instructions but the ir for both cases is the same

24133675
clang	llvm
clang only changes the ordering of the movd instruction and it always emits both functions with the same instructions since the llvm backend gets the same ir for both cases

24133695
swift	objective-c
i m trying to use a third-party objective-c library in a swift project of mine

24133695
swift	objective-c

24133969
min	max
the program must also calculate the average value max average value and min average value and then shows it all on each label

24133977
int	chars
here x is of type int but it is being accessed as chars

24133977
int	chars
in the above case you can store 4 chars assuming int has size 4 byte in a single int and then access them individually

24133985
uiview	subviews
ios controlling uiview alpha behaviour for subviews

24134005
min	max
it seems that the uiwebview s max min zoom levels are set from the web page and hence the settings you provide to webview.scrollview.minimumzoomscale are ignored

24134107
width	height
although it appears that the width and height are not changed through css as the documents suggest

24134107
width	height
the 4px width probably comes from some items 1px border. the packery docs say that horizontal layout requires setting height

24134107
width	height

some graph databases like titan and orientdb to some degree are capable of optimizing the traversals based on their implementation

24140696
swift	objective-c
swift enums are very different from objective-c or c enums and they can t be passed directly to objective-c

24140696
swift	objective-c
a better solution might be to implement the enum in objective-c for example in your briding header because then it will be automatically accessible in swift and it will be possible to pass it as a parameter

24140722

24141060
exif	xmp
xmp does indeed map values to exif tags

24141060
exif	xmp
both exif and xmp are rich sources of image metadata

24141060
exif	xmp
xmp derives the values from the native values in the image so basically xmp provides a mapping between properties in the exif block in images and reconciles these values in the xmp namespaces as defined in the adobe xmp sdk documentation

24141060
exif	xmp
the benefit of using the xmp sdk to manipulate metadata is that then the responsibility of reconciling between different image metadata formats like exif iptc or xmp while reading or writing is transferred to the xmp sdk

24141060
exif	xmp
if any change is made to the xmp property it is reflected back to the exif block in image

24141060
exif	xmp
similarly if any non-xmp aware application has modified the exif metadata without modifying the corresponding xmp value at the time of read operation the xmp sdk will reconcile this change into the xmp value and while writing this change will be saved back

24141119
width	height
cover - scales the image proportionally so that its width or height equal to the width or height of the block

24141158

about your concern related to acessing properties the idea is that a properties accessor could be overridden in a derived class and thus access portions of the object not already properly initialised

24150774
stateless	stateful
the soap protocol doesn t provide a way that allow to store in a web service client this identity therefore if the client doesn t know which stateful instance has the conversational state every request will be processed by different ejb such as the case of stateless

i have a large for-loop somewhere around 1000 iterations in which an image url from an object is loaded and if it loads correctly the object added to an arrays

24151311

my question is because of the asynchronous nature of javascript if the image loading takes a long time will the for-loop continue iterating and thus change the index value and thus load the wrong item into the arrays

24151344
post	get
don t use post but get

int	double
as soon as the classes got auto-generated by the website i mentioned i noticed it wasn t safe to have certain fields typed as int and others as double specially regarding the stats class because what is int now may not be int in some other case

24151725
int	double
in short the deserializer never casts a double into an int but the auto generator sees a number with a zero as it s decimal digit and it creates an int field for it thus making the auto generator and the deserializer incompatible

24151756
width	margin
percentages on all padding margin properties refer to the parent s width

so i had to bind redraw on window resize event of course to prevent huge performance hit checks are used to only redraw page when size changed from mobile portrait width to tablet landscape width

int	chars
casting the value of b 244 to a signed chars leads to an int overflow resulting in the value of -12 that you see

free	malloc
in c++ we also can t convert a the return value from malloc to so you would need but free data should still work

maven	pom.xml
i kindof solved this by making maven unpack the source file baseentity.java into an additional source folder of the dependent project but this is kind of ugly as i have to always remember to change the version number in case of releases and also have the source dependency in my pom.xml and it s also not very intuitive

24158187
post	get
using an inner join you are only going to get rows returned to you with your query using an inner join if you have a comment for all of the post that you want data from

24158187
post	get
additionally with your inner join if there is no comment on your post you will not get any post returned to you

in swift the braces aren t optional like they were in objective-c c

24158847

if you use gcc compile with g++ -wall -wextra -g

24160286

in practice good optimizing compilers when compiling with g++ -o2 using a recent gcc are able to notice that both forms have the same behavior and the compiler will often but not always optimize both perhaps even to by constant-folding and partially evaluating the string size at compile time

clang	llvm
however there are still a couple of options if you really need c code output for some reason the comeau c++ compiler emits c code with the aim of porting your c++ to platforms where a c++ compiler may not exist which these days is very few and clang uses llvm as a backend code generator which has c as one of its many target instruction languages

24163946
int	chars
you can initialize 2 int arrays of size 27 each say list1 27 and list2 27 initialized as 0 read both the strings chars by chars say if you read c from string 1 increment the 3rd element of the list1 because c is the third chars and so on and when you are done reading both the string scan both the arrays for mismatch if there is any mismatch they are not permutations of each other

24163946
addition	multiplication	multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	addition
this method is similar to what you have done but instead of using ascii values it uses prime numbers and instead of addition it uses multiplication .problem with your method was lot s of possible collisions as dystroy pointed out if you chose to multiplying instead you will again face the same problem but what if instead of multiplying ascii values we multiplying prime numbers assigned to a particular character

24163946
int	chars
here we first allocate an array which stores first 26 prime numbers starting from 2 and read strings chars by chars and multiply all the respective prime numbers assigned to each chars of the string we finally compare the two large int numbers and if those are equal then the strings are permutations of each other

24163959

width	height
i dont mind where i am able to read the width and height of the image being imported as i will just set it to a global variable but any help is appreciated

24164641
post	get
another option much better imho is to post the form with ajax and this way you will not get a page refreshed at all - but this will mean you have to update whatever page changes which may be lots of work if you have lots of server side rendering code

24164697
folder	directory
the goal is to achieve something similar to assets currently contained in the app assets folder take a file from somewhere transfom it somehow usually compiling it and make it available as an asset under the public directory

24164798
put	get
changing the query to just put in x and y i get what i want

24164819
onclick	onsubmit
in your submit button html you should move your code for onclick to onsubmit

24164935
maven-antrun-plugin	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml
the best solution is to always define your property in your pom.xml so that the maven-antrun-plugin always recognizes it even if you run the maven build from command line

24164991
hide	show
or you could just have a hidden div to be the spacer and just use a class to show hide it then do something like

24164997
ionic	angular
we don t use the angular directives of ionic because steroids has methods to use native tabs and drawer elements thus making the solution ionic made unnecessary

i think the only way you can determine the image s width and height is to actually create an image element and then get the dimensions from that

24166003
put	get
however if i put this code into a function that fires off with a cron i get the right number of events in the list but they all have the information from the last event

24166409
hide	show
if you need use for example display inline-block - you should use your classes if not - you can use show and hide

24166409
hide	show
also instead of combination show and hide you can use method toggle

24166471

it s such a shame doesn t expose min and max members especially considering internally it is backed by a which has min and max properties

24167744
min	max
you can use indexers to get max or min value in o 1 time

24167744
min	max
use fiddly reflection to access the backing set which is private member of class and invoke min and max properties

24167758

after some testing this limit appears to be around the 2kb range a uri with 2065 characters works fine while one with 2105 fails using google-chrome ie or firefox

24168213
post	get
the simple solution to this seems to be changing the request type from a get to a post request sending the search query across in the body as opposed to the uri

24168213

for example let s say i am displaying something on the map and want to hide show it when the user moves between fullscreen and normal mode

24168554
hide	show
the corollary to hide you re looking for is show

swift	objective-c
swift blocks are interchangeable with objective-c blocks so it ought to be something like

24168825
swift	objective-c
if you are calling respondstoselector on an objective-c type in swift then it works the same as you would expect

24168852
opengl-es	glkview
you may implement opengl-es yourself with glkview or use an existing solution such as cocos2d-iphone

24168856
for-loop	arrays
what i ve tried was to run through the arrays with a for-loop then whenever there is a 1 searched the length and height and determined if existed on the other side the same length at position n away

24168874
min	max
ordinal scales need to have their domain set explicitly that is there s no notion of min or max for an ordinal domain

24168876
jobs	cron
cron doesn t kill jobs it only creates them

24168881
put	get
repository can abstract things like nsfetchrequest nsentitydescription nspredicate and so on to plain methods like get or put

24168881
put	get	post	get	post	put
i inject with the dependency injection in all these service classes my apiclient which will translate a particular service call into corresponding get post put delete etc

24168881
swift	objective-c
i describe you an old objective-c example but this approach can be very easy adapted for swift language with a lot more improvements because it has more useful features and functional sugar

24168891
put	get
in other words what get put into the map foo is not a reference to the var bar it s the value of bar

24168913
treeview	expander
set up a custom style for your items in your stylebook or use treeviewitemstyle if you want this to apply to all treeview add a tlayout or any control as a child of the style give it a stylename of expander set the visible property to false and make the width of 0

24169006
put	get
best practice to use type attribute in your class is to create one get method and one put method for that

24169011
gwt	cssresource
gwt also sometimes references classes by name in non-java files eval in the of a cssresource or in files non-java portions of classes jsni or string literals in proxyforname and servicename

i ve developed a fairly simple web service using flask python 2.7 current flask and dependencies where clients post a hunk of json to the server and get a response

24169072
super	extends
if everything extends a common super class abstractspcomparison then you could leverage the xmlelementref annotation

24169072
super	extends
if everything doesn t extends a common super class then you can leverage the xmlelements annotation where you explicitly annotate which elements could appear and what class they correspond to

24169077
width	height
unfortunately you cannot modify cursor properties like width height or position .

24169099
clang	icc
this will make it so that your argument gets passed in memory which is what we see in clang gcc and icc test program on godbolt

24169106
for-loop	arrays
i have a for-loop that cycles through the elements of an arrays constructs a jquery target applies a class to it and then removes it

24169132
int	boolean
i think that compiler is complaining because multiplying two boolean requires to convert the result from int to bool and is more costly then to just multiply two int

just create the folder images in vendor assets directory

24169370
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it works like a charm in google-chrome firefox and opera

24169380
width	height
i think you might need to give it a height since you only have width the browser only checks the x axis

24169403
for-loop	arrays
add an extra for-loop inside to compare every value in the range to the arrays values

24169412
uitabbaritem	uitabbarcontroller
i have a storyboard with a uitabbarcontroller with 5 uitabbaritem and 5 viewcontrollers associated

24169437

24169437
post	get
if hotreat302like303 is enabled tidhttp will clear its request.source property thus ignoring any previous post params and send a get request ignoring the method returned by the onredirect event handler if assigned

messaging over tcp or udp sockets - cold work but in practice this is technically non-trivial as it has many cornercases you have to resolve what to do when one side gets down reconnects...

24169694
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
even if you still want a uitabbarcontroller embed every child view inside of a uinavigationcontroller and then you can control the look of your header

i got no problem getting the values of volume avg max min stddec median percentile but i need the id also

24169751
inherited	properties
hence the would effectively inherited the properties of

24169762
rtp	rtsp
it specifically gets ugly because rtsp interleaved rtp avp tcp requires a unfixed content length which is not good for the tunneling method proposed by apple

24169803
for-loop	loops
but translating that to python is hard because of the next i statement in the inner for-loop which must break two loops

24169831
min	max
the max and min height ensure that it will never occupy more or less than the height of the window this includes if they shrink the browser to smaller than screen-height

24169835
portrait	landscape
the idea is that when the orientation changes i d be able to change the orientation property of the virtualizingstackpanel to scroll vertically in portrait and horizontally in landscape

24169835
hide	show	listview	gridview
i could just make a duplicate of the gridview or use a listview and visual states to show hide them appropriately but i d prefer not to duplicate so much code

24169874
versioning	upgrade
i just upgrade to freetype 2.5.3 but had this same problem with my previous versioning 2.4.12

24169988

24169997
queue	fifo
these queue are obviously fifo and so by default the thread pool will execute as soon as possible for each request

24170048
facter	hiera
i installed latest versions of puppet hiera and facter

24170111

hide	show
edit the #commentstoggle should be able to toggle hide the comments if open the .comment-add a should only show not hide as it opens an ajax comment form

24170342
swift	objective-c
edit the relevant performselector is also notably missing from the swift version of the nsrunloop documentation 1 objective-c symbol hidden so you can t jump straight in with that

24170372
stdout	stderr
you are printing to stderr instead of stdout and because stderr is not piped you ll actually get the messages printed to the console when you run your python script

24170383
width	height
i tried width 100 and height auto and it still doesn t work

24170385
adview	adbannerview
first initialize a adbannerview adview variable in your viewcontroller s interface file then you can use the above code in your viewdidload method

24170478
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
if changing max_execute_time or replacing innodb didn t work for you try to install it in different browser like ie or opera if you ve run it in google-chrome firefox already

24170503
hide	show	button	checkbox
hereÃ¢ s the thing- the form has a ton of elements titles text boxes button checkbox and pretty much everything and the elements show up and hide dynamically depending on the choices the user makes as they progress down the form

24170513
width	height
don t try to set both the width height of the image

24170536
folder	dir

disk	ram
some operating systems cache disk i o in ram for safety after wiping your hard drive you should also resort to ram the physical way

post	get
instantiate the forms in get and post with the appropriate params

24171475
post	get
then get_context_data will not handle logic for get or post

24171478

the easiest way to do this is to create events on your form for the keydown and keyup events check the key being pressed released and track the keys and how long they have been pressed create a scale for how quickly you want to scroll and scroll the number of images

24171497

i would like to get the first audio file in the media library filtered by a custom field but it always returns an empty set of post

24172815
realloc	malloc
however there is no way to take two physical pages and make them the same and since your libraryy and libraryx presumably allocates normal virtual memory that has it s own unique physical pages for each allocation in other words the memory allocation is done with something like heapalloc malloc realloc c++ s new and other such functions

24172851
16-bit	64bit

pull	push
both systems would pull and push from the host

24174257
folder	directory
i need to create a script that will loop through a series of directory go into subdirectories with a certain name and then move their file contents into a common folder for all of the files

i already tried casting the x y width height parameters to uint32 because i read on pinvoke.net there may be errors with computed values like the division i do but that didn t help either

24184154
width	height

24184405

if you have any additional methods where more than a simple get put to the map needs to be synchronized a readwritelock is a good option to allow concurrent reads

24184949
folder	directory
have each folder be created without the box manager having to callback the main class every time it successfully creates a remote directory

24184949
folder	directory
if there are multiple requests to create folder that share a parent directory then only one will create the parent directory and the rest will return a 409 error

24185619

prepare	execute
finally you would prepare and execute the statement

24191384
public	protected

firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works great on google-chrome and firefox but the images don t show up at all on safari

24191944
children	parent
i understand why google would not send the event to children since the insets are an absolute position and if a parent view has repositioned itself children no longer need to worry about it but dropping it on the floor for all sibling views has got to a be a bug

24191969

24192244
versioning	upgrade
the userscripts have updateurl parameters set so that when i upload a new versioning to the page people who have the script installed either have their versioning of it updated automatically or are asked if they want to upgrade

24192264
getter	setter
in java you commonly have public getter and private setter with the constructor being the initializor sic of the variable such as

24192264
getter	setter
in java you are taught that class variables should be local private and should only be accessed with getter and setter

24192264
getter	setter
now if you wanted to add logic to your getter and setter using the above conventions you would need to introduce a local private variable but the code in example and your person constructor wouldn t change

24192272
width	height
in the css give the .wrapper 100 width and height

24192275
getter	setter
i tried putting update code inside getter and setter but as one field depends on xmin and xmax i get an infinite loop exception.

apache	nginx
using nginx with uwsgi instead of apache with mod_wsgi i stuck with this setup because i like it but that didn t solve my problem

24192382

apache-poi	docx4j
take a look at either apache-poi or docx4j both of which can read and manipulate microsoft office files

24192612
width	height	subtract	add
in summary use the algorithm above where you add half the border thickness to the x and y coordinates and subtract the whole border thickness from the width and height and always use a minimum thickness of 1

24192612
width	height
that will always result in a rectangle with a border that occupies and does not overflow a pixel region equivalent to the given width and height

24192640

width	height
i m trying to round up height width depth and weight from uitextfield to the nearest integer but it s still showing the entire decimal point

24192843
int	double
the apparent success of the first division is due to an artifact of how small positive int and positive subnormal double are represented

24192843
int	double
the effect of treating the int as double was to divide each value by 2 to the power 1074

24192888
int	double
ceil rounds the double up to the nearest int

24192888
int	double
casting to int converts the double to an int

24193452
latex	stargazer
as mentionned above latex output can both be customized using stargazer or xtable

24193452
texreg	stargazer
yet from my point of view texreg is more efficient that stargazer and easier to customize than xtable

24193493
google-chrome	firefox
this happens only in google-chrome also checked google-chrome canary but not in firefox

24193520

pop-up	dialog
aside from the inline javascript problem that i mentioned as a duplicate it seems that invoking the print dialog from a pop-up or a background page is impossible

24193911
int	double
if on the other hand you really mean decimal int that might overflow 63 bits when converted to binary you can just convert the string directly to double with double.parsedouble

24193959
width	height
i tried graphics2d s drawimage method with the width and height parameters but it actually slowed my program down

24193973
sorting	filtering
if you estimate that the first method is faster that so few rows match the level filtering that fetching and sorting the remaining rows is faster than ignoring the non-matching rows while scanning through the table then you can force the database to use the index with the indexed by clause

24193984
width	height
i know how to float it and everything i just need to know how to make a background color with a certain width to fill the entire height of the header like so

first if you don t put a nonrandom order by on the first query there is no guarantee what you will get as your first row or even that it is consistent

24194033
inherited	subclassing
with multiple inherited where singleton appears in the mro of the subclassing will differ and you really want to use cls to get the current mro not the mro of just singleton

24194041
pull	push
i just want the files and to know where to go to push pull updates

24194050
min	max
one possibility is to get from www the dresses that are dressed by more than one doll get the related doll_id min and max because only 2 are needed and join those id back to the dolls table

24194050
min	max
the two dolls are bound to be different because if there are more than one distinct id min and max cannot be the same value

24194078
post	get
so what seems to be happening is that the all users data doesn t update when a user makes a change via a post request or a get request for that matter

24194080
post	get
i have read the docs and it seems like what i am trying to accomplish should be quite easy but i can t get it to successfully post the file

24194096
submit	submission
basically for me the specifying data while submission with ajaxsubmit goes against the concept of this plugin which is described as the main methods ajaxform and ajaxsubmit gather information from the form element to determine how to manage the submit process. idiomatic way of using ajaxsubmit would be applying this method for the form with controls

24194157
children	parent
rails is creating a parent object and it s children correctly and inserting new records into the database for each but then it is deleting the children

24194184

24194468
google-chrome	firefox
i verified that it works in firefox and google-chrome

24194512
robocopy	xcopy
it has at least one other bug surrounding error 32 in use files b backup mode will fail with this error even if a file is not exclusively locked and is copyable with copy xcopy windows explorer and robocopy without b so i suspect there are bugs in how it handles in-use files in general

24194534
apache	nginx
you can easily compose new stacks use an apache instead of nginx

24194535

24194537
sorting	filtering
even the sorting and filtering are not working now

24194547

a simple fix is to change your css selector to essentially you are showing the children but since the parent is hidden the children will continue to be hidden too

24194603
jslint	sublimelinter
i m trying to configure sublimelinter specifically jslint on my mac

i pull from the remote repository do some work and then push my work to the remote repository

24194605
width	height
both bodies together took way more impuls to let the player body jump than it took a box with the same width height

24194626
try-catch	exception-handling	puts	gets
the first method that calls the submethod puts that submethod in a try-catch block that catches any exception-handling that gets thrown inside that call

24194626
try-catch	exception-handling
in practice no exception-handling is being caught by that try-catch block

24194640
post	get
the jquery sends an ajax request to the php server using get or post methods

24194640

width	height
i am looking for an algorithm that will resize all rectangles to new width height of all objects on the scene but keep the distances between them

24194663

24194679
groovy	gsp
i have a groovy tags like below in my gsp

you may have to to this for pull as well as push but it seems to be working for me just having changed the default push behavior to upstream

24194720
persistent	transient
second but not directly related to your question this uses a transient vector a standard clojure feature to build up the results at the end within a loop and then turn that vector into a persistent vector before returning the persistent vector

24194740
int	boolean
i did some poking around in the viewpager code and discovered that the boolean pagescrolled int xpos function goes from being called with values in the range of 0 940 0 on the first page and then 940 on the second to being being called with values in the range -940 0 -940 on the first 0 on the second

using md5 hash will be like using a guid for your primary key

24194799
google-chrome	firefox
firefox uses document.documentelement for its scrolling while google-chrome uses document.body

24194842
getter	setter
in your pojo classes used for the table s observable list you not only have to set getter and setter methods but a new one called property

24194872
width	height
don t forget to make the height and width

24194921
swift	objective-c
this approach has two benefits over copying and pasting a list of #import statements above each place you use swift classes in objective-c code

24194921
swift	objective-c
when you add new objective-c classes to your swift code you won t have to add new #import statements in every objective-c file that uses swift code

24194957
profiling	instrumentation
i have read some of the other q a regarding this and all of them seem to advice that once this behavior is seen enable the zombies and run the zombie profiling instrumentation on the simulator

24194964
move	drag
i need to be able to have a delete icon on each header which move whilst being sorted and has a separate on click function so it does not expand or drag the accordion

elasticsearch	kibana
it seems to be correct in elasticsearch via kibana the load and spawn fields exist and are populated correctly

24195063
chisel	verilog
the blackbox will let you describe how chisel interfaces with your verilog code

24195063
chisel	verilog
then you compile your chisel design to verilog

24195063
chisel	verilog
once you have chisel s outputted verilog you have to manually connect your chisel verilog design to your existing verilog code

24195083
pull	push
a pull which will do a merge and then a push should solve this

24195083
pull	push
once the pull succeeds you should be able push your changes to github

24195084
width	height
the correct solution would be having the overflow scroll and a set height width in your itself however this would add a scrollbar if the canvas size itself got bigger not if the contents in the canvas changed size as they do know

24195085
hide	show
clicking the checkboxes to apply the filters might hide an item when it should show it etc

24195087

viewdidload	viewwillappear
these are methods such as viewdidload viewwillappear etc

24195437
viewdidload	viewwillappear
none of these methods should be running if the view is in the background other than arguably viewdidload viewwillappear which are technically called before the view has come to the foreground and viewdiddisappear which is technically called just after the view has left the foreground

24195467

you need a free for each malloc that was not realloc d and a free for each realloc that did not do a free mdash

24195772
free	calloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
treat calloc as equivalent to malloc as far as free is concerned

24195784
submit	submission
my idea was to use the password flow directly and instead of just submission a password submit the whole user registration data

24195804
hide	show
and if you want to permanently hide some of the icons you still need to hook sbstatusbarstateaggregator _setitem int arg1 enabled bool arg2 and sbstatusbarstateaggregator - void _notifyitemchanged int arg in order to ignore any ios attempts to show hidden icons

24195814
put	get

hash	md5
the 3 in the hash specified sha but you can also use md4 1 or md5 2 if you like

24196273
bower	npm
i bumped into this problem after npm install -g bower too

24196289
outputstream	inputstream
for 2.0 bluetooth i can create a socket inputstream and outputstream to transmit the data something like this

24196348

your hide and show functions look for hide tags that are children of the button s parent siblings of the button

edifact	x12
ansi x12 and edifact both provide a framework at a time when frameworks weren t really available and there were a lot of disparate systems unix as 400 windows etc

24197507
edifact	x12
for x12 you re not going to find a lot of freeware because the standards are not publicly published this is not true of the edifact standard so maintaining standards libraries for free is not something most developers want to do

when you assign that int to a double variable it is promoted to a double but its value is kept

int	double
so you end up with a double with the exact same value as the result int -- in this case 3.0

24198655
int	double
in your first case both are int so the result also an int and you have assigned to double

24198655
int	double
but the conversion int to double happened before assignment to double

hex	binary
but because representing a binary number to humans as a string of 0 and 1 makes them difficult to read hex is used as a shortcut groups of 4 bits those 1 and 0 informations are represented as one hex digit

24199287
hex	binary
this conversion from binary to hex and vice versa is very simple

24199287
hex	binary
therefore the hex system isn t used by computers but by humans for terser representation of binary numbers but easier convertibility than from to decimal number system

and now the runtime window looks exactly how we want note the grid s height and width don t have exactly the same values as the original window one - 40 180 vs 75 190 - and that s fine as in design mode you can now just forget window height and width property forever

24200933
width	height
but if we want the behavior in the question i can resize the window but its content doesn t resize with it because i specified a fixed size. which was the original behavior too instead of specifying width and height we can use minwidth and minheight like this

24202679
distance	polygons
the distance between a polygons is either zero if the point lies within the polygons or lies on an edge

24202679
distance	polygons
the nearest distance gives you the distance of the polygons the edge belongs too

24202679
distance	polygons
for example if you have 8 angles every 45Ã¢ you can remove all edges from the list that are superseeded by another edge therefore any point of the removed edge will yield always a greater distance than any point of the other edge of the same polygons

24202679
distance	polygons
so one does not need to check the polygons of a node that result in far greater minimum distance than the maximum distance of another node

client-side	server-side
you problem is that you are mixing a server-side language with a client-side language

24203701

24203951

24204056
free	malloc
malloc and free go hand in hand with each malloc being matched by one free

24204056
free	malloc
thus it makes total sense that the free matching a previous malloc should simply free up the amount of memory allocated by that malloc - this is the majority use case that would make sense in 99 of cases

24204056
free	malloc
imagine all the memory errors if all uses of malloc free by all programmers around the world ever would need the programmer to keep track of the amount allocated in malloc and then remember to free the same

free	malloc
this means that were free to require a size as well as a location malloc would have to be changed to return the actual size allocated as well

24204463
free	malloc
there are two key differences between what malloc free do and what std allocator does

24204463
free	malloc
firstly malloc and free are user facing - they re designed for the general programmers to work with - whereas std allocator is designed to provide specialist memory allocation to the standard library

24204463
free	malloc
let s suppose that header is a mere 4 bytes long which is actually smaller than most real libraries and doesn t include the size then imagine we have a 20 byte free block when the user asks for a 16 byte block a naive system would return the 16byte block but then leave a 4byte fragment that could never ever be used wasting time every time malloc gets called

portrait	landscape
only if the device is landscape the error will burst but while calling this line in portrait everything works well

24205142
hash	md5
the advantage however is that by running other hash you are effectivley winding up with a hash signature consisting of more bits - you are getting three md5 hash as a result

24205142
hash	md5
if you want to do this - and are in-fact okay with having more larger hash data to store compare - you would be much better advise to simply run a different hash function other than md5 that is either more secure and or uses a larger number of bits

24205146

i ve put div s in each cell set the width and height to fixed set max-heights and max-widths and no matter what the table seems to ignore the css entirely and resize itself as it pleases

24208039
width	height
my most recent idea was to write a javascript jquery function that goes through the cells finds the largest cell and resizes all the other cells to be the same size as that one i don t particularly care how big the cells are provided they are all the same width and height

24208039

all these libraries like jpcap and jnetpcap just use libpcap underneath

24212638
jpcap	jnetpcap
i have used both jpcap and jnetpcap and through personal experience i would suggest that you use jnetpcap as it is much easier to use has a good documentation with examples and it has a recently updated version

ubuntu	linux
because this server will be running linux but i require windows tools for development i m running a vm with ubuntu server 14.04 for dev purposes

24213126
minimum	max
there are two likely ways this can be done you can use nulls to indicate no upper lower limit or like mlt indicated in the comments you can use extreme non-null values to set the borders--such as 0 for minimum age and for maximum age for example if this is a tinyint value the max age coud be set to 255

24213126
min	max
with extreme values you skip the trinay logic age between min and max no null checks necessary

24213199
post	get
the post request i get is this even the length is 41 which i guess should be correct for a missing data of

24213202

something suspicious to me is that canvas has both height width set to 1

24213361

outputstream	inputstream
my guess is that someone never got around to making a stringbufferoutputstream in java 1.0 since the product was somewhat rushed to market. by the time java 1.1 rolled around and people actually understood that readers and writers were for characters and inputstream and outputstream were for bytes the whole concept of using streams for strings was realized to be wrong so the stringbufferinputstream was rightly deprecated with no chance ever of a partner coming along

personally i m an mri ruby contributor and i think that the benchmark chart above is not true at all since the introduction of the yarv vm of mri ruby this version became the fastest outthere and lots of benchmarks proved so see pat shaughnessy s benchmarking and comments about the three famous ruby interpreters mri ruby jruby and rubinius

24218638
jruby	mri
2- jruby contains an additional interpretation step unlike mri ruby tokenization parsing ast parsing and generating yarv instructions code generation and finally code execution while jruby contains an additional stage

24218638
jruby	mri
3- garbage collection in mri ruby is a lot faster than garbage collection in jruby even it got better when they introduced some changes in the mark and sweep garbage collection technique

24218638

malloc and free are intentionally very simple memory management primitives and higher-level memory management in c is largely up to the developer

24219566

it is a much more end-to-end solution whereas glfw and glut are only designed to facilitate rendering windowing

24222877

free	malloc
it s required to be async-signal-safe which means it s unlikely to use malloc but even if it doesn t there s no way it could free the allocated memory which exists in the parent s memory space after the underlying execve takes place so it would at best leak memory in the parent unless it manages to construct the argument list on the stack

24223331
execvp	vfork
the latter may require allocation and the former may do all sorts of unsafe-after- vfork things note execvp is not even async-signal-safe

24224695
hash	md5
i am pretty much sure you can not use anything like md5 to compress the data because what md5 does is hash the data so it will look at your data run an algorithm to create this fixed length hash

24224695
hash	md5
however there is an extremely small possibility that two data sets will create the same hash therefore it seems to me impossible to reliably decrypt md5 or other similar hash

24224719
arrayiterator	arrayobject
arrayiterator is like arrayobject but it can iterate on itself

24224719
arrayiterator	arrayobject
comparing array vs arrayobject arrayiterator

24224719
arrayiterator	arrayobject
on the other side the arrayobject arrayiterator classes have certain methods defined that you can use while there is no such thing for arrays

24224719
arrayiterator	arrayobject
comparing arrayobject vs arrayiterator

swift	objective-c
you see implicitly unwrapped optionals in api imported from objective-c because that s the closest swift approximation of an object that s expected to be there but which can be nil

24225670
swift	objective-c
it s a compromise for imported api Ã¢ you can address these variables directly like in objective-c and you can test them for nil using swift optional syntax

24225670
swift	objective-c
as you seem to have suspected swift wraps the possible nil in an optional when bridging from objective-c but the

24225670
swift	objective-c
since swift 1.2 xcode 6.2 in spring 2015 objective-c apis can be annotated with nonnull and nullable in which case the swift interface to those apis uses either a non-optional type or a fully optional type

24225670
swift	objective-c
what s less well-known about this is that you re free to change the optionality of parameters when you implement your own swift functions that get called by objective-c

24225676
stdout	fflush
you could use fflush to fflush it or use n to fflush stdout as it s usually line-buffered

this will draw in the html5 canvas element the height and width of which are specified in the html and so are variable with a white rectangle the size of the canvas beneath two black circles at 150 150 and 300 500

24227283
width	height
so if you know the projected image size which i assume is true by 2. in your question then you can simply use normalized co-ordinates x x width y y height

24227283
width	height
then you can convert a location between any sized images by recovering x x width y y height

24227324
width	height
then whenever you change sprites set the width height to those pre-defined values

24228830
nixos	cabal
if you use the standard install method and or ghcwithpackages when needed then nixos will dedup on a package level if you plot a dependency tree they will point to the same package in nix store nix-store --optimise can always dedup the store at a file level. many packages automatically unlike cabal sandboxes

in the above the templates could just be a set of php files using or echo to produce the output or it could be a dedicated templating system such as smarty or twig

24231692
twig	smarty
indeed the point of the separation is that you could change your mind on that front later because the result of the code modules would be an array of data to be displayed which is just what smarty or twig would need as input

in a language with inherited i would make an abstract base class post and then subclassing that to make one concrete class for each type of post

24232385
post	get
so i definitely don t want to just have the post method that i am writing return because then anytime someone wants to get the ids of all the post for example they would have to make a horrible type switch which would be a pattern used over and over and makes me cringe

24232385
post	get
but the use case for get all ids of all the post into a slice or something similar is still very cumbersome

24232386

24232502
int	double
any code which would consume the result of calling genestate would need to be able to handle both int and double Ã¢ clearly this is the case because i can call genestate on both discrete and continuous values

24232502
int	double
let s represent the part of this code which consumes the int and the double separately

24232502
int	double
this is mathematically justifiable because double contains all of the int egers which can be made more formal if you want

inherited	properties
please take a look at my answer to the following question set inherited zoom action properties to bookmark in the pdf file

24237904
inherited	properties
in my answer to set inherited zoom action properties to bookmark in the pdf file i had this code

24237905
width	height
you could use a single private variable to hold the length width and height and then when setting any of those properties assign that value to the private variable

24237905
width	height
return the value of that same variable in the get properties for width height length

24237964
integer	unsigned
is the case of a bit field each data item would be allocated as a primitive integer type like unsigned int or preferably uint32_t

24237964
for-loop	arrays
in both cases the whole clock can be allocated as an arrays of items which you iterate through with a simple for-loop

24238000
client-side	server-side
i think though that you are confusing server-side php and client-side javascript execution environments

24238034
superclass	subclassing
one option would be to create a superclass for viewcontroller1 and viewcontroller2 where you implement the logic for the common behaviour the options button and specify the common design elements in this case you wouldn t have redundant code and you could simply add more view controllers to the tab bar controller by subclassing again

24238107
width	height
the width and height ratio is the same as before

24238151
pop-up	dialog
i have a google maps that plot multiple markers i need to have click events for the markers to display the pop-up which the following code does with info window but i want to use jquery ui pop dialog instead of the info window

24238162
pop-up	dialog
input box does not change and the keyboard dialog pop-up in google search app

24238163
for-loop	loops
ok so the for-loop with var i will loops 4 times then at 5 it breaks out to label outermost and same with j so the first iteration i 4 and j 4 and num 2

24238179
implements	extends
one uses interfaces to allow for multiple implementations and one uses overriding to simplify the implementation of an interface when implements a windowlistener one typically extends and overrides a method of windowadapter so that one does not need to provide definitions for the cases where the default behavior is sufficient

24238186
strcpy	strncpy
always use strncpy when copying to a fixed length char array - not strcpy

24238191

because you are interested in distinguishing the individual digits within a larger int the chars data type will be a sufficient size container to facilitate the comparison

24252106
min	max	int	chars
using arrays of chars strings within a recursive function with exit criteria of strlen 0 will allow you to walk through each int and select the appropriate value min or max

i find it useful to think about anything left of the dot as a way for angular to resolve the properties through scope inherited

24266512
noexcept	throw
if memory allocation fails it should throw std bad_alloc for an operator new without a noexcept qualification and return nullptr otherwise

24266524
int	double	spaces	delimiter

24266563
getter	setter
this keyword opts out of arc memory management setter getter that are generated for this property

24266565
fgets	getline
note the use of getline instead of fgets it is the preferred method of line input

24266568
glut	sdl
sdl gives you a lot more control over events and glut but takes a little longer to set up

24266568
width	height
call this anywhere really but since the only affecting variables are window width height it s normal to put it in some initialization code or if you plan on resizing your window a resize event handler such as

24266573
elasticsearch	kibana
since you are looking at text processing for log files i d take a close look at the elasticsearch logstask kibana stack

24266610
post	get
i have a controller with a get and post action on the post it checks if the model state is valid

24266703

24266808
innodb	myisam
the heavier have innodb myisam others

24266862
jms	jta
it could be that you are either not using jta to coordinate the jpa and jms transactions or if you are you are running into the two-phase commit race condition see delivery of jms message before the transaction is committed

24266872
getter	setter
create methods in the derived view class which fill the inner elements something like getter setter like properties in c#

24266903
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox but not google-chrome

24266961
put	get
now i could of course just put that line at the end of each test to get it working but that would be a mess

tablet	galaxy
i have stuttering video on both a galaxy note 10.1 tablet and a lenovo yoga hd tablet...the former is on 4.1.2 so it s pre-cts and possibly wont get fixed...dequeueoutputbuffer always returns bufferinfo.size of 0 so cts test will never display the surface if display is based on size

24267064
versioning	upgrade
ie11 crashing with that 6u23 jre plugin must upgrade to higher versioning

24267124
puts	gets
you are printing the symbol stripe_secret_key with puts stripe_secret_key so the string stripe_secret_key gets printed

24267126
pop-up	dialog
right now the empty dialog pop-up for the time it takes the code to go and fetch the content from the server then the dialog populates with the content

24267126
pop-up	dialog
my question is how can i get the dialog to not pop-up until the content has been received

24267142
children	parent
if you need all children from every parent load them eagerly - minimizing the number of round-trips to the database server is the most common trick to get your db-accessing application run faster

24267142
children	parent
if you access a small percentage of children and you want all parent lazy loading may be better - when you need to see the parent before deciding on whether to check the children or not and most of your decisions turn out that you do not check the children go for the lazy loading a round-trip or two wouldn t hurt as much as bringing ten or twenty times more data than you need

24267161
post	get
i m not sure how where to get the value into post though

24267203
button	checkbox
i am having problems when the user selects just 1 or 2 checkbox and changes the radio button eg from met to not met etc

24267203
button	checkbox
so if 2 checkbox are checked and radio button are changed only those two should show in the text area

24267234
disk	ram
virtual memory involves using the disk to emulate additional ram

24267234
disk	ram
this results in lower performance because you re swapping out pages of ram writing them to the disk and then reading other pages of ram from the disk before you can do anything with the data stored in those pages

24267234
disk	ram
if you have 8gb of ram however theoretically you wouldn t use the disk at all and the operations would be faster as you simply have to access the memory location

24267261
postgresql	mysql
if the postgresql db doesn t need to be up to the minute because it is just used by the offline app anyway you can update that db asynchrounosly and use your mysql dbs in a way which gives you the necessary performance

24267288
google-chrome	safari
this doesn t happen when i test my app in google-chrome but it does happen in desktop safari

24267288

i have a datagridview winform c# with predefined height and width sizes of the all columns are also predefined and fixed

24267461
profiling	instrumentation
to launch instrumentation click and hold the play -button in xcode and choose profiling

24267496
post	get
after downloading you ll need a dom parser to get hidden fields out of the blank form and include them in the post submission of the contact form

24267496
post	get
you now should know how network-related tasks are performed in android how to go about performing http post requests to generic sites and how to get form csrf tokens and other hidden fields consider all web forms as having them

24267511
hide	show
one way to avoid that behavior is to create all views when you create a cell and just show hide them

24267521
post	put
if i m reading the docs right this means post put will go through the serializer s process without me having to override the post methods in views and other uglyness

24267529
background-position	background-size
background-size cover + background-position center actually will do the trick

24267535
post	get
your fields require the name attribute to be filled to be sent in post or get data not id

24267541
onclick	onfocus
most likely would use onfocus or onclick in each input type field that somehow clears the output of disp_msg

24267551
hide	show
you can convert the form post to an ajax request and show hide the error code via javascript so you don

24267599
pop-up	dialog
cant figure it out how i display facebook share dialog box in a pop-up rather than browser pop-up

24267600
width	height
the only way i can get this to actually show up is by manually hacking the live css and setting the width and height then it shows up without a problem

24267622
put	get	post	get	post	put
i ve edited my previous answer since you re most likely using a post put when calling your login rest api and okhttp converts any non get or head request into a get request before redirecting which would probably not work for you

24267658
addition	multiplication
use parentheses to make the addition before the multiplication

24267661
hide	show
means it works like normal android when the user leave the edittext we don t need anymore to show the keyboard but since this time it s your keyboard you should care about show hide it

24267697
width	height
probably at the time of execution of your code your view hasn t been drawn yet so its width and height are zero

24267697
width	height
you can use the view.post runnable and in the runnable get their width and height

24267702
swift	objective-c
the only way to get around this is to add an objective-c file and then use #if macros and make two helper functions that you call from swift one for ios8 and one for ios7

24267851
post	put
the user can update his email address by put ting or post ing a new email address at that url

24267893
post	get
in php use where jsonstr is received through get or post

24267906
width	height
i have made the images 200x200px as per the demo so you may need to write some code that changes the sizes base upon the relevant width and height ratios

24267906
client-side	server-side
you are right that php code gets executed server-side and that the rest will get executed client-side

24267915
apk	dex
you can however use the tool dexdump which exists in to view information about the combined dex file inside of the apk

24267915
uniq	grep
. dexdump downloads stackexchangemobile-release.apk | grep class descriptor | cut -d -f2 | cut -c4- | cut -d -f1-2 | uniq -u | sort

24267966
hide	show
but this will affect the scrolling and memory performance you can put the label in the cell by default show hide it in the if else blocks

24268028
tabcontrol	tabitem
it should be just any class inheriting it from tabitem makes it confusing since tabcontrol will create a new tabitem to wrap around this data item so all the methods like focus on the tab you created will have no effect

24268071
hex	binary
it s easy you just need to read every 2 characters and convert them from hex back to binary

24268076
width	height
also the list item contains only one child for the linearlayout so it could just be textview having width set to match_parent and height wrap_content combined with padding

24268138
jtextpane	jeditorpane
use a text component that support multiple colors such as jtextpane or jeditorpane

24268233
mp4	h.264	mp4	webm	h.264	webm
your browser doesn t support html5 video in webm with vp8 or mp4 with h.264

24268271
onresume	onpause
when onresume is removed the crash happens because of onpause specific line below when switching between fragments.

24268305
fflush	gets
you might actually do the network takedown before the fflush finishes and then you re still in the same boat redirect goes out on the new ip and gets rejected by the client

24268340
button	checkbox
if checkbox are checked then radio button should be unchecked and when radio button are checked checked checkbox should be unchecked

24268340
button	checkbox
above is the code which unchecks all the checkbox when radio button is selected

24268340
button	checkbox
how to get started with unchecking the radio button when checkbox are checked

24268408
jmenubar	jmenuitem
i have a jframe with a jmenubar and jmenuitem

24268422
put	get
the api is supposed to be composed of a set of phalcon models that represent the db and business logic and over them a component that acts as a layer that makes those models accessible as http services - generally by translating requests to model names and the http verb to the appropriate model action e.g get account- find findfirst put account- update params etc.

24268430
getter	setter
i have read through the documentation and i can t seem to find a way to shorten properties in general without having to writing both the setter and or getter

24268509
put	get
i tryed to put in front of it but i get error 13 1 pls-00103 encountered the symbol

24268521
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
i love running django in amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk

24268680
width	height
doesn t seem to be possible with varying height so i made the cells full width and mange the padding logic inside the cell class itself

24268725
hide	show
i will show my code bellow but first let me tell you things i have attempted i have tried reactivating the excel file before calling the hide show statements i have tried saving the file before calling hide show i have tried separating the commands out to 2 buttons i have tried renaming the forms

24268749
google-chrome	firefox
while this might work in firefox and google-chrome you can t force a click a hidden input in some browsers ie

24268753
width	height
try this it uses view tree observer for getting the width and height

24268769
versioning	upgrade
upgrade this build server to a newer versioning

24268827
rss	feed
i am using the .net syndicationfeed to create my own rss website feed

24268828
getter	setter
so the pseudo-code here is the get_current_property which should work inside of the getter setter and deleter methods for each property

24268852
hide	show
the button when clicked hide the first form and show the second

24268860
width	height
i know uiparam is the width or height

24268875
x86	64bit
from a user who contacted microsoft support for the same issue file not found on template if not on 64bit machine remove x86 from folder names

24268915
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that selenium copies every startup a new firefox google-chrome profile to the temp directory and starts firefox google-chrome with it

24268920
uiview	subviews
i have a subclass of uiview called animatedview with all of the interface elements as its subviews

24268920
uiview	subviews
when my animatedview s layoutsubviews method is called by its parent it calls some uiview private method called _is_layout which changes all of my subviews bound and frame properties back to what they used to be

24268945
swift	objective-c
since arraywithcontentsoffile is a class method implemented in objective-c s built-in nsarray type i cannot call it as called in this post which calls an instance method by type-casting the swift s array to objective-c s nsarray

24269030
int	chars
your result array is an array of pointers and not an array of items int chars etc

24269047
pop-up	dialog
unfortunately what i see happening is if the browser isn t configured to accept iwa it pop-up up the ugly ntlm authentication dialog looks like the basic dialog

24269143
sorting	filtering
this could be done by sorting both lists do a vlookup to apply a flag where there is a match filtering on the flag then delete and or highlight

24269152
symlink	dotfiles
and your .vimrc is setting your undofiles to be within .vim which is a symlink into that dotfiles directory

24269171

this for-loop checks to see if there is any data in the empty arrays

24269280

referenced int number of chars

24269298
google-chrome	firefox
the following css works in google-chrome 35 but does not work in firefox 30

24269298
google-chrome	firefox
important on the base css has different implementations on google-chrome and firefox

24269319
onresume	onpause
i am building a re-usable component that should do something on a fragment s onresume and another on onpause

24269323
oncreate	setcontentview
in oncreate method before calling setcontentview

24269332
width	height
the problem is once i resize the browser s window after the retina image has loaded making the browser s width smaller the image s width resizes fine but the height stays the same effectively squashing the image vertically thus distorting the image

24269337
daemons	systemd
so instead of having many daemons waiting in the background waiting in a loop android has just one systemd utility that does all of that and that can start your service s at the exact right time

24269391
sudo	passwd	sudoers	passwd
to get sudo to not ask for a passwd you would need to configure your etc sudoers file for this

24269395
try-catch	exception-handling
after perusing through forums and swift documentation not completely i admit it appears that instead of try-catch mechanisms in swift we are encouraged to write code that is more safe from exception-handling

24269400
fadein	fadeout
i tried using simple javascript onclick to make the pages fadein fadeout but it couldn t work

24269407
versioning	upgrade
or versioning upgrade

24269412
width	height
i have 2 images which are the exact same height and width

24269447
ng-show	ng-hide
just use ng-click and ng-show ng-hide

24269447
hide	show
so if you click the anchor it sets editing to true which will hide .editable-body and .editable-toggle...then it will show .editable-form

24269466
ssl	https
you might look a level deeper in the software stack and find that an https library might be building on top of an ssl library

24269466
ssl	https
the https library would simply tell the ssl library that it want a connection to a particular hostname

24269466
ssl	https
the https library already know the hostname and passing that hostname three times to the ssl library rather than just one wouldn t be any significant amount of additional work

24269466
ssl	https
it would make sense to extend the ssl library with sni support without changing the api to the https library

24269496
swift	objective-c
i m curious if there is a way to programmatically get the location of the .xcodeproj package within an objective-c or swift class contained within that package

24269544
put	get
i ve tried to put the headline to the file even tried to remove it the version posted above but in both cases i get the same error

24269566
portrait	landscape
as you can see the camera is in portrait mode and i m trying really hard to get it in landscape

24269570
ubuntu	linux
os is windows 7 x64 running python x86 but code needs to be exportable to windows xp and ubuntu linux

24269570
hid	keyboard
i am using a usb barcode scanner that is hid keyboard compatible

24269580
stdout	stderr
xmllint is probably printing to stderr instead of stdout

24269580
stdout	stderr
redirect your stderr to stdout before the grep

24269583
google-chrome	firefox
by the way i also changed browsername google-chrome into browsername firefox as no google-chrome is installed in my linux box

24269624
post	get
running in firefox with the firebug debugger i see the post from my saveall in the console before the debug 2 above interspersed with the debug 1 s and i don t get my content effectively resorted

24269635
folder	dir
this will list all subfolders with only one file in a parent folder .as it checks the string of the dir command output it should be altered if language settings windows version provide different dir command output

24269740
versioning	upgrade
i recently attempted to upgrade my versioning of android studio android build tools and the android gradle plugin to 0.6.1 19.1.0 and 0.11.1 respectively

24269755
put	get
but if i go to an online converter like this one and i put 1403022360 the ts generated by the server i get a correct date

24269762
put	get
perform an implementation-dependent sequence of calls to the get put and delete internal methods of obj and to sortcompare described below where the first argument for each call to get put or delete is a nonnegative integer less than len and where the arguments for calls to sortcompare are results of previous calls to the get internal method

24269803
x86	mips
all my .so libraries for arm x86 mips takes 8-10 secs

24269858
onresume	onpause
one of the requirements of basic android development according to the google docs is that when you override the activity s lifecycle methods oncreate onresume onpause etc. you must call the parent s method first

24269860
folder	directory
also copy php_ldap.dll from php ext directory to apache bin folder

24269931
google-chrome	firefox
the thing is most of browsers like google-chrome ie10 and even firefox just with the work like this once the input is clicked the class ui-state-active is added and then the javascript click event is called so my code works perfectly this way

24269935
google-chrome	firefox
both google-chrome and firefox made that change back in 2012 or so - see the various links at this answer

24269952
hex	binary
4 i write a java application to translate .obj .bones .fms to hex binary format

24269962
versioning	upgrade
if you cannot upgrade your php versioning you ll have to use the older sdk facebook php-sdk

24269966
google-chrome	firefox
you should check your source code in a web browser google-chrome firefox and see if the link to the css file is really working or use the dev tool of your browser

24269986
puts	gets
the javascript gets the csv content and puts it as anchor href then adds the download attribute to anchor where the value is filename

24270037
folder	directory
the only problem that i see is that you are probably using an invalid path to the directory where the css file is stored example its in a directory called folder

24270038
onresume	onpause
another approach would be that the fragment has to call through to your component in the onresume and onpause methods

24270041
listview	gridview
also if you are dealing with a list of items you want to scroll through especially when the list is long - you would use some itemscontrol subclass - typically a vertical listview for long mostly text content lists or horizontal gridview for lists of richer media items

24270146
int	chars
but i suggest to store a date which occupies 4 bytes just like an int while chars 7 occupies 11 bytes

24270155
put	get
the session map is a wrapper for http session object and operations such as get put are synchronized using a http session object monitor

24270164
post	put
you need to put your thumbnail image in a meta tag that facebook can read for each post

24270204
children	parent
i would like to keep receiving touchmove events on the parent although the children inside are removed or added

24270262
post	get
also i need to get the post future image path post url and post title

24270301
mouseup	mousedown
taking a bit of a different approach rather than using the drag and drop functionality i used some coupled mousedown and mouseup listeners

24270319
pull	push
if you do a push now to remote without resolving the conflicts and doing a git pull until successful the remote repo now looks like this

24270319
pull	push
but if you don t push those files after conflict which you don t changed but git was showing as modified because you did not resolve the conflict and completed a successful git pull then effectievly you are leading to lost commits

24270329
subtraction	add
as you can see you can t center a div vertically using auto top and bottom margins so if you want to center your div vertically you have to make a subtraction and add Ã¢Â½ of it to the top margin for example

24270360
nhibernate	queryover
i m sure i m weak on nhibernate but after numerous attempts i still can t figure out how to get it to join the tables without reverting to queryover or hql but i really like having the dependency defined by

24270367
pop-up	dialog
so i m trying to make the program wait and check if that pop-up dialog has appeared

24270367
pop-up	dialog
however 80 of the time it works every time....otherwise pywinauto sometimes jumps out of the loop and tries to work on the pop-up dialog that hasn t appeared yet

24270435
uialertview	uialertcontroller
i want to conform to the uialertcontroller used in ios 8 since uialertview is now deprecated

24270492
int	chars
as looking for an alternative if you can t use a compiler supporting the complete current c++11 standard actually you may either consider to use std sscanf as roddy suggested or split the string using as delimiter chars and simply convert the split out parts to int values using the the atoi method

24270494
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
in css 1 and 2 the w3c dictated that width and height shall describe only the dimensions of the content of an element disregarding its padding border and margin which would be added expanding around those dimensions

24270494
width	height
however internet explorer from versions 4 through 5.x did things differently by also considering padding and border as part of width and height

24270506
textview	imageview
instead of using a grid view why are you not using relative layout and set your layout relatively.your second problem is because your are setting your grid row one after another hence after setting the imageview it sets your textview txtcabindesc..try this following code snippet i have tried

24270518
int	boolean
declare a shared class called settingsformatter with a shared method called booleantointeger accepting a boolean value returning an int

24270520
pull	push
now you can push and pull changes like you are used to

24270534
put	get
i built a slid down the you first build a holder div put the object to ge the slide down inside set the display of the object to block and get the height and use this for the sind

24270602
pop-up	dialog
but my problems arise whenever the pop-up s form-based document now loaded in the modal dialog s iframe tries to manage its state

24270639
disk	ram
the file is in your operating system s disk cache which is stored in ram

24270688
filesystems	hfs+
the file is compressed by the filesystems and so you only need to transfer less bytes in fact hfs+ does that since 10.6 see for some scripts to inspect things and an explanation

24270734
hide	show
when i go over the link show the div the problem itÃ¢ s when i go out the link no hide the div

24270756
stdout	stderr
also you can simplify the command a little by using the syntax to send stderr to the same handle as stdout and there is no need for append mode when writing to dev null

24270763
nsstring	nsdata
nsdata nsdata and optional nsstring nsstring

24270813
updatepanel	scriptmanager
i tried to add my scriptmanager and updatepanel inside my gridview but i get errors saying the tags aren t recognized

24270842
getter	setter
create setter getter class which will set and get your object

24270842
for-loop	arrays	getter	setter
next create the arrays list of your setter getter class.next add all objects into arraylist using set method in for-loop

24270884
bmp	png
this is actually quite reproducible but only when using bmp icons but not png icons

24270923
int	chars	int	double
sometimes by luck this is the same low value floats will have an exponential of 0 so the int interpretation may be the same but often times this ll be garbage or worse if the sizes are not the same like casting to double from chars you can read unallocated data heap corruption sometimes

24270932
int	double
the following then occurs precisely n times a 32 bit int m_i 0 1 Ã¢ i Ã¢ n followed by exactly m_i ieee-754 double x_ i 1 Ã¢ x_ i m_i

24270967
emacs	sublimetext
we have a new language in our lab and we have stuff that provides syntax highlighting etc in emacs but currently there s nothing for sublimetext

24271020
accessor	properties
you return the text properties of the textbox in the input get accessor

24271107
for-loop	loops
what happens is that the for-loop loops but never executes test

24271179
onkeyup	onkeydown
i got around this issue by using onkeydown instead of onkeyup

24271209
freebsd	linux
env is in usr bin on at least linux and on freebsd osx probably also on other platforms

24271213
maven	pom.xml
i want to deploy my .war into tomcat 8 and run it by maven pom.xml file

24271256
google-chrome	firefox
when i click on download csv google-chrome firefox and ie10 prompts me to save the file without refreshing the page view but on ie8 9 the page is refreshed so the content from the ng-include tag is gone in particular the html i posted above is no longer present

24271324
textmate	sublimetext
also let me point out that you probably get better response when tagging this question textmate as sublimetext uses textmate s .tmlanguage files as syntax definitions

24271331
uilabel	uitapgesturerecognizer
another way to do this without adding a hidden button is to add a uitapgesturerecognizer on the uilabel make sure to set userinteractionenabled to true on the label

24271334
width	height
my canvas has 1000 height and 1000 width as follows

24271390
getter	setter
in swift getter setter work differently

24271390
getter	setter
since there are no more properties like in objc there are no automatically generated setter getter for you

24271396
switching	screens
i guess what i am looking for is when i switching screens for a function to reset or refresh also the function is tied into an array so i don t know if that will effect anything

24271439
swift	objective-c
write an objective-c class that handles the exceptions and returns values for swift code to consume

24271501
cpu	processors
is there a way i can make this work when i set it to any cpu with default processors architecture set to x86

24271535
post	get
oke so i have been messing around for 5 hours straight right now and i finally managed to get my own hashed password into the post data of cakephp 2.x

24271563
hide	show
then usually you d overlay all your stuff once on the initial load in the first overlay and just hide show your ui according to your rules

24271574
google-chrome	firefox
this works in the latest versions of firefox google-chrome and ie

24271582
getter	setter
a computed property with a getter but no setter is known as a read-only computed property

24271595
mouse	keyboard
i suggest that you may look into a shared hoisting plan on a reputed hosting companies like hostgator since there isn t much traffic.i also suggest you also buy a cpanel for managing tools.cpanel has a web interface with which you can control every tool using your mouse keyboard

24271600
fadein	fadeout
this will ensure that the fadeout has finished before the fadein begins

24271604
subtract	add
i m trying to create a form that has dynamic form fields where a user can add and subtract them as they wish they re input is then displayed in a preview panel so they can see how it looks outside of the text box

24271616
comparator	comparable
so i will use comparable interface and implement comparator method

24271632
equals	compareto
you don t need to override equals since collections.sort will use compareto not equals

24271696
implements	extends
public class actionbartabactivity extends actionbaractivity implements

24271718
comparator	comparable
i think that in your case you should use custom comparator instead of making your class comparable

24271763
equals	compareto
consistent with equals means that compareto returns 0 if and only if equals returns true

24271763
equals	compareto
so unless compareto always returns a value for two different object references equals should be overridden

24271772
width	margin
using the .outerwidth true parameter will give you the width of the element including the margin

24271772
width	height
the inner and outer width function are mirrored and work the exact same for height

24271772
width	height
however once you have a vertical and horizontal scrollbar at the same time things could would get complicated because the 100 height or width element could expand beyond what is in the view-able space depending on how the content is rendered into the element with the scrollbars

24271802
awt	swing
painting in awt and swing

24271824
google-chrome	firefox
but it is giving error undefined function in google-chrome .and in firefox unsupported html document error occurs

24271825
qdialog	qwidget
i have a qdialog with different items among them a pointer to a qwidget

24271883
freebsd	linux
i did some sore research and found two interesting things about malloc realization in linux and freebsd

24271883
freebsd	linux
so any kind of optimization is needed only for freebsd as linux allocates blocks with a very tiny steps and it s very unlikely to receive less then 16 bytes of data from socket

24271905
post	get
although i used post method in the form the data from the post is empty but when i try get the value is there so i tried using get_post

24271924
spaces	delimiter
as far as i understand you have string that contains spaces delimiter numbers

24271925
hash	salt
server break-in if you don t store passwords hash and salt in the server someone who gets the list has those passwords trivially and doesn t even have to crack them

24271982
setinterval	settimeout
do not reload upon online offline and instead handle online offline in your xhr requests and just set a short timer loop settimeout setinterval to retry or use a framework to handle this for you

24272005
width	height
carousel-slide-dimension on jquery cycle2 -fixed width height

24272037
box-sizing	border-box
used box-sizing border-box to account for padding

24272050
put	get	post	get	post	put
now i use the repository instance in my controller of the web service to invoke get put post and delete operations which are defined respectively in xmlrepository and sqlrepository

24272054
folder	directory
.. images imagename.jpg means the image is one folder up and the in the images folder from your current directory

24272076
hash	salt
as soon as you use a unique salt for each password and save it together with the password you won t be able to do the verification in a single sql statement especially not with a slow hash function

24272114
width	height
my recommendation is instead of instantiating a uibutton that i m guessing is equal to the height width of each table row is to implement

24272114
uitableview	nsindexpath
moreover for the row label just stick in uilabel and for uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath set the label according to the array value

24272115
width	height
you should use this method only if you have complex shapes because this algorithm has o height width complexity where height and width are sizes of smaller sprite in pixels

24272140
post	put
for the above example i recommend you put the pre and post steps into the same recipe

24272150
button	checkbox
note there is no need for ngvalue that directive is for checkbox and radio button

24272160
ubuntu	linux
i wrote the program in a plain text document on linux ubuntu 14.04 and used the terminal to compile and run the program

24272189
listview	gridview
this is not a gridview but a grouped listview gives quite good results

24272193
implements	extends
if your object implements a specific interface or extends a specific class php knows how to iterate it

24272226
post	get
after i post my update i also tried reinstall mod_wsgi by following this tutorial and this tutorial but i still get the same failure

24272228
put	get
in case of no value provided i want to use it as 0 i also have tried to put it as default 0 in parser.add_argument and also with an if statement.but i get the error above

24272272
inherited	properties
as of raven 2.5 the support for dynamic objects seems to be mostly for the read side of things and it s not that easy to set properties on an existing object because raven.abstractions.linq.dynamicjsonobject which inherited dynamicobject only implements the read invoke methods of the dynamic contract like trygetmember trygetindex and tryinvokemember

24272308
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk

24272308
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk see this tutorial on how to build a nodejs app using cluster in an autoscaling environment

24272341
google-chrome	firefox
depending on the user in here people are using firefox google-chrome internet explorer 8 9 or 10

24272401
google-chrome	firefox
it works well in firefox and google-chrome but internet explorer 8 is not showing any of the accordion functionality

24272411
filesystems	ntfs
this is true for all normal filesystems all those of linux or other unix like systems ntfs etc

24272431
swift	objective-c
if you have a swift project add a new objective-c file to your project and xcode will prompt if you want to configure your project with a bridging header

24272431
swift	objective-c
if you have a objective-c project add a new swift file to it and you will get the same prompt

24272490
pull	push
i m wanting to automate a local server to pull github repositories and then add copyrights to the code files if they aren t already there then commit and push them back

24272490
centos	linux
i have the copyright executable running on the linux centos server but i can t get a way to tell my program to run or not

24272497
equals	gethashcode
this custom comparer must have public bool equals and public int gethashcode methods respectively

24272507
google-chrome	firefox
if you use firefox or google-chrome you can just right-click on the object you need more information on in your case the black lower part that shouldn t be black

24272509
post	get
then in asp.net mcv one could have methods with the same name responsible for the get and post requests

24272524
salt	md5
this adds two different salt two different hashing functions and it reduces the already low chance of a rainbow table attack because the attacker would need a collision that occurs for both md5 + the first salt and sha256 + the second salt

24272533
children	parent
your second query doesn t do the same as the first one it s counting the number of children not parent

24272537
min	max
i have pulled historical weather data as a separate dataframe and would like to add to each sample row the total_mm_rain that fell during the growing days along with max min and mean temperatures of that growing period

24272582
nsurlconnection	nsurlsession
nsurlsession is a refactoring of nsurlconnection and introduces some new features

24272582
nsurlconnection	nsurlsession
if nsurlconnection cannot safely be used while nsurlsession is being used i ll just have to refactor to no longer use nsurlconnection but i d rather not if i don t have to or if doing so doesn t solve the problem

24272623
nsstring	nsdata
i tried creating an nsstring then converting to nsdata then serialized and failed

24272691
swift	objective-c
swift is mostly compatible to objective-c and i have no issues with this code

24272691
swift	objective-c
there s an apple document about transferring your objective-c code to swift

24272699
junit	testng
something similar to server side unit tests - junit testng

24272808
express	node.js
i am using node.js with express web framework and with jade template parser

24272834
metaphone	soundex
double metaphone is a soundex -like hash algorithm for imprecise matching of roman-alphabet english-pronunciation proper-name text

24272834
metaphone	soundex
like the ancient and honorable soundex double metaphone favors false positive matches rather than false negative

24272893
int	boolean	tinyint	boolean
the values are being set to 1 or 0 courtesy of eloquent calling a boolean a tinyint in mysql but i can t see how to use the form model approach and set that checked attribute if the value coming is an int and not a boolean hence why i think form model binding for checkboxes isn t working

24272897
for-loop	loops
my idea was that i could run a while loops around the for-loop to check if it still contains items which did not work because after the for-loop is finished the threads are not finished an so the list isn t empty

24272900
put	get
to get names create a custom datatype and probably a datatype equivalent to int string to put names on those fields and derive your own custom instance of tojson as described in the docs

24272948
width	height
bottom line - set width and height to auto delete the values that they have

24273031
folder	directory
go into the same folder as d xampp htdocs fineuploaderv2 html templates server handler.php and make the chunks directory

24273072
put	get
no matter where i put the removeeventlistener the listen does not get removed

24273079
put	get
looking at the docs i assume that if i put around d+ and w+ i get the numbers and strings inside the group

24273091
google-chrome	firefox
i am using both google-chrome and firefox

24273108
post	put
you can then put them in the controller s view model and store configs example at end of post

24273145
setinterval	settimeout
i tried setinterval settimeout but non of them is working for me

24273155
mouseup	mousedown
the problem i m trying to solve is allowing a normal click mousedown mouseup to still trigger the oniteminvoked event on the listview while still allowing the div inside a listview item to be scrolled

24273279
asort	usort	ksort	usort	ksort	asort
i have tried usort and asort and ksort

24273289
rss	feed
i m trying to parse an rss feed from sharepoint using jquery

24273376
put	get
using a cross apply and getting artificial rows where we can split a given value i then use the hours and days to put into the select statement in various ways to get your intended effect

24273398
opera	google-chrome
in 12th row i need at least .0743em border width to make it visible in google-chrome and opera last versions as of today

24273398
box-sizing	border-box
please aware that i use box-sizing border-box

24273419
put	get
how ever i get the following when i put into my comments controller index action and get the following result

24273421
hide	show
you could also just use session.openactivesession method to login instead of the login button - then you can create a fragment with your own login button hide it on successful authentication and show a logout button in your settings activity

24273444
rcharts	rmaps	leaflet	rmaps	shiny	rcharts
possibly part of the reason of my problems is that the original code from ramnath uses rmaps while i m using rcharts also developed by ramnath as it is more developed better integrated with shiny and of course includes leaflet

24273485
entity-relationship	diagram
to understand the model relationships see my entity-relationship diagram

24273529
put	get
if you use multithreading you would likely have to either chop up the list and put it back together or get the indexes and then go through the list in reverse and remove each one manually

24273563
post	get
my idea was to have a base basecontroller in the domain that each of the services controllers could inherit from and in turn would all necessarily inherit the wired-up stuff like get post etc

24273585
move	drag
so i will go from dragging it several hundred pixels in a row successfully to having 2 or 3 drag attempts where it doesn t move at all

24273647
folder	directory
folder directory

24273664
google-chrome	firefox
tested in firefox and google-chrome

24273683
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i ve tried outputting the data using the following which strangely works in google-chrome but not in firefox ie safari or google-chrome mobile

24273683
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
note i was logged-in using google-chrome and not logged-in using firefox ie and safari which totally explains why i was seeing the undefined console message when using these browsers

24273734
min	max
you should read and possibly parse all of them and use min ... and max ... to get the smallest and the largest

24273766
hide	show
i was thinking about using .toggle but it looks like it s only being used to show hide only

24273812
addclass	removeclass
removeclass and addclass both return the jquery object so rather than repeating the selector you can just keep chaining

24273814
qnetworkreply	qnetworkaccessmanager
qnetworkaccessmanager get returns qnetworkreply pointer

24273816
hide	show
toggle works fine aswell for classes just as with show hide

24273876
udp	tcp
by the way my netstat shows that my server is listening to port 5060 for both tcp and udp traffic so that rules out one problem

24273912
put	get
your get parameter api_key is just a little weird put the between api_key and the key itself like

24273924
post	get
i want to get all post parameters

24273925
put	get
i have a method that reads a string and two integers from the defaultsharedpreferences.when i attempt to put the values stored in the two integers from defaultsharedpreferences into other two integers i get an error saying that the two saved integers defaultsharedpreferences are actually strings.here is the error from logcat

24273925
int	double
i have double checked everything related to those two int - port_server and port_android and i am out of ideas

24273960
width	height
edit here is something that maintains 90 proportions with just css under the conditions that diva and divb are both parents to some other div rather than diva being a parent to divb height 300px is arbitrary as are the width s

24273998
getter	setter
you can create a subclass of jpanel that holds the value and include getter and setter for the value like so

24274028
express	node.js
when updating a user via database update in my node.js express app i update a user session which then updates a res.locals.session

24274034
width	height
fwiw the system.drawing.rectangle struct is not a match either it uses width and height instead of right and bottom

24274037
cos	sin
cos and sin in javascript accept an argument in radians not degrees

24274071
hide	show
the plan i am currently leaning towards is to add a div to my primary table row that i will show hide update rather than using child rows at all

24274078
versioning	upgrade
one of my colleagues suggested that the deactivate reactivate process done by the timer job would update the versioning number meaning that i can no longer call upgrade

24274078
versioning	upgrade
some way to decrement the versioning number programmatically then call upgrade

24274085
dataframe	multi-index
i have a dataframe in pandas with company name and date as multi-index

24274097
octal	decimal
convert each octal string representation to its decimal equivalent as a byte

24274151
for-loop	loops
the enhanced for-loop as you call it it s actually called the foreach loops internally uses an iterator for any iterable - including linked lists

24274158
for-loop	arrays
here is the for-loop that could be used but it seems like there could be a function in numpy that i m missing - i d rather not use the masked arrays that numpy offers

24274219
flot	highcharts	flot	fusioncharts	highcharts	fusioncharts	d3.js	highcharts	d3.js	flot
i made some testpages 4 graphs each with libraries such as highcharts flot d3.js amcharts fusioncharts etc

24274251
swift	objective-c
excuse the code it s actually swift instead of objective-c but the concept is just the same

24274253
post	put
in short you ll need to change your ajax request from put to post - laravel is rejecting the put request because it s expecting post

24274268
codeblocks	mingw-w64
i m using mingw-w64 with codeblocks so would i put it into mingw codeblocks or the codeblocks project

24274278
width	height
my canvas height and width is 500 500 and its clipping coordinates are also 500 500

24274278
width	height
but when i add image as children whose height and width is 600 600 and then saved it canvas also save that part also by covering the extra space with black color and then save it

24274298
width	margin
i needed margin not padding btw because the padding was actually squishing the width of the image

24274361
versioning	upgrade
you should upgrade you re php versioning to 5.3.7

24274368
udp	tcp
i have a server that firstly takes a tcp connection then on another thread listens for a specific udp packet from all sources on a port to be noticed and the endpoint associated with and used alongside the tcp connection

24274401
post	put
the problem i am having is turning the post data as json and put it into a new post but it is not play s type writeable

24274539
width	height
i create a custom linearlayout object inflate in this the resource of the arrayadapter and force android to calculate the measurements through row.measure width height

24274551
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have a uitabbarcontroller and uinavigationcontroller in an app with storyboards that i want to use iads in

24274551

24274552
subtract	add
they do not add or subtract

24274714
nvd3.js	datamaps
i m using nvd3.js and datamaps to visualize data and then i embed these visualizations in a reveal.js presentation by using iframes

24274714
nvd3.js	datamaps
this happens with both types of visualizations datamaps and nvd3.js here is a screenshot of the nvd3.js not loading and here of the datamaps not loading

24274731
subtraction	addition
because as far as i ve seen after two floating point operands are used in an addition subtraction operation the result gets rounded before being used as an operand for another operation also i ve seen this

24274749
division	modulo
as well reconsider naming your variable mod which is a built-in matlab function for modulo after division to avoid any perhaps future bugs in the code when you may try to use the mod function rather than than the mod variable

24274765
tex	mathjax
i m using node and express with mathjax to make a comment system with tex

24274805
swift	objective-c
usually when accessing an objective-c api in swift you will see lots of these implicitly unwrapped optionals because pointers in objective-c can be nil

24274828
hide	show
i m making a single page website and using jquery for show and hide form switching

24274995
multiplying	add
without a fused multiply-add it is done twice for each pair once after the multiplying and again after the add

24274999
ssl	https
if i connect with ssl to an https address the socket will not open

24274999
grizzly	netty
i have tried updating my libraries and replacing netty with grizzly

24275015
folder	directory
simply copy it into a directory within your theme named woocommerce keeping the same file structure except you don t include the templates folder

24275091
bbpress	buddypress
i migrated our old buddypress forums to bbpress successfully disabled all network active plugins deleted all the ones we didn t neeed including bp and re-activated updated versions of all the plugins on just the primary blog

24275115
mouseover	mouseout
every time i apply this script i get the following error messages whenever i mouseover mouseout of the menu

24275183
int	chars

24275183
istream	getline
Ã¢ getline std istream char 1024 Ã¢

24275188
elasticsearch	kibana
i have just started to play around with lucene via logstash elasticsearch and find that this seems to work from the kibana ui

24275188
elasticsearch	kibana
i am not sure yet if this is some intelligence in elasticsearch or kibana i just know that elasticsearch borrows from the lucene syntax

24275200
istream	getline
all overloads of std getline take a basic istream and a string

24275201
inherited	properties
3 create a class with associated properties that inherited from jastor

24275215
post	get
did you check that what other params are send in post or get method when you search from browser you have to pass them all in form data

24275261
oncreate	onstart
there are two events that the app expects oncreate and onstart

24275261
oncreate	findviewbyid	oncreate	onstart
i had to move findviewbyid from oncreate to onstart

24275282
for-loop	loops
note part of the challenge is to use the for-loop not the while loops

24275312
put	get
in cakephp when i get data it is put into a nested array with each model separated out so something like this

24275318
daemons	systemd
that is suppose the core applications that are needed just to bring up the os are all rewritten in c++ and all use the library things like a systemd daemons shell getty and so on

24275344
gradle	ivy
you are expected to use a build system like gradle ivy or maven to manage your dependencies - these tools will automatically download the library you want along with any of its dependent libraries and be smart about it caching it on your local filesystem so if a library is shared across multiple libraries it won t be downloaded twice

24275356
for-loop	loops
the python for-loop doesn t care if you modify loops variable in the body

24275367
folder	directory
having done that if you then cd into to your virtualenv source folder somewhere in home youruserhame and run python virtualenv.py home youruserhame yourvirtenv it will create a directory yourvirtenv into which it will put a copy of the interpreter of your local python

24275367
flask	django
flask is like django a python framework

24275371
cos	sin
sin cos tan and the other related functions have their units in radians

24275384
for-loop	loops
as others have stated the python for-loop is more like a a traditional foreach loops in the sense that it iterates over a collection of items without checking a condition

24275412
for-loop	loops
as your question states note part of the challenge is to use the for-loop not the while loops and you don t want to use break you can put it in a function and return when the correct number is guessed to break loops

affinity	processors
since tbb 3.0 update 4 processors affinity settings are referenced to determine the number of available cores according to a developer blog

24275516
affinity	processors
clarifying the statement in the end of my previous blog tbbÃ¢ s methods tbb task_scheduler_init default_num_threads and tbb tbb_thread hardware_concurrency return not simply the total number of logical cpus in the system or the current processors group but rather the number of cpus available to the process in accordance with its affinity settings

24275516
freebsd	linux
currently on windows linux and freebsd it returns the number of logical cpus available to the current process in accordance with its affinity mask

24275516
affinity	processors
the docs for tbb task_scheduler_init initialize also suggest that the number of threads is limited by the processors affinity mask

24275516
affinity	processors
you can set the affinity mask in matlab or c as described in the q a set processors affinity for matlab engine windows 7

when you call the - uitableview reloaddata method you are telling the tableview to refresh ints content based on the source you already gave him but he doesnt change the source

24275647
uitableview	reloaddata
in some cases you refresh you datasource and you need to refresh the uitableview so you call the - uitableview reloaddata

int	chars
in any case it is guaranted by the standard that typical chars like english alphabetical letters or digits have all positive int values in the range of values of chars

24275928
int	double
you have the basic idea right - you ve created the structure but you re assuming that the double precision value is stored immediately following the int value and that generally isn t correct

24275928
int	double
that is a 8-byte double precision number will have to be aligned to 8-byte boundaries that is the address of it s first byte is zero modulo 8 whereas the int only has to be 4-byte aligned

24275928
int	double
this almost certainly means that there are 4 bytes of padding between the int and the double

so you ve got the rdf xml serialization of the rdf mapping of an owl ontology

24288801
rdf	owl
in fact many of the owl files you ll find online are rdf xml serializations of rdf mappings of owl ontologies

24288801
rdf	owl
one more way to serialize an owl ontology is an rdf graph

24288801
rdf	owl
owl 2 web ontology language mapping to rdf graphs second edition describes the rdf mapping of owl ontologies

24288801
rdf	owl
so from the owl ontology you can generate a set of rdf triples an rdf graph

24288801
rdf	owl
here s the rdf graph for your owl ontology in a few different rdf serializations

24288801
rdf	owl
since they re rdf encodings of an owl ontology it also makes sense to call them owl files

that didn t make sense when considering that display none and display initial works fine in non-ie browsers tested firefox google-chrome safari on windows mac android and iphone

24295708
initializer	class-method	swift	objective-c
the compiler automatically remaps objective-c class-method that are named as convenience constructors to work as swift initializer

24295820

24296125
cfstring	nsstring
here s a swift string a function that takes a cfstring and how to call it by casting to nsstring

24296125
swift	objective-c
the compiler takes advantage of the automatic arc bridging for cf types that was introduced with xcode 5 to let you treat those types like swift or objective-c objects

24296146
versioning	upgrade
identity is not tied to the mvc versioning although the versioning installed with mvc5 is 1 you can just upgrade to identity 2 via nuget

24296284
submit	submission
jquery uses an input of type submit for form submission

24296364
easeljs	tweenjs
also if you want to continue using easeljs only or with tweenjs you ll need to implement the ticker properly here s how i create my ticker function

24296364
easeljs	tweenjs
note that both easeljs and tweenjs work together

24296424

in either case you should build a buffer of input concatenating the results of each read until you are ready to process

24296600
button	checkbox
in this case all user objects will be loaded from the database and rendered as either a select tag a set or radio button or a series of checkbox this depends on the multiple and expanded values

24296605
integer	unsigned
signed integer overflow as strictly speaking there is no such thing as unsigned integer overflow means undefined behaviour

24296605
addition	multiplication	addition	twos-complement	multiplication	twos-complement	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	twos-complement	subtraction	addition
this option instructs the compiler to assume that signed arithmetic overflow of addition subtraction and multiplication wraps around using twos-complement representation

24296605
integer	unsigned
1 - this rule does not apply to unsigned integer overflow as Ã¢ 3.9.1.4 says that

24296619

note that i explicitly set the processors affinity mask to use all 8 cores but since there are only 4 running threads cpu usage stayed approximately at 50 in this case

24296633
width	height
somewhere something has gone wrong - when the background image is at full size which only seems to be possible by adding a png transparent image - full height not full width - to fill it out then the text seems to be forced from the containing div and its background image

24296648
subtract	add
it s very easy you need to separate the string in terms you can add or subtract

24296772
client-side	server-side
the broad answer is that your class as you currently have it effectively represents both the client-side and server-side portions within the same thread process

24296772
client-side	server-side
as you ve seen you re able to write your data to the outbound or client-side socket but the server-side component never gets a chance to listen for incoming connections

24296790
min	max
found the half max in my case it is half min

24296810
getter	setter
you should be using arr.pushobject obj and arr.popobject for manipulating an array in ember think of it as the setter getter of arrays

24296814
width	height
the public window int width int height int locationx int locationy string title canvas c constructor then creates another instance of window jframe this is window #2 but it is not visible.

24296814
width	height
this then calls public window int width int height int locationx int locationy string title which creates another window which is actually the one that is visible.

24296852

the correct way to delete a profile is to use websphere s manageprofiles utility located in was_home bin in your case c program files x86 ibm websphere appserver bin

24297157
hide	show
first onloading of document we need to get how many options you have in your select and we should hide all the div then show the div that have class equals to the selected value of select box

24297181
ng-view	ng-include
this might happen if you re inside a directive that creates a child scope like ng-repeat ng-include ng-view etc and then you assign flightsprocessed with a value which inadvertently creates a new scope variable in the child scope

24297228
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	opera	safari

when you try to submit a form with errors you ll see the form you were submission

24297326
pop-up	dialog
in my spring application i have one dashboard page from where the sub-pages are opened in pop-up windows implemented using the jquery-ui dialog

24297331
folder	directory
it seems some of the project dependencies are defined in the .idea folder so i wasn t sure if i can put the whole directory in .gitignore or not

24297385
min	max
then you query for the min max id by name and join that to the original data

24297385
min	max
if you want the min just take the max out of the line and vice versa

24297404
superclass	subclassing
this seems like it would make more sense because i have a superclass of location and a subclassing of data

24297429
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition
you are expanding an array of only 10 real pseudo random numbers into 1 million by using addition multiplication and subtraction

to implement bubble-sort for any type of object in that case book implements in your object class the interface comparable and override the methode comparator to define your desired handling

24297676
vertica	teradata
so i need a simple data store with high compression features as in vertica teradata oracle and sqlserver products

24297686
post	get
but any other method yes i am using post and not get and yes i ve tried to pass all the params as post data individually rather than via querystring either way results in duplicate albums causes duplicate albums

24297689
post	get
note that i used post .post method instead of get because in normal get request a body is not expected and thus no request type is needed

24297706
super	extends
if your instructor is looking to have all of the objects in the same array then you would need to rely on the fact that all objects in java extends a super object called object

24297706
super	extends
if you have a common interface or super class such as persondata inherits person or persondata extends person you could use this super class to create a single array such as the first example as well

24297732
skaction	sktexture
right now i m trying to figure out how to both remove the skaction from my skspritenode as well as the sktexture

24297732
skaction	sktexture
i m guessing this is an issue of these skaction s and sktexture s still being in the ram but i don t have a clear understanding of how this works

24297732
swift	objective-c
i m just messing with the spritekit library for fun i admit i am still a novice intermediate to objective-c and honestly i would probably do better with a loosely typed language like swift however the programmer inside of me wants to know the proper way to do things so i m going to try and do both and start using swift as soon as possible

24297735
implements	sealed
because is not a sealed class it would be possible for a type to exist which would inherit from and implements

24297748
erlang	elixir
i want to learn erlang and maybe elixir

24297754
post	get
the modal is done in chat style where the newest post get added to the bottom

24297754
post	get
but what i can t get to work is the scroll to bottom after a new post is submitted while the modal is still open

24297816
int	double
note that my code separates the line based on spaces found not using the scanner to search for double int

24297834
width	height
just place both views in the xml layout so that the overlap for framelayout both with width and height as match_parent

24297982
hide	show
the problem is true because the height of the browser in android will change when the url bar hide and show

24298003
post	get
so get v post should both work the same

24298004
int	double
moreover for surviving from exception you can use hasnextdoubel hasnextint method to make scanner check whether there exist double int in data it returns true false .you can read more about this at #scanner

24298066
linefeed	delimiter
you can use .readline to read in a single line in to a string as delimiter by the cr linefeed and then use standard string manipulation functions to pull off the parts of that string that you need and rebuild it with your replacements

24298112
min	max
looking at the rules variable explains why the method variable is undefined - for some reason the array containing the min and max parameters is undefined instead of being named customstringlength

24298132
portrait	landscape
i split up the declarations for the landscape and portrait images in subclasses so the rest of the declarations in this case only overflow hidden

24298132
width	height	portrait	landscape
to determine whether the image has landscape or portrait format simply check to see if width height is larger or equal to 1

24298230
uiview	subviews
let s say i have a xib mapped to my custom uiview subclass - i know how to set that up in ib - and my xib has a uilabel subviews

24298230
uiview	subviews
after creating my template xib use the storyboard to drag in new uiview and somehow set each to be linked to my one customview.xib and then somehow do my static repositioning of the subviews uilabel within each of those uiview instances on the storyboard

24298255
versioning	upgrade
that is correct although you also need to check the official documentation and follow the official upgrade guide as there are still a couple of files you might need to change manually depending upon what versioning you are upgrading from

24298278
i2c	spi
contrary to i2c spi does not define a protocol or handshake spi chips manufacturers have to define their own

24298297
factors	mean
suppose i have a data frame in r where i would like to use 2 columns factor1 and factor2 as factors and i need to calculate mean value for all other columns per each pair of the above mentioned factors

24298299
post	put
put any adminifiable resources inside namespace e.g resources post

24298300
subtract	add
the reason why i am trying to do this is because i am building a form that allows the user to dynamically add subtract player fieldsets

24298315
vsto	add-in
i have created an add-in using vsto 2010 and my application as soon as it starts the folders are created in the appdata path

24298341
firefox	safari
but in safari or firefox the 2nd and 3rd slides do not display

24298347
width	height
set minimum height minimum width to 0 then padding will remove for ex

24298356
try-catch	exception-handling
but sometimes outofmemoryerror occurs at line 2 and app crashes i tried enclosing this code within try-catch but still my app crashes as only exception-handling are caught by try-catch also createscaledbitmap functions only throws illegalargumentexception

24298390
hash	salt
you probably do want to avoid disclosing the hash password but the salt doesn t need to be private

24298390
hash	salt
you could get the salt for the user and hash client side then compare server-side

24298390
pbkdf2	hash
i don t know if sql has actual password hashing algorithms mcrypt pbkdf2 etc. or is limited to purely cryptographic algorithms like the sha family but a benefit of hashing outside the server is that you can choose your hash algorithm

24298391
salt	md5
obviously this would be overkill yet strictly speaking from a whim and wonderment would looping these methods with our password and salt and then using our return saying md5 being our last algorithm to be ran as the store

24298404
width	height
right now if someone visits my site from a narrow browser viewport the slideshow will only fill the width but not the entire height therefore leaving space at the bottom of the div

24298432
folder	directory
what did fix the problem for me was deleting the bin obj and tools folder in my project directory

24298447
maven-surefire-plugin	pom.xml
specified additional classpath in pom.xml under maven-surefire-plugin over here also i specified full path path from project base directory etc.

debian	linux
i m having some errors when i try to compile my program in linux debian

24298510
getter	setter
iboutlet properties need to be mutable so the xib storyboard can do its magic so you d need to implement it with both a getter and a setter like this

24298523
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
if i were you just generate a random salt for each user possibly by md5 hashing uniqid just an example and hash the password with said salt

24298536
hash	salt
this is because the entered password in the login form will be hash with the random salt this salt is different to whats in the database for this user

24298545
getter	setter
and i use those synthesized getter but write setter that do the appropriate kvn

24298561
serializable	deserialization
the perfect way to do this is by using a library for serializable deserialization

24298636
width	margin
the clearest solution might be to use css3 calc to make it take 100 width minus the space that the menu button is taking 22px width + 20px of padding + 2px of border + 15px of margin 59px total space

24298661
hash	salt
the hash can be more secure you can have random salt for every user which makes it computationally expensive for someone to brute force attack the passwords should the database be compromised

24298661
pbkdf2	hash	pbkdf2	salt	hash	salt
always use cryptographic functions such as sha2 for hash pbkdf2 for deriving salt etc. for all cryptographic operations

24298661
hash	salt
hash the password using this salt

24298661
hash	salt
store both the salt and the password hash in the db

24298661
hash	salt
hash the password using the salt on the client

24298661
hash	salt
hash the password using the salt on the client

24298713
factors	mean
if you need to calculate the mean for all other columns than the factors you can use the formula syntax of aggregate

24299066
post	get
but when i post back i get an error on this line

24299095
put	get
one thing you can do to minimize the problem is to put all your assets in one specific folder not a child of the folder where your actual php html whatever are located then create one section in your httpd.conf for each folder where the assets folder get minimum checks and your web site urls can still have more complex rules applied only for them

24299116
width	height
you can use wrap_content or fill_parent for width and height in the xml

24299120
hide	show
since the ng-show directive on the inner div is bound to showdiv the same showdiv that is on the samplecontroller s scope it will automatically show and hide based on the value of showdiv

int	double
collections in java have one overall type as in you ll always have a collection of number s array of persondata s arraylist of string s etc. and not collection of int s and double s so no matter the actual type of whatever s inside all the compiler knows that the type of the object you ll get out of the collection is the type of that collection

24299334
int	double
it doesn t know if the first element is an int double long etc

24309903
width	height
1 even though i ve defined a height and width for my image its size seems to change across browsers

24309903
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome the defined polygons are the perfect size but in firefox they are way too small

24309920
post	get
use facebook 3.0 php-sdk first argument requires an endpoint me feed me photos while the second is the method get post and delete and the third is an array of parameters you want to send along with the call so try

24309948
width	height
you can simplify your css using display table and setting a height width on the parent element

24310076
getter	setter
but any attempt to add a var to the extension is presented with errors about how i need to provide setter and getter

24310114
hash	md5
basically i m calculating the md5 of some data coming in via stdin which is being stored in the application and i want to store my hash calcs in the objinfo area of objattr

24310114
hash	md5
i want to include the algorithm used md5 sha1 etc with the resulting hash so that when i retrieve that data i can re-run the digest to make sure that i still get the same hash

24310140

24310202
postgresql	mysql
if when you move from sqlite to a dbm like mysql or postgresql you ll find that same technique will work well

24310208
portrait	landscape
when i go to view it in landscape on an iphone 5 or lg g2 the pixel density causes the page to be displayed in the small portrait view

24310225
hide	show
it d be safer to change those toggle for either show or hide depending on the case

24310258
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this error comes in google-chrome and rest of the browsers - firefox and safari it works fine

24310283
opencart	joomla
i was looking for this solution for opencart but actually i discovered that you can just use joomla 3 s default forgot password link on the user login page

24310283
opencart	joomla
when you do this it ll change the joomla user s password and opencart customer s password

24310283
opencart	joomla
so i am just going to redirect opencart s forgot password links to the joomla one

24310303
width	height
my best guess is that setting the width of the image to 200px and leaving the height unspecified is causing the browser to calculate the height of the image

24310337
websphere	ibm
recently ibm packaged websphere mq 7.5 inside of ibm integration bus v9

24310337

24310398
versioning	upgrade
as far as i remember with old versioning of redis and 2.4 is quite old - you should really upgrade it was unbounded meaning that if you transfer a big object at a point the communication buffer associated to this client connection will grow and never shrink

24310430
pull	push
if i clone from tfs then the features are available but i do not want push pull to happen directly against the tfs server

24310431
pull	push
by renaming the origin remote the existing branches had their tracking updated appropriately so push pull on those branches will happen against mirror

24310431
pull	push
if you cloned from tfs but want a different remote the mirror to be the default for push pull

24310431
pull	push
then it makes the master branch track mirror master instead of origin master which will cause visual studio to use mirror when you click push or pull in visual studio

24310431
pull	push
you will need to repeat the last line of the above for every other existing local branch that you want to have push pull to the mirror rather than the tfs server

24310455
firefox	safari	opera	firefox	opera	safari
this works perfect in my project on firefox opera and safari

when you used .next it is targeting the second li not content div so nothing show or hide

24310570
width	height
w h are the width and height of the bounding box

24310597
google-chrome	firefox
firefox is the same as google-chrome but obviously it fires animationiteration events instead of webkitanimationiteration

24310632
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
basically i want the invocation to be passed down if a class inherited a method and the method in the superclass is called it will be called in the subclassing as well

24310633
folder	directory
however i want to be able to have the repos directory placed directly at the root of the cygwin folder not under a home folder -

24310639
barcode4j	barbecue
barbecue seems to have the same issues so i don t imagine using it as opposed to barcode4j will solve this issue

24310651
portrait	landscape
one of our requirements is to build a report where the first page is landscape and has many text fields on them 2 of which if the text overflows need to continue onto 2 different reports both portrait

24310687
width	height
i am trying to create a kpi dashboard which has its displays each in their own tiles these tiles are of a static width and height in the examples provided these are 200px

24310687

the website that these are being placed has the content in a with the css attributes margin auto and width 80 this has been done to allow users with widescreens to benefit from an increased width of content

24310695
public	protected
access control public private protected controls whether a piece of code can legally refer to a name of a class s member

24310747
portrait	landscape
if a document has breaks in it where page 1-5 is portrait page 6 in landscape and page 7- is portrait again my code ignores that fact and adds all pages in portrait

24310769
superclass	subclassing
it s not quite that easy to invoke your subclassing from the superclass because not all subclassing may behave in the same way so a generic keyword for that functionality would wreak havoc

24310769
superclass	subclassing
just define the most generic similarities that all subclassing have in common in the superclass then simply start each subclassing definition of the method with super

24310778
superclass	subclassing
if the subclassing wishes to also invoke the immediate superclass method that is accomplished via a call to super

24310821
post	get
however if you view the post from a browser and click on link i get an error

24310861
superclass	subclassing
hence you require your subclassing to define a function that you can call from the superclass

24310869
int	chars
that would let you index into each line by int chars position and get the chars at that position along with the associated styles as an object

24310873
width	height
match_parent formerly fill_parent using this property for layout width or height will expand the view to the parents width or height minus margins

24310873
width	height
wrap_content using this property for layout width or height will allow the view to take as much space required or available if it exceeds screen dimension exception is inside scrollable views

24310873
width	height
so for your tag set both width and height to match_parent

24310873
width	height
and in the custom row that you might be populating set the root layout width to match_parent and height to wrap_content

24310960
for-loop	loops
i used a for-loop here but you can use a while loops if you would like

24310976
equals	gethashcode
the equals and gethashcode methods of datarow are not based on the values of each row but on the object s reference

24311006
crypt	salt
the crypt function takes a salt as the second argument

24311006
hash	salt
when comparing against a hash you should give it the full original hash and it ll extract the salt from it.

24311018
width	margin
you need to add a width to your second containing div then you ll be able to use margin auto to center it

24311034
int	double
you could also cast the int to float or double as you do in your qdebug statement

24311099
implements	sealed
from any class-type s to any interface-type t provided s is not sealed and provided s does not implements t

24311105

i have an entitymanager class which creates specialized entities by attaching the correct set of properties to them in accordance with an entitytemplate that can be loaded from file

24311166
entities	entitymanager
the entitymanager expects strings like graphicsproperty inputproperty etc and then selects which property to attach to newly created entities based on that

24311199
min	max
g t returns a value in the closed interval g min g max

24311228
ssl	https
if you are linking from an https page to another domain with https they need a valid ssl certificate

24311263
filtering	grouping
another option is to pass it as get param and in your function use request.get to check if you have the grouping and if so filtering further

24311270
folder	directory
word of warning if you put config files in your web-inf classes folder and your ide say eclipse does a clean rebuild it will nuke your conf files unless they were in the java source directory

24311270
folder	dir
in my case i had added a linked source dir from our pojo java library it would compile to the web-inf classes folder

24311271
button	checkbox
the same thing will occur if we deal with checkbox which means that element type on an array of radios or checkbox button cannot be determined without specifying an index

24311322
google-chrome	safari
mac google-chrome and safari will be also fine could you any body help me on this

24311336
min	max
however not all images have the same amount of matches with the rest in the image set applies tenfold if you have done some additional filtering to ensure reliable matches for example by exploiting the properties of the homography ratio test min max distance check etc.

debian	linux
i am on 64 bit debian linux

24311471
oncreate	findviewbyid
if you want to use a more complex layout r.layout_blabla and show the message like it seems to be your case as the text view is in that layout reference it from the oncreate by findviewbyid instead of create a new textview

24311495
jar	war
this page documents the names of the jar and war files that weblogic uses for loading jersey

24311523
post	get
i have read some other so post about cross-domain request issues but i don t understand the solutions or what the difference is between sending the get from my code or from the browser

24311538
folder	directory
it is not possible to do the folder rename directly within the for-loop as it is not possible to rename a folder while it is the current working directory for a running process

24311538
folder	directory
each folder is the current working directory for the batch process while for is running

24311538
folder	directory
the command cd in third line just makes sure that the working directory is set to parent folder of all the subfolders to rename to avoid that renaming a folder fails because the batch file is started from one of the subfolders

24311693
getter	setter
you can make fields immutable by making their setter private and exposing only their getter as public methods

24311723
children	parent
whilst this could be achieved with floats i prefer using inline-block on children then text-align center on the parent

24311740
jboss	weblogic
i m trying to migrate an application from weblogic 11g to jboss 7.1

24311849
mergesort	in-place
mergesort can be done in-place for list

24311872
filtering	grouping
you can use user-defined variables to rank each record per ticker grouping and in outer select just filtering them by rank

24311882
getter	setter
i can t find any setter or getter to do that

24311929
ssl	https
i see a lot of information regarding ssl for python and i not sure if i need those modules and python setup to make https work

24311931
google-chrome	firefox
same result on google-chrome and firefox on mac os x

24311935
kivy	buildozer
ps i have tried also starting the app from kivy launcher without the previous .apk compiling but i have got the same result so i think that it would be a trouble of the python code or the kv language code not a trouble in the process of packaging the app with the buildozer tool

24311938
division	addition
the reason the result is incorrect is that division takes precedence over addition your program needs to divide b by y and c by z before adding them to the result of division of a by x which is float

24311942
getter	setter
i have read somewhere that the private properties of the inner class are accessed using synthetic setter getter methods from outer class

24311958
hide	show
which means i would have load all the content boxes first and then show and hide div s that are tagged to the dropdown value

24311959

24311981
put	get
simply put i have no way of telling where the image will be placed when it needs to be moved but it needs to move left for a distance that i guess i ll be able to define once i get it moving left

24312062
apache	nginx
typically the ssl part for python web app is managed by some frontend web server like nginx apache or so

24312062
apache	nginx
if you want to run pure python solution i would recommend using cherrypy which is able providing rather reliable and performant web server part it will be very likely slower then served behind nginx or apache

24312073
express	node.js
i have an express app with node.js that

24312092
int	chars
this came up during the testing of web application where time of the day is allowed to be entered manually date hh and mm in separate asp.net textbox controls and chars were not initially limited to be only digits asp .net validator control accepts -0 to be an int in 0..23 range

24312094
background-repeat	background-size
in order to make the image cover the background of the body element you need to make its background-size 100 100 and background-repeat no-repeat if the background is set to repeat the browser repeats the image instead of stretching it

24312223
width	height
but as soon as i in any step declare a height width in the keyframes the rotation stops working

24312223
width	height
it will still scale as it should and the height width properties are applied but the rotation is skipped entirely

24312223
width	height
now scroll down in the css and comment out the height width properties and you ll see that the rotation now suddenly works

24312223
width	height
i ve tried different combinations of having not having height width declared in the normal selector not in the keyframe i ve also tried putting the height width declarations in different steps in the keyframes

24312223
google-chrome	firefox
i get the same result in both firefox in google-chrome

24312233
width	height
i am trying to design a website with a background image that should stretch in height and width

24312263
width	height
inline elements are things like b or span - usually text styling elements with no width and height

24312263
width	height
images behave as block-inline which is similar to a block but with a width and height

24312278
width	height
i have a custom view i m making which has a fixed proportion between width and height

24312278
width	height
i want the programmer to set the height and i would like the view to set its own width according to a formula based on height

24312278
width	height
i don t know how to do it in the onmeasure hook because the view s width and height are not available at that time

24312290
post	get
dosales is an action in the restaurant controller which has both get and post parts but i only wish to call the get part and refresh the page at the same time or else i would have used ajax or json when the user clicks on any of the options in the drop down that was generated

24312306
width	height
as long as you specify an explicit height pixels and do not specify a width this property should cause the background-image to resize while maintaining aspect ratio

24312350
paperclip	fog
it all works fine for local storage but i am trying to make it work using paperclip s fog support to store files in a bucket on our own ceph cluster

24312508

children	parent
any child context can see beans from its ancestors but not from other child context as well as the parent context can t see bean in your children

24312763
width	height
a better solution would be to create some sort of polygon the width of which might be adjusted by the height and size of the plane

24312799
width	height
to get the width and height of the texture you can use sdl_querytexture and create the sdl_rect using that

24312803
slider	slidesjs
i have a slidesjs slider show that uses 3 images when you click on an image it changes text in a slider container

24313112
bash	subshell
as far as i know you cannot really modify the executing process environment from a subprocess or subshell be it python or bash itself

24313112
bash	subshell
for instance if you run bash from inside your terminal session and export a new environment variable once you exit that subshell your original shell will be untouched

acs	adfs
i have an mvc application that uses azure adfs and azure acs for authentication

24331149
floating-point	integer
when a floating-point value is assigned to an integer variable it is rounded towards zero not towards the nearest integer

24331165
hide	show
to achieve that i m simply using ng-show to hide the graph s element until we get the ajax data at which point ng-show will evaluate to false and the graph will show

24331165
ng-show	ng-hide
so it seems hiding the element using ng-show ng-hide breaks css animations

24331178
apache	nginx
Ã¢ configure server apache nginx to prevent accessing configuration

24331184
width	height
a div with fixed width and height and more text than can fit in it will create scrolls

24331187
folder	directory
the command rd is used to first remove the target directory on removable media before copying the files from source directory to avoid a mixture of new and old folder and files

24331238
put	get
when i go to my job and put api at the end i get the following text

24331244
post	put
this won t conflict with another activeadmin.register post and would allow you to put a scope on the post s or something like that

24331248
uiview	uipangesturerecognizer
i ve got a uiview to which i add a uipangesturerecognizer in order to be able to move it to some extent vertically on the screen

24331248
width	height
just above it on the screen is placed a uiimageview whose top edge s position and width are meant to maintain their values but its height is supposed to be changed depending on the position of the self.viewmenuproper so that it seems like it connects that uiview with some point at the top of the screen even when the uiview is moved around

24331248
children	parent
edit both the uiview and the uiimageview are children of the same parent uiview - they re not connected to one another in the .xib file where i created their layout

24331350
public	protected
because i need to access the data members of this class from my own code i have modified protected to public

24331350
public	protected
therefore my conclusion is that key words such as public protected and private does not go into the compiled code

24331350
public	protected
we can change private and protected to public in order to access the class data members

24331386
mp4	h.264
we are building a completely web-based system for recording video questions and answers and due to a number of details that i don t fully understand can t get into our video recorder is a flash element that records to an mp4 with h.264 and speex codecs

24331386
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox the audio starts playing about a second into the the track while the video plays normally

24331386
google-chrome	firefox
it does not appear that the flash fallback is being used for any of the browsers i am testing in ie11 firefox and google-chrome so i don t think it s a flash issue

24331386
mp4	h.264	google-chrome	firefox
according to this documentation google-chrome and firefox should not have any issues with h.264 and aac in mp4

i am trying to have jradiobutton and jcheckbox that respond to right mouse clicks as well as left mouse clicks

24331427
namedtuple	dictionary
which to me appears to best reflect the dictionary aspect of the nature of namedtuple

24331473
cos	sin
just use sin and cos separately and turn on optimizations

24331473
cos	sin
the compiler will probably optimize away any calls to sin or cos in favour of simply using sse intructions to calculate it

24331483
background-color	transparency
background-color transparency

24331512
maya	blender
software like blender and maya add layers of abstraction on top of this making them easier and more intuitive to use

24331512
maya	blender
the approaches are also different whereas using opengl involves writing function calls in order to do things like render polygons to the screen software like maya and blender are instead interacted with through a gui where you create the vertices through point and click

24331512
maya	blender
instead it s usually used for taking data representing models created in another program such as maya or blender and rendering these to the screen

24331512
maya	blender
maya and blender still rely on opengl for actually rendering stuff on screen or directx could also be used as do all programs which require drawing stuff on screen

24331565
gif	png
i want to determine if a puush.me image links are no html just the image is png jpg or gif

24331575
folder	directory
the safe bet here would be for you to delete the wordpress folder in the htdocs directory untar it again there and from the browser go to localhost wordpress-folder-name and follow the wizard

24331601
post	get
how can i get current view state name in grails web flow plug-in i am trying to follow this post but i can not get it to work in my app i am getting this error message

24331603
hide	show
finally implement hideloadingdisplaytable formid function to hide loading indicator and show table with javascript

24331608
background-color	transparency	margin	background-color
so in your case you get margin 0em and background-color transparency

24331610
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
this usually means it supports property and collection changed notification through the inotifypropertychanged and inotifycollectionchanged interfaces

24331610
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifydataerrorinfo	inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
sometimes you will need to work with model objects that do not implement the inotifypropertychanged inotifycollectionchanged idataerrorinfo or inotifydataerrorinfo interfaces

24331632
devise	cancan
i am using devise and cancan

24331720
for-loop	arrays
wrapping the assignment in parenthesis makes sure the assignment doesn t turn into a boolean value and then or ing that assignment s result with true makes sure that an element in the arrays that evaluates to false doesn t break your for-loop

24331771
width	height
it s obvious in a malloc call that the sizeof type must be included but i totally missed it in calls of the type allocate width height

24331771
width	height
so given an image of dimensions width x height in pixels this is how it comes together

24331771
width	height
the only wasted threads here are for the cases where the width or height are not multiples of the number of threads per block

24331821
actualheight	actualwidth
then the actualwidth and actualheight properties directly return the actual size of the control

24331845
post	get
so get and post needs an json root such as

24331852
min	max
the problem with priority queue is that you would need to have one for the max values and one for the min values

24331864
google-chrome	firefox
when i am tring to inspect an element of html in google-chrome it s showing the less file whereas firefox is showing css file

24331870

the jdesktoppane is within a jpanel that has the borderlayout layout

24331914
int	chars
i wanted to split every chars in the input and store each int in the input into a single element in array ary that s why i m getting this error

24331945
google-chrome	firefox
this works great in firefox but in google-chrome it only gets 1 image and sets it for all the users

24331959
uninstall	upgrade
i ve seen this done by having the upgrade get the uninstall string from the registry where there should be a command you can use since it s not msi-based

24332004
ogre	irrlicht
cegui can easily be enhanced and be used with direct3d opengl ogre engine irrlicht engine and can also be integrated into any other engine using opengl or direct3d

24332049
public	protected
when you extend a class there is access to the public and protected methods and variables

24332057
getter	setter
or you can also create getter and setter methods for rect

24332067
inherited	properties
extends basically allows the class to inherited attributes methods and properties of the parent class but not private variables

24332112
google-chrome	firefox
using google-chrome and firefox you get same results

24332125
implements	extends

24332126
centos	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	linux
so docker does not only abstract the hardware by using linux it also abstracts the operating system by providing the same environment on different machines you can have an ubuntu container running on an centos machine

24332180
post	get
http verb attributes are mutually exclusive a request cannot be both get and post at the same time

24332271
post	get
the default schema.xml doesn t seem to index the author field properly--i get no results when i search for an author name but i do get results when i search for a post name

24332293
width	height
well actually since there are two parallel pairs of vectors you can simplify the calculation further you only need two non-parallel vectors and get the width and height with the following formula

24332335
width	height
you can give height and width to dev.new

24332335
width	height
if you re saving the plot then whatever method you re using has height and width arguments and this is where a programmatic approach makes the most sense

24332340
super	extends
you can extends the features of super class but accessing methods and variables depend on super classes access modifiers

24332385
pull	push
and whenever you or the other person push it gets synced with the remote branch and the other person gets the changes while pull ing

24332452
portrait	landscape
all ipads are regular-x-regular in any orientation but an iphone s size classes change on orientation from regular h -x-compact w in portrait to compact-x-compact in landscape

i also read out about the apc extension and some memcached but i didn t try that one yet

24332481
express	node.js
i m converting php templates over to ejs in node.js express

24332486
int	double
because java will convert 5 from an int to the double that a double constructor will take

24332503
swift	objective-c
swift protocols don t map as types into objective-c

24332503
swift	objective-c
so your swift function defined that way doesn t magically map upward into objective-c as it has nothing to map to

24332503
swift	objective-c
i was afraid that a swift class that uses any non-objective-c features wouldn t map to an objective-c class at all

24332503
swift	objective-c
but on the contrary you can use all the pure-swift features you like and they simply don t map up into objective-c they are cleanly filtered out and those parts of your swift class that do map into objective-c work just fine from objective-c

24332507
pop-up	dialog
dialog.html is the jqm dialog page that has a single input which the mobiscroll library turns into a pop-up scroller for selecting numbers

24332530
post	get
you could use one off tools to get the list of styles that are not being used from this post

24332590
integer	unsigned
however gzip does store the uncompressed file size as a little-endian 32-bit unsigned integer at the very end of the file

24332663
folder	directory
images are almost always linked relative to the root directory meaning your browser is not going to be able to find them unless you saved the images in the same folder structure as the website

24332675
children	parent
i am trying to return just the parent where the set of children contain multiple specific records

24332681
matplotlib	scipy	debian	linux
is there a way to build a stable python numpy scipy matplotlib 1 pandas environment on linux debian

24332688
folder	directory
instead we have a classic asp page that loops through all of our directory and files using the scripting.filesystemobject and excludes includes files folder and generates a large list of hyperlinks in a page that google can then query

24332701
button	checkbox
is is possible to change the default so that non-baselayers also appear with radio button instead of checkbox

24332789
vim	notepad++
you have to get vim although notepad++ may also work

24332812
qdap	stringi	stringr	qdap	stringr	stringi
this may be a good solution but it relies on a function regcapturematches that is not in base r or another package such as qdap or stringi or stringr

24332814
range	max
would this be a feature implemented statically in the hardware or could i allow the user to set the max connectivity range of the product

24332832
rss	feed
and the second one is supposed to parse the rss feed to find zip filenames

triples	stardog
i am using stardog to store a bunch of triples that come from different sources

24332922
triples	stardog
i am considering options to load the jena graph varies between 1 and 7 million triples into stardog

24332922
triples	stardog
another option is to load the triples one by one example of stardog sparql insert query in java which i dislike for potential inefficiency

24332933
width	height
set the height and width to what your specifications are i just picked random ones

24333004
int	double
in above statement widening is happening from primitive int to double

24333004
int	double
wrapper class constructor used and passed with int type value 5 but returns wrapper class double reference d with reference to value 5.0 as jvm will do widening on int type value 5 and return double type 5.0 which gets used by wrapper class double constructor

24333004
int	double
but is erroneous as int type value 5 can not be auto boxed to double type value and referenced by double type reference variable

24333012
hide	show
i m looking for a js that filters the rows hide and show depending on the selection of the ddl

24333036
post	get
i am issuing the following login api request using fiddler to a sugar 6.5.4 server and all i ever get back with a post request is the documentation for sugarwebserviceimplv4_1.php

24333144
subtract	add
then i get a date i need to display for the user add subtract their timezone value

24333163
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
what i d really like to know for sure for future cases is whether subclassing automatically inherited their superclass constructors if they the subclassing don t define their own kind of like how they inherited other methods from the superclass

24333222
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
works fine in google-chrome and opera doesn t show all options in firefox only first option is displayed

24333223
inherited	subclassing
am i correct in thinking that subclassing will automatically inherited

24333224
spaces	delimiter
assuming t is one long string the delimiter is white spaces and you know the number of columns

24333224
spaces	delimiter
this is assuming the delimiter is white spaces and constant

24333224
spaces	delimiter
textscan doesn t allow you to stack whitespace as a delimiter so it throws a nan after each white spaces character if there isn t data present

24333242
int	double
int and double are said to be supported so what could i be doing wrong here

24333247
min	max
in order to perform a real normalization you ll probably have to compute all possible values first then compute the min max of these values and afterwards normalize all values based on these min max values

24333262
int	boolean
if biginteger is your own custom class you could add a boolean property that determines whether the int is positive or negative

24333275
int	double	getter	setter
you would need to define getter setter for your int double properties

24333287
explode	implode
note i could also separate these by spaces and use implode explode but the question remains the same

24333287
int	chars
also let s reduce the number of random int numbers to 12 so we can fix the serialized string with between 512 to 1024 chars

24333313
ssl	https
in my opinion the key terms you should definitely take into consideration are https ssl certificate rest oauth

24333346
associativity	operator-precedence
7.3.1 operator-precedence and associativity

24333351
sorting	filtering
meaning if you know you re going to be sorting on a field using a filtering later on you will index that particular field without doing any analysis on it

24333381
hide	show	slideup	slidedown
when i add a new row to the datatable the div is hidden then i hide and show slideup slidedown on a click event

24333399
src	attr
i m posting this answer because someone else may want to do it this way and hopefully one day we ll be able to use background-image attr src url

24333433
min	max
the first element in each heap is then the min max of all values

24333455
int	chars
you can even change the type of your lists to int if you want by writing a converter from chars to int

24333458
required	placeholder
error default initialization of an object of const type const placeholder 0 required a user-provided default constructor

24333473
next	except
a block has some whitespace above and below it and tolerates no html elements next to it except when ordered otherwise by adding a float declaration to another element for instance

24333525
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	opera	safari
if you haven t done so already download the latest versions of firefox google-chrome ie safari and opera to test your pages

24333525
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
as far as i know safari google-chrome and opera use the webkit rendering engine but there are still slight differences in how they are displayed

24333530
notepad++	sublimetext
if somebody else has a better udl for netlogo in sublimetext or notepad++ please let me know and if someone knows how to add the autocomplete functionality in a udl like closing a or or following a to with an end that would also be a great added benefit

24333531
min	max
you need a min-max heap which is like a min or max heap but odd rows are min s of their children and even rows are max s of their children

24333531
min	max
you can get the second-smallest or second-largest by looking at the children of min or max nodes which can be found in constant time because they re right there at the top of the heap

24333538
swift	objective-c
if you want to show in log like as objective-c does using nslog then in swift language you can do this way

24333551
post	get
this sends post info to another php page so i get something like this on the url

24333568
openacc	pgi
i need to use pgi to start using openacc for this code

24333645
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
the second idea i had was to just make all of the variables fields of the superclass and have them be inherited by the subclassing

24333679
rsa	aes
but if you use public key encryption to encrypt messages you are a limited to small messages -- a 1024 bit rsa key encrypts less than 128 bytes and b going to pay in performance because public key encryption is much more costly than symmetric key encryption such as aes encryption

24333684
post	get
i want to get the data from the value of the table column here i have one photos one post these are different tables

24333707
width	height
this will allow the control to fill the whole container but have a minimum width and height of 500px

24333707
min	max
change the following resizable call to not specify the min max

24333722
children	parent
whether you have a parent property on the child or a children property on the parent should depend on what your code needs to do

24333758
int	double
in this case even when you explicitly cast value to int the other value is a double so binary numeric promotion occurs and the int is re-promoted to double

24333758
int	chars
if one of the operands is of type t where t is byte short or chars and the other operand is a constant expression Ã¢ 15.28 of type int whose value is representable in type t then the type of the conditional expression is t

24333758
int	chars
if one of the operands is of type t where t is byte short or chars and the other operand is a constant expression of type int whose value is representable in the type u which is the result of applying unboxing conversion to t then the type of the conditional expression is u

24333760
int	double
however the difference is that with the conditional operator the type of the conditional expression is double - the type of the second operand is int due to the cast and the type of the third operand is double

24333760
int	double
the conditional operator can only have one type so it follows the rules in the jls and picks double as int is implicitly convertible to double but not vice versa

24333768
post	get
most probably table setups for photos and post are different so you can t get them in a single resultset

24333820
getter	setter
another method loads and parses an xml file and creates an object that has specific getter and setter for the settings that it finds in the file server port title etc.

24333834
nsoperationqueue	nsurlsession
b no nsurlsession and nsoperationqueue has nothing for comparison

24333834
nsoperationqueue	nsurlsession
in fact nsurlsession itself has a property of nsoperationqueue

24333834
nsoperationqueue	nsurlsession	nsurlconnection	nsurlsession	nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue
nsurlsession is a replacement-api for nsurlconnection not nsoperationqueue

24333834
nsoperationqueue	nsurlsession
every nsurlsession object has its own nsoperationqueue to perform its tasks concurrently

24333834
nsoperationqueue	nsurlsession	nsurlconnection	nsurlsession	nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue
e again this is a wrong comparison nsurlsession is not replacement or equivalent for nsoperationqueue it is replacement for nsurlconnection

qtableview	qsqldatabase
i have a qt application which essentially creates a qmysql database connection using qsqldatabase creates a gridpopulator instance to populate a qtableview with obviously data from the database

24334415
yacc	bison
you need to read the numbers as positive integers treating the leading - as a separate token that is interpreted syntactically by bison yacc as either negation or subtraction depending on context

24334443
width	height
a rectangle is defined as rectangle x y width height

24334461
width	height
furthermore i would like to read the png file to a nx ny 3 array of integers where nx is the width and ny is the height and then do an analysis on the resulting matrix perhaps making changes including resizing the matrix and then write the resulting matrix to a separate png file

24334480
shiny	googlevis
i am trying to display a simple gauge using the googlevis library in r shiny

24334480
width	height
however - the only thing that i can get to display is a blank space that matches with the width and height of the invisible gauge

24334487
client-side	server-side
any workaround on the client-side won t help as the server-side does not support it at all

24334495

i am dynamically generating 3 divs each with a ul that has draggable elements and the ul themselves are droppable

24334511
width	height
first when you have your imagebutton click in graphiclayout background set drawable and pick your image from folder i think you setting src not background then you can do things like scale type and pick fitxy or change your imagebutton width and height that all

24334562

i have another version of this page which does not employ the for-loop but instead calls data arrays from the backing bean for each city - that version works fine but i won t be able to do that in final implementation since all data will have to be pulled dynamically

getter	setter
for all your getter setter you will need to define them as privileged and add them to this otherwise there isn t much point in creating getter setter if you plan on leaving them private

24334979
getter	setter
if you do a lot of heavy lifting inside the constructor of your object this could be a valid reason to create a reusable getter setter method but that really depends on your use case

24335082
alexa	amazon
not exactly what you ask for but amazon s alexa publishes a csv with one million domains regularly

yo ll need to understand the mapping of basic types such as boolean string int but it s fairly obvious

24335123

put it another way both examples have the same query statement why is it that the console.log statements in example 1 have to wait for the query to complete before they get executed

24335630

your new prototype object doesn t have that constructor properties and instead has its own constructor properties inherited from object.prototype

24335698
public	protected
usually you should not test private methods of classes but only the public interface then using any sort of reflection for this purpose in my opinion is completely the wrong approach anyway in .net there is a system to test protected internal methods with internalsvisibletoattribute decorate your under test class with

24335705
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
anyway everything displays and submits fine on google-chrome and safari but on ie10 and firefox the recaptcha box simply doesn t show up client-side

post	get
fyi i have watched youtube videos and read a few other post here nothing seems to explain the basics simply and thoroughly so i thought a forum post would get better explanations

24336146
hash	salt
the salt has to be part of the password before you hash it

24336146
hash	salt
and then you need to return the hash password and the salt so that you can do proper comparisons later

24336261
post	get
first off having tests depend on each other is typically bad practice but i realise this is a purest view and that if it is really so slow to get to that state that you have to continue on then i would say you should have a look at the answers provided over on this post personally i would pick the second option as annotations make it nice and explicit

24336262
google-chrome	firefox

since you re getting the connect request over a plain socket presumably you re trying to upgrade that socket to an sslsocket afterwards which you can indeed to with sslsocketfactory.createsocket socket s string host int port boolean autoclose

24337752
put	get
since you re generating your new certificate on the fly by putting the hostname you get via connect into its cn by the way it would be better in a san you can quite easily create a keystore instance in memory and put that cert and its private key into it

i assume itÃ¢ s because once i issue the quit command to the qcoreapplication i should be waiting for a little while for it to close down the event loop properly before deleting it - just as one would usually call quit and then wait on an ordinary qthread before deleting it

24346017
qtimer	qcoreapplication
however qcoreapplication doesnÃ¢ t seem to have the equivalent of a wait command and i canÃ¢ t implement a qtimer to force a delay because it wouldnÃ¢ t work once iÃ¢ ve closed down the event loop with quit

as tmyklebu mentioned square root is also defined by ieee 754 so it is possible to guarantee same result for same input for add subtract multiplying divide and square root

24352333
public	protected
this is the same behavior that you have in c# derived classes have access to all methods of their base class as long as their visibility public protected internal etc. allows for it

24352341
width	height	google-chrome	firefox
the element inspector in both google-chrome and firefox tell me that both middle and inner have the correct width and height and indeed the horizontal positioning is working correctly but for some reason the top -50 rule is ignored

24352354
portrait	landscape
if i rotate then to landscape all appears fine rotate back to portrait and the master back button appears and can then access the master table view

24352370
int	chars
i guess unsigned chars gets promoted here but unsigned int doesn t

24352370
int	chars
result type of chars + unsigned int seems to be unsigned int and result type of chars + int seems to be int

24352386
min	max
i think you need to calculate the max and min values in a sub-query

24352397
post	get
a post request is similar to a get request

gtk	pygobject
i m going to assume that you are using pygobject gtk 3.x based on the fact that you re gtk instead of gtk

24352419
post	get
if your task is to detect post by sexual predators on a children s forum you definitely do not want to miss any of them even if the price is that a few post will get incorrectly flagged

24352425
screens	tablet
only problem is it doesn t fit small screens phones tablet etc. so i would recommend using bootstrap

24352450
floating-point	integer
they are described in the c11 standard at clause 6.3.1.8 which is too long to quote in full it also handles the conversion from integer type to floating-point type when the program contains 1 + 1.0

24352450
integer	unsigned
have unsigned integer types the operand with the type of lesser

24352450
integer	unsigned
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type

24352450

24352483
integer	unsigned
otherwise if both operands have signed integer types or both have unsigned

24352483
integer	unsigned
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or

24352483
integer	unsigned
signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned

24352483
integer	unsigned
all of the values of the type of the operand with unsigned integer type then

24352483
integer	unsigned
the operand with unsigned integer type is converted to the type of the

24352483
integer	unsigned
otherwise both operands are converted to the unsigned integer type

24352490
datediff	difference
i use a few different date functions including datediff which returns the difference between two dates given to a specified interval as well as dateadd does the inverse of that by allowing you to add specified intervals to a date value

24352500
ord	chr
ord gets the ascii value from a character and chr vice versa

24352530
glfw	glew
i m using the libraries glew glfw opengl32 glm

24352542
swift	objective-c
however the app is now slow and laggy and i m thinking that the reason hides in the fact that i m mixing swift with objective-c

24352569
post	get
while sending request post it changed into get because afnetworking send wrong path when server redirect it method has changed into get

24352599
put	get
i bet you wanted to put it after the do to get the value again

24352599
loops	while-loop
to avoid writing the check line twice you could write a while-true loops and check the condition inside and break out of loops since bash has no head-controlled while-loop

24352624
width	height
the offset is a percentage of the containing block s width for left or right or height for top and bottom

google-chrome	firefox
why does this jquery ajax put work in google-chrome but not firefox

24352799
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	opera	safari
i m going to agree somewhat with the person who wrote paraphrased here for a link in an existing web page the browser will always open the link in a new tab if the new page is part of the same web site as the existing web page. for me at least this general rule works in google-chrome firefox opera ie safari seamonkey and konqueror

24352800
put	get
i managed to implement some code which will execute get method though very slow it takes about 20-30 seconds to get data from server but i have problems with put method

24352800
put	get
i checked if this is due to some error with the server but i think is not because i managed to get appropriate response when i m using code similar to the code from android developers and also when i m trying to execute put to the same url from restclient in chrome

24352815

hide	show
i have a working code for populating states drop down list with an array based on country drop down list selected value and i would like to add something like jquery show and hide to hide the states drop down if the country is not included in the array of countrystatearray and do the opposite while populating the states list

24352900
portrait	landscape
the problem i m having is that when i when i try to take a photo using the android photo intent in portrait mode it saves it in landscape orientation

24352900
portrait	landscape
i found this question android camera intent saving image landscape when taken portrait which is the exact same problem i m having but the answer is incomplete and didn t work for me

24353017
width	height
then set your width and height to 100 and your preserveaspectratio to none

24353017
width	height
this second option will give you a drawing area of 1000x1000 and will automatically stretch that area to fill the width and height of your parent object ie your page

24353020
portrait	landscape
well some cameras lock the landscape mode as default mode of camera samsung note 2 so if you take a picture in portrait mode the image is still saved in landscape mode

24353020
width	height
it is a class that provides methods to change the behaviour of bitmaps like making it mutable is set to true you can apply effects like grayscale to this bitmap find its height and width in pixels without loading it to ram etc

24353048
post	put
i m not sure if your workaround is correct in the land of put vs post

24353048
post	put
dr put should define the resource by request-uri but we don t do that during creation so we shouldn t be using a post

24353048
post	put
the fundamental difference between the post and put requests is

24353091
portrait	landscape
its fine on mobile on a nexus 4 anyway and on a nexus 7 in portrait mode but even in landscape on a nexus 7 it s all wrong

squash	merge
if this is a one-time merge i would squash your development into master and remove the .htaccess at that time

24353134
post	get
or you ll have a get request that retrieves a json array of recent blog post

24353157
post	get
get and post are supposed to be two different verbs and their purpose is different

24353157
post	get
are there any good reasons why a get parameters should be part of the url string and post parameters should be part of the body of the request

24353165
pop-up	dialog
when a modal dialog pop-up then the background will be the last active page

24353165
pop-up	dialog
and the modal dialog pop-up

24353165
pop-up	dialog
and the modal dialog pop-up

24353198
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
add the setcontentsize to viewwillappear or viewdidappear

24353212
comparator	comparable
as a result comparator is based on the remaining delay time while equals is based on the payload of the queued objects so they are not consistent as is strongly recommended in the javadoc of comparable

24353254
swift	objective-c
i just started learning apple swift i can not deal with the problem i have methods to help objective-c please rewrite on apple swift

24353264
accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
edit i also noticed that in this class if i add any properties accessor method it complains about the ivar

24353267
installation	upgrade
naturally i want to use wheels to speed up package upgrade and installation across the virtualenv s

24353273
post	get
you do have the choice to encode the parameter as a query string or in the request body that is why we have post or get

24353273
post	get
so when you ask why get is encoded as a query string does not make sense because if they are not then they would become post parameters

24353278
int	double
all javascript numbers are ieee double precision floating point numbers double and those can represent 53-bit int at most

24353278
int	double
so you shouldn t even be trying to parse the int yourself unless you know for a fact that the result would fit into a double

24353278
integer	unsigned
if you need the result but are not sure it is a 32-bit unsigned integer you can detect if you re dealing with 32 bit unsigned integers that are just packed into uint64

24353280
hash	salt
is is a hash a salt

24353294
oncreate	ondestroy
when the change the screen orientation the system will restart the activity calls ondestroy and then oncreate

24353320
int	chars	for-loop	arrays
i m trying to create a for-loop which checks if a member of my chars arrays is the ascii value i m looking for a 97 d 100 g 103 and so on and if it is add 5 to an int value i have however my code isn t working but i can t figure out why

24353324
getter	setter
if you override both the setter and getter of a property the compiler will not automatically synthesize the backing ivar for you

24353372
post	get
a post has broader application and is generally used to send persistent data to a server in fact prescriptively get should not be used for this purpose

24353372
post	get
the use of body for post and url for get is really for consistency of convention and reflects the different needs of the respective use cases

24353372
post	get
there is no reason that post couldn t use the url to encode information except that there are many cases in which the url would not be suitable for post content and so for consistency of convention the body is used for post while get is restricted to url to reflect the implied functional contract of retrieving content from a specific provider given a set of input parameters

24353402
put	get
even when i put the above code snippets a b directly into my oncreate method i get the same result

24353406
firefox	safari
ie firefox and safari all work fine

24353415
keydown	keyup
keyup and keydown won t do

24353421
width	height
if it s only about displaying filled rectangles you might put the whole thing in a viewbox with fixed width and height and stretch set to fill

24353446
nstableview	nsviewcontroller
i have an nstableview that when you click a specific row opens a segue that goes to a popover that contains an nsviewcontroller

24353454
width	height
also you needed to use px after height and width

24353487
post	get
when i start httpd varnish and pound on the guest httpd listens to 8080 varnish to 80 and pound to 443 i can get http site http site 8080 but no https site had to remove or can t post it where a wget from guest works response 200 with expected html

24353504
strncmp	strcmp
make certain you use strncmp and not strcmp

24353550
hide	show
i display about 10 filters and i want to show only 5 and hide 5 i can do that in jquery with .show hide

24353591
min	max
this code show max and min number of lines in a directory but doesn t list files with min or max number of lines

24353646
prepare	execute
i execute the prepare statement

24353665
oncreate	onstart
if the time between oncreate and onresume is shorter then a threshold i use 1s assuming oncreate could be finished within 1s which we really wanted for the good programming practice then we believe this is the first time the onstart onresume is called right after the oncreate otherwise we believe it is about all the other cases including our motivating case

24353703
width	height
the preload div has no height width since the images are set to background so it doesn t show on the page and the images are ready when you want to swap them on hover

24353703
width	height
you will obviously have to set height width on the anchors

24353714
post	get
both get and post can use parameters in the uri

24353725
hide	show
for this i need a section title which will either hide or show the title s section when user presses on that title

24353734
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition
that might be true for more complicated operations like multiplication and division but for simple addition and subtraction that is not how the cpu works

24353790
min	max
note this works as long as the min is less than the max and the max is greater than equal to nomin+ 2 noincrement

24353790
for-loop	while-loop
also it seems like a for-loop is of greater cost to the compiler than a while-loop

24353834
int	double
i ve got type mismatch cannot convert from double to int info

24353848
single-quotes	double-quotes
ruby doesn t interpret interpolations within single-quotes only within double-quotes

24353868
post	get
sorry somehow i don t get what the problem is and if you are looking for to post to an url but the server will redirect it to another url for example 301 then what you are expecting is to post to actually you should look at this thread afnetworking setredirectresponseblock inside my class nsurlresponse always return null value

24353906
firefox	safari
doesn t work in firefox but works in safari

24353909
post	get
http post is defined by rfcs to include the same url and headers as get as well as to include a postdata section separated from the headers by two newline characters and terminated by two newline characters iirc

24353916
strncmp	memcmp
note that strncmp in this case cannot be replaced with a simple memcmp because you still need to take advantage of its stop-on-nul behavior in case one of the strings is shorter than n

24353919
folder	directory
there is no libreoffice bin directory per-se on linux and unfortunately there are 351 candidate directory i was able to identify on my machine my path and all folder with libreoffice in the name or under a folder with libreoffice in the name

24353927
mathml	mathjax
i am working on an android app that includes some mathml rendered using a local folder of the mathjax 2.3 package

24353943
post	get
i am not able to get the likes and post comments to work.kindly update if there is any problem in code

24353967
explode	implode
the server decodes it for my example explode by a dot divide by constant convert each number to its ascii character and implode the array

24354023
portrait	landscape
i m maintaining a legacy application that uses itext to combine multiple landscape and portrait pdfs

24354023
portrait	landscape
this process is working fine when combining pdfs produced by the same application with other pdfs it renders landscape as portrait and cuts off content

24354059
put	get
so now all you should do is to get the value from ajax put it in a variable and pass it to your plugin as mentioned above

24354115
width	height
the width and height return fine because i defined them for the div but the top and left positions return nan in javascript

24354178
margin	height
the margin -10px is neccessary to compensate the line height after rotation

24354180
profiler	perf
while pi is running perf top sampling based system profiler also shows __ieee754_pow_sse2 taking 60 + of cpu

24354188
int	double
because the lzakupow method returns a double array and you are trying to create a double array of a specific length which must be an int

24354204
hash-collision	key
a hash-collision occurs on insert either because the given key already exists in the hash in which case you should replace the value object reference with the new object or because of the non-uniqueness of the hashing function

24354204
hash-collision	key
you need to provide logic to evaluate equality inequality of two key in order to properly handle the hash-collision case

24354285
portrait	landscape
works fantastically in portrait orientation but when i go into landscape the listview is destroyed and it seems that the array adapter is also empty

24354285
oncreate	recreate
what i don t understand about this solution is that to my understanding onresume is called after oncreate anyway so the listview wold have been recreate already

24354302
division	subtract	division	modulo
also instead of using those convoluted if statements to check r and subtract 10 from s you can just use division and modulo instead and or just

24354303
google-chrome	firefox
here is my cross-browser solution that works on ie google-chrome and firefox

24354306
apache	nginx
secondly for hiding index.php called the entry script in your url in addition to changing configuration here you need to change configuration in your apache nginx server

24354313
passenger	webrick
i have observed it while using webrick on a local machine and with passenger and apache on the production environment

24354346
put	get
since the second activity has to save on a db all my facebook friends and put them in a certain order inside some list view i get a black screen passing from the first activity to the second..

24354451
abstract-class	superclass
this abstract-class is the superclass as you can see with the annotation and 3 mapped classes with entity extends this superclass

24354469
min	max
in your case ydata is the data from fft the xdata is an array that sweep from min to max 2 frequency values of the fft discarding the other half when the signal is a real signal

24354477
width	height
right now the button inherits the height from the headline its width also changes

24354481
folder	directory
in build options search directory compiler i have added usr local lib usr local include opencv and usr local include folder

24354481
folder	directory
same code blocks configuration as before except that i have cleared all the folder in build options search directory linker

24354562
width	height
you can use something like this to get the width and height of the browser

24354596
textview	imageview
three of them are using asynctask parsing html code with jsoup and then adding imageview and textview to my fragments

24354631
portrait	landscape
some of the pages in my bootstrap site is zoomed automatically when orientation has changed from portrait to landscape

24354632
cpu	processors
the differences with unaligned data if any can depend on the particular cpu you are using and i believe that the impact is not as great on recent processors as it was in previous generations

24354665
int	double
and don t name double what is actually an array of int

24354697
swift	objective-c
i m finding it very challenging to structure a mixed swift objective-c ios application to avoid build errors after converting classes to swift

24354697
swift	objective-c
if you use your own objective-c types in your swift code make sure to

24354697
swift	objective-c
swift generated header into the objective-c .m file you want to access

24354697
swift	objective-c
firstly although the documentation is quite explicit about importing the -swift.h file into .m files there are very often references to types from a classes now based in swift code in the .h files of objective-c classes so i end up having to import -swift.h in .h files most of the time

24354722
nsstring	nsdata
but i dnt know how to send nsdata to .net method so i tried to convert this encrypteddata to nsstring unfortunately it gives me nil

24354764
min	max	range	min	range	max
the approach i ve used here though i ve created a plugin to do so is to check whether the entered value is in the range defined by the min and max attributes if it is we keep that value

24354764
min	max
if not we test whether the entered value is less than the min value if it is then we set the value to the min value and if not implying that the value must be greater than the max we set the value to the max attribute

24354832
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
at least you will if you do not use google-chrome peculiarly the problem seems not to occur in safari ie or firefox

24354848
swift	objective-c
this is how i do it in objective-c but when i try to convert it to swift code it doesn t work

24354865
ssl	https
the video feed is a flash player that is served via https while the chat box is an iframe that does not have ssl encryption

24354865
google-chrome	firefox
by default web browsers such as google-chrome and firefox block the chat box because it s an iframe using http served on an https website

24354870
pop-up	dialog
then a dialog pop-up with the following message

24354885
width	height
the standard box model does not include padding borders into width height calculations

24354885
box-sizing	border-box
by adding the box-sizing border-box property it will force the browser to include the padding borders in the dimensions

24354912
centos	linux
id like to use jpegrescan on my centos 6 linux install both on its own and as part of picopt

24354948
express	node.js
but i hope this will help you to better understand node.js using express

24354960
min	max
if you insist you can use the with min and max set to 1

24354972
subtract	add
use a case statement inside of sum to determine whether to add or subtract

24354976
width	height
in both cases i floated the button to the right and used display inline-block to keep a shrink to fit width height and white-space nowrap to keep the text on a single line

24354990
for-loop	arrays
array.foreach iterates over an arrays just like a for-loop

24355019
put	get
i am doing this to try and get away from the crud model of get x from repository change it and put it back remove all domain-specific knowledge from the web application and to allow the intent of the user to be communicated directly to the domain model

24355084
width	height
you have to specify a width and height for your s to work the way you want them to

24355275
libstdc++	libc++
looking at libc++ and libstdc++ is probably the best bet and then documenting it as you go along might work

24355288
qobject	qmetaobject
you can change slot s name so that it won t try to find a matching signal and use qobject connect directly instead of qmetaobject connectslotsbyname

24355290
min	max
the python functions max y and min y

24355348
int	boolean
i have a boolean array in my main-class i think this is what we call it and a int array in a class

24355352
xsd.exe	svcutil.exe
now for an obscure reason known only to microsoft svcutil.exe has a rather fussy interpretation of xsd which means that for service definitions which fall outside this interpretation vs will fall back on using good old xsd.exe which happens to not support collections as

24355365
getter	setter
define a getter setter methods for boolarray in class myproblem and use the getter to get the array and operate on it in your class myclass

24355367
udp	tcp
i m trying to setup a udp connection after a tcp connection has been made

24355367
udp	tcp
all of the connection states and control goes through tcp but i want the client and server to be able to talk through udp as well

24355367
udp	tcp
i have it 100 working fine with just tcp binded but i want to use udp

24355374
put	get
if i run this code from my ide intellij everything works as expected i get a directory listing of my classpath and can put html-files in my resource-directory

24355397
portrait	landscape
but when i present the view controller when the originating view controller is in landscape the nextviewcontroller isn t presented in portrait but rather in landscape like the source view controller

24355406
hide	show
you probably just want a dropdown with the values of show and hide

24355418
pull	push
without isolation susy has no way of knowing anything about your dom tree or where an element lands in the default flow or how to push it back and forth into place Ã¢ so you need to set that explicitly in relation to the default using the margin mixins pre post push pull

24355559
hide	show
i want to initially hide all the posts and then show the relevant ones when a threadid is passed in

24355592
interpreted-language	compiled-language
this method would work best for interpreted-language as opposed to compiled-language since it s much more efficient for git to work with text however binary files would work

24355619
factors	mean
suppose i have longitudinal data for 20 individuals each having measurements of 10 time points...now i have a factors x having 3 levels say 0 1 2...i need to test if the levels differ significantly from each other...i have to test for the mean vector vector since each individual contains 10 time points

24355626
express	node.js
on a server i have a running node.js app with express module

24355634
udp	tcp
there will be no tunnel for udp just because you have a successful tcp connection

24355634
udp	tcp
you have to establish the udp connection the same way you got the tcp connection

24355634
udp	tcp
if the tcp connection was established from intern to outside you have to do the same with udp otherwise the nat device will not establish a connection for the udp connection and thus packets from the peer will not be sent to you

24355647
post	get
but when i submit my form post method i m not able to get this info

24355648
swift	objective-c
swift does not have any drop in replacement for nsarray or the other collection classes in objective-c

24355653
maven	pom.xml
make sure to get familiar with maven or gradle sbt ... and take a look at the pom.xml especially the dependencies section

24355656
google-chrome	firefox
tested on firefox 30.0 and iron 34.0.1850.0 google-chrome

24355704
bower	npm
it s a standalone available through both the npm and bower package managers

24355729
versioning	upgrade

gif	png
if user post an image of another type i want to show an error message saying only jpg png or gif images are accepted.

24355851
firefox	safari
if you are wanting it to be fixed ie always in the same position then this line is preventing that for me in firefox and safari -

24355865
dbcontext	objectcontext
you can create a dbcontext from an objectcontext but i don t think that s of much help to you

24355907
folder	directory
i think that it is a little bit tedious to have all the files on the bower_components folder only to copy them into your public directory

24355954
scheme	racket
the question is tagged with both scheme and racket so it s probably not a bad idea to have an implementation that works in scheme in addition to the versions that work for racket given in some of the other answers

24356007
post	get
in the logs i can see that the form is non submitted with a post request but with a get this is the second one after the initial visit to the login page

24356007
post	put
the funny thing is that if i copy and paste the html code from the rendered page and put it in the partial instead of the simple_form helpers it works and the test passes with the correct post request

24356007
post	get
it should be home devise redirect to the params redirect_to but it s users sign_in since the form is not submitted with a post but it s a get to the same path so the form is only re-rendered

24356008
google-chrome	firefox
the browser type doesn t matter it can be firefox google-chrome android s built in browser etc

24356063

parent are children

24356125
dictionary	map
edit i thought to use a dictionary and the map function like so

24356127
getter	setter
user class has both getter and setter

24356162
ubuntu	linux
note that ubuntu and some other linux distributions nowadays allow a process to ptrace only their child processes running as the same user

24356197
prepare	execute
the solution to using a variable limit or offset seems to prepare and execute a statement

24356198
int	chars
the value is passed as an int but the function fills the block of memory using the unsigned chars conversion of this value

24356198
int	chars
the unsigned chars conversion of an int is that number modulo 256 or the least significant byte

24356211
nstableview	nssplitview
i have an nstableview embedded in an nssplitview

24356213

note i tried searching for scala println parentheses and such but all i get is post on how to remove the parentheses from the code not from the output

24356229
onresize	onload
background-size will need to be set via javascript onload and onresize for #mask

24356276
prepare	pdostatement
as you can see calling the method connection- prepare will return a statement which is an object of the pdostatement class

24356276
prepare	bindparam	prepare	pdostatement	bindparam	pdostatement
if you have parameters set in the prepare query you would want to set these through the bindparam methods of the pdostatement class

24356276
bindparam	pdostatement
keep in mind that when it s neccesary to execute multiple similar queries in one go use an object of pdostatement and then set different parameters using the bindparam method

24356291
cpu	processors
there are also ways to use ps to get cpu utilization in a way that is scriptable to tell you when the processors load drops below x amount

24356354
swift	objective-c
_t prefixes all swift functions and it looks like to corresponds to the function having the objective-c attribute

24356354
swift	objective-c
unfortunately i don t have enough knowledge of the internals of swift and the objective-c runtime to tell you what each of these functions does

24356354
swift	objective-c
i think it s safe to assume it s part of the objective-c to swift bridging process though

24356362
implements	extends
public class decodeactivity extends activity implements surfaceholder.callback

24356362
width	height
20736 unable to instantiate a decoder for type csd-1 java.nio.readwriteheapbytebuffer status capacity 8 position 0 limit 8 height 360 mime video avc csd-0 java.nio.readwriteheapbytebuffer status capacity 31 position 0 limit 31 width 640

i have a uitextfield that needs to show a uidatepicker with a uitoolbar in above to close it

24356414
libstdc++	libc++
now i m facing a problem with unique_ptr not being parsed which should be solved by telling clang to use either libc++ or libstdc++ in the command line arguments

24356458
subtract	add
except in django the key s add and subtract are regex url patterns and the someview.as_view are the lambda functions

24356503
int	boolean
so the compiler thinks you are trying to compare a boolean to an int which of course doesn t make any sense

24356521
submit	submission
since you are not passing e into the submit handler as gwsmaster has mentioned your code errors on the e.preventdefault line and therefore none of the two gets executed ending up submission the form anyway

24356601
integer	unsigned
because 1065353216 is the unsigned 32-bit integer representation of the 32-bit floating point value 1.0

24356643
hive	hdfs
the entire hadoop ecosystem including hdfs hive and hbase is not designed for fast interactive real time queries with less than few minutes responses

24356679
public	protected
unless otherwise defined by using the public private or packaged keywords ivars will default to protected

24356679
public	protected
you re not showing your code so i can t be certain but i wonder if you have the same issue as described in this other post objective-c - private vs protected vs public

24356680
post	get
when i add a pagingandsortingrepository for product and try the same post i get the following error message

24356680
post	get
with only the appointment repository i get the following payload and can post the list of products

24356702
strlen	substr
now i use a combination of strpos stripos strlen and substr to account for the asymmetry of equivalent answers a b same as b a but it adds lots of code

24356712
width	height
set the width and height of the first div to 100

24356723
subtract	add
so you are going to have an in_radius and an out_radius and what you going to do is just subtract some from the original radius for the in_radius and you are going to add some for the out_radius

24356755
children	parent
a call to start will block in the parent process until there are fewer children running than the limit specified

24356795
width	height
i think the problem is that the i element has width and height 0 therefore it is not clickable

24356795
width	height
the element must be visible and it must have a height and width greater then 0

24356796
implements	extends
so for that i made a new class wich extends surfaceview one wich extends a thread implements all i needed the surfaceview in the xml file of my activity

24356805
folder	directory
however when published the actual tomcat directory being used was located in workspace folder .metadata .plugins org.eclipse.wst.server.core tmp0

24356811
for-loop	arrays
using a for-loop traverse the arrays with the duplicates say its name is arr and in the for-loop write this

24356814
bindparam	bindvalue
unlike bindvalue bindparam allows you to bind before or after the variable is initialize because it uses the variable reference not the value so you are allowed to put create after binding

24356869
jscrollpane	jviewport
you have to access the viewport using getviewport method on jscrollpane then call getview method on the returned jviewport the component returned should be your jtextarea you will need to cast the component to jtextarea to be able to call setlinewrap on it

24356878
width	height
at a a window instance is created with a width and height

24356906
overwrite	preserve
note the latter option will overwrite the current font weight to regular so if you want to preserve the font weight use the first option

24356911
build.gradle	gradlew
in gradlew just like maven convention is that java files by default are in src main java and since you re not overriding this in your build.gradle file i assume this is just an error on your part

24356965
width	height
but i want my stacklayout to fill all the screen width and height also i have tree buttons added like this

24356972
integer	unsigned
integer promotions turn into note 1 but it is entirely possible that int only has 32 bits and you need it to be an unsigned 64-bit type for the shift to be meaningful

24356972
int	chars
note 1 it s theoretically possible for unsigned chars to be as wide as an int in which case the int promotion would be to an unsigned int

24357025
setinterval	settimeout
if you want to integrate with other javascript frameworks set timers using settimeout or setinterval or send ajax requests perform those operations in this method

24357056
nltk	lda	scikit-learn	lda	scikit-learn	nltk
that said if you need to see actual weights of terms in the corpus unrelated to lda you can use something like nltk in python to check frequency distributions and also something like scikit-learn for tfidf to get more meaningful weight distributions

24357099
nsurl	nsdata
i tried returning an nsdata object instead of an nsurl for my local .gif file on a tip from lyndsey about the twitter api

24357103
post	get
if you have forms that post get to this script then of course the script must be available not protected via .htaccess deny rules etc.

24357192
pop-up	dialog
the recording goes well with both tools but the replay of the scenario fails because a click action on a commandbutton opening a pop-up dialog doesn t fire the associated event

24357240
post	get
i dont have much experience with post and get and request and i think that is where the problem is occuring

24357289
touchescancelled	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchescancelled	touchesbegan	touchesended
so yea it turns out that the problem was that i was using a custom button class as well which had overrides for the touchesbegan touchesended and touchescancelled functions

24357305
post	get
yes preflight is required any time your cors request is not of the simple variety--meaning you have a method other than get head or post a content type other than application x-www-form-urlencoded multipart form-data or text plain or your request sets a custom header

24357333
int	chars
so i m creating a list class that can hold a mixture of int and chars

24357416
swift	objective-c
here s the code generated by xcode for the swift - objective-c conversion

24357435
inherited	subclassing
1 traits interfaces can be part of the inherited hierarchy but can t be described as classes and therefore can t be part of a subclassing relationship

24357437
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox but fails in google-chrome and internet explorer as well. the rest of the application continues to function without error except that the stencil is ignored

24357441
queue	fifo
but the problem lies in implementing deque operation as queue works in a fifo manner while stack in a lifo manner

24357443
versioning	upgrade
my gut tells me the issue is in the codeigniter logic in your codebase since the upgrade from ubuntu 12.x to ubuntu 13.x includes an upgrade versioning of php from versioning 5.3 in ubuntu 12.x to versioning 5.5 in ubuntu 13.x

24357468

i am not going to show it but if while reading in the inputs you keep track of how many numbers to the right of the decimal place then multiplying all of the values by that number of tens so to get it all as an integer then add then do the comparison after multiplying the targetnum by the same value 100

24357647

width	height
just as a quick test i adjusted the framelayout width and height to be fixed 500dp and 200dp and that s what i got

24375235
width	height
so this way i can see that all things are there but i can t get it to be shown right without playing with fixed width and height numbers

24375254
png	ico
it just had png jpg and ico originally

another thing that catches my eye is that you are iterating through a numpy arrays with a for-loop

24375364
invariantculture	cultureinfo
try parsing the number without specyfing culture will use local os cultureinfo then try with invariantculture then maybe try some fallback culture you expect the number to be formatted with

24375412
int	double
int and double are different so you cannot pass any sort of array of double to this function as you have described the function anyway

24375412
int	double
unless the api also includes a function that takes a pointer to double you have to retrieve the int s and then convert them to double

24375412
int	double
the last line performs a value conversion from int to double

24375452
webkit	blink	google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
this worked just fine in google-chrome safari and opera which all happen to be running webkit blink

24375452

it seems as though in google-chrome safari and opera all click through the button and trigger the click event on both the button and nested element

24375463
dictionary	map
however the contained items pairings can be sorted and the result is a sequence list not a map dictionary

24375475

though it got me thinking if this would be on the right track with some adjustment for how int map to individual chars

24375703
versioning	upgrade
if that was not the case this case may give a hint as he got the same error but i m not sure he was right with his approach as i m not sure he really revised the versioning or why he couldn t downgrade the jstl or upgrade the container

24375719
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome android google-chrome for android this outputs

24375719
google-chrome	safari

frequently i ll be defining a class which extends another class and call super in my onshow method out of habit

24376207
do.call	lapply	purrr	plyr
put similar data in lists because you want to do similar things to each data frame and functions like lapply sapply do.call the purrr package and the old plyr functions make it easy to do that

24376207
for-loop	loops
even if you use a lowly for-loop it s much easier to loops over the elements of a list than it is to construct variable names with paste and access the objects with get

24376226
pivot-table	crosstab
this process is called pivot-table or crosstab report

24376242

so never put any information you want to hide from other people in the url string and always encrypt using https if you post or receive sensitive data like logins or personal information

24376384
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
the topic remains complex and the amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk eb documentation could still do a better job to clarify available options

24376384
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
while unfortunately not specifically addressed within configuring databases with amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk the amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk settings for an optional amazon rds database are handled via option values see namespace amazon-web-services rds dbinstance within general options

24376384
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
if specified amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk updates the configuration set associated with the running environment and sets the specified configuration options to the requested value

24376444
awt	swing
take a look at painting in awt and swing for more details about the painting process

24376444
awt	swing
now unless you have a really good reason for doing so i would encourage you to use the swing api over the awt library which was replaced with swing some 15 years ago

24376444
awt	swing
there are more people available who understand how swing works then who remember or have experience with awt

24376445
subtract	add
only if you also need arithmetic operations -- add subtract multiple divide greater than less than -- would you need to worry about the signed nature of the bytes

24376450
hide	show
you might want to review nganimate documentation hide show animation comes along with others comes for almost free

24376457
min	max
list.remove max is first run your program goes through the while loop again but min and max will keep the same values they had on the first pass through the loop and as nothing remaining in list is greater than max or less than min the variables won t be changed and so python will end up trying to run list.remove min

24376457
min	max
list.remove max with the same values for min and max that were used before

24376457
min	max
the simplest solution is to set min and max at the start of the while loop rather than before it

24376457
min	max
also note that list min and max are already the names of builtin python functions and using those names for regular variables is widely considered bad practice

24376463
min	max
your problem is that you only initialize the min and max variables once outside the while loop

24376463
min	max
you could speed it up a bit by using the built-in functions max and min but the algorithm is still inefficient

24376471
awt	swing
take a look at painting in awt and swing for details about how painting works

24376471
awt	swing
having said all that i would discourage you from using awt based api as it was replaced by swing some 15 years ago

24376480
webkit	gecko
this string is deliberately designed to cause most ua-string sniffing logic to interpret it either gecko or webkit

24376501
qwebview	pyqt
the documentation in pyqt at least for qwebview says the qwebview class provides a widget that is used to view and edit web documents whereas qwebpage says the qwebpage class provides an object to view and edit web documents

24376505
jspinner	documentfilter
you could also use a jspinner or a documentfilter with examples depending on your overall needs

24376633
for-loop	arrays
the for-loop and log statement are included to print the arrays but it does not print anything at all

24376698
ng-style	ng-class
an alternative is to use ng-style or ng-class for making the text bold

24376716
inline	inlining
note that the c# compiler doesn t ever inline the methods - the inlining happens during the jit compilation phase

24376779
int	chars
the reason why i did not see duplicated events during the entry of a chars was because a veto was called in the event handler for the evt_grid_cell_changing if an int conversion was invalid because my handler for that event gets the grid input and tries to convert it

24376780
dbcontext	objectcontext
you didn t just upgrade you changed from objectcontext to dbcontext

24376789
folder	directory

width	height
jquery find this div and whatever text is inside it i want you to scale it so that it fills the entire height and width of the div as tightly as possible

24376922
getter	setter
basically what happens is that id property is only defined in element.prototype and it has a getter and a setter

24376922
getter	setter
then the getter and setter of element.prototype.id don t work

24376963
versioning	upgrade
i ve already upgrade to the newest versioning and i have no idea how to adjust this solution for the newest versioning

24376978
subtract	add
in your add and subtract methods you are creating your list using the default constructor which sets its head to null and does nothing else then returning that empty list

24376978
subtract	add
you ll need to actually implement the functionality of add and subtract

24376986
ddms	adb
2 this way i can still connect and debug with breakpoints after installing via adb you can attach to the process under the devices view normally visible in the ddms perspective look for the little green bug icon.

24377161
strcpy	strncpy	strlen	strncpy	strlen	strcpy
the strcpy function finishes after writing strlen label +1 bytes so it is redundant to try and use strncpy

24377167
folder	directory
if you don t want to have to use the folder name import ch1 foo you ll need to symlink inside of those directory so you can simply import foo

24377199
min	max	range	min	range	max
this code will simply restrict the value of the field to the allowed range keeping the value on min and max if it is greater or lower of it

24377207

24377287
versioning	upgrade
if you want to use visual c++ 2012 you ll need to upgrade your versioning of matlab

24377287
versioning	upgrade
as such you ll either need to stick with visual c++ 2010 for r2011b or upgrade your versioning of matlab to r2013a that provides visual c++ 2012 support

24377349
keydown	keyup
you can also use one of the key press event handlers keypress keyup and keydown

24377612
kerberos	ldap
openid connect is a profile of oauth2 that is used by google and is projected by industry experts from gartner to forrester and beyond... to become a standard as ubiquitous as ldap and kerberos in fact due to support for native and web authentication it can integrate all those apps that saml missed like server login

24377613
post	get
to get around this i updated the controller which receives the form post to detect when the collection has been emptied from the client side and manually empty the collection on the entity

replace int test_i int i with int test_i chars i and you will get stack corruption Ã¢ because python side gives function 4 or 8 bytes while c side only reads 1 byte

24377909
quantmod	performanceanalytics
packages are quantmod for data download and performanceanalytics for analysis plotting

24377938
accessor	superclass
you d have to register the specialised accessor for the specialised sprite the subsprite class before registering the accessor for the generic superclass sprite

apache	nginx
you can either do that by listening to that port on the app directly or by having a web server that acts as a reverse-proxy for you nginx or apache

24378054
qstring	qchar
your a is a qstring and it s member function qstring at always return qchar

24378054

24378152
jobs	cron
fourth examine your cron jobs

24378152
jobs	cron
if your cron jobs must run frequently and do a lot of computing consider moving them to a compute engine instance

24378237
int	chars
in the second one you are aliasing some adjacent chars values as int

24378237
int	chars
however a common result is that you will get the value of int which has the same bit-pattern as the bit-pattern of those chars values concatenated

24378237
int	chars
it is undefined behaviour because of c99 6.5#7 which lists the valid type combinations which may be aliased and chars as int is not in the list

24378237
int	chars
you can alias int as chars but not the other way around

24378278

24378318
matplotlib	colormap
you can use matplotlib s colormap to map values to colors for the nodes

24378359
accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
i understand that when you declare a properties like the following that the compiler automatically synthesizes the backing ivar and the two accessor methods for you

24378359
accessor	properties
to top it all off i ve been told that you should not refer to mystring as a properties and that the word properties should only be used to refer to the two accessor methods that are synthesized for you by the compiler when you use the properties directive

24378363
width	height
the only solution that i can come up is to set childs width and height by using calc to calculate and subtract width and height of child s border

24378389
width	height
the data api doesn t have a way to retrieve any video height or width because youtube videos as they re delivered don t have inherent dimensions

24378389
width	height
provides a default-sized embed code as well as some parameters for default width and height

24378538
super	extends
in java a class extends only a single class because the constructor of that class only call one super class constructor

24378573
width	height
you have set the width and height of child element to 100 percent so obviously it will be equal to the container one

24378573
width	height
now setting a border it will take extra width and height that will overflow

24378592
google-chrome	firefox
the functionality of visited pseudoclass has been restricted in many modern browsers firefox ie9+ google-chrome to prevent css exploit

24378879
width	height
i have width and height in centimeter and i calculate the area like this

24378889

i wanted to animate going to the next set of pictures with jquery hide and show

24389379
boost	stl
implementing a class which does this is not a problem but this feels like a generic problem that i just can t find in boost or stl

24389385
post	get
however when i add the same code to the front-end get works but post fails with a 500 error

24389416

shadowing	named
it just took me quite some time to find out that a bug in my code was due to unintentional shadowing of a named within the same scope

24389606
margin	height
ok it looks like the issue is not with the navba height its with the margin you have set margin-bottom 33px on .navbar-btn - that needs to be removed

24389619
inherited	properties
label inherited from labeled control and region which means it inherited a great many styleable properties which text doesn t have

24389659
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
mostly platform application independent most user-scripts can work on firefox google-chrome opera etc Ã¢ and windows mac linux etc without any problems

24389669

as you can see it will change the dir to . tasks inside the folder from which it was executed

24389674
post	get
you want to get post of a given user for this relation so

24389735
put	get	post	get	post	put
but it doesn t work probably because method apiauth isn t a post field - it s a url param - but i get a 302 if i actually put it in the url

24389771
min	max
edit fixed the 2nd query to be min instead of max that was a typo

24389774
put	get
i need to form a layout in which i want to put an image in the upper 50 of the screen two edittext two button in the lower 50 of the screen and also it should be device independent so that the view doesn t get disturbed on smaller or bigger screens it works fine on minimum 3.2 hvga device but everything goes overlapped if run on a even smaller device

24389794
ant	maven
using ant this is possible but since the generation must be switched to maven i wanted to use jaxp within our own generator plugin

24389823
integer	fractions
your fractions component is just your integer and your exponent will be 1 and floating point doesn t struggle with that

24389836
width	margin
there are several reasons why a string of digits in normal content may have a width different from a string of digits as the value of a text input box the font faces may differ the font sizes may differ and the input box may have some padding some margin or some border by default

24389850
median	max
as you mentioned average median max time per request inverse of latency analyze memory usage average time the system takes before failing as well as the error rate

24389875

for the imageview and linearlayout make sure you set height and width to 0dp

24389883
hide	show
i m trying to create a button to hide and show content using css3 child selectors but the trick only works with minimal markup

24389883

soon as i add multiple div s inside the section where the content is placed the child selectors don t hide the content anymore rendering the hide show button useless

24389921
int	chars
i want to avoid this and convert the id to a string with random chars and numbers like youtube does example and then convert it again to an int so i can fetch the content

24389968
min	max
if you are worried about non-unique numbers for the max and min you can trim the array down using .uniq after sorting

24389981

however going forward it should be easy to use this feature to upgrade apache php mysql to newer versioning

24389989

i guess you mean setinterval instead of settimeout

24390004
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in google-chrome firefox but the container chart doesn t even begin to render in ie

24390016
mongodb	bson
the purpose of this is to provide type fidelity where json itself is not aware of strict types such as what the bson format is desinged for and what mongodb itself uses

24390016
mongodb	bson
the proper bson date types that result in this are the proper way of storing in mongodb

24390045
google-chrome	firefox
the code is loading jquery 1.7.1 and the script fixes the problem in google-chrome firefox and ie9

24390098
typedef	struct
for anyone using the more limited compact framework .net v2.0 cf the following code works on both windows ce 5.0 and ce 6.0 reading just the adaptor name but search for typedef struct _ip_adapter_info on msdn to get the full definition of the structure returned

24390114
folder	directory
this worked for me when i had to import a script from a different directory then the executed script that used a configuration file residing in the same folder as the imported script

24390128
hash	md5
you can get the md5 hash of large files by breaking them into small byte chunks

24390128
hash	md5
also calculating md5 hash is significantly faster than sha-256 and should be favored for performance reasons for any application that doesn t rely on the hash for security purposes

24390137
pull	push
pub sub is just one option there are other combinations like push pull req rep etc

24390137
pull	push
i have some services running for years with push pull and it stays quite well typically there are 6 weeks before there is a need to do some restart but this is rather due to problems on hardware than in zeromq library.

24390162
children	parent
i have a app parent which has many positiondata children

24390163
post	get
for the post page i want to get some information about the next chronological post like you can do with the theme builder using or

stdout	stderr
the following adds encoding utf-8 to stdin stdout stderr and makes it the default for open

24390229
nvl	sysdate
v_date_extraction to_char nvl p_date_launching sysdate yyyymmddhhmm

24390243
width	height
on the inner button i just set the width and height to match_parent

24390243
width	height
i have the root layout width to be wrap content so the button with big text takes the biggest space and that space would be the height of the parent

24390251
ng-include	ng-controller
i want to pass these attributes into the directive s template which i use to render two nested div tags -- the outer one containing ng-controller and the inner containing ng-include

24390251
ng-include	ng-controller
the ng-controller will define the controller exclusively used for the template and the ng-include will render the template s html

24390251
ng-include	ng-controller
placing the ng-controller tags inside the template instead of wrapping it around ng-include

24390251
ng-include	ng-controller
the priority level of ng-controller is lower than that of ng-include

24390282
folder	directory
i dealt with this by writing a shell script mgit that reads a hidden file .mgit in the current directory which contains a list of folder that are individual git repositories

24390295
rcurl	rjsonio
as far as i know the rcurl library won t make json for you so you need to build the json yourself here using the rjsonio package

24390320
move	drag
i can drag hand full of documents and move a across

24390359
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome is the same as firefox

24390503
swift	objective-c
also if your swift class does not descend from an objective-c class then you must have a colon at the end of the target method name string and you must use the objective-c property with your target method

24390510
folder	directory
the individual collected files from inside the unprocessed directory are then sorted to individual folder named after each file extension and created at the same level as the unprocessed directory again using individual robocopy commands

24390576
avassetwriter	avassetreader
to do so i m using a combination of avassetreader to read the mp4 source files and avassetwriter to write those source files in a single mp4 output file

24390634
switching	screens
the point is when i run the program and try to switching the avd to landscape mode it actually rotates 90 degres but only the device not the screens contents

24390666
qtcore	qtgui
in my app i use from pyside import qtgui qtcore

24390669
super	extends
extends the socketchannelimpl and create a constructor that passes a given filedescriptor to the super class constructor or

24390682

whenever the screen is locked onpause - onstop are called as per usual however when the device screen wakes up to unlock onstart - onresume is called before the device is unlocked

24390682
portrait	landscape
this sort of behavior has only been experienced on this device so far regardless of it being in portrait or landscape position either upon unlock or during app execution

24390757
nsstring	nserror
incompatible pointer types sending nserror __strong to parameter of type nsstring __autoreleasing

24390757
post	get
a different post said to replace nsstring with nsstring both in the method that is called and in the calling method but if i do that i get hard errors

24390768
portrait	landscape
the segmented control is shown in portrait mode in a uiviewcontroller set to landscape - as shown by the status bar

24390845
hide	show
at first i select the textfield it show and then hide the keyboard really fast strange

24390856
filtering	grouping
i basically ignore subfeatures for grouping and then temporarily add it back within the filtering function but that gets lost so i finalize it after the filtering function completes

24390863
maven	pom.xml
doing a quick search on maven and derby included the following in my pom.xml

24390878
nsstring	nserror
which is pointer to a pointer to nsstring but you are passing nserror instead

24390878
nsstring	nserror
you can also replace method to accept nserror as a argument instead of nsstring

24390892
post	get
then you can get post of a number of users by using containedin

24390902
put	get
now when i try to loop through this result and put it into the grid array i get the error

24390910
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i ve tested this in reasonably modern versions of ie google-chrome safari and firefox

24390944
int	double
inserting into a simple table with an id 1 datetime 2 singles 2 double and 3 int is very slow ranging from 8 to 15 inserts per second on a system with an ssd

24390976
junit	testng
based on my experience with both frameworks testng has a few convenient features that the junit team has declined to implement for several years

24390976
junit	testng
converting to testng is easy since it basically supports pretty much everything in junit there s a converter plugin for eclipse even converting back to junit is not so great because of these missing features

24390976
junit	testng
in testng beforeclass methods are not static and execute before the tests in that class run rather than when the test class is loaded the junit behavior

24390976
junit	testng
testng data providers are a bit more flexible than the junit equivalent

24390976
junit	testng
an annoyance with both is the way hamcrest is bundled with junit and the way junit is bundled with testng

24390977
switching	screens
in most cases it ends with the screens switching to black and then back to normal

24391061
width	height
it uses height and width of your parent element smartly to show ellipsis

24391126
junit	testng
i m using git as source control and junit and testng as test frameworks

24391168
folder	directory
log into your ftp find your plugins folder and download all plugins to your local plugin directory

24391198
folder	directory
here is some code that i tried to work with but it tried to delete all the files in the program s folder and not to the custom save directory

24391200
filtering	grouping
you need to use having to filtering the table after it s been grouping to

24391352
submit	submission
it s obvious that user.getemailaddress is going to be null so it s giving me this error but removing it doesn t work submit not submission and any textbox after the first textbox doesn t validate so i just want to type exactly what the book shows to see how it goes but of course it doesn t compile

24391368
width	height
i need the height and width of an image in matlab

24391383
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
all works great on safari and google-chrome but in firefox 30.0 the button moves left randomly from 35px to 60px but never for the setted value 276px in the .animate function

24391395
post	get
we can t automatically copy them as a post build event because if we make breaking changes then we don t want all projects using the assembly to automatically get the new version

24391413
spaces	delimiter
comma tab spaces delimiter

24391419
actionscript	haxe
i m a developer in actionscript and while i m watching haxe as a language to be used by me since besides the resemblance actionscript still be possible to make applications with output to flash yet

24391432
implements	extends
then all classes that re-use the view eg display the button panel must extends mainactivity and in the oncreate method they implements the method setup

24391448

either upgrade to python 3.3 or 3.4 even or downgrade markupsafe to 0.15 the last versioning to support python 3.2

24391488
versioning	upgrade
the error occur when i upgrade admob sdk to the newest google play service versioning

24391488
versioning	upgrade
but when upgrade to the new one google play service versioning problem occured

24391490
int	boolean
1 it is for looping forever since c does not have a native boolean type it is using int and 1 is true

24391497
stdout	stderr
the info will be in stderr and rgb will be in stdout

24391560
children	parent
i have a parent pom with two children

24391560
children	parent
the two children build to a common target folder and the parent builds an rpm with the codehaus rpm-maven-plugin from that folder

24391560
children	parent
if i specifically build the children before building the parent it works

24391560
children	parent
but if i clean and then build from the parent it ll try to build the rpm before it builds the children and complains that the files are missing

24391613
width	height
i want the #header div s height to be as small as it s content and it s width to be 100 of the #container div and the #container to fit exactly in the #main div

24391625
move	drag
now i have got into layouts panels stack panels canvas dock panels etc and i am struggling to understand why they are useful if you can just drag and move objects controls on the screen yourself

24391659
nsstring	nsdata
keychain stores the password as nsdata not nsstring

24391674
google-chrome	firefox
it works just fine in google-chrome whereas it doesn t in firefox

24391674
google-chrome	firefox
notice the difference between google-chrome and firefox with the same code

24391698
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in using font-face it s working fine with firefox google-chrome safari etc. but not in internet explorer

24391706
oncreate	ondestroy
an activity does not always have a matching ondestroy call for every oncreate call

24391706
onresume	onpause
the correct place to put a registerreceiver call is in the onresume call and unregisterreceiver in onpause

24391729
inherited	properties
the reason why they are not the same is because for test3 you inherited all the properties that you do not explicitly set

24391729
inherited	properties
in that view you can also check view inherited properties

24391755
getter	setter
it can be useful if you want to write custom getter and setter

24391779
width	height
it s size is 322px width and 128px height

24391779
width	height
i can get the img s width and height but not the a-href link s background width and height

24391779
width	height
note the links are id s and not class s as i was unable to find an easy way to access the existing images width and height before loading and then how to resize the a-href link s size after getting it

24391790
ubuntu	linux
my company has decided to migrate our base server images from ubuntu server to amazon linux

24391801
accessor	properties
by using the properties keyword the compiler automatically synthesizes your accessor methods for you and also a backing instance variable

24391801
getter	setter
however because none of them have the readonly property attribute they will all have getter and setter methods synthesized for them as well as the backing instance variable

24391801
getter	setter
no setter or getter methods are being synthesized for you by the compiler

24391801
getter	setter
with the second example outside classes will be able to access your getter and setter methods for your property so they can read and write

24391813
shim	polyfills
a polyfills is a shim for a browser api

24391876
google-chrome	firefox
everything works great in google-chrome firefox ie

24391890
width	height
error converting value x 1 y 1 width 1 height 1 to type microsoft.xna.framework.rectangle

24391896
inherited	properties
sure enough i had empty font-family properties and in internet explorer it apparently won t fall back to the inherited font

24391903
bash	subshell
bash is a subshell resource

24391903
bash	subshell
when you use the bash or any execute resource you are executing in a subshell so things like source or export are not persisted to the parent process

24391912
put	get
therefore you are supposed to get the registration id in handleregistration so i m not sure where you put the line but you probably put it in the wrong place

24391938
setinterval	settimeout
you could use setinterval instead of settimeout and then within the code you re executing on the interval include a counter and a condition to remove the interval stop setinterval call in javascript after the correct number of executions

24391945
multiplying	multiplication
we check if we have more rows than columns or the other way around and then do the multiplication accordingly by choosing either to multiplying rows with matrices or matrices with columns thus doing the least amount of loop iterations

24391961
cassini	iis
however consider that your asp.net website or webservice is an application and requires an application pool to run in within iis or cassini

24391970
post	put
i m new to rails but my understanding is that i can t send a put request from the login controller to the other object controller since redirects don t allow you to post data

24391970
put	get
i suppose i could also put some get variables in the login path action make_private which the login controller could interpret as make object with id 123 private. the login controller could check for the existence of these params whenever a new login is created and handle the updating of that object itself

24391974
versioning	upgrade
you could either upgrade your java versioning or remove that module

24391986
width	margin
so if you want to align #content and #menu you ll need to manually set a margin equal to #menu s width + paddings in #content

24392006
width	height
2 resize image to width 770px or height 400px

24392006
width	height
if image has width 2156px and height 777px than need to be resized to the height 400px as this will give 1100x400

24392006
width	height
if image has width 777px and height 2156px than need to be resized to the width 770px as this will give 770x2137

24392007
csv	tsv
accept a parameter that will determine the file format csv tsv fixed width

24392007
min	max	range	min	range	max
previous to this latest requirement my approach was to populate a staging table get the min and max recordids for each export batch then use a loop control flow number of records in recordset maxnumberofrecordsperfile to then use a data flow task to select the particular range of records and write them to each file

24392036
post	get
i have an application where i have one class file that handles all of my ajax post and get requests

24392043
debian-based	ubuntu
the fact that you mention a2enmod implies that you are on a debian-based distro like ubuntu

24392061
jeditable	tablesorter
i am using tablesorter and jeditable plugins

24392094
disk	ram
if the page is not yet in physical ram the operating system will issue a page fault to trigger loading of the requested page from disk or swap into physical ram

24392094
disk	ram
long story short the data of your active collections datafiles plus indexes should fit into physical ram if possible or you will see a lot of disk activity

24392110
width	margin
i m trying to give a table a left margin and set the width of the table plus its margin to 100 of the containing div

24392110
width	border-box
normally i d do this with width 100 and box-style border-box but this doesn t seem to be working on a table

24392110
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i can see it in google-chrome firefox and safari

24392117
margin	font-size
for example in chrome the margin before and after the p tag is 1em which is equal to the font-size you set

24392126
qdialog	qwidget
create the qdialog elsewhere and just call show on it from the mousemoveevent on the qwidget your hovering over

24392127
filtering	grouping
you can grouping the admob requests if you add ad_client_id to the list of dimensions of your report or filtering them

24392133
ssl	https
this issue doesn t seem to be fineuploader s fault but instead appears to be a result of the way ssl works on azure blob storage that only allows a specific amount of data to be transferred in a single https session around 5 megs in my testing

by changing the background to a color and not defining any text there s no minimum height or width anymore effectively hiding your checkbox

i would suggest creating a component that uses react s statics component property to define a couple of functions wrapping rendercomponent to give you a nice clean function call to show or hide a react dialog

24396595
sorting	filtering
this would also mean that any filtering sorting etc would need to be custom built as well

24396662
filtering	grouping
my understanding was that the filtering is just the where clause of the query but it would appear that in the case of a totals query containing a grouping by clause it is more like the having clause

24396662

however i would still like to understand how the filtering works when there s a grouping by clause in the select statement

hide	show
you could eliminate the need to explicitly loop over the items altogether by just apply the hover to the item class and the hide show logic to the overlay class

24397276
hide	show
additionally to hide and show items the jquery friendly pattern is to use the hide and show methods

vlan	packets	libpcap	wireshark
because the vlan tag is consumed by the kernel libpcap -- which is the packets capture library used by tcpdump wireshark et al

24397590
vlan	packets
as you can see the latter packets has only the 802.1q vlan header -- the client vlan -- the kernel having consumed the 802.1ad service vlan tag

24397590
vlan	packets
using the raw packets interface the kernel consumes the 802.1ad vlan header the one immediately following the recipient address

24397590
vlan	packets	libpcap	wireshark
you can use tcpdump or wireshark to compare the received packets libpcap is obviously reinserting the consumed vlan tag pack into the packet.

equals	gethashcode	equals	tostring	tostring	gethashcode
to make things right additionally to overriding tostring method i also do recommend to override equals and gethashcode methods with marking amount field as readonly

24398331
illegalargumentexception	runtimeexception
the intent of runtimeexception is that it is generally used in unrecoverable bug scenarios that are the result of something done incorrectly by the method caller such as attempting to traverse beyond the end of an array arrayindexoutofboundsexception or passing an invalid parameter illegalargumentexception

24398373
equals	gethashcode
note you will also need to implement equals gethashcode or use iequatable

24398380
actionlistener	focuslistener
essentially for jtextfield you could use a actionlistener and or a focuslistener to monitor for changes to the field

24398380
actionlistener	focuslistener
this occurs in place of the actionlistener and focuslistener mentioned previously so you should only require a single listener but won t provide real time feedback at least not without a lot more work

24398570
hide	show
id have a div containing two inputs and just show or hide the div depending on whether the box is checked or not

24398611
width	height
if so say for example you allow a units to be entered as well as width and height you should attach a documentlistener to your jtextfields to monitor changes to the content of the underlying text documents

24398611
width	height
the update of the width should happen when there is a document change to the height gui element

24398611
width	height
similarly the update of the height should happen when there is a document change to the width gui element

24398611
int	double
you ll need to gracefully handle divide by zero errors or restrict input to always be greater than 0 perform your calculations using double and preferably use math.round to get the best int values for preserving aspect

24398611
width	height
because updating the target aspect ratio on every value change of the width and height fields could result in aspect-ratio creeping due to integer round-off

24398655
min	max
furthermore it is more advisable to make use of min and max i guess

24398655
min	max
min and max are sometimes directly supported by a cpu and there are implementations that avoid branching if-then-else s

24398686
implements	extends
in other words you have to extends the webbrowser control by implements at least idochostuihandler

24398714
google-chrome	firefox
so if i open the chat app in 7 ie8 google-chrome firefox in d same computer or in different computer each and connect to the same url domain it won t be affected but if i open the chat in 7 tabs in ie8 google-chrome firefox only then it will be affected

24398714
google-chrome	firefox
same as the above but the limit will only be affected if i open 7 ie8 google-chrome firefox browsers in 7 computers by 7 different accounts

draggable	droppable
looks like we can simply append the draggable item accessed via the ui.draggable to the list associated with the droppable item in this drop event handler but it s not such simple

24398808
width	height
btw you should not set grid s width and height most important thing is your grid s content looks confused

24398850
width	height
with aspect ratio defined as width height

24398850
quad	uniform
you pass in the xscale yscale values we calculated above for the value of the scalefact uniform set up the attribute location and everything else the way you normally would and then render the -1.0 1.0 x -1.0 1.0 quad

24398895
distance	pdist
contrary to what your post says you can use the euclidean distance as part of pdist

24398895
minimum	diagonal
therefore we can set the diagonal and the upper triangular half to inf then search for the minimum for those elements that are remaining

24398895
distance	pdist
as such instead of specifying euclidean you can specify your own function which can calculate the distance between two vectors within your matrix by calling pdist like so

24398895
distance	pdist
for pdist you need to make sure that the custom distance function takes in xi as a 1 x n vector which is a single row of pixels

24398896
width	height
it should contain curly brackets that differ in height but that all have the same width

24398896
width	height
but with any font -- even a monospaced font -- brackets that have a larger height will also have a larger width

24398896
width	height
i am also looking for a solution that can create brackets of differing height while holding width constant

24398901
google-chrome	firefox
in both google-chrome and firefox

24398956
width	height
we then set the height of that element to equal its width like this

for-loop	arrays
whenever i update my arrays of objects by say adding an extra object so that the size is 5 my for-loop changes its behavior

uiview	subviews
i thought i d subclass uiview and add a toolbar subviews and then do some clever rendering to sort of achieve the vibrancy effect which would look like this

24399415
uiview	subviews
have a subviews of the uiview display the final result over the toolbar

24399424
coldfusion	railo
cfml ie railo coldfusion or blue dragon would solve your concerns

24399444

avoid using commands directly on crontab you probably have a directory etc cron.hourly and crontab already have call to run all the scripts in the specific folder in determined intervals hourly daily for example

24414309
thin	webrick
for example if you wanted to use thin in production and webrick everywhere else you would add this line to your gemfile

24414309
thin	webrick
now thin will get auto-detected in production but other environments will fall back to webrick the default

i can t have both a .war file and .war directory in the same maven target folder

24415863
getter	setter
first you will have to add the setter and getter in the myclass as the var is private and change it to static

24415871

your doesn t have an id attribute on it so you ll either need to add to the or you ll need to change your code from getelementbyid to getelementsbytagname like this

24416023
swift	objective-c
first it s hard to translate that code to swift without knowing what you used that class object for in objective-c

24416023
swift	objective-c
however when objective-c apis are bridged to swift the type class is converted to anyclass

24416023
swift	objective-c
types in swift are not objects and thus are not directly equivalent to class objects in objective-c

24416023
swift	objective-c
however if you intend to use an objective-c api from swift it will have been bridged to expect anyclass anyway so you have to pass a type

24416023
swift	objective-c
if you really want to get the class object as an swift object the same way as in objective-c and not as a swift type there are some convoluted ways to do that too.

maven	pom.xml
in general if you are using maven to manage the versions it isn t a problem to put the parent version in the sub-module pom.xml

24416130
hash	salt
a common mistake is to use the same salt in each hash

24416130
hash	salt
they just have to apply the salt to each password guess before they hash it

24416130
hash	salt
if the salt is hard-coded into a popular product lookup tables and rainbow tables can be built for that salt to make it easier to crack hash generated by the product

24416130
hash	salt
every time a user creates an account or changes their password the password should be hash using a new random salt

24416130
hash	salt
as a rule of thumb make your salt is at least as long as the hash function s output

24416130
hash	salt
the salt should be stored in the user account table alongside the hash

24416130
hash	salt
prepend the salt to the password and hash it with a standard cryptographic hash function such as sha256

24416130
hash	salt
save both the salt and the hash in the user s database record

24416130
hash	salt
retrieve the user s salt and hash from the database

24416130
hash	salt
prepend the salt to the given password and hash it using the same hash function

24416130
ssl	https
client-side password hashing is not a substitute for https ssl tls

24416130
hash	salt
you need to salt the client-side hash too

24416198
getter	setter
make sure route class contains name as instance variable with getter setter methods

24416215
int	double
i am asking this because i know that it is float double but when i try to save the descriptors on a file it saves some int values.

24416229

needs a little calculation to get the correct height if the width changes

24416262
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	opera	safari
lack of compatibility is just propaganda against ie s ways tbh i don t like ie either because as far as my tests confirmed latest versions of ie firefox opera safari and google-chrome support it

24416262
width	height
analyzing very helpful and detailed answer from cale_b i came to the conclusion that my browsers interpret width 1em as this element has width of one height of the font currently being in use

24416262
width	height
an since most of the fonts use golden ratio for width height proportion i assume that is the reason why i have 160 increase in length gr 1.61803

24416283
post	get
but we need to do some nesting of and and or groupings of query criteria and are looking for an example of how to post an xml representation of such a query to the server and get the results back

min	max	width	height
i have a vertical fixed div on the left with a min max width set and 100 height

24416386
median	percentile
in order to find the p-th percentile of a set of n numbers essentially you are trying to find the k-th largest number where k n p 100 rounded down i think--or on second thought thinking of the median for example maybe it s rounded up

24416392
width	height
when i put width 100 and height 100 the video dissapears but i have sound how i can fix this

24416403
swift	objective-c
turns out there s a weird module naming thing going on in swift so you can fix it by adding an objective-c name to the class

24416415
width	font-size
here is a fiddle that demonstrates that the marqee at 10em is the same width as a div of the same width assuming that they have the same font-size applied

24416415
width	height
the conclusion you have come to is correct - that 1em is equal to the height of the font size not the width of the font size

24416415
width	height
in order to get the desired width you ll need to determine the proportion as you re already hinting at between the width and height of the font

24416415
width	text-align
an alternative method would be to set the width on the span as well as on the marquee and use another technique such as text-align center to make it look good

24416485
rcharts	nvd3.js
i am interested in plotting jvm gc events using thin vertical bars using nvd3.js and rcharts

24416510

in fact you can continue to refer to a cursor object by whatever name you bound it to in with-statement after the with block exits so long as its parent connection remains open

24416557
width	height
today i needed a function that is getting the size width and height of image from url

24416590
actualheight	actualwidth
i know you can use xamlreader.parse to create an object tree from the xaml parse that into its top level object and if that object is a frameworkelement or a uielement you can use the actualwidth actualheight or measure to figure out how big an object w size auto actually is

24416663
post	get
when i click on save and with php examine the post data i get the following result

24416671

the problem is everytime i call a modal or load something my jquery plugins like icheck or tooltipster do not work so i have to call them all again with callback

24416710
hide	show
you could also show an activity indicator when you make the request and hide it in this method

24416724
pop-up	dialog
custom print when you click print button report opens in new tab window in browser as pdf and automatically pop-up print dialog

each cell of gridview contains a image that has same width and height

24416859
maven	m2e
now m2e requires explicit instructions what to do with all maven plugins bound to interesting phases of a project build lifecycle

24416859
m2e	pom.xml
by either configure the lifecycle mapping in your project s pom.xml or use specific m2e configurator eclipse plugin if somebody has kindly created it for the community

24416859
maven	m2e
m2e allows you to run maven manually

24416859
maven	m2e
unfortunately maven is also invoked automagically from m2e whenever eclipse builds the project for example after a clean

24416860
swift	objective-c
i thought i d be cautious and try out swift on an existing objective-c project by converting one class

24416860
swift	objective-c
transliterating the original objective-c into swift should be straightforward and so it seemed

24416860
swift	objective-c
if and the caps are intentional nscoding swift gives the same persistent content as nscoding objective-c then my all objective-c version should be able to read what is encoded by swift and vice versa

24416860
swift	objective-c
this proves not to be the case - and my perfectly-functioning objective-c version crashes out when it tries to read the persistent store from the swift version

24416860
swift	objective-c
i can t write objective-c and read swift and i can write swift read objective-c and i can t read write in swift

i have already tried with the wsimport and wsdl2java but it doesnt generate all the classes i need maybe i didnt put the right options

24417054
min	max
anyway if you want to keep the position fixed the min max width and the #maincontent s auto filling width then probably you should use some javascript jquery will do and calculate on initialize and resize the #leftbanner width and the remaing window with so that you can give your #maincontent div the right width and margin-left padding-left or just left with position absolute

24417177
post	get

int	double
i am using bufferedreader to read a line of int and double from a csv file

24417520
free	malloc
i know m_attr is going away when valuestrategy object is destructed but the memory that was allocated using malloc that it points to is not getting free d in that destruction so i don t understand why the calling code crashes using the pointer returned by the get call in the 2nd case and not the 1st

24417627
getter	setter
if they are simple getter and setter then you can delete the ones you have right now and then recreate them by groups

24417627
getter	setter
so after you delete them place caret below all class members and press alt + insert on your keyboard then choose getter and setter and then select member you want to create in the first batch

24417627
getter	setter
this is how i do in cases when i have pure getter and setter

swift	objective-c
according to the using swift with objective-c book all of the following types are automatically bridged to nsnumber

24417964
integer	unsigned
a relatively fast way is to precompute a table of the bit counts for all byte values and to sum for the four bytes of the unsigned integer

24417965
button	checkbox
i m trying to develop a cms where users can create dynamic forms with their own specific questions question help text and possible answers in case of radio button checkbox

24418052
folder	directory
you just need to remove the eclipse directory in c users folder then start it again

24418132
swift	objective-c
i saw rncryptor that of course is written in objective-c and it could be integrated in a swift project but when i add the files to the project x-code doesn t asks me if i want to integrate them and it doesn t make the bridging header

24418151
maven	pom.xml
above mentioned fact is may be clear for maven users there is lot of pom.xml files but gradle users must create such builds on their own and this information may be useful for them

24418208
int	chars
the problem is that isdigit expects the input must be a chars with int value between 0 and 255

24418211
addclass	removeclass
you can use the functions addclass and removeclass to add or remove a class to your element

24418272
istream	getline
istream.oef and most other methods instead of while std getline istream strline but i keep getting the same error

24418384
cairngorm	flex
i m using flex 3 with cairngorm framework

24418421
width	height
my assumption is that my browsers interpret width 1em as this element has width of one height of the font currently being in use and since most of the fonts use golden ratio for width height proportions i have no better explanation for the fact that the width of these two green div s are in golden ratio - 1 1.61803

24418434
folder	directory
and the assets folder is of course one directory up from the executable

24418434
folder	directory
i have used getcwd to determine that the working directory for my game is and then i have included the assets folder in the application bundle in the directory but qimage.load still returns false and furthermore calling returns -1

24418477
post	get
this is one of my issues with rails default rest routes as provided by resources and i usually change the update post to go to the edit page or somewhere with a get variant at least for that very reason

24418540
filtering	grouping
i want to filtering the range using a predicate and the range needs to be grouping

24418570
inherited	properties
or i need to find a way to inherited properties of parent scope

24418585
globalization	localization
i have partially implemented globalization localization in my project

24418585
post	get
i coded the get and post controller actions which work as intended except that i was unable to persist the culture cultureui settings

24418615
width	height
with that being said your best bet will be using the border radius approach which dictates that you probably want to have the height width to be the exact same when in use

24418652
folder	dir
as jigar joshi pointed out you installed a jre and is in the wrong dir the name of the folder is jdk-8u5-windows-i586

24418691
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade the ie versioning to 11

24418695
iron-router	collectionfs
i can add other packages fine such as iron-router or collectionfs not sure what s causing the issue

24418721
post	get
when using the post method you must get the request stream write the data to be posted and close the stream

24418722
superclass	subclassing
i initially created an abstract method in a superclass that is overridden in all subclassing

24418723
post	get
your routes are configured for a post request however you are attempting to visit that page using a get request

24418723
post	get
either change your config routes.rb file to collect get request or send a post request for the url

24418729
hide	show
everything works ok but within the methods of the uiwebview i need to detect what url i eventually end up on because i must parse this url to determine whether to show or hide navigation

24418742
getter	setter
the fields are random hence using map for getter and setter

24418773
int	double
for these types of calculations you want to cast to double precision because sqrt int is usually not an int

24418780
getter	setter
activerecord defines setter and getter methods for all fields in the database table of a model and ruby allows you to silently override those in your class definition

24418785
deb	dmg
and open unpack only arj cab chm cpio cramfs deb dmg fat hfs iso lzh lzma mbr msi nsis ntfs rar rpm squashfs udf vhd wim xar and z

24418955
swift	objective-c
remarks background of course high-level functions using high-level data structures like swift string or objective-c nsstring are preferable

24419007
udp	tcp
you could use both udp and tcp to communicate different things but that adds a lot of complexity

24419007
udp	tcp
25 nearby players and all of their gameplay data usernames etc. tcp or udp

24419007
udp	tcp
this is more of a scaling issue than a tcp vs udp issue

24419027
post	put
edit apparently i need 10 reputation to put images in my post

24419039
for-loop	loops
more importantly your example creates and instantly destroys the fork objects they never survive loops and you actually call loops function inside your for-loop so probably you don t loops more than once

24419062
folder	directory
it can often be easiest to just select the entire folder and upload all the files and directory at once

24419068
ethernet	wireless
it obviously has to have an ethernet or wireless port shield but otherwise it doesn t matter

24419078
loops	if-statement
inside your main loops but outside of the event handler if-statement check for the player s movement state

24419088
viewdidload	viewwillappear
then in your .m file initialize the deck most likely in viewdidload or viewwillappear using something like this

24419093
for-loop	loops
i noticed when i put the procedure in a for-loop to loops over all ids it takes longer than running it one at a time i could be wrong but this is what i noticed from running it a couple of times

24419144
put	get
to get the behavior you want you ll either need to define a macro so that you can prevent evaluation and put the form inside a function or to construct a list that you coerce to a function

24419157
folder	directory
create lib directory in the root folder of the play project just put the jar there

24419171
post	get
you can use .post .get or a more general .ajax here you specify manually if the data should be sent in post or get format

24419178
google-chrome	firefox
i tried it in google-chrome and firefox

24419254
vb.net	vb6
vb.net handles nullable types a bit different than c# so vb.net can be backwards compatible with vb6

24419264
min	max
i know i can ditch the min max or give it a static width to resolve the issue but i d like to try to find a solution before i give up

24419264
width	height
i plan on covering this with a fixed navigation bar of the same width and 100 height

24419330
cashapelayer	calayer	cashapelayer	careplicatorlayer	careplicatorlayer	calayer
i ve managed to get the effect with a still image using a calayer masking it with a triangle cashapelayer then replicating it with careplicatorlayer

24419347
jasmine	mocha	jasmine	qunit	mocha	qunit
on top of the rails layer it uses jasmine mocha or qunit as browser test frameworks

24419359
min	max
to make your code even better you can also check if the value is between min and max

24419362
min	max
try putting a container around the content and flaot left and right and dropping the min and max width

elasticsearch	kibana
i have setup elasticsearch and kibana in amazon vpc where two elasticsearch instances forming a cluster stay in the private subnet and other node having kibana nginx sitting in public subnet

24419409
elasticsearch	kibana
when i do curl -xget and curl -xget from kibana node it works fine where es_node1 and es_node2 are two nodes of elasticsearch cluster

24419409
elasticsearch	kibana
in config.js file of kibana i ve tried putting private ip or private dns name of the elasticsearch instance but it doesn t work

24419409
elasticsearch	kibana
please note that elasticsearch nodes are accessible from kibana node using curl from command line

24419409
elasticsearch	kibana
i suspect the issue is that until and unless elasticsearch cluster is made public put in public subnet kibana would keep showing that error

24419433
post	get
now when i try to post again and every time after the first successful message post i get an error your credentials do not allow access to this resource

24419466
put	get
here s a quick adaptation i did of the example page i tried to put it on jsfiddle but couldn t get it to run

24419505
width	height
notice i m using half the width and height as that is what the setasbox function requires

24419517
submit	submission
my main problem is that the script isnt running when im submission the form when there even some errors at the form what the user submit it still goes to the next page and no innerhtml massage is shown

24419519
getter	setter
both generate a bunch of classes with getter and setter properties and attributes which detail meta data this is done automatically when you drag and drop database tables onto the data context

24419528
for-loop	arrays
then i want to use a for-loop to reference the elements of each arrays the user selected in the zenity prompt like

24419551
implements	extends
i am trying to implements the below i know how to use 2 columns but i need to extends it to more than 2 columns

24419554
google-chrome	firefox
i had the same issue and have found that using u+2b51 and u+2b52 black small star and black white star displays consistently between google-chrome and firefox

24419586

this code has been tested on osx 10.9.3 ubuntu 14.04 3.13.0-24-generic and freebsd 10.0

24419690
min	max
i placed the min max fluid div inside the content div and covered it up with a fixed div of the same dimensions

24419694
min	max
the min max sizes may not be needed unless you are making this responsive

24419729
put	get
i am trying to get my list of tags but using a foreach so that i can put each tag into a list element

24419744
addition	multiplication
if you had a function that would be written with only addition and multiplication such as

24419752
hide	show
another method is to quickly show hide the element which i ve used below

24419781
google-chrome	firefox
i am trying to develop a firefox extension to have the same functionality as of existing google-chrome plugin

24419807
folder	directory
delete the cache full page cache if it exists sessions and log folder from with the var directory

24419812
folder	directory
this will save the directory you need to protect in the shared folder where the symlink is sent to

24419901
width	height
it just sets width and height to 15cm

24419951
ubuntu	linux
to retrieve the contents of a directory recursively on linux ubuntu i m using the following raii struct

24419967
libstdc++	libc++	clang	llvm
is a clang not gcc option and tells clang to use llvm libc++ standard library which is what clang uses rather than gnu libstdc++ which is what gcc uses

24419967
libstdc++	libc++
since you got linking errors it seems likely that other packages you are using were compiled with clang and libc++ which is not abi compatible with gcc s libstdc++ except for some low-level stuff

24419968
hash	md5
you should look up how to hash passwords but be aware of broken algorithms like md5 etc

24419968
crypt	salt
i usually tend to go with crypt with a random bytes salt

24419974
int	double
a simple trick to round to nearest is to add 0.5 before converting a double float to an int

24419987
google-chrome	firefox
whether .scrollwidth includes the right-side padding depends on the browser firefox differs from google-chrome so you can either add a subjective good enough number of pixels to .scrollwidth or replace it with your own width-calculation function

24419987
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
tested to work in ie7 ie8 ie9 ie10 ie11 firefox 30 google-chrome 35 and opera 22

24419989

even though the functions below return a tuple of double and an int they can both be defined as function types

24420042
google-chrome	firefox

24420090
mouseup	mousedown
this is especially important when interacting with the dom which outputs a lot of events mousedown mouseup touchmove resize etc... and it s preferred to use subscribe when listening to a dom element

24420126
metaclass	subclassing
typeerror metaclass conflict the metaclass of a derived class must be a non-strict subclassing of the metaclass of all its bases

24420203
post	get
i need clarity on how to get my post variables to show up in my html variable mpdf is using

24420208
division	multiplication
the same way you can define multiplication as a series of additions you can make a division as a series of subtractions

24420276
post	put
id and joindate are of course properties that are readonly and will not allow a change through a put post request

24420278
integer	unsigned
unsigned integer

24420322
getter	setter
i have configured a customized template for getter and setter javadocs in eclipse s code templates

24420322
getter	setter
however it s only used when i use the generate getter and setter dialog which creates the methods

24420322
getter	setter
the template is not used when creating javadoc comments for existing getter and setter either by simply typing or by right clicking the method and choosing source generate element comment

24420322
getter	setter
when i do that eclipse seems to be using the generic method template not the specific getter or setter template

24420334
post	get
in the past i have just submitted the form and used some get post variables to create the correct table however this project is a bit more complex and i would like to have a dynamic form

24420418
hide	show
you have 2 listeners one show it then immediately another one hide it. if forgetting the . before portfo in the second function was a typo anyways

24420427
int	double
a naked 0 is an int literal in c++ so it appears you are trying to fill an int by casting double to int then adding those up

24420427
int	double
just to be very explicit about the fact that you are converting a sum of double s to int

24420427
int	double
if you are adding up double s and they are intended to add up to some int value you probably want to explicitly round to the closest value -- int casting always rounds down which could be very surprising if the result of the summation was 5.99999991587151

24420428
folder	directory
i see express express.cmd and node_modules directory with express and express-generator folder in the c users me appdata roaming npm directory

24420484
min	max
since your log statements are displaying numeric values you can tell that the contents of the dictionary max and min keys are not arrays

24420486
google-chrome	firefox
is this something with google-chrome because firefox does not bug in that way the resuming works perfectly and so on

24420487
hide	show
also i d change it from hide show to toggle so that it will simply make it visible if it s hidden and hide it if it s visible

24420530
instances	transient
i also use the jpacloner to clone my entity so i get new transient cloned entity and i can therefore save a new instances in database with the same fields but the profilid field

24420538
getter	setter
under preferences java code style code templates there s a getter body and a setter body which can be edited by clicking edit on the upper right of the fields outline view

24420563
multiplying	division
you don t actually need a single division anywhere all you need to do is multiplying the threshold x by n to get a minimum digit sum at the very start to which you can then compare sums of multisets

24420563
children	parent
furthermore with the previous suggestion for how to generate children the sum of a child is always exactly 1 less than the sum of its parent so we don t even need a loop to calculate the sum -- it s a constant-time operation

24420563
children	parent
the way around this is to figure out a rule by which each child can pick a unique parent and then arrange things so that parent only generate the children for which they would be the picked parent

24420563
children	parent
but during dfs we generate children from parent and not the other way round so we still need to transform this rule for picking a parent into something that tells us when we are at a node that is potentially the parent of some other node whether it is in fact the picked parent for that child

24420607
folder	directory
then simply go to the directory in your pc that has the jar file and copy it and right click on the lib folder in your project and click paste

24420615
children	parent
after few hours of investigation it turner out that i forked out children then demonized parent which forks it which effectively turned all children into orphans

24420615
children	parent
i moved parent daemonization to occur before forking children and everything started to work flawlessly

24420615
children	parent
so if you get this mysterious echld error and you did not mess with sigchld signal handler - check if those children are actually still your children and children s ppid is equal to parent s pid

24420617
onresume	onpause
onpause - onnewintent - onresume

24420649
width	margin
to set the right margin equal to the left margin dynamically i would let flot draw the plot once set the right margin equal to the yaxis s width and then redraw the plot

24420683
int	double
it will return the closest int value given a double

24420690
jobs	cron
our current portal has a bunch of cron jobs which sync all of our client contact and invoice records from our whmcs billing system but this is a really horrible way to do it

24420722
getter	setter
getter and setter are still just methods

24420783
int	double	subtract	add
the simplest method you get taught in most basic computer science classes is probably to add 0.5 or subtract it if your double is below 0 and simply cast it to int

24420792
post	get
i have to build a query to get users that did not received and alert about new post

24420792
post	get
i want to get all users that didn t have a record on postalertusers for each post in post that isn t from the same user

24420792
post	get
i want to get all users that aren t already warned about a post so it will not have a record on postalertusers for this user and post combination but will have a record on post from a user other that itself

24420797
short	base
if you are not using c++11 and can t use boost you can bring the proposed implementation of the standard to your code base it is short enough

24420814
inherited	properties
be aware that for...in loops iterate inherited properties you may want to check options.hasownproperty name to avoid that

24420880
button	checkbox
have some checkbox button in html that i would like to filter the results via the api on.click over ajax

24420880
sorting	filtering
the result of the find or aggregate would be a callback of data filtering to match the toggled voting booleans..and then sorting them by descending rank

24420894
winhttp	indy	winhttp	libcurl
you can use any http client indy ics synapse libcurl wininet winhttp raw winsock calls etc to download the html

24421342
google-chrome	firefox
though this code works on firefox but not on ie or google-chrome

24421370
firefox	safari
quite interestingly firefox will work for 1 minute after i am using safari with that auth proxy

24421370
firefox	safari
however if i am not touching safari for 1 or 2 minutes firefox will stop working and pop up the similar error message

24421380
factors	mean
by saying condition i mean factors like scalability peaktime et cetera

24421429
inherited	properties
the cool thing is that the child scope will inherited that bit of parental controller properties from the parent

24421429
children	parent
they both have a message property on their scopes but they are easily distinguished without digging through parent children siblings etc

24421459
width	height
in size x and y are double default type of float literal but in point width and height are float

24421501
vbo	vao
i can t combine them all in one vao vbo because the combination can change this is drawing text with each character having its own vao vbo combo

24421510
children	parent
topterm is the outermost parent and childterm is the child which can have as many children as possible

24421537
pull	push
you don t need to change anything you just push and pull from your fork instead of the original

24421537
pull	push
however usually one sets the default path to save specifying the repo for each push and pull

24421548
lodash	underscore.js
i d use a utility library like lodash or underscore.js that would be more robust than this solution but you could do something like this if you didn t want to rely on native prototype methods on the array

24421591
google-chrome	firefox
1 google-chrome firefox is fine but slow in ie8

24421608

put	get
you could easily just put the logic in the get piece and not define a set

24440225
min	max
you can turn it off or adjust its performance characteristics using the connection string options pooling connection reset connection lifetime cache server properties max pool size and min pool size

24440233
for-loop	arrays
it s an arrays with dictionaries - how i can cast this nsarray into a dictionary with a for-loop

laravel	codeigniter
i come from a php background and have extensively used laravel zend and codeigniter but now i am trying to learn a whole new language alongside a whole new mvc

24440510
put	get
it throws an error and when the query is analyzed the array that you put in first get gets appended as part of the select

24440533
d3.js	dc.js
you could use dc.js it simplifies making d3.js charts and retains the flexibility

24440551
ccscene	cclayer
i know that ccscene doesn t have setopacity and have seen that some guys advice using cclayer for scenes but then ccdirector pushscene accepts ccscene as the argument

24440582
int	double
that means that everything even primitive types like int or double has a class object in the jdk

24440582
int	boolean
int boolean vs

24440609
postgresql	mysql
it seems to be designed to allow a developer to load up a bunch of drivers and then connect to any supported database without knowing or caring what the db implementation was mysql postgresql oracle etc. i have never seen this as a useful feature

24440631
textmate	sublimetext
i want to use this textmate bundle because the bundle for sublimetext is really bad

24440635
post	get
when i am visiting blog.example.com i ve got static#index action response and get posts#index when visiting blog.example.com post

24440651
stdout	stderr
error messages belong on stderr not stdout

24440673
hide	show
it doesn t run the show hide so i think the bug has to do with how i m attempting to call the js file but i m unsure what i m doing wrong here

24440698
getter	setter
solution use getter setter pattern to void direct access of public field

24440708
pyenv	virtualenv
what isn t covered is that when you create a virtualenv in pyenv it shows up as a version

24440708
pyenv	virtualenv
this drops a .python-version file with the python version which pyenv reads and uses as the virtualenv python

24440708
pyenv	virtualenv
just remember to manage your virtualenv like python versions of pyenv and you should be able to keep things straight

24440708
pyenv	virtualenv
if you did pyenv shell you will need to pyenv shell --unset or pyenv shell another_version to move virtualenv

24440723
gruntjs	yeoman
what i did for a solution is to remove the absoluteurl function call from the index with a gruntjs task running the asset handling yeoman tasks then place it back after everything is ok

24440727
margin	height
put the top as 50 then use a negative top margin to compensate for half the height plus half of the height of the header too

24440759
hash	salt
the client sends the password in the clear and the server hash it with the salt

24440759
hash	salt
if an attacker could log in with the salt hash alone thus not needing to know the original password it makes the salt and hash less useful

24440761
ready	each
render is called each time the device is ready to update the screen

24440768
mongodb	bson
going into node_modules mongodb node_modules bson directory and from there use

24440768
g++	gcc
sounds like you didn t have gcc g++ make python 2.x installed when you used npm to install the bson module

24440776
fullcalendar	momentjs
since you will be dealing with time which is always troublesome you will probably want to familiarize yourself with momentjs recently integrated into fullcalendar v2 as well as moment.php a php port of momentjs for the backend

24440804
braces	reformatting
the braces layout was not one of the reasons i dislike noelkd s reformatting

24440838
stdout	stderr
all the psexec approaches upload a binary that is a windows service that provides named pipes for stdin stderr stdout and a mini protocol to send commands to execute

24440845
dictionary	map
ordinarily the dictionary map key-value data structure doesn t store or care about the order of the keys

24440854
hash	md5
your second problem is that md5 is a cryptographic hash and so has been explicitly designed to prevent someone doing what you are trying to do

24440901
put	get
once the root_url is loaded in the browser there is a javascript that fires a get and a put each one to its respective controller api in the application

24440947
min	max
add properties to hold set min and max

24440947
min	max
you could add checking to make sure min value max but i have left that out for simplicity

24440947
min	max
then adjust the value property to check it stays between min and max

24440954
jobs	cron
i don t have experience writing cron jobs but it seems that would presumably just run a file watching script at a regular interval

24440954
sqoop	hadoop
i was hoping to find something built into hadoop or at least a tool used almost exclusively with hadoop like flume or sqoop

24440959
google-chrome	safari
wow64 applewebkit 537.36 khtml like gecko google-chrome 35.0.1916.153 safari 537.36

24440991
onclick	onsubmit
certain elements will have onsubmit and onclick attributes that will not be handled by react but should still call a javascript function

24440998
getter	setter
as you re aware csvbeanreader and csvbeanwriter can t handle indexed or nested mapping so there has to be getter setter on the parent class to access the child class fields

24441056
udp	tcp
the standard so_type socket option which returns values like sock_stream corresponding to tcp and sock_dgram corresponding to udp should suffice

24441056
sctp	tcp
with sctp sock_stream might correspond to tcp or sctp and so_protocol is useful to distinguish them but macos x does not support sctp

24441078
rcharts	nvd3.js
issues that we face here that cause us to require this hack are the draw function in the standard rcharts template does not offer us a place to add bits of code for nvd3.js and the afterscript for nvd3.js falls outside of our draw so is called before the chart is rendered

24441080
translation	localization
what i am trying to do here is defining a key that is used for localization in the dialog template which is passed to the component template and translation there

24441119
gridview	repeater
my itemtemplate contains a repeater instead of the gridview

24441149
children	parent
children will always appear above their parent

24441153
hide	show
then i use show and hide in the button

24441153
hide	show
to show or hide

24441153
hide	show
the issue is that this means to add a bunch of variables while i was trying to put everything inside the button that does the show hide functionality i know that this is not portable and good oop design i am exploring various options

24441153
hide	show
if i declare it as variable outside the click code i can t get the values for getextremes and i can remove the label simply using show hide

24441179
google-chrome	firefox
i vaguely understand that this is because of how page elements are handled differently in firefox as compared to that in google-chrome or ie

24441180
post	get
though in browser console i get source but i can not understand why my post does not get any value in the action productsubmission

24441180
post	get
can any one help i just need the controller to get the selected option value on post or even a text value on post

24441180
post	get
i am not able to get any value from view to controller and my model has also all properties null in post

24441237

if i take one of those records and i call .tagable on it and i can get the blog post but i m wondering if there is a way i can query and get an activerecord collection for all the matching blog post

24441249
width	height
if you play around with the width and height of the window the images keep proportionate w h based on their aspect ratio

24441249
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
also notice how wider images vs thinner images are resized when just the width of the browser window not width and height together is reduced - the images bounce down from the top margin

24441249
width	height
looking at the source the images top left width height css properties are dynamically being altered

24441254
put	get
if i put the line before super.init then i get the error

24441254
put	get
if i put it after i get the error

24441293
matplotlib	scipy	matplotlib	canopy
i recently updated a number of packages and my version of epd canopy to1.4.1.1975 and now i m unable to import pandas numpy scipy or matplotlib

24441368
width	height
if a uilabel has a leading constraint and a top constraint but no other constraints then its width and height are determined by its intrinsic size

24441421
namenode	hdfs
if it is a test environment and you are willing to lose any existing data in hdfs you could cleanup the datanode directories and namenode directories and reformat dfs

24441421
namenode	hdfs
finally reformat dfs with hdfs namenode -format

24441435
post	get
this will get back all post for all friends there s a limit of 1000 max records per query 100 is the default limit .

24441457
width	height
i want to know width and height of image while it is in clipboard because if dimensions are too small then message like image is too small should appear

24441503
sudo	passwd
with caching sudo credentials the user of your script needs to enter his her passwd only once

24441527
hide	show
2 right it is a good practice to not add the ids but we are nesting these components and show hide by using these ids

24441527
hide	show
so we have to manually show hide the tab

24441596
google-chrome	firefox
as far as i understand i should be able to just open the example.html file using either firefox or google-chrome and i should see a nice grid there

24441626
flann	surf
at the moment i am using surf for detecting keypoints and extracting descriptors out of the images and flann for tracking them

24441645
versioning	upgrade
please remember to upgrade the jar when new versioning will be rolled out

24441713
struts	sitemesh
the reason for the unexpected data is due to how sitemesh works when sending the response at some point it forces struts to ignore any if-modified-since header writing the requested content to the response buffer

24441713
struts	sitemesh
is it an apache server bug or a tomcat bug or a struts bug or a sitemesh bug

24441713
struts	sitemesh
to replicate the problem you need a tomcat behind apache running a struts webapp with sitemesh in it and fetch this url twice while fiddler2 is active

24441741
width	height
it needs to have width height and data within expressed in percentages so everything scales with the page

24441741
width	height
i also tried but when you reduce window width graph height is reduced.

24441752
min	max
every time you call random.randint min max you get a new random number

24441760
post	get
look the section get the access token of the account owner and post responses at

24441786
min	max	range	min	range	max
in other words within your loop for count in range rolls every time you execute random.randint min max you can get different numbers and thus exit the loop without a print statement

24441786
min	max
also based on your min max values you are only generating random values from 1-6 not 1-12

24441788
google-chrome	safari
intel mac os x 10_9_3 applewebkit 537.36 khtml like gecko google-chrome 35.0.1916.153 safari 537.36

24441810
getter	setter
and the foo class which is just a string name and a int bar plus getter setter

24441811
getter	setter
first you need a class variable for example _bar then we adjust the property getter and setter methods to alter this instead of an instance variable

24441829
division	subtraction
other operations such as division and subtraction can be done with mathematical symbols

24441904
fflush	gets
in your case it looks like it means fflush buffers so your program gets access to the terminal s line-buffered input of asdf

24441935
addslashes	htmlspecialchars
addslashes expects strings not arrays and similar with htmlspecialchars

24441941
google-chrome	firefox
ie works fine but when using google-chrome or firefox this text box is having the autocomplete off attribute appended to it which is exactly opposite of what i need

24441942
put	get
i think i have put a range to plot point to get the example i below

24441963
folder	directory
i have a directory in the public folder called exports and when i run my code no image is saved to the directory and i do not get any errors

24441966
for-loop	loops
to comply with the three requirements i suggest writing a simple for-loop doing one request per loops

24441972
puts	gets
that s a lot of gets and puts and checking of values

24441977
int	chars
they only work with int short chars and byte types

24442017
ciimage	nsbitmapimagerep
if i convert the nsbitmapimagerep to a ciimage and draw using ciimage drawinrect then it s about 10 faster

24442101
zipalign	build-tools
your system then copying zipalign from the build-tools 19.1.0

24442118
pop-up	dialog
my problem is that whenever i run this code the file dialog pop-up before the main gui with the actual browse button pop-up

24442121
post	put
michael hunger put together an excellent blog post on memory mapped settings for fast load csv performance

24442136
post	get
assuming you have enabled viewstate you get most if not all of the original data from the page load when you post back to the server

24442175
pop-up	dialog
i note as soon as the pop-up loads it shows up # ui-state dialog in the url

24442211
rank	max
if you want all rows with the max use rank or dense_rank instead of row_number

24442257
google-chrome	firefox
but if i use google-chrome or firefox when i click on my submit only one time it works fine

24442259
google-chrome	firefox
then all of a sudden about 8 weeks ago uploads from mac osx mountain lion with firefox and google-chrome latest versions stopped working

24442259
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
safari however still works perfectly fine as does firefox google-chrome and ie on windows

24442259
google-chrome	firefox
only firefox and google-chrome on mac osx mountain lion stopped working

24442259
google-chrome	firefox
we have chunking enabled and watching the server when doing uploads from firefox and google-chrome on osx we can see that the first chunk folder and first chunk gets created and then there is no response from the server so back on the client side fineuploader will just be stuck at x whatever percentage depends on the size of the file being uploaded with x being the chunksize filesize 100

24442259
google-chrome	firefox
it is possible that both firefox and google-chrome on the test system in question were updated auto updates are eanbled just before this problem occurred

24442259
google-chrome	firefox
again the confounding thing is everything worked fine then suddenly stopped working for only firefox and google-chrome on osx

24442274
osx	yosemite
i am currently using xcode 5 on my macbook pro which is running osx yosemite

24442317
google-chrome	safari
also to give an explanation of what i think is happening - ios hijacks any video content safari or google-chrome and plays it using the native video player

24442342
google-chrome	safari
the transition works as expected in safari however in google-chrome it just shows instantly no transition

24442346
swift	objective-c
there is a bit of a mismatch between objective-c initializers which may return nil and swift s init semantics

24442372
versioning	upgrade
please i want to add a button in my app titled upgrade to pro versioning

24442381
int	chars	int	double
i understand that dword is double word and is a 32bit int but some of the arguments ask for an axis like x y and z...why would they want a number when they could ve just asked for a chars

24442386
pull	push
so i m trying to come up with a way to benchmark iops in a command git for some of it s different operations push pull merge clone

24442387
cout	cin
for example you type in order to use std cout and std cin

24442544

mouseleave	mouseenter
on mouseenter is when the mouse is hovered over and mouseleave is returning the back to its regular state

24442558
post	get
the main goal is to get the hangouts id and post it to my server

24442601
width	height
and define a width and height to your div to show your image like

24442661
width	height
seems like on retina displays we are required to serve 2x images and then specify the dimensions as half width and half height

24442661
width	height
this is kind of annoying because you have to a look up the dimensions of the image then b manually type in the 50 amount for the width and the height so that it doesn t show as double size

24442696
stdout	stderr
with stdout and stderr redirected you can then background the process

24442709
awt	swing
as an aside -- swing builds ontop of awt - awt has a lot of problems most of which are marked as wont-fix by the java project openjdk oracle

24442709
awt	swing
swing was built to replace fix awt however sometimes you will marry awt objects into your swing application

24442709
awt	swing
i would not bother with learning awt if you learn swing you are learning awt for the most part

24442709
awt	swing
the largest difference with swing vs awt is swing components start with the letter j

24442722
swift	objective-c
i have a coretext that works in objective-c and the migration to swift is driving me nuts

24442739
background-position	background-size
each background just renders 1 line the background-size is the same for all the background is just about 2px height and the background-position should be different

24442751
folder	directory
the sinatra app works fine when accessing it via ip but when accessing the site via the domain i get an index of the folder in the directory on my home location on the server

24442755
width	margin
for the landing page i was able to get the three photos to align regardless of the width of the viewer s monitor size by setting up max-width and margin to auto

24442785
ubuntu	linux
no because you d be trying to transfer a virtualenv created for a python on a windows machine and hoping it would work under a python on linux ubuntu

24442785
apache	nginx
then configure apache or nginx to reverse proxy all needed dynamic traffic to that server see this so answer as an example

24442821
children	parent
the compile and link process is a one way street - meaning parent are compiled before children

24442825
children	parent
and because of that i think that means there is no way outside of javascript to size the parent container to the max of its children columns heights

24442906
doxygen	docset
when building core plot documentation doxygen makes the docset folder inside the core plot framework folder and copies it to your library from there

24442949
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i am trying to vertically center the contents of .onesizechart which i have working in both google-chrome and safari but does not work in either firefox or ie

24442949
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome and safari the contents displays like so on hover but in firefox and ie the contents display like this when i hover

24442958
ng-init	ng-show
using the ng-show directive in combination with the ng-click and ng-init directives we can do something like this

24442958
hide	show
in our html we use ng-click to set up our click event handler for our show all and hide all buttons

24442959
spaces	delimiter
actually the scan function will remove spaces or tabs if they are not specified as the delimiter from any value that is not a character as it process the input stream

24442985
ubuntu	linux
i m working on ubuntu linux to build android and linux binary

24442993

24443019
mouse	keyboard
instead of moving the mouse to the top right corner i want to have a keyboard shortcut that gives me the window overview effect showing all open maximized windows

24443042
google-chrome	firefox
i would consider logging this.model and inspecting the object into a browser google-chrome or firefox then look into the attributes property of the object

24443067
typedef	struct
the typedef struct are defined in the .h and #include in the .c

24443087
profiling	instrumentation
in the instrumentation app an invert call tree can be inspected in various profiling modules

24443094
addclass	removeclass
its probably better to manage your selected attributes as a separate class then it becomes a matter of using jquery to either addclass or removeclass as required - as seen in this jsfiddle

24443115
alarmmanager	appwidgetprovider
to do so set an alarm with an intent that your appwidgetprovider receives using the alarmmanager

24443117
x86	64bit
the installation is essentially for a stand-alone version now but after you have installed you can go into the flash builder installation folder on windows that will be under c program files adobe flash builder 4.7 64bit or c program files x86 adobe flash builder 4.7 for the 32-bit version

24443137
cpu	processors
based on cpu load it switches between the more power hungry 1.6 ghz and the less power hungry 1.2 ghz processors but only one of these can run at a time

24443142
salt	md5	hmac	md5
but unfortunately there was no hmac so i decided to use md5 with a salt because this was taking too much of my time

24443158
cpu	processors
it seamlessly switches between cortex-a15 and cortex-a7 processors selecting the optimum cpu by workload thereby saving power

24443217
children	parent
each node in the tree contains an object of my choosing and a link to each of each children and possibly parent

24443225
disk	ram
each pc uniquely specifying by a code in the table pc is characterized by model foreign key referencing to product table speed of the processor in mhz total amount of ram - ram in mb hard disk drive capacity - hd in gb cd rom speed - cd for example 4x and the price

24443227
crossfilter	dc.js
if i were to do this project again i might have tried exploring the libraries dc.js and crossfilter as to try to avoid writing some of my filtering logic

24443268
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this works in ie and firefox but the opacity and associated css transition is not properly applied to the child elements of the tag in google-chrome and safari

24443268
google-chrome	safari
if i add an explicit rule for a as a child element it works in google-chrome and safari

24443285
memset	strncpy
also it is poor style to use memset and strncpy like that

24443285
memcpy	strcpy
either strcpy or memcpy should be preferred depending on what you want

24443310
jar	manifest.mf
there should be a meta-inf folder inside of your jar the manifest.mf file should be in that folder of the jar

24443348
children	parent
one to many relationships where the children are embedded in the parent document

24443348
children	parent
one to many relationships where the children are stored in a separate collection from the parent document

24443415
width	height
i am relatively new to js and i am trying to build an iframe generator based on a selected width and height

24443480
width	height
when you move the mouse around the position of the mouse cursor is assigned to the div with the css method left mouse cursor coordinate minus half the width of the div and top mouse cursor corrdinate minus half the height of the div

24443480
mousemove	mouseup
the code then unbinds the mousemove from the document and swaps the position of the closest div with the oldest position of the div that just got the mouseup

24443512
cos	sin
the sin cos functions now seem to lead to a better result

24443532
domxpath	domdocument
using curl is a good start but its not going to be enough as hanky suggested you need to also use domdocument and also you can include domxpath

24443557
profiling	debugging
it s much better for less technical testers since once they have given you their device id s the simply install new app versions by clicking a link in an email no need to send around provisioning profiling etc....it also gives you great debugging crash device os data

24443564
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	opera	safari
it works fine on ie firefox google-chrome opera safari ios.

preorder	postorder
defaultmutabletree has predefined methods like add - to add child it uses enumeration and provides standard methods to access child nodes using preorder and postorder processing

24443652
loops	if-statement
however this if-statement is independent of the loops

24443652
loops	if-statement
if not how big of a cost is an if-statement like this inside of a loops

24443680
noexcept	throw

essentially this part makes a substring of one chars at the index determined by the random int generated above

24458346
width	height
i found that finding the width and height on the current layout no matter the device and then dividing those values by 3 then taking the value divided by 3 and creating an int variable which is then used along with buttonheight and buttonwidth works great on all devices to keep the button within screen

box-sizing	border-box
this definitely has to do with the fact bootstrap and kendo rely on different box models and the difficulties in making elements that rely on box-sizing border-box intermix with those that rely on box-sizing content-box

24458394
width	border-box
in content-box they re part of the width of an element in border-box they re not

what i finally did was create a new folder with in tomcat s directory structure include it in tomcat s classpath and then put my properties file there

24458501
hide	show
for the toggling i guess you will need some simple javascript to do some show hide which could be done fairly simply either using an existing framework such as bootstrap or some simple jquery all you would need to do is have a reference of the image tag to the checkbox so that it knows that when it is checked that the image should change state

24458504
put	get
when i put that in i get the error

width	height
this assumes that w and h are actually the width and height of your viewport

24458796
children	parent
i m needing a way to link subsequent rows with previous rows children to a parent

24458796
children	parent
if the parent has 3 children rows 3 4 5 they re going to contain an s or d in column e

24458796
children	parent
if there s an s or d i need to fine the last row searching up that has an m and then grab the value from the b column in that row which is a unique id for the parent and insert it into a column in rows 3 4 5 to create a relationship between the 3 children and the one parent

24458796
children	parent
there will be cases where there are no children to any number of children and so far we ve been assured that the next row up will always be the parent for the subsequent children rows

width	height
the only thing i can think of is measuring the width of the popup element and correct the coordinates based on the width height of the popup

24458981
memcpy	strcpy
tried with memcpy strcpy but didnt work

24458996
folder	directory
the package manager extracts all the files into a temp folder and returns the directory they were extracted to

24459035
children	parent
all you have to do here after populating the children is make the parent now point to the two children via a copy of the first key in each of them and adjust its key count to two

24459059
put	get
all other actions i take on this object compare and writes work but i can t get it to put a border around a range

24459060
equals	gethashcode
you need to override implement equals and gethashcode right now you are listing distinct instances and they are correctly all distinct unique from each other

24459090
pkcs#12	pfx
you will notice that even with your cosign user certificate that you cannot export a pfx or pkcs#12 file because you can never export the private key from the appliance

24459105
equals	gethashcode
you will need to override the methods provided via system.object mainly equals and gethashcode although you might get away with not overriding gethashcode this will be needed for hash sets to work properly.

24459110
equals	gethashcode
if your class only contains those two fields then instead of implementing equals and gethashcode you can also do

24459112
memset	calloc
it may well happen to all 0s but you should still initialize it with calloc or memset

24459130
folder	directory
if you like to map the directory structure of the app scripts folder in js i d suggest using the following settings for your file watcher

24459131
charindex	substr
i thought about creating a temp table that maybe calculate the position of each . using charindex and using substr to get the parts out based on the differnet position i recorded in the temp table but i really have no idea how to start especially there are many email addresses that have over 10 parts to up to 30 parts.

24459181
oncreate	onstart
so it turns out i have been calling the start method of the thread twice in my second activity once in oncreate and again in onstart which had been left over from a previous version of the code

24459208
memcpy	strcpy
tried with memcpy strcpy but didnt work

24459222
google-chrome	firefox
could not read google-chrome manifest in the installation directory is because the platform supports having a manifest in the installation directory but firefox doesn t use this capability anymore

24459244
maven	pom.xml
no need of any plugin to import maven project in itellij just file - import project- then select the pom.xml file of the project to be imported it will handle automatically all the dependencies.first time it will download the dependencies better have internet connection while importing first time

24459280
folder	directory
if it s a maven project find a place in your project for the file and add it manually by right clicking run- run configuration - classpath tab - click on user entries - advanced - select add folder - and adding the directory where you put the file

24459294
post	get
i am building a plugin but when i register a custom post type i get this error.

24459316
equals	gethashcode
this allows you to distinct objects on single shot without implementing equals and gethashcode

24459316
equals	gethashcode
if on the other hand identity of the classname objects is a concept that spans through many methods and classes for sure it will be better to define simply equals and gethashcode

24459372
filtering	grouping
i ran across a plugin called collapsingqparserplugin which uses a filtering query to remove all but one of a grouping

24459372
filtering	grouping
because it filtering out other members of the grouping only facets from the representative document are counted

24459376
width	height
so if you want to control the default width height of the scroll pane you need to override the getpreferredscrollableviewportsize method to return a reasonable value

24459395
range	minimum
click reset on the w l or b c window and the display range will be set to the minimum and maximum

24459395
int	double
note that 1 double is used to convert to double precision to avoid int arithmetic 2 the data is assumed to be unsigned 8-bit int which is what the result is converted back to and 3 i didn t use the variable name image because there is already a function with that name

24459402
width	height
so the masthead is a div that contains some text and the video itself that is designed to take up 100 of the width and height of the screen

24459412
for-loop	loops
furthermore attempting to modify that loops to account for the null pointer could instead lead the outside for-loop attempting to access the link member of a null pointer

24459425
post	get
image name is same as post title in order to get related post image from the folder

24459425
folder	directory
this code is used for read directory how can i get images name from the folder and upload it to server

24459430
client-side	server-side
it s server-side tree you have don t worry about it because for client-side usage you have to know as svn-admin tell about it only url of repository how it correlate with physical tree on server isn t your question and headache

24459430
client-side	server-side
tortoisesvn is pure client-side tool creating repository is server-side administrative job unless you have some server s space mounted as local drive in which on any empty folder you can use create repository here

24459492
post	get
your form is submitting as a get request not post

24459554
width	height
so basically i can take the urls and extract the original image name and width height from there

24459559
width	height
i want for all images that are larger than the given width and height to scale down to the border from the centre and then crop off the edges

24459566
hide	show
but basically for every time an image is clicked it moves forward down the list hide and then show an image

24459615
int	double
some of these measures are represented as int s some are double s

24459615
int	double
as is unobtrusive validation doesn t enforce the numeric constraint and i have to parse them when they come back not sure how i m going to tell which are int vs double other than maybe looking for a decimal point which could be removed by the user

24459632
post	put
i can print also the post title with something like this post title but i really don t have a clue how to put in the breadcrumb the category name

24459692
width	margin
you will need to specify a width in order for margin 0 auto

24459695
google-chrome	firefox
this all works fine and dandy in google-chrome and firefox but it doesn t work in ie11 i haven t tested in older versions of ie since i don t support those in this circumstance

24459702
getter	setter
i read the answer to this question extend setter default object which seemed to suggest the solution using getter and setter

24459718
instances	transient
now i ve read all the questions that i could find referring to unsaved transient instances and the best i can figure is the error indicates that my address object is considered a transient until it is saved and for some reason it won t cascade save with the headofhousehold or dependent

24459725
width	height
the idea for the website is that there is a video playing in the background that takes up the entire width and height of the browser when you go to it

24459734
width	height
i have a subclass of a nstableviewcell that has several controls in it and i need the width of one of them to calculate the height for the row

24459734
width	height
since its not allowed to get the cell from tableview heightofrow i need to calculate the height taking into account the width of a textfield thats inside the cell and the string that goes in that row

24459770
serializable	deserialization
for more about json serializable deserialization see the documentation

24459771
nswindow	nsstatusitem
using swift i have an nsstatusitem and when i click it i want to check if an nswindow is visible

24459771
hide	show
if it is hide it if it isn t call a function to show the nswindow

24459801
switching	screens
which will reduce screens flash as the screens is repainted each time you switching worksheets

24459948
set	bag
this is one way assuming you want to ensure that the result is a set unique items rather than a bag allows duplicate items

24459966
profiling	debugging
my target is to use two different profiling for different deployment phases development release since release has for example debugging flag to false while development has debugging flag to true

24459974
accessor	properties
set the isasync properties to true when the get accessor of your binding source properties might take a long time

24459974
accessor	properties
one example is an image properties with a get accessor that downloads from the web

24460010
charindex	substr
as it is i have the same substr charindex stuff repeated multiple times

24460012
profiling	debugging
this way you have one common build tag and two profiling each profiling specified whether to debugging or not via the properties tag

24460047
post	get
a login should be done via post not get

24460050
firefox	safari
but i cannot rely on this code as it doesnt work on safari or firefox

24460068
hash	md5
agree on and encryption hash approach md5 for example

24460190
hive	hdfs
i d like to store that relationship on hdfs but i d like to do so in a way that is friendly for other hive pig mapreduce jobs to operate on the data or subsets of the data without having to ingest the full output of my pig job as that is a significant amount of data

24460192
width	height
do i have to declare a width and height or can i just use padding border-radius

24460230

x86	64bit
if the os is windows 64bit then i want to copy to c program files x86 my folder or windows 32-bit then c program files my folder

24460322
int	chars
then since strings are chars arrays you can loop through each chars in the array and turn it into an int by subtracting the ascii chars 0

24460322
division	modulo
then you can loop through each integer in this array and use the modulo which will give you the remainder of a division

24460325
google-chrome	firefox
then i thought maybe something had changed in google-chrome so i tried in firefox same thing

24460342
hide	show
i have a directive on a tag that show hide an error on the span element once the rule is validated

24460365
fflush	gets
this way you can use the uuid for the equals hashcode because the id is assigned before the entity gets fflush

24460372
nsapplication	nsusernotificationcenter
the only thing i can think of is that the usage of nsusernotificationcenter only works if you re running an nsapplication but i cannot find that documented anywhere

24460375
memcpy	memset
also you shouldn t be casting to in the calls to memcpy and memset since they take as arguments and any pointer type can be implicitly converted to without a cast

24460400
jar	manifest.mf
maybe you should remove the bundle-version from manifest.mf at com.google.gdt.eclipse.platform.e42 jar

24460401
rss	feed
i am trying to read an rss feed from type deviation with the following code

24460410
width	margin
you can simply style your divs to float left and relatively inherit first div s width as a margin by next div

24460457
getter	setter
you also bring up the question of how to access the original getter setter when you redefine a property

24460457
getter	setter
in some browsers such as firefox the original functionality of a property like id is also implemented as a getter setter

24460461
implements	sealed
since each of the integer primitive types is sealed the is operations performed by your reference implementation are compiled by the jit to simply an equality comparison between the runtimetypehandle of the type of the object x likely obtained through either one or two pointer dereferences and the handle of a particular integer type likely implements as an inline literal or a single mov instruction that references a fixed memory location

post	get
when i run the rbt post command i get

24460535
cos	sin
after this you will have a sin 2 and cos 2 of the compass directions

24460586
width	height
how do i set both width and height based on proportions of the width

24460586
width	height
if i set height 10 it would calculate that based on 100 height and i want to have height as 10 of 100 width

24460633
post	get
the first method batch_add_new is called when the form is first loaded get and the second method batch_add_create is called when the form is submitted post

activemq	rabbitmq
i know we can achieve this kind of functionality with activemq retrying messages at some point in the future activemq but could not find a similar solution for rabbitmq

24460655
sudo	passwd
you may setup an easy passwd for youself and use the command sudo ssh username 127.0.0.1 then you will be prompted for the passwd you usualy are using

24460662
for-loop	loops
there is an exit case which is set reached sometime while loops is running if you want to simulate a for-loop you ll use something like a counter extra code

24460662
for-loop	loops
while you can do this in a for-loop you ll have to account for the increment at each iteration as well causing some unreadable code which can be avoided when if you use a while loops

24460676
express	node.js
i ve created an extremely simple node.js app based on express s route-separation example

24460693
int	chars
because that is not a casting of an int to a chars

24460693
int	chars
it s a casting of an int to a pointer to chars

24460695
width	border-box
the value that makes the width work as we expect is border-box

getter	setter
in my opinion it s better to use getter and setter methods for object-oriented approach

24460936

int	double
comparing against a value with a decimal point will convert the string to a double instead of an int and then it all works

24460998
put	get
hit ctrl + z to put vim in the background and get back to your shell you can kill vim with kill 1

inherited	properties
these child states can also have their own controller views as well but they will be sitting inside the base state both visually and also inherited properties of the base state optionally they can have separated urls themselves but they don t have to you can just change states without changing the url by leaving the url bit empty when you define different states in your configs

both nexus and artifactory currently support storage for binary artifacts and dependencies used in .net development

24461379
post	put
i ve put together a blog post covering this now - the answer marked as correct isn t actually right - memorycacheservice needs to be a singleton because it contains a memorycache instance that needs to be shared across all dependent instances

24461402
post	get
so the chain of events looks like get - php code executed - form submitted - post - php code executed again

24461402
post	get
the important distinction is that when your code executes you can tell if it was a get or post request

getter	setter
luckily there is a work-around for this you can create a so-called associated object that is stored externally and manually declare your getter and setter methods

personally i m not gung-ho to introduce databases for our use of sessions so i m going to experiment with setting the cache-control header to ignore cookies and using header_remove at the top of views i know will never be user-specific like our rss feed

oncreate	ondestroy
my question why after each call of ondestroy and the subsequent call of oncreate the count gets reset

24464663
oncreate	ondestroy
i looked up on ondestroy and saw that is there to let your app have a final chance to clean things up before the activity does get destroyed but it does not mean that the activity will be called my initial idea was that count is an instance variable and that oncreate creates a new instance of my class buttonactivity

24464742

in the case of a double pointer first loads a pointer from memory at then it loads an int from behind that loaded pointer

24464745

using this doesn t work i just get int is not a subtype of chars

24464849
swift	objective-c
the lacontext reference has method signatures in both objective-c and swift

the parent click event can cover any of the other children except those two elements

24465085
post	put
many production http servers disable put post entities to avoid abuse

24465085
post	put
the example below see entity_size.c for a working example shows how to modify the g-wan server-global put post entity size limit from a servlet but this can also be done in the init or the main calls of a connection handler and from the gwan init.c script available in v4.10+

24465085
post	put
when dealing with requests without a put post entity you may also dynamically enlarge the read buffer by allocating more memoy to the read_xbuf by using xbuf_growto

24465112

swift	objective-c
swift doesn t like objective-c you can put nil to arguments which are class type without any restriction might be

24465209
folder	directory	post	get
if you get the user s credentials user name and password from him directly you can impersonate that user and under that user s context you should be able to get a listing of all the files and folder in his own home directory see rick strahl s blog post for one way to do it

24465209
folder	directory
if you can run the web application under a specific account that has read-only read directory access to all the user s home folder you could even avoid having to do impersonation but in that case your asp.net app s account needs extended access privileges

24465210
m2e	pom.xml
since you said are using m2e plugin in you eclipse ide and the web pom.xml have already listed java.servlet as dependency you should have that lib in your local repo when doing mvn jetty run

width	height
when a canvas element represents embedded content it provides a paint source whose width is the element s intrinsic width whose height is the element s intrinsic height and whose appearance is the element s bitmap

24465375
width	height
whenever the width and height content attributes are set removed changed or redundantly set to the value they already have if the canvas context mode is direct-2d the user agent must set bitmap dimensions to the numeric values of the width and height content attributes

24465375
width	height
the width and height idl attributes must reflect the respective content attributes of the same name with the same defaults

24465387

24465766
maven	pom.xml
problem is i need to include the produced lib jars in order to make netbeans happy about finding imports for the libs however that breaks the maven build because dex finds duplicate build configs because the libs have been specified twice in pom.xml once as apklib aar and once as jar

24465768

24465901
put	get
you can get confused with o n 2 but as you can replace while with if conditions so then there will be no 2 loops while loops are just put there to increase the computation

24465951
put	get	post	get	post	put
this has the advantage that it works with all methods get post put etc. and that using the login_required decorator is more dry than explicitly checking request.user.is_authenticated and redirecting

24466418
int	double
as for why the method call becomes ambiguous - the compiler is looking for a single method where every conversion from the method argument type int for both arguments to the method parameter type int long or double is at least as specific as the corresponding conversion in other candidate methods

24466418
int	double
the conversion from int to int is more specific than the conversion from int to double so your second overload wins in both cases

24466482
width	height
the width and height appear to be bad false values

int	boolean
would appreciate if someone could give me a suggestion as to how to do this whether with boolean or with strings int since i was told that boolean is a primitive

24467281
mp4	h.264	mp4	webm	h.264	webm
the only combination that has a decent chance of working is h.264 mp4 and webm or ogg theora so you must convert the video and for good browser support you will have to generate at least these two formats

24467323
implements	extends
for the casting to be successful ut2004botparameters has to either be a targetbot2params extends targetbot2params or if targetbot2params is an interface implements it

24467635
post	get
issues a post request but the edit action requires a get request

24467668

you probably want to use jquery.get in this case if the server does accept a get rather than only a post which is most certainly the case here

24467758
button	checkbox
i have a button delete on the listview activity.after checking the checkbox when a user presses delete button it will delete the data which was cecked from database and show the rest of the data remaining in database

24467782

all what is hard-coded in the example is the viewbox viewport numbers also hard-coded the width and height of outer canvas to match the numbers you may write a converter for the same to bind with sizex sizey as all the properties in visual brush need to be accurate in order to map it correctly

24467782
width	height
1 point to notice is that since canvas do not clip by default you may not require to set the width and height explicitly

24467864
hide	show
also i suggest you hide show the elements which would be better in this case instead of creating and swapping elements every time

24467870
openni	kinect

24468415
prng	random
i then want to hide the message in an image using a pseudo random number generator prng to choose the pixels

24468433
button	checkbox
if i am understanding you correctly you want the delete makes button to open the modal only if some checkbox are checked

24468433
hide	show
bootstrap has its own event that show and hide the modal

24468433
hide	show
since the modal will not be show you will not have to hide it

put	get
until ozten fixes this you might want to just get some binaries somewhere else like gnuwin32 zip unzip and put then somewhere in your path

get x and set x are to be used only within object literals to define getter and setter for property x

24468815
hide	show
you can set a cookie for your particular session and use that to show and hide errors for example check whether a user is logged in or not if logged in does s he have the privileges to see the errors

24468846
filtering	grouping
after that you can use regroup template filtering tag to grouping the dict appropriately

24468851
typedef	struct
that typedef struct node doesn t make sense even after changing the word vector to something else - you don t use it anyway in your code

24468856
put	get
but when i make a put request to update a record it appends form data in the url very similar to get request

24468913
hash	md5
you could create md5 hash from name email and the comment save and use that as unique identifier

24468913

24469662
stdout	stderr	qtextbrowser	pyqt
a code posted on redirecting output in pyqt does two good things at once it takes advantage of logging module to nicely format messages and it redirects standard stdout and stderr in to qt qtextbrowser widget

24469662
stdout	stderr
output in to qtextbrowser and not just stdout and stderr

24469662
stdout	stderr
as a matter of fact i would rather redirect logger s messages instead of stdout and stderr ones if i would have to make a choice between the twos...

24469752

24469884
width	margin
you can also count the exact number of margin width for each media query breakpoint

24469884
width	margin
in my case the margin takes 40px out of 293px .col-xs-3 1170px breakpoint so for your columns the 100 width is not 293px but 293px - 40px

i have created a page that shows all the post that are under a single category if i click on the category music i will get all the articles that are connected with music category

24470014
post	put
first of all if you need to consume a webservice you need to put instead of cxf jaxws-client ...next step is you need to use an http outbound endpoint to post to the external webservice .

24470015
post	get
i have read a lot of post about this error and the reason i am posting this is because i get the error when trying to install statsmodels package and not one of my programs

24470035

i don t know arabic urdu

24470084
urdu	arabic
for matching you can easily get any plugin for english modify it little bit with urdu arabic chars and its done

24470090
for-loop	arrays
you pick a random arrays index in a for-loop where the same index y can be chosen again randomly thus adding the same object say the one at index 1 twice

24470162
implements	extends
you need to use a recyclerview an adapter extends recyclerview.adapter and a layout manager extends recyclerview.layoutmanager to implements the recyclerview within your application

24470171
children	parent
use two-level depth to position children within parent e

24470177
windows	wow64
you have hit a known misfeature in windows .net c# wow64 that happens when form.load event handlers throw exceptions

24470177

this works perfectly for me but only tested in google-chrome and safari on mac

24470262
google-chrome	safari
this works perfectly for me but only tested in google-chrome and safari on mac

24470269
put	get
to try and get the concatenation part right i put this together which seems to work

24470277
google-chrome	firefox
this seems clean and it works consistently...but only in google-chrome not in firefox

24470290
for-loop	loops
one idea to make it faster is to use one for-loop instead of two loops since you do not make use of x and y

24470338
getter	setter
since it neither exposes any behavior properties or getter setter don t qualify nor encapsulates its structure again properties or getter setter that do nothing but expose the underlying data don t qualify it is no object at all

24470354
equals	gethashcode
an interesting similarity to note is that both tuples and anonymous types give you immutability and equality comparability both overrides equals and gethashcode based on the properties by default

24470392
google-chrome	safari
is working well i can connect by using web browser like safari google-chrome

24470411
zipalign	build-tools
zipalign has moved to be part of the build tools and can be found in the various build-tools directories in your android sdk installation

24470411
zipalign	build-tools
for example on my ubuntu machine i have zipalign in build-tools 19.1.0 and build-tools 20.0.0 in my sdk installation as i have the both the 19.1 and 20 android sdk build-tools installed in the sdk manager

24470411
build.gradle	gradlew
as ben75 notes gradlew for android should pull in the zipalign associated with the build tools you request in your build.gradle file

24470412
bluetooth	usb
two examples of this that come to my mind are usb and bluetooth so you are in luck

24470433
folder	directory
i first put the android sdk folder unzipped in my applications directory and renamed it to android sdk you can use whatever you want or put it elsewhere

24470433
folder	directory
launched eclipse and was promoted to select the sdk location so in eclipse s preferences i selected the folder i put inside my applications directory

24470475
scala	typesafe
scala s f string formatter is already a typesafe printf

24470492

but it does not seem to close when i click on the .overeverythingcover which has width 100 and height 100

24470509
width	height
the ratio of a Ã¢ qwidget sub class is width height

24470516
portrait	landscape
what i am trying to accomplish webviewcontrollers capable of rotating in portrait or landscape while other viewcontrollers remain in portrait

24470516
portrait	landscape
looked at facebook and it seems they lock the feed display to portrait but when you click on an image from within your feed you can view it in either portrait or landscape

24470603
margin	height
that s why you ve had to set a bottom margin of 160px but only get a gap of 10px or so - your margin covers the entire height of the two items in each row and then anything left over appears as the spacing

24470626
daemons	systemd
exec will do the job only if systemd user that runs php usually www-data has rights to restart mysql daemons

24470655
unsigned	short
security atomicfile create unsigned short

24470688
width	height
since you want both columns to have the same height regardless of the amount of content within them first you have to understand that setting height 100 sets the height in relation to the width of the parent div or containing block

24470693
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu

i m learning java a bit and i need help calling an arrays while its in a for-loop here s my arrays code

24470741
int	double
the compiler gives me a required type is xs int but got xs double

24470783
button	checkbox
so radio button were the best choice instead of checkbox

24470801
openbsd	netbsd
netbsd and openbsd made the opposite choice their libm for amd64 does use x87 instructions

24470801
cos	sin
here soft sin 0.5 is so fast this cpu would do soft sin 0.5 and soft cos 0.5 faster than one x87 fsin

24470801
cos	sin
if i also want cos 123 there is a chance that x87 fsincos would be faster than soft sin 123 and soft cos 123 for this cpu from 2010

24470803
hide	show
i have almost everything set up except i encountered a loop problem hide show only show for first item on table so i added an auto_increment id on sql row 13 so that i can easily assign unique ids to each group on the table

24470803
hide	show
the jquery script for hide show

24470814
jacoco	sonar-runner
i have a problem to set up gradle with sonar-runner and jacoco

24470842
inherited	properties
if i understand well inherited in css by doing something like this if .menu class will occur somewhere deep in .navbar then its elements will float to left and have other properties if not this statement menu nav nav-pils nav-stacked will produce vertical menu

24470861
put	get
whenever a student is added to the list i can get the course from cache make changes and put it back on cache

24470878
macbook	bootcamp
following are updated test results tested on macbook pro with core i5-4258u windows 10 bootcamp

24470897
hide	show
you are outputting the same show hide id for every row

24470903
getter	setter
i want to set the a variable using a getter and setter in one class and to be able to get that value from another class

24470915
int	chars
as for the others chars you can obtain the value for the ascii table by casting the chars as int

24470927
getter	setter
this said your class really looks like it was designed to be instantiated as there is a constructor setter getter

24470949
google-chrome	firefox
i think it s cuz i add integer with float numbers i check code in firefox google-chrome and confirm that behavior

24470957
inherited	subclassing
so an enum already inherited from another class making it a subclassing of another class would break java s single inherited paradigm

24470988
folder	directory
i have this code which gets the image inside my uiimage connected with ib called c1_1 and should save in my directory folder

24471002
getter	setter
and what that does is use the parent s empty setnumberofnewitems setter to force the button binding to call the getter

24471002
children	parent
the trick here is that having the parent add itself as a kvo observer for the isnew keypath for all children would be a terrible pain

24471002
children	parent
if you simply have the children call the empty setter in the parent the parent can own the calculation and there s no kvo outside what the bindings use

24471003
children	parent
it is assumed that it is not required to render the parent models along with the children in main view area eg show the lib1 on top underneath book1 and below that page1 at the same time and the menu can be defined in template so no nested resources have been used

24471010
portrait	landscape
when i created the hprof file the activity was in landscape orientation and i hadn t ran the portrait orientation before

24471019
free	malloc
you need to lift it one scope up or allocate it in dynamic memory with malloc don t forget to free it when you re done

24471030
exponent	modulo
in openssl this could be done by copying the modulo and public exponent to a new struct but seckeyref is opaque and i ve been unable to find a function that performs this operation

24471045
children	parent
i started using xml in a vb.net project and i have one problem when trying to save it to a directory i have the root and its children nodes well formated new line for each one but each grandchild node is in the same line as it s parent the child of the root and i need the xml file to be very well formated and human readable is there a way to make the file saving use a new line for each node

24471067
libs	library-project
i ve referenced basegameutils as library-project in my project s properties and marked basegameutils which is referencing google-play-services_lib and google-play-services_lib as libs too

24471085
put	get
i ve tried to debug the service but when i put a breakpoint and watch the item that i get from the mobile app then the item s properties have cannot evaluate expression because the code of the current method is optimized

this method works for portrait landscape orientation

24471254
swift	objective-c
i m working through the opengl for ios tutorial by ray wenderlich in an attempt to convert his code from objective-c to swift

24471254
swift	objective-c
i am very new to opengl and to swift and believe my problem has to do with how i have translated the objective-c

24471254
swift	objective-c
essentially i couldn t for the life of me determine how to convert some portions of the objective-c to swift so decided to for now create a small class in objective-c that could supply the swift code with those attributes

24471254
swift	objective-c
the problem in my case was that my conversion of the objective-c to swift was incorrect in several cases

24471303
integer	unsigned
the unsigned integer type means that any bitpattern for the value representation bits is ok and on the pc platform for built-in type there are no bits other than the value representation bits

24471316
button	checkbox
i have a script that uses checkbox and command button and there is a macro that resets them to default on every sheet

24471316

the problem is that if there is a sheet that has no checkbox or opt button the script does not work

24471326
post	get
i am trying to get the reddit topic results from ajax request and it seems my current approach of passing the post results is wrong

24471337
put	get
but i couldn t get the edit put to work

24471419
swift	objective-c
i don t really know the languages but one obvious difference is that the objective-c version sets up two different vertex attributes while the swift version sets up the same attribute twice

24471476
mp4	webm
in some forum and blogs i have seen that we need to provide multiple formats of video mp4 ogg webm etc in html

24471476
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
any solution for this to achieve with once format from ios device and it need to support in at least google-chrome firefox and safari browsers

24471480
for-loop	loops
in this algorithm you make some comparisions that are in fact not needed because you know when you increment loops variable of the outer for-loop in traditional bubblesort you have 2 for loops you know that everything on the left is already sorted

24471504
int	boolean
is it because flag is a boolean type and x is type int

24471576
public	protected
you could make you private or protected methods as public

24471631
skype	hangout
but some chat clients seem to do something else i ve verified by sniffing the traffic of an idle ios device that at least google hangout facebook and skype all keep a persistent socket opened in the background and regularly send traffic to keep it alive

24471641
post	get
if you cannot get your macro to work post your code with an explanation of what it does and what you want it to do

24471644
google-chrome	safari
safari google-chrome have built-in pop-up blockers that stop this from working

24471644
google-chrome	safari
the only javascript that is allowed to open a new window in safari google-chrome is javascript directly attached to click handlers and other direct user input handlers

24471980
rbenv	homebrew
i m on a mac running mavericks and rbenv was installed using homebrew

24471987
for-loop	arrays
one way you could simplify the code is to place the text boxes into an arrays and run through each of them with a for-loop so that you only have one select case

24471995
pop-up	dialog
here s an example of how to make this a pop-up dialog

24472014
versioning	upgrade
check that android studio hasn t removed the zipalign file from the tools folder - it does helpful things like that when you change build versioning and got me when i upgrade then had to downgrade

express	node.js
i m trying to decide between using bootstrap and foundation for front end work for a node.js express route

24472033
nsscanner	nsstring
assuming that the file is small enough to fit into memory say 5mb or less you can read the file into an nsstring using the stringwithcontentsoffile method and then parse the string with an nsscanner

24472053
svm	k-means
main algorithm i use is k-means and svm

24472053

button	checkbox
in my below servlet code i am extracting all the values which i have selected in the checkbox as soon as i click create button and it works fine

24472269
getter	setter
so with that in mind why not simply change the location.path as the method is both a getter and setter with something like the following

24472295
textview	imageview
for instance you can use the textview + imageview layout that r4j proposes in his answer

24472341
post	get
after adding that server you can get the ip address of your android device by accessing the wifi network interface of your phone see this post for example

24472361
fseek	ftell
it was written in unsafe way all file offset are stored internally as unsigned 32-bit offsets and ftell fseek functions where used

24472361
fseek	ftell
in freebsd 7 the host platform for software it means that ftell and fseek uses 32-bit signed long

24472361
fseek	ftell
i need to do quick fix of the program because some internal data files suddenly hit 2 31 file size 2 147 483 7yy bytes after 13 years of collecting data and internal fseek ftell assert fails now for any request

24472361
fseek	ftell
is it enough to work with up to 4 gb files and safe to search-and-replace all ftell to ftello and all fseek to fseeko sed -i s ftell ftello same for seek if possible usages of them are

24472397
prepare	execute
note some mysql client libraries have methods functions that perform this for you so you can retrieve the value without having to prepare and execute another sql statement in your code

24472422
nsbitmapimagerep	nsimage
my first attempt was to create nsbitmapimagerep and to get the individual frames from the representations property nsimageframecount and nsimagecurrentframe after getting a nsdata tiffrepresentation compressed format object from an nsimage object that was inited with contents from url

24472620
int	double
the interesting thing is that with foo int and float the same happens but with long and double it again gives the exception

24472628
int	chars
a function that takes two state int chars values call them a and b and gives us back a state int chars value and only uses the applicative interface of state int must produce a value whose statefulness is always the same regardless of what the int state value is and regardless of what chars values the inputs yield

24472628
int	chars
or it could ignore both entirely not taking either of their effects on the current int state and just pure some chars value

24472655
nsscanner	nsstring
instead of using nsscanner you can also use a method of the nsstring class called contentsseparatedbystring

free	malloc
it depends on the free memory available if free memory available is less then it will give segmentation fault otherwise it will use the extra memory to store the data and it will not be giving segmentation fault.there is no need for malloc because array itself allocates memory

from what i understand you should add the displayconnectionbutton method to the relevant uiviewcontroller subclass and not to your uinavigationcontroller subclass as this only contains the stack of view controllers

put	get
as a note if you put a breakpoint on your displayconnectionbutton in your customnavigationcontroller and po self.viewcontrollers i think you will get an empty array no view controllers

int	chars
but this doesn t seem to be the case here my impression is that instead of both references to al dl was actually meant - was that the case the result was that an end of string 0 would be printed as space chars before termination int 21h looks like msdos function 2 which outputs the chars which ascii is in dl

superclass	subclassing
let s say i have a superclass called applicationdao and a number of inheriting subclassing such as userdao productdao etc.

24477684
superclass	subclassing
if my catch and finally blocks are exactly the same for all my subclassing crud methods is it possible for the superclass applicationdao to handle the exceptions rather than the subclassing

24477684
superclass	subclassing
that would mean i would only need to write one try...catch...finally block in the superclass rather than duplicating it in each subclassing

24477684
superclass	subclassing
if it is possible i m not sure how to do it because the methods in each subclassing would have a different name getusers in userdao getproducts in productdao etc... so i m not directly overriding a method in the superclass

24477743
superclass	subclassing
superclass cannot handle subclassing exceptions

24477743
superclass	subclassing
subclassing can replace wrap superclass methods not the other way round

have your common processing in applicationdao and have subclassing call the superclass - this way you only write the code for the common stuff once
