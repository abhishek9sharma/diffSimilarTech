hide	show
tip if calling hide show mask too early and or too late mask flashing may be experienced visually

2880169
ssl	https
ex of site using ssl https

2880201
hide	show
i am looking for a jquery plug-in which will show hide a div in a very smooth slide manners when i click on a link

2880203
httpcookie	jsessionid
the servlet container usually keeps track of session using either 1 a httpcookie or 2 adding an extra parameter jsessionid in each url

2880221
firefox	safari
this works great in safari and firefox of course and i haven t tried other versions of ie but here is a simple example

2880227
quicksort	mergesort
see my question here asking for a good open source multithreaded mergesort quicksort whatever

2880227
quicksort	mergesort
multithreaded quicksort or mergesort

2880227
quicksort	mergesort
i haven t implemented mergesort but quicksort and i can tell you that there s no array copying going on

2880259
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox google-chrome and safari but unfortunately in internet explorer this script totally destroys the layout of the site where it is contained

2880264
put	get
how can i get the current user id and put it in a menu tab

2880318
disk	ram
all db operations will have to be backed up by writing to disk having more ram is helpful but not essential

2880332
rpm	yum
both apt-get for deb and yum for rpm will check these dependencies and install them if needed

2880340
inherited	properties
i need to find the lowest interface in inherited tree that has the count properties

2880362
int	double
the c# ipaddress class provides network byte order reading writing methods for all primitives except double and float but as in my example you can pass through through either a 32-bit or 64-bit int respectively

2880459
firefox	safari
however using the html bridge you may be able to handle the onbeforeunload event fired by some browsers ie firefox and safari perhaps more

2880490
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari has a function where you can report bugs to help their developers fix it

2880500
post	get
you can fudge what appears in the address bar on the browser by using a front-controller architecture and using forms post for every request but this is going to get very messy very quickly

2880511
hide	show
i have two links i want to show hide them one at a time my code is

2880544
winpcap	libpcap
sniffing library i think is libpcap or winpcap

2880565
action-filter	onactionexecuting
you could write an action-filter and in the onactionexecuting event put the user inside viewdata

2880590
width	height
i have a page that has a 100 width and height div in it all surrounding elements are sized accordingly so that it does actually achieve 100 width and height

2880644
yacc	bison
to do this i would read up on lex and yacc or the gnu variants flex and bison to get a feel for how you can lexicalize input and then place it into some sort of hierarchical structure

2880653
folder	directory
i have made one applet which downloads a zip file from the server on client machine into temp folder extracts the zip file into a directory specified by client browser user and then deletes the zip file

2880671
post	get
but you will probably need to use a post for this not a get

2880692
post	put
good point this is the post that i put my presentation from here

2880708
opera	firefox
my suggestion would be - try yui calendar instead it shows well on ie firefox and even old opera

2880744
width	height
the idea is that your form contains several invisible inputs their type should probably not be set to hidden but they should be invisible to a human set width or height to 0

2880767
codeigniter	kohana
i sometimes use it with some of the other frameworks codeigniter kohana etc

2880783
int	chars
with pod values int chars etc. passing by value is not a problem but if you are looking at complex structures then the stack grows too quickly by placing entire structures on stack for function calls

2880827
int	double
i m not really expecting any votes for this - it s a mad solution to be honest it does have the advantage of being able to be applied for any enum type and even discreet values of type int float double as well as supporting any delegate type - so perhaps it s a bit of a sledgehammer

2880846
memcpy	memmove
memmove is used over memcpy in order that the source and destination may be the same location if you do not need that it may be more efficient to use memcpy

2880865
vbscript	vb6
here s the documentation with a sample for how to do it from vbscript pretty much the same from vb6

2880868
vbscript	vb6
note that example works in vbscript as well in vb6 you can get the file by

2880909
put	get
it s easy to put it into nested dictionaries but i want it in objects of my class-types to get the right behaviours as well as the data

2880970
serializable	deserialization
possible causes are invalid stream or object version change between serializable and deserialization

2881006
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
for example if you do drag and drop the mousedown event is fired then any number of mousemove and finally mouseup

2881008
google-chrome	firefox
tested in latest firefox google-chrome and ie7 ie8

2881082
textarea	textbox
and also i want to implement large page like some textarea some textbox more images etc.

2881104
int	chars
int main int argc const chars argv

2881120
eurekalog	madexcept
besides eurekalog and madexcept the jcl jvcl libraries have usueful to obtain those informations

2881122
portrait	landscape
i am using two xml layout file layoutpotrait.xml and layoutlandscape.xml.when device emulator is in portrait mode i want to set the content view with layoutportrait.xml file and when i will change the emulator to landscape mode i want to set content view with layoutlandscape.xml file

2881159
put	get
from there you can declare a htmldocument object which is queryable its a bit of headache in places because the api design forces you to do random casting but it does get the job done and it can always be put in to a util class on it s own so you don t have to keep your oddities in your main app code classes

2881160
many-to-many	one-to-many
in hibernate tutorial chapter 25 best practices says we should use 2 one-to-many relationship instead of one many-to-many with an intermediate link class

2881200
udp	tcp
i am using a udp application and therefore do not get to view the ip_tos field at the application layer as is the case with tcp

2881226
rss	feed
a straightforward syndication feed of these articles to end users along the lines of a simple rss feed

2881227
google-chrome	firefox
if i give my image 100 height it works correctly in firefox google-chrome it stretches all allong its wrapper while in explorer it inherits the page height

2881227
google-chrome	firefox
i tried with height inherit but in firefox google-chrome image doesn t stretch at all in explorer the problem remains the same

2881244
put	get
the portlet gets deployed fine but when i put it on a page i get the following exception

2881315
google-chrome	firefox
by the way in the firefox looks like old jquery lib loads and scripts that depends on it works but script that uses new version and in ie and google-chrome everything is exactly opposite

2881346
stdio	fflush
the recommended fix was to add sys.stdout.flush to the spot in my script where i want stdio to fflush its contents to the python-shell

2881372
django	web2py
pyamf supports many popular web frameworks twisted django appengine web2py wsgi each of these providing different interfaces for using sessions

2881387
stdout	stderr
all do more or less the same thing but give you access to the stdin stdout stderr open3 open4 and pid open4 of the subprocess

2881411
ant	maven
this is how i did it note that we re using ant in our legacy corporate project you probably should be using maven which should eliminate 50 of those steps below

2881418
width	height
i can get the width but the height i m getting seems to be wrong

2881454
int	double
it s a double pointer to a simple struct with 2 int time and tons

2881500
subclass	abstract-class
you will find that in fact the object returned by create does not belong to abstract-class xmlwriter but some other concrete subclass

2881542
int	double
simply parse the string into a double and then check whether that double represents an int value

2881628
put	get
check the second query parameter that you put into array - namely pg thats what you should get there 0 0 0 0 0...403 or other thing might be that your oin numbers are not present in num_list keys

2881640
getter	setter
you should create getter and setter anyway for matter of encapsulation

2881711
width	height
i have an image with a width of 1600 pixels and height of 1819 pixels

2881752
equals	gethashcode
you must implement gethashcode and equals

2881758
equals	gethashcode
it is always expected that you implement gethashcode when you modify equals

2881777
equals	gethashcode
so implementing would be my choice if you implement it it also makes sense to override equals and gethashcode anyway

2881778
equals	gethashcode
either implement equals and gethashcode or create an appropriate which has the right form of equality matching for your map

2881817
stdout	stderr
try redirecting the stdout stderr to see what s happening

2881907
x86	64bit
i ve been asked to create an installer package that checks whether the client already has sql server express 2005 already installed his operating system 64bit vs x86 and install the required sql server instance if needed

2881988
equals	gethashcode
but if you really want to compare the whole objects equality then override the equals method not forgetting gethashcode too and do your equality checking in there

2882017
width	height
so ironically i set about building a set of panels that communicate to each other from the parent panel who ultimately needs to have knowledge of its size right down to the most inner panels so that when my grid component finally gets drawn i can fire a method called onsizeknown int width int height and do whatever sizing is required

2882018
easymock	jmock
or you could use aop but i think using a library like easymock or jmock is going to be the easiest way to go

2882034
nscopying	nsmutablecopying
the easiest way to create a new array containing the same elements as the old array is to use nscopying or nsmutablecopying

2882055
jgroups	jini
but you can also use far more sophisticated solutions like jini or jgroups

2882077
mouse	keyboard
this allows paints mouse movement and keyboard input to work

2882108
portrait	landscape
there can be a keyboard 308px in height in portrait 397px in landscape as well

2882130
stdout	stderr
it looks like i should create a new printstream implementation which sends its output to syslog and redirecting stderr and stdout to that class in jetty-logging.xml

2882158
inherited	subclassing
myapp.h doesn t tell the compiler that subclassing inherited from baseclass - you should probably include baseclass.h and subclass.h in your myapp.h file as long as you have getobject inlined there

2882171
post	get
now in my views.py i get a post with this istruction

2882225
int	chars
map iterates over the single elements of the string the digits turns them into a string chars 1 becomes the string 1 and read turns them back to an int

2882300
clisp	ecl
i would also propose to switch from xlisp to something like clisp or ecl

2882305
post	get
if you had asked how to get all the comments for multiple post as efficiently as possible i d point you to my blog for a good technique but since you haven t i won t because that would just be blog-whoring

2882330
jsf	wicket
i think that the most obvious upside of gwt it is better scaleable than server side presentation layer technologies such as jsf wicket

2882339
restrict	shared
i should add that the desktop instance allows developers to do things that he dbas often restrict on shared environments

2882354
jar	war
web applications are packaged in war files which are just jar files with a specific layout

2882368
button	checkbox
it seems like there are no way of getting the toolbar background as background on the checkbox and button

2882394
lisp	scheme
for syntax metaprogramming i think scheme is a good option if you hadn t mentioned simplicity etc i d suggest common lisp

2882394
lisp	scheme
if you decide to use a language that s larger and messier than scheme try common lisp

2882451
min	max
if you do want to show the numbers rather than a check or something but only want to allow 0 or 1 you could use a numericupdown control and set min to 0 max to 1 and step to 1

2882457
postgresql	mysql
another way will also work on mysql and postgresql

2882476
versioning	upgrade
so developing on the local copy has all the benefits with no risk in a general case when you support multiple versioning of the system and maintain upgrade scripts anyway

2882515
wordpress	joomla
if you venture out of .net and want to look at php solutions then drupal joomla and wordpress are best solutions

2882517
glulookat	glrotate
more in particular i think i didn t get very well how the mechanism of glulookat works in comparison with the functions gltranslate and glrotate

2882564
rss	feed
all images are retrieved from the rss feed

2882590
disk	ram
according to our sysadmin the problem is that the ram that the kernel uses as a disk cache apparently all but 8mb is not freed when the jvm needs to allocate memory so the jvm process throws an outofmemoryerror

2882590
vmware	esx
we are currently using jdk1.6.0_20 on sles 10 sp2 linux 2.6.16.60-0.42.9-smp in vmware esx

2882711
inherited	properties
pom inherited parent properties does not necessarily follow this and is not relevant for the purpose of this question

2882758
ubuntu	linux
some linux versions like ubuntu prefer etc event.d instead of inittab

2882761
integer	fractions
the fld st 0 frndint fsubr st 1 st piece subtracts off the integer part so we re left with only the fractions

2882810
dlsym	dlopen
there are plenty of existing c programs out there that use dlopen dlsym to implement a plugin architecture including more than one irc-related one

2882819
base	fractions	multiplying	add
as you know a fractions power is equivalent to a root and you also know that multiplying powers with the same base is equivalent to add their exponents

2882823
put	get
i m wondering how and at which lifecycle phase i get maven to grab the artifact from the other module and put it insode the appropriate folder of the webapp module

2882860
libsndfile	fftw
then convert all of the samples to ieee floating-point float or double depending on the fftw configuration-- libsndfile can do this for you

2882881
bash	zsh
i usually work with bash but i m trying to setup a cronjob from a machine and user account that is configured with zsh

2882886
integer	unsigned
if you want to try the repeated square root algorithm begin by writing an unsigned integer power function that uses repeated squaring only

2882915
post	get
its been mentioned in other answers about getting the same code running for both the def get self and the def post self for any given request

2882974
hide	show
i do show a please wait animation on top of the itemscontrol with the itemscontrol dimmed down as it is working but i d rather not hide the itemscontrol entirely because it gives the user an indication that progress is being made

2882986
int	chars
for example b converts a non-negative python int into an unsigned chars

2883008
disk	ram
according to our sysadmin the problem is that the ram that the kernel uses as a disk cache apparently all but 8mb is not freed when the jvm needs to allocate memory so the jvm process throws an outofmemoryerror

2883022
dlsym	dlopen
dlopen dlsym are probably the easiest way to go

2883052
children	parent
a parent with no children

2883052
children	parent
b parent with children

2883052
children	parent
|- b1 parent with children where no child matches the filter

2883052
children	parent
- b2 parent with children where 1 or more match the filter

2883052
children	parent
in query 1 the where clause is performed after the left join so parent with children where none of the children match the filter are excluded case b1

2883061
base	fractions	integer	fractions
fractions exponents are considerably more difficult since it means essentially calculating an nth-root of the base where and multiplying the result by the result of the integer portion power calculation

2883063
profiling	debugging
that s not debugging symbols which don t affect the code generation that s for profiling which does

2883070
button	checkbox
i m trying to create a set of button which have an off or on state much a checkbox without the check

2883071
children	parent
the first query will return cases where the parent has no children or where some of the children match the filter condition

2883071
children	parent
this is why you are getting more rows in query 2 - parent with children that don t match the filter condition are output with null child values where in the first query they are filtered out

2883072
accessor	properties
i d really like programming languages to introduce a super-private properties field modifier one that basically says you can only access this properties through its accessor

2883078
width	height
you re looping i from 0 to height but then you re using i as your x parameter when creating lines and using width as your y parameter

2883081
hide	show
obviously if you have more than one element and only one can be show at any given time you ll want to have some logic in there to handle the show hide of the non-selected elements

2883092
children	parent
i notice couple of differences that can make the results vary.in the first query you have and then in the second query you have and this makes the second query return all parent with children satisfying your condition where as the first condition will also return the parent wit no children

2883098
postgresql	mysql
i am using both mysql and postgresql but ideally i want the answer to be database agnostic since i try to not get tied down by any particular vendor

2883103
content-length	content-type
charset utf-8 content-length length soapaction string string string string string http 1.1 200 ok content-type text xml

2883103
content-length	content-type
charset utf-8 content-length length string string string string string http 1.1 200 ok content-type application soap+xml

2883105
children	parent
the parent that only have children with won t appear in query 1 because the where clause is evaluated after the rows are joined

2883132
objectdatasource	formview
formview and my objectdatasource

2883144
button	checkbox
you could create a checkbox that looks exactly like a button

2883169
post	get
i would suggest both theoretical and practical reasons why the approach you re using refactoring out the common code to a separate method and calling it from both post and get methods is superior to the apparently-simpler alternative of just having one of those two methods call the other

2883169
post	get
no big deal and you ll have to refactor back to the original nested way if and when you do need to apply tweaks before or after the nested call from get to _run etc or need other tweaks in debugging set a breakpoint in your debugger on post but without having the breakpoint trigger on get etc but a nice little simplification for those times where it s feasible

2883197
google-chrome	firefox
for example i couldn t debug it with firefox nor google-chrome it only worked correctly in ie

2883198
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested this in firefox 3.6 safari 4 and google-chrome i keep the background-color in the body for any browsers that for some reason don t support styling the html tag

2883320
serializable	deserialization
the serializable form has enough information such that the deserialization process will produce an identical object without any additional help

2883322
hash	md5
install a md5 checker on each server and make it a local process so you don t have to use bandwidth to recheck the hash

2883362
jdk1.6	jdk1.4
i was able to do it in jdk1.6 software but not in jdk1.4

2883373
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox a shows in the middle on google-chrome ie it doesn t

2883386
cpu	processors
on an old compaq 1ghz 1 processors machine i was able to create about 10 000 counters and monitor them remotely for about 20 cpu usage

2883418
hash	md5
to send the files again just to compare them is of course not practical but sending the md5 hash of the file is

2883418
hash	md5
the md5 hash at least saves you a lot of network traffic

2883453
google-chrome	firefox
i need it to work for google-chrome ie and firefox

2883460
post	get
but now i want to get the same result in my c# code post this string 100 as post-value and request as post-key to the action uri

2883480
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
if by ie you mean ie 8 then web storage is supported in ie 8 firefox 2+ officially from 3.5 safari 4 google-chrome 4 and opera 10.50

2883480
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
web storage can be viewed simplistically as an improvement on cookies providing much greater storage capacity 5mb per domain in mozilla firefox google-chrome and opera 10mb per storage area in internet explorer and better programmatic interfaces

2883485
super	implements
the hollow or white as i perceive it arrow means that this method does not override a super class method but implements specified in an interface

2883581
post	get
scott guthrie has a nice blog post on how to enable get on web methods

2883581
post	get
the is the key passing an object makes .load do a post instead of a get

2883590
free	malloc
in the second example ld_preload is used to intercept calls to malloc free

2883608
post	get
as a result each url which is used for both get and post should have specific actions that differ based on the type of request

2883608
getter	setter	post	get
i tend to think of get and post like a getter and a setter

2883608
post	get
post s change data and get s get data

2883608
post	get
as a result a simple search can use get all day long but when you save a setting back to the server a post is in order

2883608
post	get
you could then use get to get the blog post and render it to screen with a nice comment form

2883638
google-chrome	firefox
i am trying to create a simple menu using li elements but it only works on ie7 in firefox and google-chrome the alignment get weird

2883666
ienumerable	ilist
make sure your collection type ienumerable ilist etc matches what type of collection you are sending in your controller along with the type of the actual object in the collection

2883684
cpu	hyperthreading
it has the i7 620m dual core hyperthreading cpu running at 2.66ghz and 8 gb of memory

2883685
squash	merge	squash	branch
i canâ t seem to get my merge intact with magit for emacs without squash them into the current branch consistently

2883691
stdout	fflush
fflush stdout

2883729
post	get
for example when a user edits some data the browser will send the changes using an ajax post and then do an ajax get to get fresh content and replace an existing div on the page with that content

2883778
squash	merge
if you would like to squash the merge have git avoid creating a merge commit then use a prefix argument with the command

2883795
maven	pom.xml
you ll need to add this to your maven pom.xml file in the section

2883797
children	parent
i m trying to delete a child using the parent repository by removing it from the parent s children collection

2883798
xslt	xquery
xslt has proven itself to be both a powerful and adaptable language but now we can also choose xquery

2883798
xslt	xquery
xslt 2.0 xquery 1.0 and xpath 2.0 are just the same query language dressed up in different forms

2883866
accessor	ivar	accessor	properties
if you have a variable there are two ways to read and set properties which are usually a combination of an ivar and accessor methods

2883866
accessor	ivar
the way around this problem is to use accessor which are methods that control access to an ivar

2883866
getter	setter
in objective-c getter get the variable and are usually named the same thing as the variable so in the person example the getter would be - int age and setter set the variable it would be named - void setage int theage

2883866
accessor	ivar
if you use accessor you can freely change your implementation in the future even getting rid of the ivar completely if necessary without reliant classes breaking

2883866
accessor	ivar	accessor	properties
in objective-c the combination of an ivar and accessor is often called a properties although there doesn t necessary have to be an ivar if the value is dynamically created

2883875
versioning	upgrade
we upgrade the .rdlc to the newest versioning and also upgrade the reportviewer control used by asp.net

2883888
hide	show
i dont want the show hide box to scroll to show the rest of the page detailed content..

2883917
web.py	turbogears	web.py	cherrypy	django	web.py	django	turbogears	turbogears	cherrypy
you mention django which is the most popular although i like turbogears cherrypy and web.py

2883923
inherited	properties
the selectedvalue properties is inherited from the listcontrol control

2883940
hide	show
then you can hide show the number of panels using .slice

2883953
hide	show
possible duplicate of showing and hiding a div with jquery and or using jquery to show and hide different div s onclick event

2883953
hide	show
selecting an element by id in jquery is #idname and show hide are simply .show and hide so for your elements

2884019
setinterval	clearinterval
setinterval returns an identifier that you need to store in order to properly cancel it with clearinterval

2884080
innodb	myisam
mysql won t make the row available until it s done reading it automatically acquires a table lock in the case of myisam or a row lock in the case of innodb

2884086
dictionary	map
typically the term dictionary was used before the mathematical term map took hold

2884097
integer	unsigned
x is unsigned integer which must be checked to be greater than 0 and less than y

2884097
integer	unsigned
y is unsigned integer

2884097
int	double
now later if i need to change the attribute of y to a float double would there be another way to optimize the check i.e will the suggested optimal technique for int become non-optimal solution when y is changed to float double

2884202

it could use equals hashcode or compareto of the element

2889396
getter	setter
first instead of thinking in terms of with fields with getter and setter you are advised to think in terms of bean properties here

2889406
rss	feed
let s say that it s an rss feed item s url called item.link

2889415
mouse	keyboard
so basically i wanna keep looping if the user hasn t clicked the mouse or pressed a key in the keyboard yet

2889417
awt	swing
use swing not awt so use jpanel

2889455
printf	strncpy
first as andreyt noted in the comments to this question truncation methods printf strlcpy and strncpy are often not a good solution

2889473
hash	md5
it is trivial to use a secure hash function like sha-256 and continuing to use md5 for security is reckless behavior

2889473
hash	md5
according to nist md5 is not a secure hash function

2889473
hash	hmac
according to schneier a hash function vulnerable to a collision attack can still be used as an hmac

2889473
salt	md5
keep in mind the md4 and md5 attacks are prefixing attacks and if a salt is prepended then an attacker cannot control the prefix of the message

2889477
strcpy	strncpy
some nice libc versions provide non-standard but great replacement for strcpy 3 strncpy 3 - strlcpy 3

2889515
folder	directory
these are stored in a mynetwork directory stats folder on my network drive

2889520
hash	hmac
according to schneier a hash function vulnerable to a collsion attack can still be used as an hmac

2889520
hash	salt
for instance if the hash was h pass + salt we d need a preimage attack which allows us to find pass2 such that

2889542
folder	directory
i created a virtual directory in iis housing the master folder containing the master files

2889558
google-chrome	safari
i have confirmed that my control adapters are not triggering in google-chrome and safari

2889558
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve debugged and the breakpoints inside the adapters just don t get hit in google-chrome safari when they work perfectly find in firefox ie

2889558
google-chrome	safari
so for google-chrome safari iis is just ignoring the mapping

2889575
vim	emacs
engineers in large semiconductor companies are using emacs vim for code editing

2889575
jobs	cron
integrated development environment doesn t make much sense there since a project is a few thousand hdl files taken from different places on a nix network setup scripts for a dozen different tools and cron jobs to do frequent builds

2889637
folder	directory
bit longer you will have to edit the apache config at least to give it permission to access the web directory so even if you symlink your web folder to var www it will not work

2889649
integer	unsigned
have the first 4 bytes of the message represent the length of the message as an unsigned integer

2889683
margin	height
if you really mean on top of the cap height and not somehow inside the cap height margin then you can apply the css padding to either the font element or its parent container

2889722
int	chars
but i get the following error invalid conversion from chars to int

2889726
onresume	onpause
depending on the usage pattern i would probably also cache the thumbnails to the sd card so it would be cheap to free the ram they use in onstop onpause and reload them in onstart onresume

2889732
folder	directory
on a whim i ended up removing the .ruby_inline directory in my home folder and that resolved the issue

2889766
put	get
it seems to me the best way to do this is to put my filetype specific settings in after ftplugin so they don t get overwritten and filetypes.vim in after for the same reason

2889783
treemap	linkedhashmap
for details look at the javadoc of treemap hashmap linkedhashmap

2889796
put	get
it supports o 1 get put operations

2889796
put	get
its put get operations take o log n time

2889796
comparator	comparable
it requires items to have some comparison mechanism either with comparable or comparator

2889799
width	height
iframe src width 100 height 595px frameborder 0

2889864
put	get	salt	md5
then you can call user.create_user_with_digest name bob and you ll get a digest created automatically and assigned to the user you probably want to generate the api key with another library than md5 such as sha256 you should also probably put some user enterable field a continuously increasing number such as the current date-time and a salt as well

2889872
clearance	devise
but you should definitely take a look at devise authlogic or clearance gems

2889895
centos	linux
i have some old build scripts available that may or may not save you some pain if you re compiling on linux centos in particular but you could make it work pretty easily on non-redhat distros too

2889910
button	checkbox
we are not supposed to use an actionlistener for each checkbox but rather get the list when a button is clicked

2889910
button	checkbox
ideally i d like to somehow add all the checkbox to an array and loop through the array in the button s action listener to determine which ones are checked but if i have to check each one individually i will

2889917
vbscript	jscript
you can set it up by configuration changing the default langauge from vbscript to jscript or you can do it explicitly per-file

2889939
button	checkbox
you may then iterate through the list of checkbox in the button action-code using a for-each loop construct

2889950
hash	md5
download sites use md5 hash as a checksum to determine if the file was corrupted during download and i would say a broken hash is good enough for that purpose

2889990
affinity	processors
setting an affinity mask for a process or thread can result in threads receiving less processors time as the system is restricted from running the threads on certain processors

2889997
integer	fractions
if you want to take the modulo of a fractions type you can convert to an integer first

2889997
integer	fractions
fromintegral will convert any integer type into any number type floor ceiling and round will convert fractions types to integral types

2890032
moq	mspec
i have started to use mspec for bdd and since long ago i use moq as my mocking framework

2890072
codeigniter	kohana
go for kohana the improved alternative of codeigniter

2890081
superclass	subclassing
you could try subclassing listview and overriding layoutchildren to chain to the superclass then call setselection 0 in the case where that is needed

2890086
getter	setter
the getter and the setter have the same type

2890086
getter	setter
another potential problem is that some reflection utilities may not recognize your getter setter pair if they don t have the same type

2890107
multiplying	add
one way to get a better distribution is to multiplying a member by a prime number and add the next member repeating as needed

2890153
range	max
divide the result by the max possible value for the number of bits supplied which i think should give you a decimal evenly distributed in the range 0-1

2890174
django	turbogears
is it true in other mvc frameworks too like cakephp symfony django or turbogears

2890199
ropemacs	pymacs
i use pymacs to load ropemacs and rope with the following lines in my .emacs file as described here

2890206
post	get
i know a redirect can kill a post request as it gets converted into a get request

2890270
inherited	subclassing
in python you can change the inherited of a class at runtime but at every given time a class is not a subclassing of another one unless declared otherwise

2890279
rss	feed
so i have an rss feed with variations of each item

2890290
nsstring	nsdata
the dictionary must contain only property list objects instances of nsdata nsdate nsnumber nsstring nsarray or nsdictionary

2890299
int	boolean
basically numbers including int and uints strings boolean null and undefined have value type semantics

2890307
metaclass	subclassing
it is possible to have a metaclass or a class decorator i suppose replace some object that came from a class definition with an actual subclassing after the enclosing parent class has been created

2890324
width	height
it subdivides 2-d space in order to accomodate items identified by their bounding box x y width height on the smallest possible quad up to a minimum area

2890362
treemap	linkedhashmap
create a custom fascade class for a linkedhashmap and a treemap

2890410

2890790
post	get
i was having issues with my encoding between a desktop application sqlite and get post variables

2890790
post	get
it scrubs your get post request i omitted cookies but you could add them if desired on each page load before processing

2890803
metaclass	subclassing	metaclass	superclass	superclass	subclassing
you might be able to do that in smalltalk by modifying or subclassing the behavior class which is the superclass of class and defines the behavior of both classes and metaclass

2890816
integer	unsigned
if you want to work with numbers bigger than the range of uint64_t 2 64 -1 64 bit integer unsigned then you should look into bignum

2890858
16-bit	64bit
given that the pdp-11 is a 16-bit processor you d be much better off running your c through a compiler that will produce 16-bit code instead of the 64bit code you ve posted

2890934
int	chars
doing so will also allow you be able to infer a column s data type such as int chars bigint etc

2890935
queue	fifo
put each message on the fifo queue and you will have all the information you need to identify who sent it

2890940
min	max
you need to perform a groupwise max or groupwise min

i m not using gcc but i think it can just be called with all the source files and will then call the linker with all the object files provided g++ main.cpp record.cpp

2891014
folder	directory
in rubymine go to file open directory navigate to the directory or file that you require this should refresh the view don t add the .idea folder to git if you re using it

2891043
inherited	properties
they have various properties for functions they inherited from the array.prototype like join or splice

2891043
inherited	properties
that first checks to see if the properties name is a number and then checks to see that the properties is defined on a itself not the array.prototype remember that arrays inherited properties from the array prototype

2891121
rtos	isr
typically when using an rtos you can either disable interrupts so that neither the scheduler nor interrupt service routines will run or you can apply a task lock so that the scheduler will not run but isr s will continue to run

2891154
rtp	sdp	rtp	sip	sip	sdp
for a long time i didn t know where to start with the media session and slowly learned how to use the jmf and i ve constructed an object that handles rtp transmitting now i m standing at the cross road on the one hand i have my sip signaling but it needs the sdp content header to complete the invite and on the other i have the rtp which is knows how to p2p

2891154
rtp	sip
that the sip user agent server uas is listening on and the codecs it accepts and can start sending your rtp

2891158
width	margin
in the case where you want to have right margin use 1 as right margin and make the width 49 this way you use 100 of the space and don t wrap to the next line

2891158
width	margin
if you need more margin padding border use a percent-based value and substract it from the width to still make the elements fit

2891158
width	margin
if you have a margin of one percent on each side you need to substract 2 from the width

2891174
min	max
i asked to make a website to view images and manage it s actions like max min autofit ...

2891222
width	height
i d like the radial gradient to fill a rectangular area defined by width and height completely

2891222
width	height
how should i choose the radius of the outer circle to make sure that the outer circle will entirely fill my bounding rectangle defined by width height

2891222
width	height
in other words the bounding rectangle width height must fit entirely into the outer circle

2891238

ready	each
from 0 to 4 5 ready states with each state progressing by 20

2891485
postgresql	mysql
you don t say what database your using postgresql mysql oracle..etc but if your using mysql you could get away with using a tinyint datatype

2891520
button	checkbox
the checkbox inherits the name of the image and is to prevent accidentally pressing the x button and deleting an image

2891549
button	checkbox
i would recommend changing the structure of your form to have a field for confirmation the checkbox one field for the name hidden and your submission button image

2891643
int	double
limited capability to specify generic type requirements generic sum method that takes both int double and a bigint without tricky and often slow hacks

2891731
postgresql	mysql
i just wanted to know what s the equivalent query in postgresql to mysql s

2891797
int	boolean	int	double
any way i could specify that in all cases the conversion will indeed be possible i m basically getting int boolean double and strings

2891837
webkit	gecko
perhaps a firefox extension or hooking up events if they are available on webkit gecko controls

2891847
onclick	onsubmit
you might want to use onsubmit instead of onclick for forms.

2891854
int	boolean
i m guessing you have a type column that indicates if the value is an int boolean date etc

2891859
maven	m2e
i m using eclipse 3.5 maven 2 m2e and tomcat 6

2891866
postgresql	mysql

2891993
codeigniter	kohana
kohana improved alternative of codeigniter

2892018
cos	sqrt
i d rather not use cos or sqrt in order to preserve accuracy and to minimize performance the code would run on an embedded system

2892037
subtract	add
for a custom derived class vector2 from flash.geom.point when trying to override the clone method similar to add subtract methods that will return the type itself it will always complain about incompatible overriding cuz the return type has been altered from point to vector2

2892047
getter	setter
i created a simple collection of person with name age and sex where all three fields have getter and setter

2892053

width	height
you need the width and height attributes in the canvas element

2892079
instances	transient
object references an unsaved transient instances - save the transient instances before flushing

2892081
temp	tmp
ususally a temp directory tmp on linux is used for this

submit	submission
i know that this works on form submission whether the submit is triggered via a submit button or javascript

2892148
sqldatasource	formview
i am using a sqldatasource in combination with a formview

add your uibutton as a left or right barbuttonitem to the uinavigationitem

2892271
listview	gridview
i m trying to center align data in a listview gridview where i use displaymemberbinding

2892279
invokerequired	begininvoke
but winforms includes support for this with the invoke and begininvoke methods to perform a cross thread call with the invokerequired property

2892292
for-loop	arrays
i was wondering if there was a way to access these vector elements similar to two dimensional arrays access currently i am implementing an for-loop to cycle the elements while comparing its coordinates

2892339
stdout	stderr
since the output we re interested in all goes to stdout we can pipe that and ignore stderr

2892350
migrate	upgrade
for that period you can use the free sub-domain provided by the free host and when you ve got it all worked out you may then either upgrade your plan to premium or migrate to a premium host and buy a domain name as well

2892506
jboss	glassfish
this would only lead to collisions in the classpath which leads to this kind of errors and it will make your webapp unportable it is tied to run on tomcat only you can t run it at another servers like glassfish jboss websphere etc

2892506
libs	buildpath
this way eclipse will automatically add the server-specific libs to the project s buildpath

2892532
maven	m2e
assuming you have the maven integration for wtp feature installed from m2e extras and tomcat configured as server just right-click on your project and select run run on server.

2892573
integer	unsigned
as far as the compiler is concerned the conversion from integer 0 to unsigned int is no better than the conversion from integer 0 to pointer

2892582
openmpi	mpich
the instruction says for many users using lam mpi mpich or openmpi configuration is almost automatic i got myself openmpi in c but i didn t do anything more with it

2892634
apache	nginx
my web server nginx and test server apache

2892666
sqldatasource	datalist
my sqldatasource and datalist no header and footer template - works

2892731
hide	show
it is a nested set of ul s and the ul s hover state is what show and hide the sub menu levels

2892756
post	get
this kind of turned into a rant which i thought i d post here in order to get some feedback and to provide some guidance to anybody thinking about sailing into these very murky waters

2892774
mouse	keyboard
for example i am trying to get all .txt files inside of windows explore highlighted without having to select them with the mouse or without other keyboard gymnastics

2892786
width	height
a canvas is just a panel with zero width height

2892786
width	height
you must explicitly set width and height to a non-zero value in order for it to appear

2892786
width	height
now remove either width or height and it will vanish

2892794
int	chars
since this is an int and not a string it returns int not chars or

2892804
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i am pushing a uiviewcontroller onto a uinavigationcontroller

2892827
integer	fractions
there are two distinct cases to deal with integer exponents and fractions exponents

2892827
integer	fractions
similarly to calculate 2 x you can multiply 2 integer part of x 2 fractions part of x

2892859
folder	directory
anyway i create a core repository inside the live mesh folder and then clone from that to a working directory

2892892
actualheight	actualwidth
you can then use actualwidth and actualheight to compute the whole rectangle

2892909
versioning	upgrade
while this was quite an overhead in v1 in subsequent versioning it made upgrade and patching of the live system very natural

2892925
int	double
i d like to make a textbox that accepts only numbers but not int but rather double

2892951
strtol	atoi
i m a c noob and i just found out that atoi is deprecated in favor of strtol etc

2892966
comparator	comparable
when to use comparable vs comparator

2892966
comparator	comparable
comparable and comparator contract with regards to null

2893020
oncreate	findviewbyid
you can use findviewbyid int to identify the view objects in your layout that need to be updated and assign the result to an attribute in your oncreate to allow you to access it later

2893103
rss	feed
ps on the other hand my another webpage mywebform2 in same website has only rss feed and works very well

2893104
apache	lighttpd
document_root may work differently between server configurations apache vs iis vs lighttpd vs nginex

2893156
int	chars
for instance while it can be represented with 4 8-bit bytes and hence fits in a php int you may wish to represent that number in base 10 in a string and then it can have 10 chars unsigned since 2 32-1 is 4294967295

2893165
jquery	scriptaculous
i d recommend just using jquery and getting rid of prototype and scriptaculous .

2893177
i2c	spi
spi i2c parellel

2893194
put	get	post	put	post	get
in the previous version the company used get and post methods but not put and delete methods

2893239
implements	extends
since the jvm cares about the difference between extends someclass and implements someinterface you ll need to recompile c1 against the current importable interface and probably also change its code from extends to implements

2893253
pop-up	dialog
2 you override onclose or something like that to pop-up a dialog to ask the user a question

2893271
bibtex	latex
you can generate a bibtex file the usual way until all the references are there then cut paste the .bbl file into place in your latex file and annotate and reformat away to your heart s content

2893271
bibtex	latex
latex users tend to be better that word users in this respect and i think that it is because of bibtex

2893271
bibtex	latex
for m in particular i use both latex and context both use bibtex but only latex uses biblatex

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
according to w3schools it is supported in ie firefox opera google-chrome and safari

2893411
switching	screens
fine but you re only told how to do that and nothing about the problems that can follow for example if i use their paradigm to switching to a uinavigationviewcontroller the navigation bar ends up too low on the screens because uinavigationviewcontroller expects to be the topmost uiviewcontroller apparently

2893452
client-side	server-side
with javascript mostly being a client-side scripting language this method is not possible since you already have your html document generated from a server-side language such as php

2893513
arp	dhcp
independent of dhcp or not any connected computer that wishes to communicate with the outside world will have to make an arp request for the address of the default router

2893513
arp	dhcp
if the other computer uses dhcp it will make an arp request for it s own address as part of duplicate address detection which is also a broadcast you can snoop on

2893560
keydown	keyup
however the noncharacter keys do raise the keydown and keyup events.

2893571
rss	feed
i am trying to understand how to use syndicationitem to display feed which is rss 2.0 or atom compliant

chown	sudo	chown	chmod
unless you are running lots of terminal windows as root it is not likely that you have many entries under dev pts that belong to root so take note of the one that does after running the above command and then sudo chmod or sudo chown it to make it usable for your normal user and then tell your debugger to use that as your serial connection to your remote debugging target

2893773

2893973
getter	setter
after installing flash builder and the great new plugin sourcemate which helps to get some of the useful features that fdt is famous into fb i realized that when i use sourcemate s generate getter and setter feature it automatically sets my code up using the implicit route

aim	instant
specifically i am talking about using aim and sending instant messages to an existing aim screename

2894191
ready	each
bottom line is the worker has to wait each time it asks the producer to create work for itself so that the producer can muck with the worker s data structures before telling the worker it is ready to run in parallel again

2894219
getter	setter
keep in mind that if all you re doing is straight get set there isn t a whole lot lost by just exposing a public var and bypassing the getter setter with the holding var _variable

2894244
filtering	grouping
i have the following compiled query that i want to return a list of grouping that don t have a groupid that s contained in a filtering list

2894249

another advantage to getter setter is that you can always make properties simple public variables initially and refactor them into getter setter later if needed without changing external code

2894266
awt	swing
you can use component.setname to give names to swing and awt components

2894270

hmac security relies on an other property that the hash function must fulfill

2894496
hash	hmac
note though that the forgery attack has cost 2 58 which is quite high no actual forgery was produced the result is still theoretical but substantially lower than the resistance level expected from hmac with a robust hash function with an n -bit output hmac should resist up to 2 n work factor

2894515
twig	smarty
if your in the market for a templating engine twig a new templating engine used by symfony is much better than smarty imho

2894521
ant	maven
some people use eclipse some people use ant and others use maven or apache maven2

2894521
ant	maven
if you were to create a project from scratch then maven or ant is probably the ideal way to go

2894521
ant	maven
if the project already uses maven or ant loading it with other ides should be fairly simple while if the project uses a specific ide s quirks or uses some more exotic build system it may be harder

2894530
client-side	server-side
the only way to prevent against these attacks is to sanitize and validate input on the server-side instead of or in addition to client-side validation

2894608
post	get
we have a considerable code base with relatively high test coverage for pages forms all via vanilla post get

2894608

2894732
width	height
the square it takes from the original image based on my fixed width height will come from the center of the image to give a proportionally correct thumbnail

getter	setter
the type parameter t appears in types produced getter for parent and consumed setter for parent by this interface

2895332
comparator	comparable
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a treeset instance performs all element comparisons using its comparator or compare method so two elements that are deemed equals by this method are from the standpoint of the set equals

2895332

the appropriate callback is being executed for me in google-chrome but not firefox so i think it has to do with the way the callbacks are handled for an http 500 response in some browsers

2897921
folder	directory
i wanted to try bio_f_base64 so i created an empty console app and added the includes needed also added the paths to the bio and evp folder to c++ incl directory and also added the main openssl folder

2897931
glassfish	weblogic	jboss	weblogic	jboss	glassfish
the normal procedure with eclipse and java ee webapplications is to install a servlet container tomcat jetty etc or application server glassfish which is bundled in the sun java ee download jboss websphere weblogic etc and integrate it in eclipse using a builtin plugin in the servers view

2897931
libs	buildpath
either way eclipse will automatically place the necessary server-specific libs in the project s classpath buildpath

2897938
post	get
use grab the backtrace get var dumps on your session post get server and start compiling enough information to be able to pinpoint the problem

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome safari all work fine but ie 7 8 and 8 compatibility view all wretch

2898044
width	height
try setting a width or height on the hidden div

2898046
width	height
to make it grow from its center you ll have to animate its margins as well at half the rate at which you animate the width and height

2898087
post	get
the problem i have is when i submit a form the post data i get on the other page is empty

2898087
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this site has worked on ie6 on a different windows server it has worked on my laptop and works on all other major browsers firefox google-chrome ie6 7 8 safari etc

2898096
int	boolean
can t use boolean in switch only int

2898110
int	chars
in java switch only works for byte short chars int and enum

2898114
int	chars
the type of the expression must be chars byte short int chars byte short int or an enum type or a compile-time error occurs

2898127
int	boolean
switch takes an int value and a boolean cannot be converted to an int

2898129
put	get
if i put it all together i get

2898135
width	height
the useragent i get is a fairly generic one so my workaround is to tweak my mobile.browser file to have the correct screen width and height of the target device

2898211
post	get
i know how to do this using get but i can t find anything for http post

2898237
children	parent
i m creating a tree control and i m attempting to use a parent element as a template for its children

2898237
google-chrome	firefox
surprisingly i observe the same behavior is in ie firefox and google-chrome leading me to believe that it is by design

2898266
min	max
once you have the circumcircle calculate a bounding box for the circle to use with drawarc using the min max dimensions center + - radius

2898267
stateless	stateful
since the web is stateless but desktop applications are stateful client applications have many more interaction and interface options easily available

2898300
ant	maven
you can also mention that ant together with ivy can handle dependencies quite similar to maven

2898322
sorting	filtering
in my case it turned out that it was much better to use plain html and jquery to realise paging sorting and filtering for a table

2898354
width	height
you re free to put really anything in the back element and have it not affect the flow of content if you want multiple full-size sub-layers just make sure they also have position absolute width height 100 and top bottom left right auto

2898354
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
as written this works in firefox safari google-chrome ie8+ and opera although ie7 and ie6 require extra css and expressions iirc and last time i checked the second css variation does not work in opera

2898383
gtk	gdk	gtk	cairo	gdk	cairo
apart from that it would be easy to just write your own theme engine for gtk that draws all widgets exactly as you want them using cairo 1 or gdk 2 and make your application always use that theme

2898384
memcpy	strcpy
strcpy stops when it encounters a null memcpy does not

2898397
unistd.h	string.h

bluetooth usb host controller 0x05ac

2898458
hide	show
you can use loginview control to show hide depending on role

2898459
int	double
to determine whether a certain float or double is indistinguishable from an int in haskell use floor and ceiling together

2898479
inline	inlining
whether or not the method is defined in place or a hint inline keyword or __forceinline is used the compiler is the only one to decide if the inlining will actually take place and uses complicated heuristics to do so

2898479
inline	inlining
one particular case however is that it shall not inline a call when a virtual method is invoked using runtime dispatch precisely because runtime dispatch and inlining are not compatible

2898501
svg	vml
another option is to use svg or vml ie only

2898508
superclass	subclassing
the superclass constructor runs before the subclassing constructor so the overriding method in the subclassing will be invoked before the subclassing constructor has run

2898596
tiff	bmp
the easiest way to read in a tiff and output a bmp would be to use the imageio class

2898596
tiff	bmp
the only additional thing you would need to do to get this to work is make sure you ve added the jai imageio jars to your classpath since bmp and tiff are not handled by the jre without the plugins from this library

2898596
tiff	bmp
the color model that is being created for the tiff that you are loading is probably an indexed color model which is not supported by a bmp

2898631
unix	solaris
everything happens within the same unix system running on solaris 10

2898669
spaces	delimiter
the comment consists of all characters after the percent sign and up to but not including the end of the line including regular delimiter spaces 20h and horzontal tab characters 09h

as i m using python 2.5 i cannot use python 2.6 getter setter

2898750
chunked	transfer-encoding
transfer-encoding chunked

2898780
hash	salt
basically the salt is just a randomly derived bit of data that you prefix or postfix your data with to dramatically increase the complexity of a dictionary attack on your hash value

2898780
hash	salt
so given a salt s and data d you d just do the following to generate a salt hash of the data

2898781
getter	setter
there s a long standing ticket to add proper getter setter support to django but it s not a simple issue to resolve

2898804
width	height
height 321px width 700px borderstyle solid onpageviewitemcreated radmultipage1_pageviewitemcreated1

2898844
google-chrome	safari
no image will appear in webkit google-chrome safari etc

2898851
jar	war
it can package in a number of different ways jar war ear etc

2898861
google-chrome	firefox
however no matter what i try to do get things vertically aligned i get all sorts of inexplicable results depending upon whether the site is viewed in google-chrome ie6 ie7 and firefox

2898914
gentoo	linux
if you have used source based linux distributions gentoo then maven is the equivalent of portage

2898951
getter	setter
the robotinterface should define getter and setter for the robot properties

2899018
google-chrome	firefox
i am pretty new to jquery in general however the following code works perfectly in google-chrome and firefox but not in ie8

2899023
post	get
on the initial get i can see the value passed in via psk getting set as the default for application in the generated html and all the values show up in the post request in firebug but after i bind the form it still contains no values

2899028
listview	gridview
the items are displayed data-bound in a listview via a gridview

2899033
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it should work in firefox 3+ ie 6+ recent safari and google-chrome

2899033
opera	firefox
doesn t work in opera or firefox 2 and leaves document editable

2899079
ssl	https
for these https connections with the httpclient i am using a custom ssl socket factory implementation to make sure self-signed certificates are working

2899092
put	get
if you put two instances on the same physical server you get

2899094
integer	unsigned
i think that it s unsigned because it s bigger than 2 147 483 647 which is the maximum size for long signed integer so in order to avoid wrap-around it s treating it as unsigned and giving warning

2899102
stdout	stderr
in order to fully be compatible with any console process you need three separate threads one writing to stdin one reading from stdout and one reading from stderr

2899121
actionscript	mxml
what i can t understand - yet - is how to encapsulate actionscript classes or mxml views under this module

2899123
profiling	benchmarking
you can try reading the benchmarking and profiling guide to learn how to find bottlenecks

2899124
int	double
the compiled code will not contain any int 3 only double 3.0

2899124
int	double
so once you concat the two lists the resulting type will be a superclass of double and int

2899136
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
in modern browsers ie8 firefox google-chrome opera safari you can use queryselector

2899137
crypt	salt
for generating salt use something like os.urandom 16 for random bytes or for random base64-alike chars for use with crypt -alikes

2899154
comparator	comparable
it supports where t is comparable even though clearly isn t comparator or

2899154
comparator	comparable
it allows you to pass a comparator into any of the existing apis that demand a comparator when all you have is a type that may be comparable

2899193
innodb	myisam
first of all don t use innodb as you don t seem to need its principal feature over myisam locking transaction etc..

2899224
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
on mac os x 10.6 all firefox 3.6 opera 10.10 safari 4 rendered #fff as #ffffff

if i go to i get my theme s styling and the wordpress error message for when it can t find a post at that particular url

2899264
google-chrome	firefox
testing on ie8 firefox 3.6 and google-chrome 5.0 beta all three browsers repeat the hex digit

2899279
jruby	mri
this would be annoying even when using mri ruby however starting up jruby mongrel after every view edit is much slower and much more annoying

2899324
int	chars
what you do is add a chars and an int thus effectively adding the int to the ascii code of the chars

2899325
scrollable	panels
in the end i opted for a panels child-control on top of the scrollable region

2899344
apache	nginx
anyway to answer your question the main difference between apache and nginx is that apache uses one thread per client with blocking i o whereas nginx is single-threaded with non-blocking i o

2899344
apache	nginx
in fact nginx can use select instead of epoll if you compile it with the --with-select_module option and i bet it will still be more efficient than apache

2899363
xna	slimdx
even though there are great suggestions in this post already such as slimdx and xna i d just like to mention opentk

2899377
sudoers	visudo
if you not already have a restricted account create one create the ssh keys and add the commands that the user should be allowed to execute via sudo to the etc sudoers file via visudo more about sudoers

2899378
getter	setter
i m looking for the syntax of the getter setter

2899387
jasmine	jsunit
as for frameworks jsunit or the more recent jasmine should work fine

2899391
getter	setter
neither is the getter or the setter

2899410
getter	setter
getter and setter go in an implementation context and are usually created using the synthesize directive as in

2899429
client-side	server-side
this is a very hard problem to solve completely because it goes all the way down to the dns level on the server-side and all the way down to default actions in browsers on the client-side

2899435
getter	setter
the getter and setter are two methods that are automatically created when you use property

2899435
getter	setter
by default the getter will have the same name as the property the the setter will have the name prefixed with set and suffixed with

2899435
getter	setter
the readwrite and assign attributes provide some information about how this getter and setter should be defined if you use synthesize to create the definitions for you

2899497
ienumerable	icollection
does its publically visible interface allow to add items or is it a readonly list now ienumerable icollection

2899506
put	get
basically the city and state fields are in a database table and i want to take those locations and get marker put on a google map showing where they are

2899509
subtraction	addition	subtraction	add
now we add both ax and bx as subtraction is implemented by addition in computer br

2899536
for-loop	loops
finally use a for-loop to loops over the resulting file and remove the first characters from the file again

2899603
children	parent
it s faster because you re selecting the parent once the children once and filtering instead of parent children parent again and filtering descendants

2899634
mouse	keyboard
i m writing a game in c++ and i m trying to get it to recognize keyboard and mouse events

2899640
getter	setter
let s say i have this class mapped in hibernate getter setter constructors etc

2899641
min	max
the real problem is that from that input data i need to find min values in each row and max values in each column of the original table

2899667
mouse	keyboard
it all depends on what is the source of your keyboard and mouse events

2899680
post	get
i have a usercontroller and two create methods one for get and one for post

2899680
post	get
the one for get is straight forward but the one for post is not so straight and not so forward p because i need to mess with the model binder to tell it to get a reference of an implementation of itimeprovider in order to be able to construct an user instance

2899712
width	height
edit to generate an array with width i and height j it will also fill out an existing matrix

2899731
groupbox	panel
try using the some splitcontainer controls in combination with some panel or groupbox containers

2899739
spaces	delimiter
you can set the delimiter to a spaces character and split that way

2899784
width	height
my application also moves those elements in accordance to the application width height such as follows

2899810
post	put
probably the best way to do this would be to write a plugin that runs that query and displays the result when you put a certain tag in the post

2899838
int	double
if your data contains all int values convert it to or save it as a signed or unsigned int type instead of the default double precision type matlab uses

2899933
uitableview	nsindexpath

children	parent
i have a simple parent object having many children

2900031
children	parent
i m trying to figure out how to use a named scope for bringing back just parent with specific numbers of children

2900130
put	get
i was hoping i could get some advice on the correct place to put things

2900131
xsl-fo	xslt
i found the xsl-fo designer from ecrion to be good for both programmers familiar with xslt and xsl-fo and old ladies that need to make changes to the templates we are deploying a desktop solution based on xsl-fo that replaces an older proprietary solution and the ladies can make small changes to the document templates

2900152
hide	show
unless you explicitly hide the toolbar it will continue to show when you pop your view by hitting the back button

2900183

min	max
i d like to create a window using wpf that has a thin border all the way around the form - no space for the title bar with the icon caption and min max close buttons

2900262
inherited	subclassing
you can centralize some of that by having each page subclassing your own application page base class instead of system.web.ui.page and make sure that your page base class inherited from system.web.ui.page

2900270
post	get
for some reason only in ie tried 7 8 jquery is performing a post request when it should be a get

2900270
post	get
all browsers properly get but ie is performing a post

2900329
hide	show
another idea is to use the tab bar for the whole app and hide the bar for the views where you don t want it to show up

2900401
gridview	detailsview
i have a master-detail page in which i use gridview to display multiple rows of data and detailsview + jquery dialog to display the details of a single records

2900465
button	checkbox
controls such as windows button checkbox are all defined by the library

2900470
post	get
post data might get lost between pages if you redirect

2900503
children	parent
i m not 100 sure from your description that func2 is called from within the func1 thread but if func2 is run on a different thread that s started from within func1 killing the func1 thread won t affect func2 as all threads exist as children of your parent process not of the thread that they were started from

2900542
unix	bsd
i m using bsd unix

2900547
udp	tcp
windows firewall seems to allow for setting a protocol number in addition to the usual port number -- tcp is 6 udp 17 etc. but i can t seem to find a protocol number for rtmp

2900593
free	malloc
in c++ you would use delete after allocating memory with new and in c you would use free after allocating memory with malloc

2900610
matplotlib	scipy
python offers you very good libraries for that such as numpy scipy and matplotlib

2900636
post	get
if you get a good version of this please post the commands i d like to see it in action

2900690
folder	directory
i tried to test if this was the problem by making the folder chmod 0777 but that just ended up making every script in that directory return a 500 error message until i changed it back

2900694
inherited	properties
so say we you have a css properties that is not inherited by default

2900694
inherited	properties
since this properties does not inherited by default you d think that in div2 foo must be black - the default value because it does not inherited by default

2900698
memcpy	strcpy
you can see that the ch was copied by memcpy but not strcpy

2900755
daemons	launchd
launchd daemons as a child of that child process

2900788
comparator	icomparer
otherwise you need to create a custom comparator by implementing the icomparer interface

2900811
put	get
you get a bowl from the kitchen the malloc and proceed to put stuff in it

2900820
post	get
could anyone give me a other solution and post it please because i already tried nsuserdefault or a nsarray but without i couldn t get it working

2900837
int	double
rawrgbtorgb - converts double to int and returns a color object

2900885
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
could you just xor the data with a long random string then add an md5 hash of the whole lot with another secret salt to detect tampering

2900907
post	get
turns out the problem was by appending parameters in the call to which causes the jquery library to convert post requests to get requests in ie

2900920
put	get
i m using the bowtie symbol for the join operation but when i try to put a text in subscript directly under the symbol i get the following error

2900923
google-chrome	safari
and as bradley mountford points out in a comment below it looks like you can read from webkit using the component parts too although only google-chrome seems to like border-top-left-radius where as both google-chrome safari handle -webkit-border-top-left-radius .

2900923
google-chrome	safari
in webkit tested in google-chrome safari

2900947
vbscript	jscript
you might try to use vbscript or jscript

2900956
vim	emacs
copy prototypes into source file then use keyboard macros emacs visual studio vim to fix things up and or multiple passes of search and replace generating one set of definitions and one set of declarations

2900961
superclass	subclassing
these template methods can be overridden in subclassing which provides for do it mostly like my superclass but do this bit differently

2900987
children	parent
what i don t know is how to iterate inside each loop and check for parent and do that in a dynamic way so that there could be an endless tree of children

2900991
outputstream	inputstream
you should in fact get the contents of the uploaded file as an inputstream and write it to any outputstream the usual java io way

2901017
width	height
i had two identical images one with the height and width attribute and one without

2901027
uiview	subviews
in fact when i don t display the map at all by not even adding it as a subviews of my main uiview but still cycle through the addresses which changes various uilabels and other displayed info the memory usage for the app does not increase

2901032
int	chars
create class person with chars name and int age

2901052
preorder	inorder	preorder	postorder	postorder	inorder
any other operations will depend on what you intend to do with your tree although some generic suggestions are return parent of a given node find left and right child of a given node return the root node preorder inorder and postorder traversals as well as a breadth-first traversal

2901077
google-chrome	firefox
the following code executes fine in firefox and google-chrome but gives an error

2901097
x86	64bit
however with a cas cmpxchg8b on 32-bit systems and cmpxchg16b on 64bit systems for x86 -64 there is enough space in the upper portion of the register to store such a large time-stamp that aba never occurs in practice in even fairly contrived settings it would require one thread to stall for several days or weeks and then to wake-up at precisely the correct moment

2901097
queue	fifo

my api does not depend on spring but i wish to make it spring-friendly by being pojo friendly with zero argument constructors getter and setter

2901173
range	max	range	min	min	max
the problem here was that i changed my mind about what range of values generate int min int max would use

2901180
opencv	emgucv
emgucv is a nice c# port of opencv

2901184
width	height
the code to use a shape would be similar to how i structured the code above but you would set the top left width height and the visible property of the shape control instead of setting border properties

2901281
folder	directory
open a visual studio command prompt as admin cd to the directory where your dll and pdb files are typically your debug folder

2901314
postgresql	mysql
mysql does not provide an implementation of this though it can be simulated with some more or less sophistication i do something similar to the later in postgresql - it s handy for complex non-parametrized queries that are frequently used in reports and for which is tolerable to have not totally up-to-date data

2901336
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
under the hood everything is a view though i ll note that uikit has special views for view controllers which no doubt have some kind of special handling by the system uiviewcontroller has a wrapper view uinavigationcontroller has a uinavigationtransitionview or something ...

2901409
children	parent
when the parent creates the children it should also define the children s other neighbors appropriately as far as it knows them

2901448
width	height
the whole app is visible in the html page but for some reason the background colour of the flex app goes past its height and width properties

2901460
apache	lighttpd
javascript extjs on browsers talks http ajax using xmlhttprequest raw naked or wrapper doesn t really matter to the web server lighttpd apache ...

2901460
apache	lighttpd
you can decide to put more business logic on the javascript and keep the apache lighttpd code really thin so it wont timeout

i have found several different tutorials on how to add button to tables however i am struggling with adding checkbox

2901483
valgrind	glibc
but both valgrind and glibc are complicated beasts and you really really really don t want to do this

2901483
valgrind	glibc
the easy way to get a glibc and valgrind that are mutually compatible is to get both from the linux distro of your choice

2901499
postgresql	mysql
oracle postgresql mysql mssql and sqlite all support as the identifier delimiter though they don t all use as the default - for example you have to be running mysql in ansi mode and sql server only supports it when quoted_identifier is on .

stackless	multiprocess
threading and stackless are both single-core and indeed stackless is non-preemptive so programming for it is quite different than programming for either threading or multiprocess

2901809
multiplying	modulo
push n sp instead of copy n modulo multiplying by the word size

2901825
post	get
do not use a get in lieu of post -- that which i suspect is what you mean by send as a query string would only buy you trouble of all sorts and is a violation of the semantics of get which should be limited to read-only queries ones with no side effects

2901828
post	put
i m having some issues trying to make a http put or post using webclient against a mvc 2 controller

2901828

2901895
post	put
first you need to set either a put or post actionmethodselectorattribute

2901898

my preference is to use a for-loop going backwards this avoids conditional logic of updating loops index depending on whether or not you insert something

2901967
google-chrome	firefox
i am mainly because it has become my primary browser so all development is taking place on google-chrome then i test with ie and firefox

2901973
google-chrome	firefox
i test on google-chrome first firefox second and ie last.

2901973
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome is using the webkit rendering engine similar to safari

2901982
getter	setter
if you re using some other codegen tool i can imagine adding withx fluent setter getter methods would also be easy

2901994
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i test on ie firefox google-chrome and opera and occasionally safari

2901994
google-chrome	firefox
for debugging javascript i tend to use google-chrome for its console and sometimes firebug in firefox - they re both very helpful

2902018
range	minimum
one thing i also need to account for is that there are cases where i don t want to include the minimum in the range and cases where i don t want to include the maximum in the range

2902021
inherited	properties
use the basedon attribute to inherited the properties from the aero style

2902028

google-chrome	safari
google-chrome it usually works like safari but it s good just to make sure

2902046
google-chrome	firefox
since i m working on a google maps api site i test for what they support google-chrome ie and firefox

2902053
installation	upgrade
my 2.8.1 mysql-ruby bindings had been built against libmysqlclient.so.15 and worked fine until i upgrade my mysql installation and replaced that client library with .so.16

2902070
width	height
in the opening application tag of my flex 4 app i set the width and height properties as follows

2902098
x86	64bit
however it works fine when the application is built for the x86 platform and run on a 64bit machine

2902131

hello all i want to retrieve my all the wall post that i have posted until now i am using this fql query from my native iphone application in order to fetch it but i think i am maiking some mistake please guide me how could i do that the following is my fql query to get wall post

2902131

2902259
kerberos	ntlm
for example chrome still has some outstanding issues with ntlm kerberos

2902297
websphere	ibm
ltpa is a mechanism used by websphere and other ibm products e.g lotus products as a means of authentication typically for a single sign on sso

2902326
interpolation	splines
for instance you can use a splines interpolation as implemented in apache commons math

2902332
disk	ram
furthermore think about the architecture the disk is a cache for ram ram is caching for the cpu cache and the cpu cache is for the cpu registers

2902332
disk	ram
so disk - ram - cpu cache - registers there are 3 levels of caching before you get to the registers

2902332
disk	ram
a cache miss at the cpu cache will load more data from ram a cache miss in ram will load more data from disk all this translates into reduced throughput

2902391
width	height
i don t care about dynamically resizing the image according to window size or anything i just want to take large images and resize them to a specific width and height so that the full image fits inside a specific layout

2902475
google-chrome	safari
the problem i m running into is that if you paste the code exactly as seen below using xhtml strict in each browser tested w google-chrome safari ie8 you will see a vertical scroll bar with a few pixels of white space below the div

2902475
google-chrome	safari
doing some experimenting i found that if i remove the doctype completely it works in safari google-chrome but ie gets even worse setting the iframe height to 300px or so

2902475
google-chrome	safari
if i set the doctype to transitional it works in safari google-chrome but has the same problem as in the strict case for ie8

2902488
min	max
this will make you code much cleaner and easier to add standard validation rules like valid email url min length max length etc

2902507
uitableview	uisearchbar
in that view i have a uisearchbar and a uitableview below it

2902559
hide	show
it s not really a solution more a hack but if i hide it and show it again the first time it works

2902601
qtableview	qtreeview
if i replace qtreeview with qtableview in sample source memory will not be consumed

2902601
qtableview	qtreeview
so it seems that qlistview and qtreeview are not intended to be used with very big amount of data and qtableview must be used instead

2902625
switching	screens
i am working with orbited and once i switching on orbited in production mode it throws the following error on my screens

2902853
base-class	subclassing
the python documentation on __del__ warns that the subclassing needs to call the base-class to get a clean deletion but here that appears to be impossible

2902871
post	get
a modelbinder translates http get and post information to a strongly typed object but conceptually these types aren t domain objects but similar to data transfer objects

2902886
portrait	landscape
while i tested my application on an android device turning my android phone from landscape to portrait results in all the list items in my list view are disappearing

2902979
post	get
bear in mind that this is pretty inefficient since for each comment you ll be retrieving the wall post so if a wall post has 10 comments you ll get the wall post data 10 times each time with a different comment

2902986
switching	screens
another application is switching templates when a window is resized used very often in wpf but also applicable to silverlight in order to show less details or a different layout for different screens sizes

2903032
serializable	deserialization
for the xml you need an xml parser when all major browser already have a json parser built in - so you don t have to worry about serializable deserialization

2903035
uitableview	uipickerview
the accepted ui for multiple selection on the iphone is to use a uitableview with checkmarks don t use uipickerview for multiple selection

whatever you do do not modify the core framework code of an existing framework implementation unless you are going to completely upgrade it to the next versioning

2903040
versioning	upgrade
upgrade your framework trunk in one repository then if you need to you can manually upgrade to a new versioning in an application repository

2903068
mouseover	mouseout
if the mouse is already over the element when the document loads itself the mouseover function doesn t trigger i need to mouseout and then mouseover again in order to trigger it

2903082
implements	extends
i need to scan class or jar file that implements or extends a specific class

2903149
voip	sip
a well-documented way to do this with udp is the stun protocol used mainly for sip -based voip

2903149
peer	p2p
if it is not possible to get behind the router you can only use a server in the open network as intermediator some p2p systems also promote well-connected peer to such intermediators

2903152
free	malloc
if you re using glibc you can set the malloc_check_ environment variable to 2 this will cause glibc to use an error tolerant version of malloc which will cause your program to abort at the point where the double free is done

2903195
hide	show
no need to create a diagram per view i prefer to use the show hide links and directly navigate in the java code and model from the same diagram it is easier and a lot more powerful because interactive

2903214
post	get
you can t really use post since i imagine you will be redirecting to the error page and therefore get requests are pretty much your best option

2903223

2903244
getter	setter
searching here and on the internet have not let me to a example of a live template for delphi that generate a property with getter setter and also generate the private field and execute the complication

2903257
accessor	properties
in c# 3.0 and later auto-implemented properties make property-declaration more concise when no additional logic is required in the properties accessor

2903257
accessor	properties
when you declare a properties as shown in the following example see msdn article for example the compiler creates a private anonymous backing field that can only be accessed through the properties s get and set accessor

2903264
int	double
only classes that inherit from system.valuetype string int double ...

2903296
mri	rubinius	ironruby	rubinius	jruby	mri	jruby	rubinius
for those methods which are not implemented in ruby they are implemented in c in mri yarv and tinyrb in java in jruby and xruby in c# in ironruby and ruby.net in smalltalk in maglev and smallruby in abap in blueruby in go in rubygolightly in c++ in rubinius or in objective-c in macruby the netbeans ruby plugin contains a stub method that only lists the method signature and the rdoc comments but not the actual implementation

2903762
button	checkbox
the visibility of the button can be configured via checkbox

2903762

checking the checkbox and saving means the correpsonding button should be shown

2903788
spaces	delimiter
because multiple classes are delimiter by spaces

2903809
hash	md5
it will cost a bit extra but you can compare stuff using md5 or sha hash and if 2 versions are the same you can move on

pop-up	dialog
i have a really odd behavior here i created a little pop-up dialog in jquery ui and in my test html page it works flawlessly

2903956
pop-up	dialog
in firefox 3.5.6 i do get the dialog as a pop-up

2903956
pop-up	dialog
in both cases the dialog page pop-up disappears again after a second or less - without me clicking anything

2903956
pop-up	dialog
update ok one problem is solved - it appears that for whatever reason the default ms ajax stuff is adding some kind of an observer to my pop-up dialog and closes it right away after it shows up -

2903956
pop-up	dialog
so i changed the to and how that doesn t happen anymore - the dialog box pop-up and stays there until i click on either of the two buttons ok and cancel

2903960
realloc	malloc
you can use realloc on the old rows and malloc on the new rows to fix this

2903975
google-chrome	firefox
update i made another test case and got it working in firefox and google-chrome it probably works in other webkit-based browsers too

2903975
google-chrome	firefox
update 2 on further testing the scrolling directions in firefox and google-chrome were opposite

2904035
post	get
i didn t post all the code but i think with this part you can get an idea of it

2904045
getter	setter
the example titled read write property on the already-mentioned delphi live templates page can be modified to generate getter setter methods instead of a private field

2904052
width	height
my application performs a 90 degree rotation on a drawing area so the width and height of the drawing area need to be swapped

2904058
folder	directory
as i understand it the directory structure within the regression.acceptance.tests folder needs to be preserved when copied by the merge task but the documentation is a little vague and i haven t got it to do anything yet

2904134
mouseleave	mouseenter
the main cleanup would be that .css can take an object and .hover as a shortcut for mouseenter and mouseleave like this

2904151
superclass	subclassing
the normal object-oriented way is to use superclass and subclassing

2904168
printwriter	bufferedwriter
bufferedoutputstream and printstream both extend filteroutputstream but bufferedwriter and printwriter does not extend filterwriter

2904206
google-chrome	firefox
this property seems to be unable to handle xhtml at all tested in firefox and google-chrome

2904216
actionscript	mxml
mxml is formally an actionscript generation language

2904216
actionscript	mxml
so the flex compiler will translate all mxml into actionscript

2904248
width	height
the stackcontainer is sized with width and height 100

2904248
width	height
the widget hierachy that contains the stackcontainer is actually a custom widget so the stackcontainer is not actually in a bordercontainer directly but has its height and width explicitly set to 100

2904248
width	height
the inlined height and width specified on the bordercontainer are replaced with explicit pixel dimensions by the stackcontainer

2904248
width	height
however on browser resize the stackcontainer is resized to its parent widget correctly but the explicit height and width on the bordercontainer are incorrect

2904248
width	height
the width and height computed by dojo.marginbox are incorrect the offsetwidth and offsetheight are the dimensions from before the browser maximise

2904253
springsource	grails
i m using springsource tool suite eclipse to program with grails and i m also using jfreechart in the program

2904283
processors	hyperthreading
to be able to detect the number of physical processors cores correctly i ll have to detect if hyperthreading is supported and active or enabled if you prefer and if so divide the number of logical processors by 2 to determine the number of physical processors

2904283
cpu	processors	cpu	hyperthreading	processors	hyperthreading
a quad core intel cpu s with hyperthreading enabled has 4 physical cores yet 8 logical processors hyperthreading creates 4 more logical processors

2904410
mouseup	mousedown
if it did this it would find a simultaneous mousedown mouseup key down key up

now that i m trying to checkout and build from svn i ve noticed that some files seem to be missing in the svn checkout that were present when i checked out the same branch from cvs although the majority are present

2904894
fileoutputstream	printwriter
two things i see instantly maybe copy paste-error are that you don t close the printwriter writer in generatexml and you don t close fileoutputstream fos in writetozipfile

2905016
inherited	properties
combobox is inherited from selector and when you have bounded collection to itemssource properties and you change your value of properties that is bounded to selectedvalue selecteditem then the selector call it s own private method finditemwithvalue object value

2905039
processors	hyperthreading
i think that multi-core processors report that they are hyperthreading enabled even though each individual core can run only one thread

2905082
affinity	processors	affinity	irq	cpu	processors	cpu	affinity	cpu	irq
use a sheilded cpu basically this means turn off irq affinity for a selected cpu set the processors affinity mask for all other processes on the machine to ignore your targeted cpu

2905082
cpu	affinity
on your app set the cpu affinity to run only on your shielded cpu

2905125

2905335
filtering	grouping
having is used to filtering on aggregations in your grouping by

2905386
nsstring	nsobject
something a little different is happening is again specifying a type but this time it s a type casting operation -- what this means is to take the something object reference which could be an nsstring nsnumber or ... and treat it as a reference to an nsobject

2905393
implements	extends
we often need to exchange the messages between 2 devices but the communication protocol is not a public or general one so we need to extends the framework to implements a communication protocol for receiving or sending a message completely

2905713
jboss	geronimo
some other application servers that also include servlet containers are jboss and geronimo

2905775
ienumerable	ienumerator
there s no reason that you have to implement ienumerable in order to create a function called getenumerator that returns an ienumerator that just means that you won t be able to supply an instance of that type to something that expects an ienumerable

2905801
equals	tostring
1 entities equals hashcode and tostring

2905816

google-chrome	firefox
this didn t cause a problem in firefox or google-chrome but ie just displayed a blank page

2906015

perhaps you could iterate through the superview tree drilling down to subviews by tag and add or subtract the subview s frame.origin values to get to a translated windowpoint relative to the view-of-interest s frame.origin

2906833
hash	md5	hash	hmac	hmac	md5
the sha-3 contest notice 070911510â 7512â 01 also suggests randomized hashing and resistance against length extension currently achieved with hmac for md5 sha-1 sha-2 and parallelization a few hash specify a tree hashing mode

int	double
i m attempting to use a double to represent a bit of a dual-value type in a database that must sometimes accept two values and sometimes accept only one int

2907137
min	max
more operations like max min value if they exist or an iterator would be nice of course

2907137
min	max
to implement it i would parse a list into several min max value mod pairs like 1 10 0 1 for 1-10 or 11 33 1 2 for 1-33odd or 12 62 2 10 for 12-62 10 i

2907159
post	get
please consider this post on how to get calendar components from an nsdate

2907196
folder	directory
i want my msi installer to generate a set of folder in a particular location and put a dummy file in each directory

this is the event that fires when each record is processed and it could be used to run a test that determines which rectangle to hide show or what color to give the background of the rectangle

2907326
google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox google-chrome and ie

2907345
stdout	stderr
thinking about it debug information should go to stderr so as not to interfer with stdout so this one should be favoured

2907416
postgresql	mysql
i m using jdbc but i d like to use something that is supported in most db oracle mysql postgresql derby hsql h2 etc...

2907422
datamodel	relational-model
this includes denormalization and nesting embedding - so don t migrate a relational-model to mongodb you should consider also refactoring your datamodel to leverage mongodb features

2907433
groupbox	panel
one simple option would be to perhaps have a panel or groupbox and place all the extra options on there and make it disabled then enable when you see fit

2907441
int	boolean
as a rule of thumb int stays int and any other key is converted to its string representation including boolean and float values as well as null and undefined

2907444
folder	directory
add a post-build command that basically copies the file from the folder into the top directory

2907463
post	get
as for whether to segment it by user id or by post id that depends on whether you will more often be looking for all post viewed by a user segment by user_id to get them all in one query or all users who have viewed a post segment by post_id

2907484
postgresql	mysql
text ms sql server mysql postgresql sqlite

2907491

filtering	grouping	sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping
what we did at our place was store the data from the grid and any filtering sorting grouping in session objects

lowlevelkeyboardhook is a class i wrote a while back that exposes global keydown and keyup events as c# events

2907714
stdout	stderr
edit whoops sorry i forgot to note where these mysterious stdout and stderr come from

2907756
stdout	stderr
for instance in test one you are writing stdout but in test two you are writing to stderr because of some sort of error

2907771
getter	setter
i also know i can use keyboard commands but i m asking if there s a more permanent solution. i have a lot of properties and my setter do important things so it s silly to step over them but most of my getter are pointless

2907814
equals	gethashcode
you can have your class implement iequatable and override the default gethashcode and equals properties to make them equals if all the values are the same or whatever criteria is approproate

2907841
bellman-ford	floyd-warshall
you can use the bellman-ford algorithm to produce a set of single source shortest paths for each node to help you to solve the problem but you might find the floyd-warshall algorithm preferable

2907865
accessor	properties
or you can also bind the selecteditem properties of your listbox to one of your properties and navigate to the uri in the set accessor of this properties

2907874
packets	pcap
first you should know that pcap give you packets and will not reconstruct the tcp stream so you won t be able to read full http tcp streams without first reconstructing the data

2907875
width	height
width height cannot be enforced by a widget they are determined by its container only

2907919
distance	pdist
however pdist is not what i want since that s euclidean distance

2907940
int	boolean
similarly the add method s signature is public boolean add eâ o so it will only accept int as arguments and will fail at compile time if you try to add the wrong type

2907942
versioning	upgrade
when i upgrade my web deployment project from vs2008 to the vs2010 beta versioning i was able to execute the build locally on my development box

2908194
sml	scheme
supposing you want a hash table you can t just hack it as in scheme or sml

2908210
put	get
we ve experience the exact same problem and at the time put it down to our query being badly formed - that sql 2005 had let us get away with it but 2008 wouldn t

2908211
pull	push
so i could push to x then push to y then pull from z and my hg outgoing x output is difficult to predict local-only

2908228

i have a menu which reads file info but for some reason when i open a video that i know is 1280x720 the width and height come up as 1292x758

2908254
qsort	strcmp
in this case it s pretty easy since strcmp works nicely with qsort

this has no problems in any browser tested in ie7 8 and google-chrome but firefox where it is extremely laggy and jumpy and doesn t keep with the 10 fps rate

2908415
getter	setter
convention question when do you use a getter setter function rather than using a property

2908415
getter	setter
i ve run into a lot of differing opinions on getter and setter lately so i figured i should make it into it s own question

2908415
width	height
however their properties often raise events such as resized when a form s width or height property is set

2908433
hide	show
using jquery height on a div containing the content i am able to show hide the user interface as needed based on whether height exceeds the css height of the div with overflow hidden

2908439
move	drag
get a good ftp program such as filezilla or fireftp needs firefox and you could simply select all and drag all folders and files in www upload to www upload and the ftp program will move them for you

2908440
lxml	elementtree
mostly i have seen people recommend lxml but given my parsing requirements do i really stand to benefit from it or would elementtree serve my purpose better

2908458
getter	setter
if a setter or getter is expected to be expensive don t make it a property make it a method

2908479
lxml	elementtree
lxml is basically a superset of elementtree so you could start with elementtree and then if you have performance or functionality issues then you could change to lxml

2908502
textview	imageview
i have extended an arrayadapter to manage a listview using a certain tamplate made of 1 imageview and 1 textview contained in a relativelayout as row of the list

2908535
min	max
also you must set the zoom min and max to other than the default of 1.0 for as apple s docs say this is required for zooming to work

2908545
auto-generate	edmx
i m attempting to implement a repository pattern with my poco objects auto-generate from my edmx

2908567
google-chrome	safari
it s tough to establish a character count with a non-monospaced font but if you don t limit it on the content side you run the risk of upsetting your less visually-inclined users who may be using older browsers that don t zoom all fancy like the latest releases of safari and google-chrome

2908571
ienumerable	iqueryable
just create the basic design which you iqueryable does and drop on the tread pattern that is required as needed your public ienumerable does

2908609
hlsl	glsl
to my understanding it s a free and open source gpgpu library that doesn t depend on opencl instead converting code to hlsl glsl shaders via linq

2908625
actualheight	actualwidth
unfortunately this only works on load because as it seems actualheight and actualwidth don t notify for changes

2908625
richtextbox	textblock
so what is the best way in silverlight 4 to tell richtextbox or textblock it doesn t matter to fill it s parent height and maintain scrollbar if it s content height is bigger

2908668
lxml	elementtree
as others have pointed out lxml implements the elementtree so you re safe starting out with elementtree and migrating to lxml if you need better performance or more advanced features

2908707
inherited	properties
it will be an instance of anglelabel or normallabel but since the portions inherited from customlabel by all three classes are common the bold properties is the same in all of them

2908859
interpolation	splines
solutions in descending order of kludginess 1 pass v4 flag which does some kind of splines interpolation but does not have bugs

2908859
versioning	upgrade
2 upgrade to at least versioning 8.6

2908897
getter	setter
as an alternative for making dictionaries more like general purpose objects what i have done is make categories of nsdictionary that wrap getter and setter for specific keys

2908897
getter	setter
the only problem with setter properties is that you must define the getter in both categories to avoid a warning

2908909
innodb	myisam
make sure you are using innodb for your schema s engine as myisam and others doesn t support foreign keys

2908931
ienumerable	iqueryable
actually the return type of the query may be something other than ienumerable like iqueryable but the point is the type will be statically inferred from the right hand side of the assignment operator instead of being explicitly mentioned in code

2908932
m2e	pom.xml	maven	m2e	maven	pom.xml
eclipse has m2e plugin and if you define locations of remote maven repositories in your pom.xml definition you can add dependencies in its pom.xml editor and it will automatically search the proper artifacts for you

2908932
nexus	artifactory	maven	pom.xml
what is really helpful is using repository manager like nexus artifactory where you gather the most important maven repositories and then you don t need to declare particular repository locations in your pom.xml definition for various artifacts but everything will be proxied via nexus

2908941
ienumerable	iqueryable
if you don t need anything specific to an iqueryable that you can t do with an ienumerable then they behave the same

2908952
implements	extends
i then created a a node that can have 0 to n children and that is part of an n -ary tree class that extends and implements

2908952
implements	extends
after that i started writing a class that extends and implements

2908963
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
i have the code below to implement a dropdownlistfor with checkbox

2908963
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
my problem is that every time i click a checkbox the dropdownlistfor closes and i need to reopen it to select more checkbox

2908964
jar	war
an out of the box grails webapp will already have the plugins folder populated with jar files but the maven build script should take care of populating it just like it does for any traditional war projects such as web-inf lib if it s empty

2908976
expression-blend	silverlight
using expression-blend 4 rc silverlight 3

2908994
post	get
i know this problem is very vague and i am not looking for someone to post a solution but i was wondering if people could suggest places i might look to try and get a handle on this issue

2909004
touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesmoved	touchesended
is there ever a time when the touchesbegan touchesmoved and touchesended methods would be handled inside a uiviewcontroller vs

2909013
stdout	stderr
if the above changes avoids the hang you are probably encountering a deadlock situation that can occur when trying to redirect both stdout and stderr streams via the .net process class

2909021
jsf	seam
i want do to the same without seam just using jsf or maybe a component of a jsf library

2909033
pop-up	dialog
i would like to know if it s possible to use javascript to open a pop-up window containing an image and at the same time have the print dialog show

2909034
jvcl	timage
edit actually it appears that i owe the very capability to load png images to timage to the jvcl library itself and it seems to support transparent png s with timage just fine

2909043
ilist	iqueryable
i think iqueryable has deferred the creation until the sort was executed where the ilist did the creation up front and then performed the sort on it

2909123
stdout	stderr
easily fixed though call setvbuf in the program you are running to increase the stdout and stderr output buffer sizes

2909156
uninstall	upgrade
the obvious problems are that the way these custom actions are sequenced they won t properly support managed elevated uac instals or have any concept of servicing by msi from a repair rollback uninstall upgrade perspective

2909211
onresume	onpause
in other words put your save restore code for persistent data in onpause and onresume

2909233
for-loop	loops
for a for-loop in my own code though it s probably overkill i got into the habit early on of writing my loops such that the length gets calculated exactly once but loops proceeds in the natural way

2909274
next	except
now you say that you want to deploy using hudson which is all good except that you have to recreate everything i describe in the steps above as ants build steps and you ll spend the next 10 years reinventing the vs db project concepts like a .dbschema file and a tools like vsdbcmd

2909296
implements	extends
i m implements sql server fulltext search and i m wondering whether i should limit the search ability to just the primary fields primary address and names for example or if i can extends the search ability across all columns without occurring too much of a performance or memory penalty

2909300
haskell	scheme
functional languages such as haskell scheme and others have what are called pure functions

2909309
debian	linux
if you were using a more sophisticated linux distribution such as debian you could install something like emacs23-nox and get emacs compiled without linking to any x library

2909360
cpython	pypy
cpython is still slow as interpreters go although pypy is looking pretty good these days if it becomes the standard python this problem goes away

2909446
accessor	properties
expose properties with get set accessor

2909467
ready	each
the final outcome was a q d converter written in awk that took the .rc the .cpp and the .h and produced the xaml c# for each dialog in a form ready for editting

2909477
integer	unsigned
for the purposes of setting a value in active directory i would like to convert a long to an unsigned 8-byte integer for assignment to an ad property

2909505
put	get
right now after connection the client can send the first stx and get a single ack but i can t put more data onto the wire after that

2909630
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
it would also be worthwhile to check out the latest developments in the jscience space since it seems like they decided amount with add subtract multiplying divide pow etc

2909649
google-chrome	safari
en-us applewebkit 533.4 khtml like gecko google-chrome 5.0.375.55 safari 533.4

2909667
box-sizing	border-box
i just discovered the box-sizing border-box css property which solves a bunch of cross browser layout problems for me

2909683
subtract	add
you will notice that in a 5x5 array you have to add subtract 5 to move vertically and add subtract 1 to move horizontally

2909701
folder	directory
in an examples folder off the installation directory

2909701
folder	directory
if the installation folder for the library is a system folder make an installation directory in the usual my programs place and put instructions in the readme on how to find it

2909728
inherited	properties
learning c will definitely be of help as objective c inherited its many properties and adds to it

2909763
children	parent
once you add the parent component to the stage using the addchild method that component will start stepping through the component lifecycle which includes creating it s children via createchildren method and sizing and positioning the children via updatedisplaylist

2909763
children	parent
you may not be able to immediately access that parent s children on the next line

2909765
pop-up	dialog
using qt pop-up or qt window instead will cause input focus is automatically set when the dialog is shown

2909798
helpers	actioncontroller
the behavour you expect resides in actionview helpers urlhelper but the method you are calling is in actioncontroller base

2909798
helpers	actioncontroller
for a quick fix actioncontroller base sets a template variable which has access to all the actionview helpers

2909807
uigesturerecognizer	subviews
i am attempting to get a uigesturerecognizer working with a uiwebview which is a subviews of a uiscrollview

width	height
the width and height of the text in

2909862
move	drag
the problem is if i have this option on and click and hold the mouse down to drag the selector the selector doesn t move

2909892
width	height
uses the div container to hold the flash video and an inner div to mask it by matching the width and height as well some other css goodness

2909892
google-chrome	firefox
use your dev tools firefox google-chrome to take a look under their hood

2909919
versioning	upgrade
if your app has already been available for downloads then this is an upgrade path for your app and you must have code in the next versioning to transition your data schema from the old versioning to the new

2909937
google-chrome	firefox
the only other suggestions i have are trying to reduce the number of clicks you have to perform by using modules like administration menu and make sure you re using a fast browser firefox or google-chrome since many of the administration pages use javascript

2909940
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
no wmode or wmode transparent firefox google-chrome and safari

2909940
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
wmode opaque firefox google-chrome safari and ie8 only have ie8 to test

2909944
post	get
or and you need to research this you can probably get a jquery drop down which allows you to do a post back when you hit the bottom of the dropdown

2909952
mp3	wav
if you re transcoding by converting the original mp3 to an uncompressed format like wav and then re-encoding to mp3 at the higher bitrate then it would be impossible to determine the original file s bitrate given only the converted file

2910018
g++	gcc
i did not have your version of gcc or g++ so i could not test with those

2910018
g++	gcc
i did run it through version 3.4.5 gcc and g++ mingw special which both warned packed attribute ignored when ordered like your code but did not complain about mine

2910019
jgit	egit
even though that has been reported in the egit forum there isn t yet a a bug report either in egit bugs or jgit bugs like there was for a similar push error

2910019
jgit	egit
so the right move would be to enter a bug in jgit with as many detail as you can which is why i refer to this old egit bug report as an example

2910035
mouseover	mouseout
for example we can live bind the mouseover and mouseout events at the same time like so

2910037
google-chrome	safari
it was displaying correctly in google-chrome but shifting in safari

2910037
google-chrome	safari
i added the webkit hack to write a specific css style for safari but once i did that....it started shifting in google-chrome

2910060
rss	feed
i am using the newer html5 elements such as time and custom data attributes but not microformats because the data was already structured on the backend and for more structured and semantic access i d would ve used rss feed with specific extensions and include a link to the feed within the document itself

2910060
rss	feed
rss and atom feed provide the same data in a very structured manner but it s an alternative view

2910066
pull	push
what would happen is that the file will come up as conflicted when the second developer pull before doing a push

2910097
prepare	execute
- prepare for execute success

2910114
put	get
it will seem simple enough to add a filter sort or put an attribute in a specific spot somewhere on a report especially when you get pressure from management

2910117
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
you can have your initial view use a simple uiviewcontroller then when the button is pressed load the uitabbarcontroller either programmatically or from a nib and then display it

2910159
maven	pom.xml
im afraid that if i muck with the pom.xml which works so beautifully right now that i will get sucked into a black hole of maven mysteries..

2910186
ada	algol	ada	pascal
the pseudo-code is reminiscent of algol pascal or ada

2910198
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
neither firefox 3.5 safari 4 nor google-chrome 5 all on mac experience this issue

2910201
for-loop	arrays
it might be that you are adding a vector3 to the arrays in the for-loop

2910219
punctuation	words
i want to write a program in c++ that get a sentence and insert a space between each words and punctuation in it

2910219
punctuation	words
so a punctuation such as - or for example a . in no. should not spacing in a sentence but other punctuation that don t rely on a words or a phrase should be spaced

2910248
public	protected
modifiers public protected

2910283
filesystems	xfs
all filesystems implementations ext3 xfs reiserfs etc. expose that same interface on top of whatever specific structures and algorithms they use

2910298
webclient	httpwebrequest
also using a separate httpwebrequest or webclient gives you more control over proxies handling redirection authentication etc

2910356
filtering	grouping
in practice there is also a ledgerid field which is being grouping by though the end result remains the same filtering needs to be done on the join not on the result of the join

2910384
rel	attr
you could enable tracking by adding class trackable to each link and map links to a lookup table by using eg this attr rel

2910404
allocator	stl
when you use a stl container you can change the allocator as template parameter to malloc_alloc and use a lib like dmalloc to see if the memory house holding goes wrong see

2910447
integer	fractions
as an example integer division of 10 3 yields integer value 3 since an integer has no facility to hold fractions residual .3333

2910448
getter	setter
i can t just make the getter serialize back into a string without tearing up large code that reference this array of user objects and i tried to detect in the setter whether i have a string or an array coming in

2910491
urllib	cookielib
typically you ll need cookies to log into a site which means cookielib urllib and urllib2

2910510
ring	hiccup
the latter does not include the compojure namespace at all and has been slimmed down a lot with the basic http handling delegated to ring and various other pieces of functionality spun off to separate projects like the aforementioned hiccup

2910555
firefox	safari

2915921
rss	feed
but when i try to do the same either with css or xpath for the rss feed for the following url mentioned in the code above i dont get any output

2915942
versioning	upgrade
i used to work with rails 2.3.2 before and then i decided to upgrade to versioning 2.3.4

2916035
jar	war
with this the property uptodatewar should be set to true only if the war does not need to be rebuilt and thus the jar task will only be called in this case

2916177
rtp	rtcp
it s a byte array and i don t know how to go about determining if it s an rtp or rtcp packet

2916178
width	height
the viewport may have been set correctly when you created your opengl window otherwise initialise it with the window width and height

2916209
ant	maven
i have an open-source project that i am converting from ant to maven including its unit tests

2916209
jar	manifest.mf
i have tested this in the past and it works well as long as the manifest is indeed available on the classpath at the path meta-inf manifest.mf either on the file system or inside a jar file

2916231
bitconverter	binaryreader
mostly either bitconverter or binaryreader binarywriter

2916264
int	double
you probably want an int long float double decimal - or maybe datetime or timespan

2916293
integer	unsigned
looks like you re treating it as an 24-bit unsigned integer

2916311
dictionary	map
you could use a dictionary to map but that doesn t really let you do any additional processing during the transitions

2916338
post	get
it works fine except that when i try to post method xmlhttprequest from ie i get the login dialog again which causes the request to fail

2916353
int	chars
a chars is just an int value

2916353
int	chars
you can convert each chars digit to its int value and you could then iterate over each chars in the string and do something like this

2916356
int	chars
not magically like that you would need to read in the int and break up the digits yourself or read it as a string so you can access each chars individually

2916363
free	malloc
you ve now lost track of the memory allocated by malloc and have no way to delete it using free

2916379
gridview	sqldatasource
on my ascx page i am using a sqldatasource to select a left join of company and address and a gridview to display the results

2916379
gridview	sqldatasource
by having my updatecommand and deletecommand of the sqldatasource execute two statements separated by a semi-colon i am able to use the gridview s edit and delete functionality to update both table simultaneously

2916405
width	height
i guess that you could put this logic in the a viewmodel and databind the width height center and orientation to properties on the vm

2916413
hash	salt
of course if you don t need strong keys you can go with just a hash of secret word salt + user name and verify them in the application but this is crackable in minutes

2916445
postgresql	mysql
if it is sqlite then consider using postgresql or mysql because sqlite does not play nice with regard to concurrent connections

2916505
pop-up	dialog
i m working on setting up an alarm that pop-up as a dialog with multiple sound file options the user can choose from

2916507
google-chrome	firefox
it all works fine in firefox and google-chrome

2916510
google-chrome	firefox
it shows fine in firefox and google-chrome above the input field but not in ie pops up below the input field and the calender is cut off by the bottom of ie

2916549
perl	tcl
i ve also looked into other langs which have raii and could serve as good alternatives and so far i ve found that d ada vb perl python c php tcl and lua seem to have some sort of out-of-scope callback

2916588
g++	gcc
most linux distributions let you install multiple versions of gcc or g++ in parallel

2916588
g++	gcc
if g++ isn t available for your version of your distro or if you don t have admin rights then you ll have to download gcc compile it yourself and install it under your home directory

2916645
hash	md5
i would suggest using the md5 hash of

2916645
hash	md5
following the advice of the helpful people i would take a hash probably md5 of the query concatenated with a list of its parameters and use this as the key for that particular data store

2916672
packets	pcap
just take the ethernet frames that you get from pcap and extract the ip packets from them reassembling any that were fragmented

2916672
packets	pcap
also if pcap happens to miss any packets make sure you deal with this appropriately

2916704
3-tier	n-tier
someone is trying to build an app that s 3-tier n-tier and mvc not realizing that depending on your point of view mvc is itself either one way in which one can build an n-tier application with each main traditional tier already one part of the mvc acronym or an alternative architecture that you use instead of n-tier

2916710
systemtap	perf
not in the way you describe however there are various profiling tools for linux like oprofile systemtap and perf events i m not sure how well they d fit into embedded development though

2916760
regression	anova
i know python can do anova and it can also do regression line fitting with scipy.stats

2916760
put	get
i m not sure how to put those together to get an effective ancova though if it is possible

2916768
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
now we need to set a cookie with the same key and say a salt md5 hash of their username just in case

2916802
google-chrome	firefox
i tried doing the same process in google-chrome and firefox and it pulled the new file and logged properly on the server

2916820
atomic	lockless
while not the paterson algo the atomicboolean and atomic classes use the approach of lockless busy loops to update shared data

2916821
jar	manifest.mf
well as you pointed you the problem is that the manifest.mf is generated during package and directly included in the final jar and all this occurs after test

2916844
merb	ruby-on-rails
but since merb and ruby-on-rails are converging in the almost-released ruby-on-rails 3.0 at beta 3 right now - the lead developer for merb now performs the same role in the united product i d suggest that

2916856
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
1 but everything is snappy with current versions of firefox safari google-chrome and opera

2916857
folder	directory
that must be the cause of the problem if hibernate3 hbm2java isn t part the build lifecycle it doesn t get the opportunity to register the output directory as source folder

2916949
maven	pom.xml
maven will not be able to validate this pom.xml because the path is not absolute

2916957
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
at this point i would expect any of the size properties height width actualheight actualwidth desiredsize rendersize to give me the size of the textblock

2916962
integer	unsigned
i have a database table which contains an unsigned integer field to store the visitor s ip address

2917000
integer	unsigned
although is now an integer i ve read that mysqli has trouble binding unsigned integers so you should just use s as the type when you bind

2917000
integer	unsigned
you can convert to a string representation of the unsigned integer with sprintf

2917001
pull	push
one might use this to pull using the read-only https protocol and push using an ssh-based protocol

2917062
children	parent
you just have to use font-size property with elements like hn li p and so on but don t try to size both a parent div or blockquote and child paragraphs and headings otherwise children elements don t have the 10px - 1em equivalence anymore

2917072
children	parent
that way you can create the parent enrollment table then just insert new children as you encounter them in the form

2917085
onresize	onload
the way to do it apparently is to use javascript to monitor the onload and onresize events and programmatically resize the filling div like so

2917109
cvs	svn
we have some directories that are tracked in both cvs and svn loooong story

2917120
rsa	dsa
eugene s suggestion of using ecc is a good one - ecc keys are much shorter than rsa or dsa for a given security level

2917141
post	get
but if i use a selectlist in my model and a drop down list in my view and then try to post the model back to my create method i get the error missing method exception no parameterless constructor for this object

2917173
pop-up	dialog
dialog pop-up

2917179
hide	show
considering that i have to support ie6 i wanted to just hide the icons anytime an animation started and show them again when the queue was empty

2917179
hide	show
i couldn t find a reference to any kind of events or hooks into the queue itself and i d rather not add the hide code then the show code to every animation as a callback

2917192
int	chars
it handles varchar chars decimal float and all mysql int types

2917195
inherited	properties
however sometimes these complex types do not have all of the properties that i need so i create a new class in my project that inherited from the complex type used in the stored procedure

2917198
qthread	qmainwindow
i have a qmainwindow with three widgets inside that are promoted to a class containing a subclassed qthread

2917204
post	get
so by circumventing what you may perceive to be just an interface you re actually circumventing an entire client app which could formulate a simple http post or could perform some complex javascript manipulation followed by connection to a flash player and then a direct connection to a login server but you get the point

2917224
qpainter	qimage
qpainter can be used to paint onto qimage qprinter and qpicture paint devices

2917230
versioning	upgrade
always apply schema changes through upgrade sql scripts that use ddl create alter drop statements to change the deployed schema from the on-disk versioning to the current versioning

2917230
versioning	upgrade
this way you keep all you schema changes under versioning control as source text files you can upgrade from any past versioning to the current application versioning and you can easily test all your upgrade paths including upgrading deployments with very large tables

2917241
width	height
the pixel width and height of your renderbuffer are allocated to match layer.bounds.size

2917276
pop-up	dialog
there s nothing more frustrating than trying to get work done with a pop-up dialog asking you to perform an update every few minutes

2917284
webkit	gecko
retrieve parent node from selection range in gecko and webkit raquo

2917285
width	height
consider your grid object with a width and height

2917285
width	height
if the reason you wanted width and height to be constant is really to ensure consistency between width and height and the rest of the contents of your grid object and you ve verified that it doesn t matter whether width and height are replaced before or after other elements of grid are replaced then this assignment should be safe because by the end of the assignment the entire contents of the instance will have been replaced and you ll be back in a consistent state

2917285
width	height
however it then falls to you to ensure that none of grid s internal operations or the operations of friends of grid violate this consistency because the compiler won t be locking down the width and height for you

2917306
nsprogressindicator	nstask
i think this might use things like nsprogressindicator and possibly nstask

2917498
accessor	properties
therefore it differs from the memberbind method by not taking a constructorinfo but a reference to a properties get method properties accessor

2917498
ilist	icollection
created by the expression.listbind method requiring also calls to expression.elementinit this is similar to the membermemberbinding in that an object s member is not being created anew but this time it s an instance of icollection ilist that is being added to with inline elements.

2917502
hide	show
and since this only happens in ie6 it would be silly to hide them in all browsers so in the firing function you can add a class with an ie6 hack like to let them remain show in other browsers

2917504
children	parent
a node keeps its children but it needs to be excised from its parent

2917530
postgresql	mysql
i suggest switching to some other rdbms like mysql or postgresql

2917536
tiff	png
note that some image formats such as png and tiff do fully support the translucency so if you need that then those are the ones to go for

2917545
postgresql	mysql
note that neither mysql nor postgresql guarantee that insert â select â order by will result in the data being ordered in the table

2917560
cpu	processors
if the bottleneck is cpu and you have multiple cpus cores then multiple sessions can use multiple the processors which should speed things up

2917565
folder	directory
i installed kohana in a kohana directory in my xampp public folder and i m trying to get the full base url with the domain and protocol

2917626
public	protected
a class-member-declaration can have any one of the five possible kinds of declared accessibility â 3.5.1 public protected internal protected internal or private

2917633
icmp	udp	icmp	tcp	udp	tcp
ports are abstractions in tcp and udp but not present in icmp the protocol used by ping

2917681
xslt	xquery
it is part of xslt 2.0 but not xquery or standalone xpath

2917813
google-chrome	safari
i have tried using the last-child element but it doesn t work in safari or google-chrome

2917821
rsa	dsa
dsa signatures are signficantly shorter than rsa ones

2917844
sip	sdp
for 1 i don t know anything about jmf so can t answer directly but sdp is not actually a complicated standard unlike sip which is so constructing an sdp packet shouldn t be that difficult

2917844
rtp	sdp
the minimum you need to build an sdp packet are the codecs you re offering and the ip socket you re accepting the rtp on

2917844
rtp	sip
for 2 once you get an ok response you will know the ip socket that the sip user agent server uas is listening on and the codecs it accepts and can start sending your rtp

2917844
rtp	sip
the sip side of the pstn gateway is the same as any other sip uas and once it accepts an invite request it will start sending rtp tp the socket specified in the request and likewise will start listening for rtp on the socket it has placed in the ok response that will be sent back to your sip client

2917844
voip	sip
now it does get confusing because you ll have voip providers that operate sip proxy servers or sip pstn gateways which make it seem as if sip does operate on a client-server model but it doesn t

2917844
rtp	sip
a b2bua like asterisk has a sip configuration option called canreinvite which if set to yes will result in it sending re-invites to either end of the call once it s answered to get the rtp to flow directly between the call endpoints rather than being bridged through itself of course if codec transcoding recording or an equivalent feature is required it will not attempt the re-invite

2917844
rtp	sip
a different approach is a traditional sip proxy approach such as used by openser where it s not designed to bridge media at all and all calls through it will always result in the rtp being directly between the sip devices at either end of the call

2917880
children	parent
i m new to monorail and am trying to figure out how to have it so that i can select a parent category in a dropdown then have it show a second dropdown with the categories that are children of the parent

2917882
rubygems	rvm
you should use rvm as others have said to manage multiple installations of ruby and rubygems

2917908
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
i figure i can achieve what i want by using nscalendar and nsdatecomponents but that would run something like the following

2917917
calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	malloc
in other words every calloc or malloc needs a free every new_item needs a free_item and so on

2917947
stdout	stderr
when it gets a new job it forks writes the pid and running status to the db record opens up stdout stderr files based on the unique job id and uses ipc run to direct stdout stderr to these files

2917965
awt	swing
but some libraries and i think awt and swing do this internally use the class.forname ... method to lazily load implementation classes

2917997
nsmutablestring	nsstring
i took mike s work and turn it into a category for nsmutablestring and nsstring

2918007
org.json	jackson
json reportedly the jackson json parser is faster than the org.json parser built into android

2918008
subtract	add
if i make new_x x cos angle - y sen angle and new_y x sen angle + y cos angle if then i add or subtract the object center x and y to new_x and new_y i actually get to the new point except when angle is 180 where i would need to go with -new_x + x

2918014
floating-point	integer
you would then create the snapshots by calling drawtobitmap on each control you wish to animate and create the movement effect by drawing the snapshots onto the canvas system.drawing can draw images with floating-point coordinates avoiding the jerkiness of integer locations

2918037
maven	m2e
i m using m2e to manage maven projects

2918046
matplotlib	scipy
there are 3rd party tools such as scipy and matplotlib to help specifically with data analysis visualization

2918182
width	height
figure out the difference between the black squares width and height

2918182
width	height
figure out the difference between the blue squares width and height

2918182
portrait	landscape
how can i figure out how much to crop by depending on if the blue square is landscape or portrait

2918218
nullreferenceexception	argumentnullexception
the difference between argumentnullexception and nullreferenceexception is that argumentnullexception is always thrown explicitly like so

2918233
client-side	server-side
python is a server-side language flash is a client-side language

2918279
tcplistener	tcpclient
i m using a tcpclient passed to me from a tcplistener and for the life of me i can t figure out a simple way to get the address and port it s connected to

2918444
mouse	keyboard
enables or disables mouse and keyboard

2918453
mouseover	mouseout
if you re willing to use a richtext field eg contenteditable and designmode you can wrap the word with a and attach mouseover and mouseout events to it

2918453
mouseover	mousemove	mouseover	mouseout	mousemove	mouseout
to determine position you d probably want to start a mousemove event observer if there is a mouseover event on the and stop the mousemove event if there is a mouseout event on the

2918516
union	distinct
use count distinct hashtag.tag_name -- it can t go in the same select you have except with a union of course but on a select of its own or an appropriate union it will give the result you want

2918552
wxpython	wxformbuilder
for such low-end hardware i suggest wxwidgets or wxpython using wxformbuilder to create dialogs

2918552
kate	geany
alternatively you can use some simpler programmer s editor like geany or kate

2918630
width	height
my favorite way to do it it s by using because it s allow do use width height margins and padding

2918644
int	boolean
you can provide more constructor overloads but obviously the number would explode as the number of parameters grow and you may even have multiple boolean and int arguments which would really make a mess out of things

2918654
width	height
the 2d variant takes a float and two parameters height and width

2918806
mouse	keyboard
you might need a microsoft keyboard to use it though you need an m mouse for intellipoint

2918837
hash	salt
limiting chars makes password brute forcers easier smaller pool of chars to check and it shouldn t affect their storage as they should be salt and hash

2918855
versioning	upgrade
i would like to upgrade my fluentnhibernate to versioning 1.1 but i found out it uses castle.core 1.1

2918890
converter	multibinding
if so you could use a multibinding and change your converter to an imultivalueconverter

2918906
post	get
if you post code showing what you are trying to do and where you are having problems you are more likely to get an answer as at least it shows you ve attempted to find a solution

2918935
temporary	tablespace
the difference is because temporary tables are not memory structures they are written to disk specifically your nominated temporary tablespace

2918946
getter	setter
if you know there are no observable side-effects calling the getter or setter i wouldn t bother

2918972
inherited	properties
however the contentpresenter does not inherited the minheight and minwidth properties from the visual child it renders

2918972
width	height
the only remaining issue is to correct these minimums so that the window width and button panel height is taken into account

2918979
getter	setter
general rule not much point in writing tests for getter and setter

2919005
getter	setter
maybe one day someone decides to change a field type or to add some unit conversion code to a setter getter - a test will show if the code still works or it will show that more work is needed

2919015
getter	setter
i ve only seen a very few problems with getter and setter in the wild and only one of those could have been detected via a unit test and only then if all of the getter and setter were tested together rather than by individual test methods

2919015
getter	setter
consider the copy paste mistake of reusing the same field from two different pairs of getter setter

2919015
getter	setter
unit tests that focus on one setter getter pair at a time won t expose the problem

2919015
getter	setter
modern ides will generate getter and setter on request so this mistake is unlikely but not everyone uses modern ides

2919015
getter	setter
for this reason if i test getter and setter at all and i often don t it s from a single test method that calls all of the setter first with distinct values then asserts on all of the getter

2919015
getter	setter
one problem you ve got to live with though is that there s no guarantee that a method that starts life as a simple getter or setter will stay that way when someone else gets their hands on the code and decides say that a getter is a good place do something that involves a side-effect

2919020
onkeyup	onkeydown
in the onkeyup onkeydown and onkeypress events of the textbox

2919049
kde	gnome
is kde or gnome or other

2919052
folder	directory
if you can add files outside public_html directory put all the directory there and put on the public_html directory all the files inside your web directory put your sf directory if it was needed by your app in this case only the web files are accessible on the public however if you can only access the public_html directory and cannot add directory outside it you can put all your files to a folder inside the public_html and secure it i think .htaccess can do the trick the web files should be in the public_html also but you must change the require_once dirname __file__ . .. config projectconfiguration.class.php

2919088
installation	upgrade
i ve checked tfs installation guide i searched through the web all i could find is upgrade scenarios for the server side

2919114
width	height
it also enables you to get the height and width of the video

2919118
youtube	vimeo
you can embed youtube videos your own .flv files using jw player vimeo videos etc

2919174
passenger	thin
besides the reason of not restarting server btw you shouldn t use nginx + passenger for development simple mongrel or thin will do the job better in this case i can think of two more

2919211
children	parent
it is not necessary if you are calling databind on entire page or parent container of this label because it will call databind for all its children

2919221
put	get
however even though my page is encoded as utf 8 - in some places when i try to out put utf text i get funny characters like

2919223
curb	libcurl
you need to install libcurl for the curb gem which your app depends on somewhere

2919345
inherited	properties
opaque is a properties of uiview therefore inherited by all controls buttons etc

2919347
width	height
initial co-ordinates are 0 -60 60 0 since height 60 width 60

2919347
width	height
so now the width 70 and the height 70

2919433
mef	prism
if you are working on a localised wpf app though then i d recommend taking a look at the guidance on codeplex at and if you re building a composite app using prism or mef then i have a blog post on a nice way to accomplish wpf localisation using standard bindings

2919434
post	get
when i get it working i ll post code here but check out above link for the mouse-zoom-to-point part

2919434
post	get
i ll just post the code here rather than get you to follow a link

2919461
sproutcore	javascriptmvc
i have been looking at sproutcore and javascriptmvc

2919461
sproutcore	javascriptmvc
i know sproutcore is backed by apple and looks like it is getting more popular by the day and it has a nice green website whereas javascriptmvc looks less professional with less of a following and less momentum behind it

2919474
mvp	presenter
mvvm model - view - viewmodel is an adaptation of the mvp model -view - presenter or mvc model - view - controller patterns both of which are very popular design patterns for c++ applications

2919474
inotifypropertychanged	icommand
primarily the changes revolve around cleanly supporting the binding and command architecture present in the xaml technologies through use of inotifypropertychanged and icommand objects

2919497
migrate	upgrade
i have been looking for a way to migrate and upgrade our tfs 2008 server to 2010 server preferably without losing any data

2919518
button	checkbox
checkbox and radio button being sub-class of button as displayobject

2919528
post	get
a user is suppose to be able to write some words in a search field and get hits on post that contain the words

2919533
stderr	fflush
you can force flushing the buffer using fflush stderr

2919546
lisp	scheme
first off the syntax is neither common lisp nor scheme the two main lisp dialects which are in common use

2919546
lisp	scheme
secondly it s common more so in scheme than in lisp to use tail recursive functions rather than accumulator based ones so rather to add two lists without using the library functions you would typically take two lists and return a list whose head is the sum of the heads of the two lists and whose tail is the result of adding the elements of each lists tails

2919576
post	get
also note that comparing each post will be o n and could get very slow

2919576
postgresql	mysql
many databases including mysql and postgresql have full-text search

2919580
stderr	fflush	stdout	stderr	stdout	fflush
although we actually did it to stdout but the same rules apply - the actual fflush may not be necessary for stderr but it does no harm

2919590
profiling	benchmarking
you should consider using ab apache benchmarking tool to run a large number of queries and xhprof to profiling analyse your code

2919611
aggregate-functions	sum
sum weight is an aggregate-functions

2919612
children	parent
it may be because of a subtlety in xpath where will select all descendant a elements that are the first para children of their parent and not the first a element in the entire document

2919617
nspopupbutton	nscell
if this is just a warning you re getting from the compiler it s probably because cell is a method of nscontrol nspopupbutton s grand-superclass and is typed as returning an nscell

2919631
curb	libcurl
even curb seems to need libcurl

2919699
for-loop	loops
in your case the whole for-loop and its block is read and all variables except loops variables are expanded to their current value

2919704
versioning	upgrade
anyway i am wondering if anyone knows whether microsoft is going to upgrade fxcop because it seems to be stuck in versioning 1.36 for a long time

2919712
serializable	deserialization
of course you might be able to finagle something using the property list serializable api as well or rather deserialization

2919763
gendarme	fxcop
have a look at gendarme it s a lot like fxcop but from the mono project

2919790
perforce	svn
svn is very slow getting revision logs and comparing them perforce used to be fast with these operations

2919795
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
here s some code i use to add dynamic favicon support to opera firefox and google-chrome

2919813
udp	tcp
i m first connecting client with server using tcp and after server response i want to start file transfer using udp

2919872
sctp	tcp

html5 video doesn t specify a codec to use some html5 browsers support the h.264 codec google-chrome safari and ie9 others support ogg theora firefox opera google-chrome

2920355

2920355
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
to add to the confusion there is a third video codec for html5 called vp8 or webm recently acquired and open-sourced by google this will be supported in firefox opera google-chrome and ie9 but not safari

2920447
getter	setter
if tabbarcontroller is a property declared in your .h file with and you want to automatically create getter and setter methods for it you should use synthesize in your .m file

2920447

if you want to implement the getter and setter yourself you must specify dynamic tabbarcontroller

2920457
hash	md5
then you have use it but you cant add the hash rum til the end of the file expecting it to be correct or if you calculate the run over new yu will always end ut with a new md5 hash

2920462
hash	md5
this place will hold the md5 sum and has to be zero again when verifying the hash later

2920482
hash	md5
well adding a md5 hash to a text changes the text and thus the md5 hash

2920482
hash	md5
computing an md5 hash of your text-including-the-to-be-computed md5 hash is not possible

2920486
hash	md5
what you might be able to try is whether there are any md5 hash values that when hash yield themselves as a result thanks to francesco for that link

2921047
mouseleave	mouseenter
i think you are looking for the mouseenter and mouseleave events

2921098
equals	gethashcode
if you write your own equals method i d recommend to use some gethashcode implementation that doesn t break hashset though

2921115
equals	gethashcode
equals is also used all over the place in the bcl and if anyone else uses your objects they will expect gethashcode to behave sensibly

2921155
equals	gethashcode
if you override equals you should override gethashcode from msdn it is recommended that any class that overrides equals also override system.object.gethashcode.

prepare	execute
given this if the application always opens a prepare statement execute it once and then closes it again there s still no benefit

2921340
instances	transient
some aren t and just use transient statement instances instead

2921340
prepare	execute
looks like the jdbc driver has a threshold setting for avoiding the prepare execute server overhead in the case where the application always does this

client-side	server-side
you could even use javascript server-side if you wanted or client-side c# via different mechanisms

2921446
put	get
the workaround is to put text on a layer above the box the intent is that the box obscures the layers below it and not try and get clever with nested tags

2921450
post	get
you can also use the post redirect get design pattern pattern to avoid this

2921475
width	height
ellipse uses height and width whilst ellipsegeometry uses radiusx y and center

2921475

iboutlet	ibaction
from some reason any time i connect iboutlet or ibaction in interface builder and build my app the app crashes

2921558
post	put
i assume that i would have to use something like an http put or post request to an html doc that contains some javascript that in turn would process the data save it somewhere

2921592
jobs	cron
so if you want to access a resource one at a time you either lock to a file which is good if you are dealing with cron jobs for example or you rely on database transaction mechanism acid features and database resources locking if you are dealing with data

2921598
notepad++	jedit
if you will always be reading data from same source you could sample some files and use an advanced text editor that tries to infer actual encoding of the file notepad++ jedit etc.

2921634
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
rather use getelementsbytagname and or getelementbyid

margin	font-size
it needs formatting margin padding line-height font-size etc but the basic idea that you want is there

2921698

client-side	server-side
i can see no advantage in using the server-side geocoding web service when google maps provides a full featured client-side geocoding api for javascript

2921984
pull	push
mercurial has great backwards compatibility at the network and file level in that any version can push pull commit to any previous version s repositories but it s not forward-compatible so if your windows side is using mercurial 1.0 and your osx side is at 1.5 then windows shouldn t be committing to a clone created by the osx side

2921984
pull	push
in general mercurial was built for a clone-per-user-per-system and having conflicting actions mediated through push and pull

2922108

it and all of its li elements have height and or width properties set to 0

2922126

you can either work with a nsstring local to the loop and release it in the end of the loop - or you can use a nsmutablestring instead

2922289
try-catch	exception-handling
it is true that if you are using junit 3 and you are testing whether a particular exception-handling is thrown or not thrown within a method you will need to use something like the try-catch pattern you define above

cpu	processors	for-loop	loops
a nop operation takes one cpu cycle and in an embedded environment you typically know exactly what clock speed your processors is running at so you can just use a simple for-loop conatining _nop or if only a very short delay is required then don t bother with a loops just add in the required number of nops

we don t use svg file types just the normal mix of jpg gif png and no video audio not yet anyway

2922692
min	max
as i need to get max and min values of different columns and generate random numbers using these values so without picking up individual columns the only other option is to iterate over rows and columns to get the values and compare one by one which doesn t sound all that time-efficient

2922697
width	height
now i ve noticed some problems with this that required me to set the width and height of the rotated object again after the play method but other than that i get the ideal rotation situation

2922704

jlist	jtextfield
in any event i am implementing this by using a jlist contained within a jpopupmenu which is popped up underneath a jtextfield

2922724
equals	tostring

2922778
concave	convex
it s both short and efficient and works both for convex and concave polygons

2922800

2922896
getter	setter
i was wondering what the best practice in perl is regarding getting - or more importantly setting - a global variable of some module by directly accessing in case the module didn t provide getter setter method for it

2922896
getter	setter
just because i can do it in perl i m not entirely certain i should assuming there actually is an alternative such as adding a getter setter to the module

2922944
int	chars
you can t cast a chars array const chars into an int in c at least not in a way that gives you a sensible int result 1

2922944
int	chars
the only exception is if you use it to convert a single chars into an int which is basically just widening it if you look at the bit representation

2922944
int	chars
1 yes i know you can convert a pointer const chars into an int but that converts the value of the pointer and not the value of the data it points to

2923011
getter	setter
a getter setter with proper object encapsulation prevents a lot of this but not always

2923012
getter	setter
if there is no need for such then one could argue against implementing getter and setter which would then look something silly like

2923025
public	protected
public and protected have important roles for public apis private when you are really paranoid and you don t even trust yourself

2923027

there s also free pascal headers to use ffmpeg in delphi from it s c apis and dlls if you re adventuresome

2923128
getter	setter
for example argument validation in setter and lazy computation in getter are both fairly common

2923135
getter	setter
they are just short-cuts for getter setter

2923135
getter	setter
any logic that would be valid in a getter setter is reasonable to put in a property

2923135
getter	setter
any logic that you would normally not put in a getter setter would be inappropriate to put in a property

2923155
folder	directory
like mentioned you could put the files in a vpp directory in the live environment and that way only have to copy ascx-files to one folder for a two-site-code-infront-update

2923156
getter	setter
generally it is not a good idea to implement business logic in getter and setter

2923171
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
you can use the table per concrete class inherited strategy hibernate will replicate all properties for each subclassing this will work with a view

2923173

2923445
rss	feed
despite being optional most rss feed provide a guid element for each item which is a string that uniquely identifies it

2923445
hash	md5
my suggestion would be hashing the description using sha-1 or md5 and then checking the new item s description against the saved hash

2923502
x86	64bit
i think it implies the result binary is x86 not ppc but is it 32 bits or 64bit

2923535
xul	xbl
we implemented the -moz-binding fix for that which references the xml file with the binding information for cropping an element defined with xul xbl as defined here and it worked great.

2923666
lisp	scheme
obviously you won t get a job programming in scheme or lisp but that s not the intention behind my recommendation

2923680
subplot	imshow
2 are images of the same dimensions plotted with imshow and the other is some other kind of subplot

2923680

implements	extends
then have each of your implements classes extends abstracta

2923715
inherited	properties
through the inherited simplejdbctemplate properties in your before method

2923730
implements	extends
or you can make a a class instead of an interface perhaps abstract and extends it implements only what you need

2923754
hash	md5
yes you can generate the md5 or sha1 hash for each set of file data and then compare them

2923761
hash	md5
perhaps you should look for a file md5 hash algorithm

2923773
getter	setter
if that s not strong enough you can use the second case which will use getter and setter to compare every element

2923781
google-chrome	safari

2924311

javascript if you don t mind having this web page open 24x7 use settimeout on page load to wait until a set arbitrary time later on during the day when you do cleaning then call setinterval

there are four signed int types signed chars short int int and long int.

2924394
int	chars
and unsigned chars is in the family of unsigned int types

2924394
unsigned	short	int	chars
for each of the signed int types there exists a corresponding but different unsigned int type unsigned chars unsigned short int unsigned int and unsigned long int .

2924394
int	chars
to answer your question the reason why the stl uses chars as the default type is because the standard streams are meant for reading and or writing streams of chars represented by chars objects not int signed chars and unsigned chars

2924398

2924519
mouse	keyboard
i ve run tests and it turns out that even by leaving the browser window completely still not touching the mouse and not touching the keyboard backgrounds processes on the computer can still cause hiccups which means that for brief periods perhaps as small as a few milliseconds time is standing still in the browser at completely random intervals outside of your control

2924519

2925536
width	height
where height and width can be as big as 1500

2925536
width	height
at 4 bytes per integer with both height and width of 1500 absolute worst case the array size would be of 27mb which imo isn t that big and shouldn t really matter because i m only passing a pointer to the first element of the array

free	malloc
malloc and free if you single-step through them at the assembly language level are probably doing a lot more than you thought

2928078
post	get
i believe the above hyperlink evaluates to get but since the only visibility difference between get and post that is you can see parameters in the address bar with get

2928097
post	get
you can see the query string and consequently whether the request type is get or post

2928097
post	get
clicking a hyperlink generates a get request unless you override it using javascript by simulating submission of a post form

2928155
hide	show
that ll show hide anything with the blinking class every 1.5 seconds

2928263
updatepanel	scriptmanager
but this doesn t work on asynchronous postbacks updatepanel so i then tried the same using scriptmanager which allows me to registrer scripts on the page after async postbacks

2928288
int	chars
i m trying to match an int expression against chars literals and the compiler complains about type mismatch

2928354
int	chars
you can use the chars operator to change the int returned by the stream to a chars

2928361
mouseup	mousedown
i think the most basic events are mousedown and mouseup which are available to every uielement

2928373

2928479
for-loop	arrays
i am trying to create and arrays of objects so that i can access them in a for-loop in jquery and i know that this works in actionscript so what i am trying to do is convert my current knowledge to jquery that will work

2928492
post	get
as an alternative you can grab the raw and un-url-encoded data from the request body in case of post by httpservletrequest#getinputstream or from the query string in case of get by httpservletrequest#getquerystring and then guess the encoding yourself based on the characters available in the parameters and then url-encode accordingly using the guessed encoding

2928509
background-color	transparency
or even better use color background-color white transparency

2928513
maya	blender
if you will have space ships or anything else then you should look into 3d editors like milkshape 3d good for beginners 3ds max or maya for complex models or blender

2928518
puts	fflush
the time saved can be reinvested in thorough unit and integration test enhancement to try and fflush out these issues and puts the tooling in place to help enforce the quality of the input assertions as it would be consumed by a client whether it is a class in your control or not

2928527
persistent	transient
i am using the transient annotation in some projects that persistent with hibernate as well and didn t have any problems yet

2928527
persistent	transient
it is usually used for fields that can be determined by other persistent properties and using a cache should work also because javas serialization mechanisms caches usually expect the cached objects to be serializable take the transient annotation into consideration too

2928527
getter	setter	instances	transient
i think it is preferrable to use transient getter and setter properties that provide the information instead of instances fields whenever possible

2928541
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
also don t forget to call close on the fileinputstream and fileoutputstream when you are done

2928559
hide	show
take a look at jquery it makes writing javascript a lot easier and you should be up and running with it in no time for tasks like your basic show hide functionality

2928571
redhat	fedora
the same procedure has been working properly on redhat and fedora but i m now trying to port to ubuntu

2928582

i ve used benchmarking on different sites for quick easy profiling - it works as expected not great but good enough for my needs

2928705
hide	show
try setting display none to hide and set display block to show

2928716
nfa	dfa
the intersection logic i intend to use is the dragon book s algorithm for converting an nfa to a dfa but executed on two nfa s at the same time

2928716
nfa	dfa
since all dfa s are nfa s but with very little non-determinism you can repeat this as needed for more intersections

2928717
hide	show
display none to hide and set display block to show

2928721
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
as rob commented this search is case-sensitive - he opened a follow-up question on how to search case-insensitive

first create a initial get request and then do the subsequential post requests that will do the postback.the request and the responses should be formulated in this way

2928912
x86	64bit
flash does not run in 64bit so i changed my compile platform to x86 - and voila it works

2928930
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
typically you watch for mousedown on the slider to start the drag and when you re dragging you watch for mousemove and mouseup and keypress if you want to allow esc to cancel and such anywhere on document

2928946
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
on mousedown you should bind an event handler on the document to mousemove and mouseup

2928947
getter	setter
note that model.attribute and methods in activerecord simply call read_attribute and write_attribute so you always can access your attribute even if you override it s getter or setter

2928988
uploadify	swfupload
however there are non-pure-js alternatives that may be an option like swfupload uploadify fancyupload etc

the only method that i ve found that even comes remotely close to what i want is to set static width height values that are much larger than the report will ever be

2929075
folder	directory
put an index.php file in the www directory and have it redirect to the one in the sv folder

2929117
vb.net	vb6
i need to migrate a vb6 project to vb.net

this is one of the areas where an orm can help since it can ensure that these two references the collection of children and the parent reference stay in sync

2929168
switching	screens
then have a second view on the rest of the screens and you can switching views there

2929240
xval	fluentvalidation
this is a personal opinion xval and fluentvalidation have there pro s and con s

2929256
client-side	server-side
in fact xval by itself won t do anything for you--it s just a technology to link a server-side validation framework like dataannotations to a client-side validation framework like jquery validation

2929402
post	get
you can also use the post redirect get design pattern pattern to solve this allowing users to bookmark urls of searches without them expiring as a session would and keeping urls looking friendly

2929424
for-loop	arrays
to build up an arrays of one column i am counting the rows and then looping through that number with a for-loop and then using the to set the incrementing arrays object s value

2929484
hex	binary
why not represent the string not as binary but as hex and then you can store each four-binary-digit section as a single character

2929485
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome does not have this problem

2929543
implements	extends
this is roughly equivalent to java .net where i can extends only one class but implements as many interfaces as i need

2929581
post	get
this one is very tricky to get right and likely requires not showing a total post vote until after someone voted

2929581
post	get
herd-blind voting you don t get to see the post s ranking until you vote or state i will not vote

2929581
post	get
on so you never get the rep if you edit the post significantly enough that it generates additional rep

2929616
vb6	vba
it is a commercial product that enables global error handling in vb6 and vba applications

2929621
put	get
unfortunately there s no way to do a recursion in django s template language so you have to either 1 run a recursive function to get a flattened list of replies and put that in the context or 2 write a function that can be called recursively that uses a template to generate each level which would look something like

2929652
boost	allocator
there s also the boost pool allocator which is generally at least somewhat similar

2929694
gridview	sqldatasource
for rad there are tooling support inside visualstudio like gridview controls datasets sqldatasource and similar

2929694
ironruby	ironpython
frameworks like rails ruby django python asp.net mvc with c# ironruby ironpython .

2929707
mouse	keyboard
you could do it by replacing the default context menu with your own context menu to disable mouse clicks and then you could just stop any keyboard input while the control key is pressed by handling the keydown event and writing code like

2929735
client-side	server-side
you are trying to use the server-side geocoding web service when google maps provides a full featured client-side geocoding api for javascript

2929740
children	parent
now when these elements have children with z-indexes their position in the stack is determined relative to their parent position

2929747
children	parent
parent has a collection bag of children which are cached and lazy

2929747
children	parent
assume that the cache regions for all caches above are large enough to hold all instances of all children and parent in memory easily

2929747
children	parent
at time t1 load parent p and children c1...cn by performing a session.load p and iterating over the children collection so that all c1...cn are loaded

2929771

2929888
firefox	safari	webkit	gecko	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
to support rounded corners in gecko firefox and webkit safari google-chrome you would need the vendor extensions -moz-border-radius and -webkit-border-radius for now

2929901
public	protected
private inheritance means that it is private knowledge that graduatestudent is a student so only friends of graduatestudent and graduatestudent members can static_cast to and to access public or protected member variables of student and call public or protected member functions of student

2929931
public	protected
not true all graduatestudent objects can use any public or protected members of students obviously private members are the exception here internally

2929977
mbunit	nunit
of course there are plenty of other unit test frameworks for .net such as nunit mbunit and xunit

2930002
for-loop	loops
or you could just use the traditional for-loop that reclaims this memory as soon as loops ends

2930033
put	get
the only way i can get this to work is if i put a where clause for the first join

2930034
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

here s the code i used the code in my question at the top of the page uses mvccontrib testhelpers to create a nicely faked controller _controller that internally has faked versions of httprequest httpresponse etc

2930159
hide	show
the trick is to show the element display block but also hide it visibility hidden and to set itâ s position to absolute so that it doesnâ t affect the page flow

2930257
rss	feed
since i couldn t tell from your question if you were building an rss feed that lists yoru site s hot topics or an rss reader that determines hot topics in other sites i ll answer both

2930257
rss	feed
if you re trying to build an rss feed that lists the most hot topics in your site you can

2930257
rss	feed
download the rss feed hot_topics from that specific site if it has any such as newsnow

2930276
outputstream	inputstream
you basically just need to end up with an inputstream in the server side which you then write to any outputstream you want fileoutputstream to store it at local disk file system

2930276
outputstream	inputstream
downloading can be done easy with help of a servlet which obtains the file as inputstream and writes it to outputstream of the response the usual java io way

2930304
super	implements
we implements equals and hashcode in our super class

2930305
button	checkbox
the way we sort of do it is to use an normal button edit box and when the user clicks the button we present a separate form which can be made to look like a drop down box if you like with a checklist or listview with checkbox enabled or similar

2930500
g++	gcc
i have placed symlinks named gcc g++ and c++ in usr local bin

2930561

obviously change the top width height values to suit your purpose

2930692
keydown	keyup
you need to be careful mind you as some of the selenium commands act differently in ie and firefox keyup keydown im sure there are alot more than this

2930692

i can just use the id of the control .trigger event you want to run ie onblur click keyup etc

2930701
int	double
i would like to add a before to all int float double manipulation done in a particular method on a class is that possible

2930821
packets	multicast
wifi you could use the same idea as 3g or use broadcast multicast packets to broadcast your presence

2930827
folder	directory
i had mediawiki installed in as the default site on my server using iis 6 and i created a virtual directory and pointed it to the wiki folder

2930892

2930931
ubuntu	debian
we have run several internal applications for a while on jetty on ubuntu and debian

2930936

i just want to know what is the difference between sending parameter with ajax post get to a servlet and sending them with submit

2931022
kerberos	ntlm
they use ntlm kerberos integrated security and rely on impersonation and constrained delegation to secure access end-to-end

2931022
hash	salt
as long as the hash is properly used correctly salt

2931045
post	get
a standard form submit sends a new http request post or get and loads the new page in the browser

2931045
post	get
in ajax the data is sent to the server post or get in the background without affecting the page at all and the response is then received by javascript in the background again without affecting the page at all

2931066
instances	transient
then when your customermgmtform loads you should provide an instances of isession so that it can load your customers track your changes deletions and the new customers created once joined to the isession so that when you call the saveorupdate method the isession knows what it has to do with the tracked changes and transient entities

2931074
google-chrome	firefox
it s because firefox and google-chrome too automatically url encodes your the src because it is assumed to be a url

2931105
getter	setter	children	parent
they act as getter setter for a private static variable that each extending class should have to allow access to the parent to do the common work on a variable that belongs to the children

2931129
put	get
when i put spaces in the field it performs exactly as i want but if i leave the field blank and press submit i get the error

2931135
client-side	server-side
this is one of the many that uses the syntaxhighlighter 2.0 client-side highlighting script from alex gorbatchev and so if you want server-side it isn t for you

2931154
cakephp	kohana	codeigniter	cakephp	codeigniter	kohana	symfony	kohana
look at what some of the well known frameworks like codeigniter kohana symfony cakephp and zend do and pick and choose which features or design patterns you like

pull	push
but now i want to pull from that server and push to it but git gives me connection refused

2931168
client-side	server-side
i will not have access to server-side processing this has to be a client-side solution

2931245
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
exception classes that are subclasses of java.lang.runtimeexception and runtimeexception itself are unchecked-exception

2931321
int	chars
furthermore rather than check the numeric value of the string with int and ord just use the chars values directly

2931326
typedef	struct
there are some things that are more tedious in c++ like the need to cast void to assign to another type but there are many things in c++ that i find to be conveniences like not needing to typedef your struct to avoid writing struct foo everywhere you want a foo

2931356
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works well in firefox 3.6.3 but in every other browser i ve tested safari 4.0.4 google-chrome 4.1 ie8 it seems to ignore the onsubmit and jump straight to the php processing page

2931374
ubuntu	linux
btw my server os is linux ubuntu 9.10

2931387
post	get
however i have tried sending a delete request and i have also tried sending post and get to the object url with the argument method delete

2931424

2931460
client-side	server-side
the textbox triggers client-side validation on form submission if i leave the dropdown empty though it posts back to the server and returns back the validation error from server-side

2931531
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
fieldset elements are included in the form.elements collection on ie firefox and opera but not webkit browsers google-chrome safari

2931533
png	ico
using a png instead of an ico file

2931548
bash	zsh
this will work in both zsh with setopt shwordsplit or zsh -y and bash zero-based arrays

2931599
pull	push
you should then be able to use git pull or git push

2931688
memcached	apc
either way apc memcached or xcache would be the way to store it

2931696
try-catch	exception-handling
make sure you don t have try-catch blocks that just swallow the exception-handling

2931791
action-filter	onactionexecuting
i then tried a normal action-filter overriding onactionexecuting which did not work either

2931819
children	parent
i d like this function to pay no attention to siblings parent children etc

2931883
atomic	compare-and-swap
we created a temporary object and tried atomic compare-and-swap so we need to dispose this temporary object if it impletents idisposable and it wasn t written to instance s location

2931900
int	boolean
basic communication from my main application to the applet such as invoking simple methods that return int or boolean values works

2931908
draggable	droppable
use ben alman s replacetext plugin to set a class on the highlighted text which will allow you to not only style it but also link to be draggable by jquery ui draggable to a div that you ve predefined and set up with jquery ui droppable

2931944
width	height
for a given font size each letter will have a different height and width

2931948
spaces	delimiter
the clue is if there is some files matched then s variable will contain their names delimiter with spaces

2931989
zoo	xts
xts plain zoo or timeseries or something else

2931989
zoo	xts
i use both xts and zoo but sometimes not sure to use xts exclusively or sometimes zoo have advantage of lighter overhead

2932002
teamcity	nant
we do not use nant on our .net software because vs 2010 and testdriven.net provide far more context-sensitivity than any other build solution and our excellent ci server teamcity natively understands the visual studio build process

2932008
ant	maven
for tools like ant and maven i would use maven you have no license fee but you need to build skill on the tools which may cost some money

2932029
folder	directory
in the setup folder create a separate directory in the application folder for the driver package and add the driver files to the folder

2932071
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox ie6 ie7 and google-chrome

2932095
cairngorm	flex	cairngorm	puremvc
with flex on the front end using puremvc cairngorm or some other framework

2932100
zoo	xts
i am rather happy with xts and zoo and alternate between the two

2932100
zoo	xts
as zoo is a little older some packages interface it rather than xts

2932110
viewdidload	viewwillappear
if i put it in viewdidload or viewwillappear then it crashes with a nsrangeexception presumably because the table isn t set up yet

2932160
squash	merge	squash	branch
if you go ahead and do so you should squash the commits from this branch into another branch on merge so that you or the other repo users can make sense of the commit messages and individual commits

2932198
int	chars
of course the problem is 2 128 is a very large number and can t be contained in any single int variable in c with which to do the math hence the chars 16 struct

2932200
min	max
making use of classes like splheap or min max varieties splpriorityqueue maybe for things like file size or just wrapping your iterator in something like arrayobject which can sort its own contents

2932258
pop-up	dialog
in this event handler i would like to make some call to pop-up the browse for file dialog box which is a native openfiledialog box

2932298
mouse	keyboard
this prevents the checkbox from handling the mouse click or keyboard event that changes its state and allows the data grid to receive them thus giving it a change to enter editing mode and switch to the editingelementstyle which doesn t affect focusability and hit testability

2932353
folder	directory
the option to install to another folder is a bit hard to notice when installing the sdk but the trick is to hit the up down arrows by the default directory on the installation type step

2932377
hide	show
as long as you re keeping track of each container view perhaps using a property you should be able to show hide them on demand using a method in your code which can be as simple as hiding all container views and then showing the one you desire

2932441
lisp	scheme
i need to translate some code from scheme to common lisp

2932490
superclass	subclassing
dynamic casting to a subclassing and then assigning the result to a pointer to superclass is of no use - you practically are back where you started

2932490
superclass	subclassing
dynamic casting can only work for you if you have a pointer to a superclass but you know that the object pointed to is actually an instance of a subclassing

2932518
for-loop	loops
because the for-loop goes through all characters in word the outer while loops is completely unneeded

2932539
int	chars
this creates a list of int corresponding to each letter with 0 if the letter doesn t match chars and 1 if it does and then sums them

2932557
testdriven.net	xunit.net
i can duplicate the issue and it seems to be related to testdriven.net and or xunit.net

2932584
hide	show
how can i show or hide part of the page if the user viewing it is an app user

2932585
rtp	sip
i believe you need to look at the sip packets that come before the rtp packets

2932596
width	height
you then use background positioning and height and width to select which part of the image you want

2932599
ready	each
by using a css sprite you have each image loaded and ready to go on the button instantly

2932626
int	chars
int hex8 chars str

int	chars
printf outputs text to stdout and returns an int representing the number of chars that it output not the actual value that was printed

2932665
printf	strlen
note that printf returns the number of characters that it stored into str so you can actually use this to check whether you need to add the 0 instead of using strlen at all like this

2932676
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu based systems and has to do with automatic session garbage collection

2932682
mouse	keyboard
the idea is that the user can issue a few simple commands by voice instead of keyboard or mouse

2932714
google-chrome	firefox
the ecmascript 5th edition specification defines a method for that and some browsers like firefox 3.7alpha google-chrome 5 beta and latest webkit nightly builds already provide a native implementation so you might want to implement it if not available

2932734
client-side	server-side
one simple strategy is to screen for validity at the client-side and correctness at the server--that is use javascript to ensure that the inputs are of the correct type and form looks like a date and server-side logic to additionally guarantee that the valid input makes sense is in a sensible range for this user

2932734
client-side	server-side
if you don t mind the extra javascript and http requests you could duplicate all of the server-side checking at the client-side but then you d have two separate programs written in different languages to maintain and keep synchronized

2932740
dictionary	map
4 map to a dictionary depicting phonemes to words you could look at the sphinx dictionary as a guide .

2932747
post	get
2- send the search criteria using ajax request using jquery post function for example and get back the json result and using a template will draw the grid clean but will take time to finish and will be harder to edit later

2932769
width	height
note that the width and height is passed from the variable c the avcodeccontext i assume so it may be larger than the actual size of the input frame

2932769
width	height
it is also possible that the width height is good but the pixel format of the input frame is different from what is passed to avpicture_fill

2932769
width	height
for example if c- pix_fmt is rgba and the input buffer is in yuv420 format or more likely for iphone a biplanar ycbcr then the size of the input buffer is width height 1.5 but avpicture_fill expects the size of width height 4

2932771
rss	feed
it appears that it depends on how the rss feed is configured

2932803
virus	botnet
obviously very similar to the virus answer above the difference being that while viruses usually replicate spread do a preprogrammed inconvenient thing a botnet is more of a take control of your machine for a future usually nefarious but dynamic purpose. i think the hosts your agent can more easily change with a botnet too

2932822
free	malloc
this is only possible if malloc was used so pass the ptr to free

2932847
client-side	server-side
however keep in mind that client-side dsls risk drastically increasing load times and ruining the user experience -- coffeescript is primarily server-side for a reason

2932914
rtp	sdp
in the sdp example you ve provided you could start sending rtp encoded with either g711 ulaw pcmu or g711 alaw pcma

2932918
notepad	textpad
the only delimiter i have is eot which i can see in textpad but not in notepad

2932939
twitter	myspace
i am building a rubygem that logs in to twitter google myspace etc. and the hardest part is making sure i have the settings right for that particular provider and i would like to write tests for that

2933000
hash	hmac
i was arguing about an s3 like aproach using authorization hash with a secret key as the seed and some data on the request as the message signed with hmac sha1 amazon s3 way vs an other developer supporting symetric encryption of the data with a secret key known by the emiter and the server

2933015
x509certificate	bouncycastle
mylocalcertificate is an instance of bouncycastle s x509certificate class and myprivatekey is an instance of bouncycastle s asymmetriccipherkeypair

2933029
onmouseover	onclick
fyi the working script swaps by onclick via div elements and the non-working script swaps onmouseover out via a elements

2933042
hide	show
i ended up implementing the functionality which show hide the editbox myself which proved pretty easy for the most part

2933070
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
my app has a uitabbarcontroller that loads many different uinavigationcontroller

2933112
hide	show
i think it should work if you simply swap around the show and hide function

2933112
hide	show
then again i think you are using way too complicated code if you want to hide show just 1 element

2933122
for-loop	loops
note some people suggested to do an internal loops i mean a simple for-loop but when i do this i get a time limit error 60 seconds because loops will take more time to finish

2933126
tail	zcat	uniq	grep
though i may be diagnosing the root cause of an event determining how many users it affected or distilling timing logs in order to assess the performance and throughput impact of a recent code change my tools stay the same grep awk sed tr uniq sort zcat tail head join and split

2933126
xslt	xquery
fortunately in xml-land we have wonderful technologies like xpath xquery and xslt to help us

2933155
rss	feed
the way i move the labels is as follows the news items from rss feed are represented in a group of linklabels

2933156
versioning	upgrade
remember that the gems are associated with your ruby versioning so with the upgrade you may need to reinstall all the gems anyway

2933162
nsstring	nsformatter
this looks like a job for a custom nsformatter or just a read-only nsstring property called paginationstring .

2933170
width	height
the difficulty is that my final picture must have a fixed width and height 304x179 so if the different pictures are too big they must be cut

2933178
nsmutablestring	nsstring
not related to nsmutablestring but i find i also have similar problems using the nsstring componentsseparatedbystring method

2933183
converter	multibinding
i m trying to use a multibinding with a converter where the child elements also have a converter

2933194
lisp	scheme
if you know lisp or scheme already it s a great intellectual tour de force and very satisfying mdash

2933219
width	height
so i can t read the device width and height at runtime

2933219
width	height
i want to be able to read the screen width and height at runtime and set the sizes of my imageviews at creation so they are the optimal size

2933219
implements	extends
public class game extends activity implements onclicklistener

2933219
width	height
height width

2933280
queue	fifo
and the main process would take care of those files in the queue on a fifo basis

2933288
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
this can get a lot more complicated depending on how you handle operator precedence multiplying and device before add and subtract type stuff but the point of the grammar in this case is to help you to write a parser

2933288
yacc	bison
there are tools that will help you do this yacc bison antlr and others but you can do it by hand as well

2933306
width	height
i would generally recommend to not use any width or height properties on the body tag

2933319
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
create a custom subclass of uiviewcontroller within which you set the attributes of the uinavigationcontroller s toolbar set as enabled from within the xib in ib

2933333
mvp	presenter
imho activity is your controller or perhaps presenter a la mvp is the better architectural analogy layout xml and their constituent views are the view layer and your database is your model

2933340
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested it as working on google-chrome firefox and ie

2933357
integer	unsigned
where nameid is some unique 16-bit unsigned integer that identifies the resource and typeid is some unique 16-bit unsigned integer greater than 255 that identifies the resource type you may define those integers in the resource.h file

2933401
pylons	turbogears
similarly pylons and by extension turbogears 2 i guess has configuration options for error emails

2933404
int	chars
note that the format specifier for a null-terminated string is s not c c is to print a single chars and that printf returns an int the total number of chars printed not a chars

2933450
getter	setter
make sure to hide actual member variables in private-convention names would be the member variable and would be a getter setter accessor

2933453
jython	pypy	cpython	pypy
christian perone has an excellent article from just a few days ago where he claims with supporting benchmark data that pypy is now the fastest running the benchmark in 145 seconds vs 300 for unladen swallow and 374 for cpython psyco doesn t help actually psycov2 slows the benchmark down to 434 seconds 557 for jython -- see the url i just gave for all details

2933454
public	protected
in this case how y can access a b and c and by how i mean public protected private

2933463
fadein	fadeout
they are doing a fadein fadeout on visibility

2933465
public	protected
y can look up to its base-class x and see public and protected

2933465
public	protected
derived classes of y can see its public and protected members

2933465
public	protected
both public and protected parts of x become protected in y

2933465
public	protected
both public and protected parts of x become private in y

2933503
google-chrome	firefox
i would start by developing on a more standards compliant browser such as firefox or google-chrome and check your progress with the versions of ie you would like to support

2933506
dottrace	dotmemory
jetbrains dottrace dotmemory and resharper have better integration on unit testing and profiling

2933509
put	get
you don t get insured expecting a fatal accident to recover all the money you put into your insurance plan

2933510
post	get
here s the code that i m using to get the post from specific category

2933545
children	parent
in one case we returned multiple result sets - one set for the parent and one for all the children

2933545
children	parent
the order by was the same so that you could easily interleave the children for each parent in the client code

2933545
children	parent
it was also possible to return multiple result sets - one for the parent and one set of children for each parent we used a cursor for the outer part of this

2933547
post	get
as i search google for how to make a post and it comes up with get and post methods of html

2933612
introspection	typechecking
it does typechecking excellent inheritance has introspection capabilities and with moosex declare one of the nicest interfaces for perl classes out there

2933629
filesystems	fat
a completely different approach to building a filesystems is something like the infamous dos fat filesystems

2933629
filesystems	fat
even though the fat filesystems design is kind of clunky by today s standards it does have the advantage of being really simple to implement especially in its original fat12 or fat16 varieties if you can live with its limitations

2933636
public	protected
a derived class can only access public and protected members of the base class

2933636
public	protected
private public protected inheritance affects how the members inherited from the base class x are accessible to the users of the derived class y

2933636
public	protected
private inheritance is akin to declaring the public and protected members of the base class as private in the derived class

2933636
public	protected
is akin to declaring the public and protected members of the base class as protected in the derived class

2933638
versioning	upgrade
here s another example of the upgrade technique you re looking at as well convert mdb database to another format jet access versioning

2933642
put	get
personally i d take currentuser.instance and either move it to useridentity.currentuser or put it together with whatever similar get the global instance methods and properties you have

2933660
put	get
eclipse is a great ide it requires a bit of cuddling to get it to put out but once it does it can be quite nice

2933666
public	protected
protected - all public members of the base class become protected in the derived class

2933666
public	protected
protected members in the base class are still protected base public derived protected

2933679
rss	feed
or you can suggest any pure css rss feed

2933687
coldfusion	railo
this means either using adobe coldfusion or if you re looking to save money try looking at railo or open bluedragon both are cfml processors

2933718
matlab	simulink
it s brilliant for scientific prorgamming ie like matlab or simulink but 10 times better

2933744
nexus	artifactory
you probably want to start by setting up your own internal maven repository using nexus or artifactory

2933747
for-loop	loops
when you use a for in loops you re iterating over the properties of an object which is not exactly equivalent to the for-loop in your second example

2933754
pop-up	dialog
clicking on the open would cause a dialog to pop-up with all the open options

2933758
allocator	stl
stl priority queue grows and uses dynamic allocator i may be wrong about it though

2933799
awt	swing
when i started programming with the jdk6 i had no problem with text components neither in awt nor in swing

2933845
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
these are all runtimeexception that may be thrown by the programmer at any point exception assertionerror though it is considered poor style to throw certain exceptions like nullpointerexception

2933867
move	drag
cursor is set to cursor move for blank areas so that the user can drag and scroll the webpage

2933918
width	height
i have an jpeg image and i want to reduce its size in bytes .i don t want to change the image size in manner of height and width and not want to lose image quality.some bit of reduce quality is not an issue

2933918
width	height
i try to make it a thumbnail image but it reduce the size according to height and width

2933923
mp3	flac
i ve been recently working on a program that convert flac files to mp3 in c# using flac.exe and lame.exe here are the code that do the job

2933933
rss	feed
i ve written an rss feed parser in java running on android and it parses some feed perfectly and others not at all

2933940
reverse-engineering	obfuscation
some obfuscators such as crypto obfuscation have a feature of embedding all dlls in the main exe so your dlls are not explicitly visible and available on disk to open in reverse-engineering tools such as reflector

2933942
post	http-method	post	get	get	http-method
the mapping of a path in combination with the http-method get post etc. to a controller and a method is done by the routing not by the controller itself

2933999
matlab	simulink
it is way beyond simulink and if you like matlab then it has a type of matlab scripting built in for those that like such ways of programming

2934078
opera	firefox
there was no problem displaying those in opera and firefox though

2934110
allocator	stl
if you construct an stl priority queue at the maximum size perhaps from a vector initialized with placeholders and then check the size before inserting removing an item if necessary beforehand you ll never have dynamic allocator during insert operations

2934124
mouseover	mouseout
the best way i can think of to make sure it s actually text which is moused over and not a blank area is to use and put the mouseover mouseout events in the so that blank areas don t trigger events

2934129
pull	push
in general i would push the messages to be sent on a queue and run a thread which every timer tick pull maximum n messages from the queue

2934157
imagemagick	gdlib
i heartly recommend imagemagick check if installed on your server but you can also roll your own thumbnail script using phps gdlib which is bundled with php and most likely available

2934157
imagemagick	gdlib
there already a ton of prebuilt thumbnail scripts for php which rely on imagemagick and or gdlib

2934157
width	height
but performance-wise it is way better to store just the image pathname in the database along with some meta data like filesize width height etc. keeps your db size down and the select php code for processing the resultset fast

2934162
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
this works fine if i place it in the viewdidappear method but will not work in the viewwillappear method

2934162
viewdidload	viewwillappear
but if i put this code in viewwillappear or viewdidload it has no effect

2934191
nsmutablestring	nsstring
thus there is no reasonable way that a client can cast from nsstring to nsmutablestring and suddenly achieve no-compiler-warning mutability of the string

2934204
nsscanner	nsstring
experimenting with nsstring and nsscanner has yielded no results so far

2934222
floating-point	integer
the cast as float was to force a floating-point division because with integer division 556 227691 would give 0

2934309
post	get
i was a bit concerned as i thought it was decoding the query incorrectly the parameters passed to get or post but it doesn t seem to be doing that by the looks of it

2934317
width	height
constraints on the width and height

2934359
onmousemove	onmouseup	onmousedown	onmouseup	onmousedown	onmousemove
if you really want to detect clicks in whitespace you could try attaching to the onmousedown onmouseup onmousemove events for the page itself

2934368
writetofile	nsdata
i have a problem with a nsdata writetofile

2934391
google-chrome	firefox
i m using pylons to serve a dynamically generated pdf document for reporting my approach works in firefox google-chrome it displays the pdf inline if the plugin is available or otherwise downloads it but ie 7 8 only show a blank page and doesn t prompt for download

2934393
ceil	floor
rounding conversions mean rounding â float double to nearest floor ceil float double

2934435
hide	show
on startup i create a window which i show and hide immediately

2934435
hide	show
so when the last window is closed i need to show and hide this window again hiding is necessary so that the user cannot switch to this window using the window menu or cmd-

2934442
versioning	upgrade
you can run the upgrade wizard and then change the assembly reference to asp.net mvc 1 and update the assembly versioning in the web.config from 2.0.0.0 to 1.0.0.0

2934463
google-chrome	firefox
firefox konqueror and google-chrome don t escape characters for example

2934489
noscript	meta
also those three approaches do not exclude each other but should be combined use ajax for the folks with javascript activated a meta refresh iframe in a noscript tag as a fallback for the ones with javascript disabled as mentioned by stagas and a button or link for manual update once the maximum list reload count has been reached

2934518
put	get
if you wanted to get slightly more intelligent with this and depending on your requirements you could perhaps put some code in place to check whether the user has entered the address box with their cursor at any point and then carry out validation accordingly

2934535
versioning	upgrade
i also encountered problems like yours especially when the web host was upgrade to a newer php versioning

2934550
profiling	instrumentation
profiling your app using instrumentation or shark and look

2934554
put	get
yet every put request i make to the server i get 405 method not supported

2934588
int	boolean
this struct can hold strings int boolean and lists i think used in the language the interpreter is working with

2934635
google-chrome	firefox
and how to make it in firefox or google-chrome compatible

2934665
int	chars
the type of the expression must be chars byte short int chars byte short int or an enum type or a compile-time error occurs

2934709
lz77	lzw
i always thought lz stood for lempel-ziv inventors of most popular compression algorithms lz77 lz78 lzw used nowadays

2934710
ubuntu	debian
if you are a debian ubuntu user the package name is ht not hte

2934724
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
i am using javascript for-loop to loops through a particular arrays and alert it s value

2934788
google-chrome	firefox
i ve just tried the example in firefox google-chrome and ie and it doesn t work

2934788
client-side	server-side
incidentally if the file is larger than max_file_size then calling move_uploaded_file doesn t work so it seems the variable is having an effect server-side but not client-side

2934801
post	get
thanks deizel for the post redirect get pattern

2934818
put	get
to get around this you could put in and get rid of

2934912
vsto	add-in
i m working on outlook 2003 vsto addin.the installer for this add-in creates few registry entries either in hkcu or hklm depending on single user or all user installation

2934984
nsurl	nsstring
and nsurl or nsstring can override it can you try with those things

2935044
subtract	addition
pointer addition is forbidden in c++ you can only subtract two pointers

2935044
subtract	add
similarly you can subtract or add an integral number to from a pointer which means move the pointer up or down

2935083
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
http server may be apache 1 apache 2 nginx lighttpd etc

2935104
google-chrome	firefox
also google-chrome has built-in tools for this and firefox has firebug right click inspect element in either

2935145
identifier	ambiguous
in javascript you can read the offset between utc and the time in the user s current timezone but that doesn t give you a timezone name so you re left either leaving the timezone identifier off making the times completely ambiguous or including it is an explicit offset like utc+01 00 which is ugly and still doesn t take care of changing timezones over different dst periods

2935147
filtering	grouping
the result of grouping is a collection of grouping another collections so you can use where to filtering grouping

2935168
public	protected
note in order to maintain backward compatibility with php 4 php 5 will still accept the use of the keyword var in property declarations instead of or in addition to public protected or private

2935168
public	protected
if you declare a property using var instead of one of public protected or private then php 5 will treat the property as if it had been declared as public

2935223
return-value-optimization	nrvo
rvalue references is not a replacement for return-value-optimization or nrvo

2935323
serializable	deserialization
if the wire format is not too much of a concern you could also user soapformatter or a binaryformatter to handle the serializable deserialization

2935352
getter	setter
there are setter and getter properties for mfield and mvalue

2935371
rss	feed
lets say i have a rss feed which lists the 3 newest questions on so

2935371
rss	feed
i want to download the rss feed every 5 minutes parse it and save the articles that aren t already saved but i do not want duplicates items that remain in the new updated feed like the examples above

2935390
subtract	add
i suppose in your example the result you were expecting was to add or subtract a pointer to an offset to be moved not to another pointer

2935390
subtract	add
in c++ you can subtract 2 pointers getting the offset in memory between them or add a pointer to an integer value moving a pointer to another memory location being incremented by value sizeof object_class

2935390
integer	unsigned
just adding 2 pointers do not make sense in c++ but if you are sure you want to add 2 memory locations adresses just add then as unsigned integer values using typecast

2935404
width	height
the width and the height of the div is unknown it should work for every div dimension and in all major browsers

2935405
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
what you serialize use objectoutputstream can also be deserialized with objectinputstream

2935405
udp	tcp
it plays no role if you transport it over udp tcp a pipe a local file or whatever

2935405
outputstream	inputstream	serializable	deserialization
serializable writes to an outputstream deserialization reads from an inputstream

2935418
post	get
i m pretty sure i remember reading --but cannot find back the links anymore-- about this on some isp including at least one big isp in the u.s. it is possible to have a user s get and post request appearing to come from different ips

2935418
post	get
the same user makes a get then a post then a get again then a post again and the servers see this

2935418
post	get
so altough it s the same user the webserver sees different ips for the get and the post

2935418
post	get
however i m pretty sure this is inherently broken because there are isps where you may see get and post coming from different ips

2935447
tostring	getter
when you call tostring on that date object or use the getter for hour minute second you get values in the local timezone at the client

2935467
fflush	gets
with a lot a dynamic sql calls the sqltext area gets fflush fast enough that query reuse goes way down and peformance follows it on down

2935492
uiview	subviews
i should probably mention i m trying to add this button to a uiview which is a subviews of a uitableviewcell

2935502
width	height
you need to set its top and left to 50 and the margin-top and margin-left to the negative half of its width and height respectively

2935533
width	height
clientdata clientdata int x int y int width int height entity x y width height

2935536
post	get
note here s the link to the example i couldn t get it to work in the post

2935571
stdout	stderr
first of all try fprintf to stderr instead of printf to stdout

2935622
udp	tcp
you say you are sending files over udp yet connecting to the sever with tcp - the two protocols are mutually exclusive over a single connection

2935622
udp	tcp
udp does not provide any mechanism for detecting packet loss that s what tcp is for so by default you won t be able to work out whether packets have been lost

2935622
udp	tcp
in general the tcp protocol manages the available network bandwidth better than the udp protocol

2935622
udp	tcp
most air applications that require socket communications should use the serversocket and socket classes tcp rather than the datagramsocket class udp

2935655
kde	gnome
gnome s and kde s terminal emulators have an option for background images and they have profiles that can set up different settings for different usage

2935662
integer	unsigned
as an example consider the following table which depicts the absolute unsigned range of a 3-bit integer

2935662
subtraction	addition
in point of fact all modern processors employ just such a system in order to implement common alu circuitry for both addition and subtraction operations

2935662
subtraction	addition
when a cpu encounters an i1 - i2 subtraction instruction it internally performs a complement + 1 operation on i2 and subsequently processes the operands through the addition circuitry in order to compute i1 + complement of i2 + 1

2935662
subtraction	addition
with the exception of an additional carry sign xor-gated overflow flag both signed and unsigned addition and by implication subtraction are each implicit

2935671
nuxeo	alfresco	liferay	alfresco	liferay	nuxeo
the popular ones are alfresco nuxeo and liferay

2935844
put	get
when i put the cusor on an input field say papertaken in the first student class i can get the corresponding value in class name eg adam

2935844
put	get
i want to get the student name to put into the request for autocomplete

2935852
prepare	execute
i have a method that takes one prepare statement and any number of parameters binds them to the statement execute the statement and formats the result into a multidimentional array

2935861
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade monorail to the latest versioning and now htmlhelper.inputfile and htmlhelper.datetime don t get parsed

2935877
int	chars
here you printed a chars not a chars representation of an int

2935939
margin	height
i made a quick adjustment to the height and added a top margin for correct placement and now my menu is able to be accessed

2935947
width	height
this technique allows you to align element without knowing its height and width although it requires you to know parent s height at the least

2935964
mouse	keyboard

2940891

however you may want to consider having the browser do your thumbnail generation for you just specify an img tag with the src set to the full size image plus width height attributes which would allow you to save cpu power and disk space at the expensive of having not-so-pretty thumbnails browsers generally scale images for speed at the expensive of quality

2940934
for-loop	loops
inside your loops you re calling which is erasing any added in previous iterations...you need to move that outside before the for-loop so it doesn t do this anymore

put	get	post	put	post	get
assuming this is true which i think it is then this rules out core compliance with true rest in which you should make use of different verbs get put post delete etc.

2943134

and don t worry about having two methods with same name they will be distincted by httpverb one will respond only to get while second to post

2943194
super	implements
marker interfaces are implements by the classes or their super classes in order to add some functionality

2943194

2943369

i d like maven to run my jar looking at file meta-inf groupid artifactid pom.xml inside the package so it knows what the dependencies are and can find them in the repository

2943437
innodb	myisam
if you have so many records in the table then the first thing is to change the table engine to innodb if its not innodb because for large number of records innodb is much faster as it caches the table data while on the contrary myisam engine only caches the indexes so each time it has to do a full table scan from disk if the data required cannot be fetched from index

2943448

the service will need to handle get requests as well as writing new files coming in via post put requests

2943495
rss	feed
i would guess that the site with the rss feed is sniffing the user agent still and the cfhttp one isn t set to one that the site is using

2943495

use a http proxy sniffer ie charles http proxy to record the http request of a browser that is displaying the rss feed correctly then try using cfhttp with the same user agent string as a previously successful request

2943505
r5rs	r6rs
you can use the plt documentation which includes indexes into both r5rs and r6rs

2943753
int	chars
the fgetc function gets the next chars converted to an int and uses a special marker value eof to indicate the end of the stream

2943753
int	chars
to do that they needed the wider int type since a chars isn t quite large enough to hold all possible chars plus one more thing

2943769

struts	stripes
actually most mvc frameworks support restful actions allow to map urls on methods of actions spring mvc stripes struts 2 with the rest plugin

2943898
tstringlist	tlist
if you start using tlist you won t be able to copy it cleanly to your memo.lines which is a tstringlist and you will have created a type incompatibility for nothing plus you will have lost the extra functionality in tstringlist

2943910
hide	show
you can use these functions creaed by me to show an hide the loading animation popup

2944102
sorting	grouping
in the example you gave the team may explicitly ask the po if the sorting grouping functionality is needed

2944102
sorting	grouping
if the requirement for the sorting grouping comes up subsequently as a result of people using early incarnations of the product well that s another story and is estimated scheduled into the backlog accordingly

2944109
min	max
a very simple solution is to set the min and max size of each window equal to each other and to a fix number in the window constructor

2944109
width	height
this way the user can not change the width and height of the window

2944138
mouseover	mouseout
i want to fade in fade out a div element and i m using mouseover mouseout functions

2944233
post	get

2944269
inherited	properties
the cursor properties and the click event are inherited by the element s children

2944269
inherited	properties
to prevent the cursor properties from being inherited you can add a css rule that explicitly sets the cursor for and elements like this

2944276
dictionary	map
for instance you can map collection types to a generic list or an observable collection and for dictionary you can essentially tell it to map to various data types

2944280
google-chrome	safari
turned out i had a response.close in my aspx page which worked everywhere else but probably didn t send some required headers or something to google-chrome and or safari

2944441
strcpy	malloc
strcpy myvalue invalue function copies the contents of the string invalue appended with the string terminated control char 0 to the memory block allocated by malloc

2944441

2944692
mouse	keyboard
and simpler to use only with the keyboard letting apart the need of using the mouse for lots of simple taks saving you time and giving you more focus on the code.

2944738
for-loop	loops
how would you replace a while loops for example without using a for-loop

2944777
equals	gethashcode
the challenge is that some of the objects in the system have overridden equals and gethashcode for use as value equality and their internal values will change over time

2944777
equals	gethashcode
that means that their equals and gethashcode are useless

2944779
post	get
wordpress automatically adds magic quotes to get and post which you ll need to sanitize before saving

2944792
for-loop	loops
in some cases you can put all logic into the third parameter of the for-loop statement and create a loops that looks empty but does some job i am not saying that this is a good style

2944829
multiplying	multiplication
note that matrix multiplication is not commutative so the order in which you multiplying is important

2944843
affinity	processors
we ve noticed that the application seems to run pretty smoothly if we set the processors affinity to a single processors using task manager only manifesting instability when processors affinity isn t set

2944886
affinity	processors	cpu	processors	cpu	affinity
you could use sysinternal s psexec to start your application with a certain processors affinity to bind access to cpu 1 call

2944886
affinity	processors
your vba code will then be executed in process you will have to modify the processors affinity of the access.exe process

2944886
affinity	processors
however before you specify a processors affinity make sure that you are fully aware of the consequences

2944893
google-chrome	firefox
but when i see it on the browser google-chrome firefox looks like this

2944904
post	get
this would get post limited in the range x y with post that have comments and those with the most recent comments listed first

2944907

2944908
fseek	ftell
you can use ftell to read the current position of the file and fseek to jump to a specific position

2944951
post	get
your problem here is to do with get and post requests

2944951
post	get

2944951
post	get
you can access the request method get or post using request.httpmethod

2946011
getter	setter
if you dont do this it will serialized every collection with getter an setter for you

folder	directory
root should be set to the path of the directory that contains your app folder

2946270

2946343
post	get
if you want an idempotent request uri response is always the same then use get else post

every http method post get put delete etc

2946363
post	get
here is what is says about post and get methods

2946363

idempotence is also guaranteed for put which basically means â œupdate this resource with this data or create it at this uri if itâ s not there alreadyâ and for delete which you can simply try again and again until you get a result â deleting something thatâ s not there is not a problem

2946369
post	get
i am trying to get the blog post s text irrespective of what rss url the user inputs

2946370
post	get
get and post have semantic meaning - get is used to retrieve a resource and post is used to modify it

note that i could if needed make each parent show no children and then when the parent is clicked a new list containing all of it s children is loaded

2946574
children	parent
first you ll need a bit of css a hover class and a background on the elements so the parent s background doesn t show up on children because otherwise they have a transparent background so whatever the parent has will show like this

2946574
mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout
then you can use mouseover and mouseout not mouseenter and mouseleave like .hover uses like this

mouseleave	mouseenter
this uses .mouseover and .mouseout so it fires when entering leaving a child element which mouseenter mouseleave specifically won t

2947264
x86	64bit
also am i right to believe that while targeting anycpu will generate no errors when building a application referencing third party x86 .net dlls the application will throw a runtime exception when it tries to load these dlls when it runs on a 64bit os

2947284
google-chrome	firefox

pop-up	dialog
unfortunately because it s blocking chrome will pop-up a dialog complaining that a script is taking too long to execute if you take your sweet time selecting the file

g++	gcc
g++ gcc 4.4.1 20090725 red hat 4.4.1-2

2947724

actualheight	actualwidth
i think the reason is that the actualwidth and actualheight of the viewport are both zero and these are read-only properties so i can t set them manually

2947729

2948110
factors	mean
i mean i wouldn t use an estimate of 100 days programming plus a factors of 2.5 to get a project size of 250 days

2948212

you can use event.stoppropagation with .hover but you re actually using mouseenter and mouseleave with .hover anyway

2949018
mouseleave	mouseenter
if you provide 1 function to .hover it runs on both events if you provide 2 functions the first is the mouseenter handler the second is the mouseleave handler

2949018
mouseout	mouseenter
however this may not be what you re after...since mouseenter doesn t fire when entering a child that s actually specifically why it exists mouseout will fire when entering a child

2949018

however if you are using mouseover and mouseout then it would matter like this

2949179
google-chrome	firefox
works great in firefox and google-chrome

2949236
folder	dir
most antivirus programs protect folder and files in program dir

2949237
getter	setter
yes because that s the convention for naming setter getter for key value coding

2949250
folder	directory
so what i did was locate the source files for the reports reportserver directory and placed the app_theme folder in them hoping that would sort everything out

2949255
post	get
you can have whatever action you want for it get post whatever won t matter

2949260
setinterval	settimeout
using strings in settimeout and setinterval is closely related to eval and should only be used in rare cases

2949303
kerberos	ntlm
ie is very forgiving with ntlm and kerberos challenges

2949318
kerberos	ntlm
if you don t mind a commercially packaged product then take a look at quest single sign on for java which provides support for spnego kerberos including sites and s4u protocols as well as ntlm

2949337
inherited	properties
multiple inherited was sometimes used in c++ and other languages to allow a class to inherited properties and code from multiple base classes

2949366
client-side	server-side
client-side validation using server-side controls based on validatorbase takes place only on postback on any server-side button linkbutton click

2949371
ubuntu	debian
both machines are running java 1.6.0_20-b02 though the production host is running debian lenny the dev host is ubuntu karmic

2949442
iprincipal	iidentity
alternatively writing your own identity principal is pretty simple - look at iidentity and iprincipal

2949491
jobs	cron
i want the script to be called at random so generating the random times for say a month in advance and then creating cron jobs for each of them isn t what i m looking for

2949501
put	get
if i put two undefined variables it complains and i get nothing

2949527
fortran	chapel
if i were betting on it being replaced i d be looking at chapel x10 or most likely fortran 2008

2949548
rss	feed
i have a small test app that parses a few rss feed

2949560
cldc	midp
minimum configuration profile cldc 1.1 midp 2.0 with support for some necessary jsrs jsr-75 for file storage

2949560
recordstore	rms
there could be one key generated for each storage object file rms recordstore etc. or just use one for all the objects of the same type

2949560
keystore	jks
for this case using a standard jks or pkcs#12 keystore file could be suited to store encryption keys but i could also define a smaller structure encryption-transformation key data checksum that could be attached to each storage store using addition files with the same name and special extension for plain files or embedded inside other types of objects such as rms record stores

2949563
hide	show
that said if you re still adamant you should be able to put something together easily using the mouse over events to swap the visibility of the applicationcontrolbar and then you can use show hide effects to display the control bar

2949582
hudson	phpundercontrol
you can also use a continuous integration tool like hudson or phpundercontrol

2949620
subtract	add
add subtract this vector to from your rotating vector point

2949621
cos	sin
in summary you should use sin and cos

2949621
cos	sin	cos	sqrt	sin	sqrt
45 degrees is a special case where sin and cos are both 1 sqrt 2 so it doesn t matter which way round you use them

2949626
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
to get the yellow points just multiplying this up by your 20 pixels and add subtract it on to the co-ordinates of a

2949654
hide	show
the different tabs show hide different divs in the webview but maintain the state otherwise so i need to share the web view between the tabs

2949701
post	get
to start it is firing a get request but the servlet is listening on post requests only

2949701
dataoutputstream	inputstream
apart from the dopost incorrectly been used the io resource handling is incorrect every line has its own try catch exceptions are been suppressed and poor information is written to stdout inputstream#available is been misunderstood the dataoutputstream is been used for no clear reason the inputstream is never been closed etcetera

2949706
hide	show
show hide divs as necessary in tabbar didselectitem

2949804
disk	ram
since it does take me 7mb extra to store the extra column and that has its implications on disk usage and ram usage and our server has cpu power to spare but not ram io i m leaning towards the transform the char into date on each query solution

2949805
cos	sin	cos	sqrt	sin	sqrt
i need to execute it with sin | cos | sqrt | ln where dijkstraâ s algorithm should do the work

2949823
google-chrome	firefox
now i have the joyous task of trying to get this to work with your standard browsers - ie firefox google-chrome

2949830
onclick	onfocus
instead of binding to onfocus event you must bind this action into onclick event and it will work as you wanted

2949860
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
please please please do not store the pw in plain text and preferably not even something that can be reversed - use something like a salt md5 hash so that at the very least if someone happens to retrieve the stored password they don t have anything terribly useful unless they also have your salt scheme

2949869
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox + firebug might help you here or google-chrome safari using the web inspector

2949889
hash	md5
basic example is when you download any file from server server has md5 calculated when it comes to you it again check for md5 values if md5 hash matches file is not corrupted or not modified by any third person

2949924
internationalization	localization
this clearly has something to do with internationalization localization

2949937
groupbox	panel
if those labels are contained within other containers panel controls groupbox controls etc then you will have to write a recursive search - however this would be a good start

2949996
stdout	stderr
if you expect users to redirect stdin stderr and stdout for example when running your program from a different tool then you should make sure that status information and error messages are separated cleanly

2950021
128bit	64bit
you can take a sampling of 64bit from the 128bit hash

2950033
hash	md5
as a cryptographic hash even one nowadays considered broken md5 has no significant correlation between input and output bits

2950046
int	chars
php_plain_files_dirstream_read _php_stream stream 0x02b94280 chars buf 0x02b9437c unsigned int count 260 void tsrm_ls 0x028a15c0 line 820 + 0x17 bytes c

2950046
int	chars
_php_stream_read _php_stream stream 0x02b94280 chars buf 0x02b9437c unsigned int size 260 void tsrm_ls 0x028a15c0 line 603 + 0x1c bytes c

2950046
int	chars
main int argc 2 chars argv 0x028a14c0 line 1188 + 0x13 bytes c

2950062
hash	md5
md5 and sha hash smear the data in a uniform way across the hash value so any 64 bits ypu choose out of the final value will be as sensitive to a change as any other 64 bits

2950072
stdout	stderr
it s worth knowing the difference between stdin stdout and stderr

2950072
stdout	stderr
stdout should be used for normal program output whereas stderr should be reserved only for error messages abnormal program execution

2950078
getter	setter
so i have a fontfamilyproperty and a getter and setter for it

2950097
postgresql	mysql
it must at version 1.0 support ms sql server oracle mysql postgresql and db2

2950097
hide	show
the system must allow an administrative end user to create business rules that will enforce validation show hide ui elements block certain actions based on the identity of specific users specific user groups or privileges

2950126
hash	md5
you can just use any part of the md5 hash

2950126
128bit	64bit
we tried to fold 128bit into 64bit with various algorithms but the folding action didn t make any noticeable difference in hash distribution

2950126
hash	md5
we hash 8 million email addresses into 32-bit integer and there are actually more collisions with md5 than string hashcode

2950144
regasm	regsvr32
regsvr32 don t work with the dll since regasm must be used to register

2950145
awt	swing
small example of how to paint in swing components the same in awt

2950200
stateless	stateful
if you don t use ejbs stateless stateful mdbs jpa will be enough for that and the spring jpa support is excellent

2950201
ant	buildr	ant	maven	maven	buildr
if you have any sort of compiling or processing you should start looking at ant maven buildr sbt etc

2950236
mouseleave	mouseenter
there s no error because jquery catches and throws away event handler errors in response to mouseenter mouseleave line 2170 in 1.4.2

2950236
mouseover	mouseout
using mouseover mouseout instead allows you to see the error

2950263
int	chars
the xyz_history table has all columns from the xyz table including a xyzhistoryid int identity pk xyzhistorytype chars 1 i nsert u pdate d elete and an xyzhistorydate datetime column which is getdate

2950309
uiview	subviews
i have uiscrollview with multiple uiview subviews

2950329
implements	extends
i think you can implements that not trivial but not difficult by extends fileappender

2950389
pop-up	dialog
when the user clicks on a certain link a modal dialog pop-up is shown

2950395
width	height
if so .bmp files if i recall correctly tell you their width and height right at the top so you could actually use that to figure out exactly how many levels you ll have which might help you build something

2950396
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
if you subclassing a control that has this behavior there s really no way to override it because your subclassing will inherited the superclass s implementation of setframe which modifies your frame rectangle

2950396
inherited	properties
you ll most likely have to inherited from uicontrol and implement the properties behaviors you want from uiswitch manually to work around this

2950405
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i have an issue where the javascript source file is loading in popup for ie6 google-chrome firefox safari and opera

2950417
post	put
i have two fedora-based apache webservers making the same ssl put post calls with php curl

2950420
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

2950460
min	max
then use the iterator to get a sequence of integers from min to max both including

2950478
put	get
you have to put 3 ampersands in to get 2 ampersands out

2950510
hide	show
all i can say is start with allowing the user to customize the user interface a little bit hide show fields making a field required in a form

2950623
keydown	keyup
when this property is set to true the form will receive all keypress keydown and keyup events

2950625
int	double
it s saying you need to check if the variable is of the correct data type int double string etc and within some specified bounds mininum maximum value precision string length etc

2950643
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
here is the final working function which solved my issue and works in ie6 ie7 ie8 google-chrome firefox safari and opera

2950732
put	get
personally i would put all the keywords you want in one heading and always remember the golden rule of seo the best way to get good rankings is to have good relevant content

2950744
post	get
i think i get why you want the authentication to only be on the bid post action

2950764
innodb	myisam
in mysql autocommit is on by default for innodb - myisam doesn t support transactions

2950787
stdout	fflush
sub-proceses which produce console output can block and deadlock if their stdout stderror streams are not fflush

2950825
int	chars	int	boolean
calling the methods works fine as long as long as the parameters are simple parameters such as strings int chars and boolean

2950832
public	protected
i m not sure of all the access modifiers but at the most basic only public and protected members are accessible

2950836
public	protected
try the keyword protected instead of public private

2950842
public	protected
public protected internal and

2950845
public	protected
make name protected or public instead that will be accessible

2950852
hash	md5
the standard way is to compute their hash md5 or sha1

2950860
min	max
many basic matlab functions like mean max min sum etc. are designed to operate across a specific dimension

2950877
post	get
i personally use hackbar to send simple post get requests there s a version that can modify cookies per request too i think and wireshark or livehttpheaders although livehttpheaders is also buggy when i need to analyze traffic

2950880
lambda	first-class-functions
as far as must-have features i d say lambda and first-class-functions

2950890
put	get
the best solution is to get a second monitor and put ie on one monitor and the debugger in the other monitor

2950906
base-class	derived-class
public all public members of the base-class are accessible within the derived-class and to the instances of derived-class

2950906
base-class	derived-class
protected all protected members of the base-class are accessible within the derived-class and not to the instances of derived-class

2950906
base-class	derived-class
protected internal all protected internal members of the base-class are accessible within the derived-class and to the instances of derived-class created within the same assembly

2950906
base-class	derived-class
internal all internal members of the base-class are accessible within the derived-class and to the instances of derived-class within the same assembly

2950906
base-class	derived-class
private no private members of the base-class are accessible within the derived-class and to the instances of derived-class

2950945
for-loop	loops
with a for-loop your counter variable is always incremented before the next iteration of loops which adds some uniformity to your code

2950952
post	get
so if i have a need to get categories post authors tags etc. i have to define a new class for every one of these things

2950988
for-loop	loops
remember a for-loop is essentially a fancy while loops

2950988
for-loop	loops
the advantage of a for-loop is that it s harder to accidentally do an infinite loops

2951024
ienumerable	iqueryable
the only things i can find in common with the 2 are that the first is an ienumerable and the second converts itself from iqueryable - ienumerable - datatable.

2951053
hide	show
i have some jquery code that show or hide a div

2951089
post	put
see the following blog post i put together a while ago

2951135
put	get
like this i am having 12 tables from january to december hwo can i combine this and get out put like below

2951140
folder	directory
click the browse button to select the root directory and it should default to the workspace s main folder

2951152
inherited	subclassing
it is important to understand that all members are inherited regardless of their access modifier because it effects the sizes of the subclassing

2951216
pull	push
upon triggering push or pull of one or more changesets an activity graph is placed in the static activity folder of the default template folder

2951331
for-loop	arrays
last tip arrays.copyof anarray anarray.length also returns a copy of the arrays without the the for-loop

2951337
versioning	upgrade
the email-related credentials are ok because i could send emails until i upgrade my rails versioning about two weeks ago

2951346
int	double
that way you have 2 types an int and a double pointing to the same memory

2951357
gif	png	jeditorpane	jfilechooser
what i am trying to do is open up a jfilechooser that filters jpeg gif and png images then gets the user s selection and inserts it into the jeditorpane

2951418
versioning	upgrade
b the upgrade path from free versioning to paid versioning would include data remaining visible

2951480
int	chars
imho it should go through an int and then do some bounds tests and then only cast into a chars

2951498
touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesmoved	touchesended
you can use this code in all touch event functions touchesbegan touchesended touchesmoved and you can count touches and know their states

2951555
uitableview	reloaddata	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
i can of course set some boolean flag and call uitableview reloaddata in viewwillappear or viewdidappear but i was wondering if there s a cleaner way of doing it

2951556
hide	show
i would like for when this anchor is clicked it will hide the first div and then show the second

2951556
hide	show
i just can t figure out how to hide the first and then show the second then third then next when clicking the anchor

2951560
touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesmoved	touchesended
in iphone sdk there are touchesbegan touchesended and touchesmoved functions that are called when a touch event appears

2951560
touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesmoved	touchesended
in any of touchesbegan touchesended and touchesmoved functions i can use fallowing code to know the state for every touch but outside them i can t |

2951573
mockups	balsamiq
in balsamiq mockups this is very easy however i don t see any kind of window-like sketches in sketchflow

2951591
serializable	deserialization
looks like amf serializable deserialization is dealt with in this package red 5 code

2951595
hide	show
if the last div is showing clicking the button will just hide it and show nothing

2951604
mouseover	mouseout
simply attach an event listener to the polygon object mouseover and mouseout events

2951631
post	get
when you load the page check for any post data or get however you re doing it and then check the session to see if a recent search was done using that data

2951641
implements	extends
write a custom formatter extends java.util.logging.formatter class and implements the string format logrecord method according to your needs

2951654
g++	gcc
and to know if it is a g++ idiosincracy or not i should try another compiler but i have only gcc and no time now to analyse the asm output of g++.

2951654
int	double
which is a fragment that initializes to 0 0.0 the int and the double of the struct.

2951655
getter	setter
those objects should have private properties and public getter and setter

2951659
folder	directory
i have a folder with a few files that i would like to copy one directory up this folder also has some files that i don t want to copy

2951678
shutil	copytree
the shutil module can do this specifically the copyfile copy copy2 and copytree functions

2951679
wan	lan
the lan or wan

2951682
post	get
with a normal restful create action it would be with a post from a form or something but 404s are generally rendered from a failed get action where an activerecord find fails to locate a record with a specific id

2951685
daemons	systemd
if your target platform is debian based it makes sense to create a debina package to deploy it as it also helps getting a daemons properly integrated in the rest of the systemd

2951689
inherited	properties
nhibernate has greater flexibility in inherited mapping better integration with stored procs database functions custom sql triggers support for formula properties and it just a more mature platform than ef 4

2951704
free	malloc
my guess is it s the same thing but when i use malloc i also have to free that

2951738
post	get
the are things like sniffers on simple network analysis tools even like firebug that let you see the data transfered via post or get

2951743
rsa	dsa
you seem to have rsa and dsa confused

2951810
int	boolean
implicit conversion of any int value such as flags 0x80 to a boolean implies a language defined mapping from an int value to a boolean

2951833
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
in practice most of my loops are either stepping through an arrays or structure of some kind in which case i use a for-loop

2951834
webclient	httpwebrequest
that error wouldn t be happening on the client since reader quotas are a wcf-only thing and webclient httpwebrequest don t do deserialization themselves or enforce any other kind of quotas

2951905
int	boolean
mapping the entire range of int -- or the even larger range of floats -- onto the two boolean values is fraught with disagreement over arbitrary assignment of truthness and falseness

2951905
int	double
when you try to automatically convert a double to an int java flags this as a loss of precision error

2951917
wordpress	joomla
security is a major concern and i d like to learn from some of the popular php cms s like wordpress joomla drupal etc

2951954
post	get
enabling register globals so that get and post variables

2951991
post	get
the basic idea is to trick a user to a page where his browser will initiate a post or get request to the cms you attack

2951991
hash	md5
which is a bad idea because of rainbow tables even if the hash is not md5 but sha512 for example

2951991
salt	md5
salt md5

2951999
int	chars
i want to show a select which options are the chars - and a range of int

2952028
persistent	transient
the two typical usages of transient and transient that i m aware of are to use them either for stuff that can t be serialized persistent a remote resource handle or computed properties which can be reconstructed from others

2952040
hide	show
however i suspect that you also want to hide all other divs when one div is show

2952055
opera	firefox
it s not compatible with firefox neither opera so i can t use firebug or such plugins

2952087
int	boolean
it s actually c that does not support boolean so if and any other conditional statement actually expects an int value not boolean

2952099
fseek	fread
move around for your binary search with fseek and fread

2952110
google-chrome	firefox
i float it left and when it prints the second page it leaves off the name part of the list in firefox works fine in google-chrome and ie see here

2952111
rss	feed
it doesn t look twitter supports this in their current api however it wouldn t be difficult to create using a service which follows an rss feed

2952111
rss	feed
in this case you d just have to wait for the rss feed to update and call whatever function you require

2952122
versioning	upgrade
when i upgrade my solution from vs 2008 to vs 2010 the conversion process automatically updated references from microsoft.visualstudio.qualitytools.unittestframework versioning 9.0.0.0 to microsoft.visualstudio.qualitytools.unittestframework versioning 10.0.0.0 in my test projects

2952163
post	get
i ve gone over this code time and time again but always get a 404 when the form post to myentities add this is a post-only url on purpose

2952173
ubuntu	debian	jobs	cron
essentially the garbage collection is set up to be done by cron jobs on some systems ubuntu debian

2952183
jms	jta
the important ones are jpa persistence jta distributed transaction jms messaging jdbc data sources

2952251
partition-problem	np-complete
take any instance of the np-complete partition-problem

2952251
np-hard	np-complete
so this is a reduction so the problem is np-hard and the problem is np so it is np-complete

2952254
cos	sin
symbolic differentiation over common functions + - sin cos etc. ignoring regions where the function or its derivative is undefined is easy

2952256
width	height
set the height width of the canvas to the height width of your image

2952267
accessor	properties
leave generate accessor and generate obj-c 2.0 properties ticked and click finished

2952297
hide	show
it seems that the hide animation on the warning dialog was conflicting with the show animation of the re-login dialog

2952346
bids	ssis
this is ssis bids 2008

2952374
post	get
to use twitter4j to get all post from a user you ll have to make your request over multiple pages

2952395
post	put
when you make your title field in your blog post pre-generate the url-safe title and put it in a colunm in the blog table

2952458
stdout	stderr
sometimes stderr and stdout can also lock the system.

2952469
equals	tostring
the case of tostring is different you can do whatever you want with tostring so i will only cover equals and hashcode

2952469
persistent	transient
unfortunately this solution has a major problem when using generated identifiers the values are not assigned until an entity becomes persistent so if a transient entity is added to a set before being saved its hash code will change while it s in the set and this breaks the contract of the set

2952469
persistent	transient
the database identifier will change if a transient object is made persistent

2952469
instances	transient
if the transient instances usually together with detached instances is held in a set changing the hashcode breaks the contract of the set

2952492
google-chrome	firefox
it appears to work on google-chrome and firefox but on firefox i needed to upload it to a server

2952555
filtering	grouping
i d like a flexible good looking and easy to use grid that can do filtering grouping etc

2952576
put	get	post	put	post	get
if you need the base url outside of responding to queries not in a get post put delete block or a view it would be better to set it manually somewhere

2952588
mouseleave	mouseenter
so i ve added a mouseenter and mouseleave event one runs a setinterval function which sends a click every 1 5 seconds

2952662
srp	principles
i m reading bob martin s principles of ood specifically the srp text and i understand the spirit of what it s saying pretty well but i don t quite understand a particular phrasing from page 2 of the link page 150 of the book

2952670
folder	directory
wp created the new htaccess file and i moved the index.php to the root directory but left the wp folder where it was in the blog directory as instructed

2952686
unsigned	short
seems like you d need to allocate 5 characters for your unsigned short to cover all of the values

2952747
children	parent
create your model containing parent and children in this case it is an int and a list of int

2952748
mouse	keyboard
from the site monkeyfuzz primarily sends random keyboard and mouse events to a program but it can record the actions along the way

2952761
unix	bsd
the second alternative requires you to replace sys socket.h bsd sockets library unix standard for the tcp ip stack with winsock2.h and rewrite some parts of the code -not much but some

2952789
getter	setter
when you have a getter setter for every variable it means you don t have to rewrite your set method if you add something to your class

2952789
getter	setter
purpose of getter and setter to my mind is not about simple modification but rather about encapsulating a sequence of actions that results in value modification or returns the value which we treat as visible result

2952795
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome it works perfectly

2952795
google-chrome	firefox
with google-chrome and firefox it closes the popup and allows the handler to reload the page

2952795
google-chrome	firefox
this is very frustrating as the behaviour in google-chrome and firefox is perfect

2952821
firefox	safari
everything works perfectly in safari and firefox

2952837
for-loop	loops
you can t loops this with a for-loop but you can correctly

2952857
globalization	localization
i wonder what the practice in regards to globalization and localization on small-scale internal apps is in the wild.

2952880
versioning	upgrade
though i would call disponse on any classes that implements them doesn t matter if they don t do anything now an upgrade versioning of the class might start leaking something essential and it s a good habit to get into

2952913
cpu	processors
some common entities sharing the memory bus cpu dma controllers video processors sound processors and network or i o processors

2952965
inherited	properties
transparent means that the match inherited its highlighting properties from the containing block these rules do not change the way text is displayed

2952995
post	get
i have a rewrite rule for get and post

2952998
free	malloc
i agree with neil alienfluid and fredoverflow that in most cases you don t want to write your own memory allocator but i still wrote my own memory allocator about 15 years and refined it over the years first version was with malloc free redefinition later versions using global new delete operators and in my experience the advantages can be enormous

2953010
spaces	delimiter
this will parse the file into a collection of spaces delimiter strings lazily and then you can read them as doubles just like

2953026
intersect	contains
1 segment-plane intersection determine if the line segment connecting points 1 and 2 intersect the plane contains the polygon

2953028
extjs	mootools
when development of phonegap was under way we noticed slow load times for modern javascript frameworks such as prototype mootools yui extjs and yes even jquery

2953084
ropemacs	pymacs
this way pymacs and ropemacs will be loaded only once

2953152
width	margin
i tried setting the width of the datepicker element and a right margin so that the time selectors would position next to it

2953168
button	checkbox
i need checkbox exactly style not radio button

2953177
innodb	myisam
you can use the innodb database engine in mysql instead of the default myisam it has foreign key constraints

2953183
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
however this doesn t seem to work in any browser i ve tested in safari opera firefox and princexml all on my mac

2953226
rss	feed
i tried using rss feed but they don t give me as much control over what i retrieve as using the api directly.

2953238
spaces	delimiter
if memory serves me right you pass them in by putting them after the call to the batch file and using spaces delimiter c mycmd.bat var1 var2

2953256
pop-up	dialog
i m using a jqueryui dialog command to pop-up a and wish to print just the text of the using the declarative

2953289
post	get
i want to use firebug to view get and post parameters being passed

2953312
google-chrome	firefox
but when i use firefox or google-chrome they just open a new tab

2953351
portrait	landscape
there has been a lot of confusion and a set of corresponding set of questions here on so how iphone applications with proper handling for landscape portrait mode autorotation can be implemented

2953351
portrait	landscape
iphone landscape-only utility-template application layout errors controller does not seem to recognize the view should be rotated but displays a clipped portrait view in landscape mode causing half of the screen to stay blank

2953351
portrait	landscape
presentmodalviewcontroller in landscape after portrait viewcontroller modal views are not correctly rendered either

2953373
unsigned	short
the endianness is preserved correctly so that if you cast buffer into unsigned short you can read the same value of s_int the right way

2953454
ada	algol
several other languages were predicted to replace cobol - algol ada and c come to mind but

2953484
accessor	properties
in the last example validateduser looks similar to your original code but the key difference is that validateduser itself doesn t have any properties values - it delegates all properties accessor to the m_user object

2953512
min	max
min max stuff i would add to the same parameter

2953514
firefox	safari
will make a working link in firefox but doesn t work in safari

2953529
implements	extends
i m trying to extends a java swing component in clojure i want to extends a javax.swing.jcomponent and add some custom methods implements in pure clojure in addition to all the standard inherited methods

2953536
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
the website works perfectly fine in ie7 8 firefox safari opera

2953559
google-chrome	firefox
i should mention i m testing on the latest ie8 firefox 3.6 and google-chrome

2953574
width	height
however on ie8 and i assume other versions of ie also when i then iterate over the img elements i am unable to determine the width height of the images loaded

2953643
vmware	esx
virtual machine running on vmware esx

2953643
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
no performance problem using google-chrome firefox opera or safari from same machine

2953645
division	multiplication
since the compiler knows the value can t change it doesn t need to load the value from memory and can optimize the code to work for only the exact value of the constant for instance the compiler can use shifts for multiplication division if the const is a power of 2.

2953664
linqdatasource	objectdatasource
using a linqdatasource or objectdatasource the binding setting the editindex etc is handled through the data source

2953713
button	checkbox
fortunately i had experience getting mvc to work in 3.5 sp 1 so i tried that method opened the properties dialog of the virtual director went to the directory tab click the configuration button and added a wildcard application map to the aspnet_isapi.dll and unchecked the verify that file exists checkbox

2953745
ubuntu	debian
the approach i just got working was in ubuntu which is closely related to debian

2953766
for-loop	arrays
i run through a for-loop each time extracting certain elements of an arrays say element1 element2 etc

2953780
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
for funsies i decided to check out browser compatibility and this method is feasible in ie opera safari and google-chrome but not firefox which does not include comments in the returned string

2953832
jdom	xom	jdom	dom4j	dom4j	xom
as well as being thread-safe jaxen is model-agnostic - it works with many models w3c dom xom dom4j jdom and custom models can be plugged in by implementing a couple of interfaces

2953864
gridview	repeater
this is not part of a repeater or gridview

2953887
spaces	delimiter
the file is spaces delimiter

2953903
equals	compareto
i need to use treeset and i can t use contains because they use compareto and equals compareto pair are implemented in an incompatible way and i can t change that

2953933
treemap	treeset	sortedmap	sortedset
the contracts of map and set do not make any guarantees about iteration order but those of sortedset and sortedmap implemented by treemap and treeset do

2953957
treemap	treeset	equals	compareto
using treemap and treeset work properly when compareto and equals are implemented in such a way that they are compatible with each other

2953979
min	max
you can use max and min

2953987
vpn	lan
we wanted an admin section that was available to logged-in admins but also only available if accessed from the lan or vpn

2953987
vpn	lan
lan and vpn ip addresses all started with 10

2953999
mri	rubinius	ironruby	rubinius	jruby	mri	jruby	rubinius
looksee patches the interpreter which is the reason why it only works on mri and yarv and not on jruby xruby ironruby ruby.net rubinius tinyrb rubygolightly macruby hotruby blueruby cardinal maglev smallruby red sun and all the other implementations

2954056
togaf	enterprise
togaf and zachman are both enterprise architecture frameworks that you might find useful

2954080
udp	tcp
if this still does not improves the latency then you could fallback to using udp instead of tcp

2954108
width	height
seems like i have to walk the list of div tags in an outer loop n and have an inner loop another n to compare against all other div tags and do a containment test position width height building a list of contained div tags

2954151
postgresql	mysql
side notes i m using postgresql but a solution for mysql would be fine too so i can try to port it to postgresql

2954177
postgresql	mysql
see for more about emulating mysql s group_concat in postgresql

2954178
google-chrome	firefox
note this error only occurs in google-chrome and not firefox

2954192
pecl	pear
without using the pear library or the pecl extension because i don t want to fuss with pear or have to depend on being able to install a pecl extension on every instance of this application

2954278
pecl	pear
well in addition to the pear package and the pecl extension you also have a zend framework package called zend_markup which is very easy to use zf is loosely coupled so you can choose to only use that component

2954290
gridview	repeater	gridview	sqldatasource
well for what you are doing i wouldn t really recommend a sqldatasource as it is really meant to be bound to a control such as a gridview or repeater

2954346
puts	gets
the game works well currently it s a hotseat version however i m really frustrated by the fact that whenever i rotate the screen of the phone my gridview gets hysterical and puts some empty space in my chess table between the columns

2954346
portrait	landscape
the chess table looks fine if the phone is in portrait mode but in landscape mode it s far from nice

2954346
portrait	landscape
this is how i can decide whether we are in portrait or landscape mode

2954375
for-loop	arrays
i instantiate the objects into an arrays using a nested for-loop and expect a grid of the objects to be rendered

2954386
voltdb	acid
voltdb is an entrant which claims acid compliance and while it still uses sql its goals are the same in terms of scalability

2954389
client-side	server-side
you specify your validation rules in your java code using annotations and the library generates javascript for client-side validation and java for server-side

2954433
avr	microcontroller
im using avr and the microcontroller is atmega 1281

2954433
free	malloc
now if i use the free function to deallocate the memory at the end of the function using malloc the program just gets stuck when the control reaches free

2954434
post	get
but when i try to execute it with some small changes post instead of the the get method i get a

2954473
profiling	debugging
edit interestingly enough the build time has exploded only on debugging builds as per the following profiling information of the whole project which isn t just the file in question but still a good metric

2954474
free	malloc
whether you need to free a block at the end of the function calling malloc should be determined by whether the memory block is still used after the call

2954474
free	malloc
in any case using malloc and free on small memory blocks linked list operations in a real-time system no virtual memory is going to lead to eventual heap fragmentation

2954541
stdout	stderr
you can get around this by using redirection to redirect both stdout and stderr to a file

2954659
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox the input button has more padding than in google-chrome

2954675
put	get
if i put a breakpoint in the method i m trying to get into it works fine as in the debugger will break on the line but as soon as i step f10 it exits the method and with f11 step into also

2954701
google-chrome	firefox
it s too easy to get focused on things that users won t notice the user likely has either firefox or else ie or else google-chrome but not all of them

2954709
put	get	post	put	post	get
get put post delete

2954741
verilog	hdl
the best would be to have an hdl source verilog for example for an arm core and create vcd files or other waveform formats

2954753
folder	directory
you would then unzip the directory on the server and scan the user s folder for any directory containing .jpg or .png or .gif files etc. and then import them into a table accordingly

2954772
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
use nscalendar to get the nsdatecomponents you re interested in

2954793
getter	setter
why programmer set the variable as private then write getter and setter to access it

2954798
tiff	png
png seems to give the best speed file size performance for tiff images

2954811
getter	setter
providing getter and setter means that you have exact control over how variables get assigned or what gets returned etc

2954823
getter	setter
provide a getter if you want read access and provide a setter if you want write access

2954823
getter	setter
in that case you would provide both getter and setter but inside these property functions you would do more than just return - for example if you want to track the number of times an attribute is read by other programs during an object s life time

2954831
accessor	properties
c# calls it properties where in java it is accessor mutators

2954831
getter	setter
for me it makes sense to have getter and setter methods to encapsulate the classes so that no class can change the instance variables of another class

2954876
getter	setter
this can be be done if you only contract for the getter and setter methods

2954902
post	put
rfc 2616 specifies the semantic of the operations for post and put

2954902
post	put
however post should never put the new entity at the request url and put should always put any new entity at the request url

2954902
post	put
this relationship to the request url defines post as create and put as update

2954902
post	put
in particular where your approach breaks is that the url you use with the put is a representation of the transactional context that was created by the post not a representation of the new resource itself

2954903
client-side	server-side
sessions are made up of two components a client-side session id and server-side session data

2954919
client-side	server-side
sessions are a combination of a server-side session data and a client-side cookie with the client-side cookie containing nothing other than a reference to the correct data on the server

2954936
range	max	range	min	min	max
inside a subroutine to determine round graph start end values you could scale the actual min max values to always be between 1 and 10 then have a table to pick nice round values then unscale back to the correct range

2954949
getter	setter
for example one programmer writes public getter and setter around a private member variable

2954949
getter	setter
another programmer realizes that putting in public getter and setter around a private member variable is violating the spirit of encapsulation he sees the futility of the methods and decides to just make the member variable public

2954964
getter	setter
then it s trivial to refactor them into getter setter when necessary

2954964
getter	setter
it s impossible for you to change them into getter setter later

2954966
put	get
so isconnected will likely report true until a get put or inquire call is attempted and fails at which point qmgr will then report disconnected

2955007
public	protected
the solution is simple whenever you find a table difficult to use with these you just have to inherit from dataaccesslayer and redefine what you want to redefine so in dataaccesslayer you should only use protected and public modifiers and forget the private modifier

2955079
portrait	landscape
hello all i have my splash screen which i want to show in landscape mode and all other screen in portrait mode

2955084
switching	screens	portrait	landscape
but a warning it s probably worthwhile to tweak your splash screens so it is in the portrait orientation since it may be annoying to suggest to the user that your app likes landscape and then switching to portrait as soon as it actually starts

2955185
width	height
i have a table or a region and want to set it s width and height value to another div or region

2955218
textview	imageview
i have a listview in a custom arrayadapter that displays an icon imageview and a textview in each row

2955222
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
kaazing gateway supports all major browsers firefox version 1.5 and higher internet explorer version 5.5 and higher safari version 3.0 and higher opera version 9.5 and higher and google-chrome version 0.2 and higher

2955224
google-chrome	firefox
as for tools to measure request time you can either use google-chrome webkit s developer tools or firefox s firebug extension or measure request time in your app and send that metrics data back to your server in a deferred request for collection and analysis

2955227
draggable	droppable
i am new to using jquery and i just want to know how i can check whether a draggable object has been removed from the droppable object

2955230
spaces	delimiter
here the spaces delimiter presents a small problem

2955230
spaces	delimiter
the len function ignores spaces in its determination so i used the datalength function and also ensure that delimiter was declared as a varchar instead of a nvarchar

2955252
disk	ram
most are disk backed providing the very same consistency as a normal rdbms - only catch the entire dataset must fit into ram

2955270
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
advantages of reusing argumentnullexception or argumentoutofrangeexception rather than argumentexception or a custom exception type

2955270
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
argumentnullexception and argumentoutofrangeexception has a constructor that takes string paramname - so no need to generate a message like you would have to with argumentexception

2955314
google-chrome	firefox
for me in google-chrome onclick working with second click on select box where as in firefox ie its working fine for first click itself

2955369
put	get
why not get the message and put it into a view model along with your other data models

2955379
free	malloc
someone recently asked me the difference between a c++ standard operator new delete sizeof and function tan free malloc

2955384
children	parent
as you can see in this class source parent and also the children all have a different generic data type

2955398
punctuation	words
i want to put space between punctuation and other words in a sentence

2955429
listview	gridview
gridview like listview is for efficiently presenting scrolling unbounded data sets

2955436
profiling	instrumentation
for adding instrumentation roots to a profiling i need to write the method signature

2955468
int	chars
hello.cpp .text+0x43 undefined reference to ace_log_msg conditional_set chars const int int int

2955519
.htaccess	httpd.conf
i have one more doubt about .htaccess is there a way i can enable mod_rewrite through any code code without directly editing httpd.conf file

2955525
hide	show
if it is important the method signatures should show it and not hide it wrapped in 2 other exceptions

2955574
.htaccess	httpd.conf
i have one more doubt about .htaccess is there a way i can enable mod_rewrite through any code code without directly editing httpd.conf file

2955574
.htaccess	httpd.conf
you place this line before any rewrite rules in your .htaccess which will switch on the rewrite engine - no httpd.conf change required

2955592
width	height
default t inherit nil stipple nil background #f7f9fa foreground #191919 inverse-video nil box nil strike-through nil overline nil underline nil slant normal weight normal height 98 width normal foundry unknown family dejavu sans mono

2955615
implements	modifiers
my next goal is to implements custom statements modifiers functions etc like for-loop but i don t really know if i should use another module that i don t know about

2955627
vpn	lan
for me it works nicely on my lan and with a few machines connected over vpn

2955669
int	double
and even there it sometimes creates confusion such as having to cast one operand to double if you want a divsion of int values to yield fractional results

2955676
jms	jta
two examples of such technologies are jta the transaction manager and jca adapter for jms or database

2955688
post	get
you should be using post to pass variables instead of get

2955713
quicksort	mergesort
1- use a sorting algotithm like mergesort or quicksort has better performance with small inputs

2955762
submit	submission
3 ii have successfully created code to submit first two forms and after submission second form i am getting third form in my response in script

2955791
post	get
as to how to get in - read a few adverts for post in this area and look at the skills that they require

2955794
mako	genshi
also take a look at mako and genshi

2955884
google-chrome	firefox
so google-chrome firefox ie8 and even ie6 all work flawlessly but ie7 has some nasties

2955885
hide	show
if i try to hide the lblcountry and cmbcountry a white space is show between zip and practice fields

2955914
switching	screens
each time i switching between screens i save the input data from previous screens and dispose it

2955926
notepad++	textpad	notepad	textpad
i have played with textpad notepad++ kodomo edit and programmer s notepad 2 and found all of them lacking

2955968
inotifypropertychanged	icommand
it doesn t belong there - you might want to reuse the domain model to expose web services or a web site and inotifypropertychanged icommand properties and whatnot does not belong there

2955969
unsigned	short
in the format string means interpret everything as little endian and don t use native alignment h means unsigned short and i means unsigned int

2956008
directx	gdi
however microsoft considers windows forms as old technology and promotes wpf which is based on directx and not gdi

2956029
updatepanel	scriptmanager
i found the solution to this in the end - i should ve been using scriptmanager instead of page.clientscript.registerstartupscript - this works inside updatepanel s

2956040
debugdiag	w3wp	debugdiag	debugging
i ve tried to use debugdiag and iisstate to debugging the w3wp process but debugdiag is only available for post-dump analysis in x64 i m running on windows 7 x64 so the w3wp process is thus 64 bit and iisstat says the following when i try to run it

2956058
post	get
the same example works with get but not with post

2956195
put	get
i want to put reactive extensions for .net rx to good use and would like to get some input on doing some basic tasks

2956222
multiplying	add
so multiplying the old avg by n n+1 and add the new element divided by n+1

2956238
min	max
i m actually working on adding other aggregate functions min max etc. into it but since you only need the count function i think it s a pretty good option

2956266
mediator	service-locator
to use a mediator you typically require some service-locator as well

2956269
width	height
i try to setup ultramon with a really big width and height for my safari on windows

2956269
width	height
the problem is that the width and height seems to have a max value that i would like to change

2956269
width	height
i want ultramon not to change my width and height even if they are bigger than the screen resolution

2956290
post	get
if you are doing an ajax post to get this data i suggest using the server-side language to do it

2956292
width	height
when list rectangle added in mouse down event it s only get the values for height and width of the rectangle if use 0 0 e.x e.y and also rectangle always starts from top left corner not able to start the rectangle point where user likes and it s gets only x and y values if use e.x e.y 0 0

2956379
mouseover	mouseout
issue solved changed mouseover and mouseout events to be return true

2956386
hide	show
basically i m trying to grap the text from the title attribute in a link and show it in a paragaph in another div when a user hovers of the item and then hide it when the user moves away

2956390
post	get
ajax requests get round this by using javascript to send the post data through to the server and that doesn t need a page refresh

2956417
opera	safari
i m using selenium rc to do functional website testing and i ve recently experienced a mysterious issue with safari and opera

2956419
g++	gcc
the problem is the following error-message of the g++ gcc version 4.4.3 ubuntu 4.4.3-4ubuntu5

2956431
setinterval	settimeout
have a look at the settimeout or setinterval methods they allow you to execute a function after a specified number of milliseconds 1000ms 1second

2956432
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
edit - this also fails to work in safari and google-chrome - in other words it only seems to work in firefox

2956443
put	get
as you already showed in your second example you have to use a streamreader to get the content of the file and put it into the standardinput

2956452
innodb	myisam
also perhaps using myisam tables in contrast to innodb with referential integrity options usually gives better performance as there is no referential integrity overhead involved

2956492
appfuse	spring
info building appfuse spring mvc application

2956492
appfuse	spring
info configuring jetty for project appfuse spring mvc application

2956515
folder	directory
note that i moved the z.jar file to a folder i created in the current directory called application x y for this purpose

2956558
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
i tested myself in google-chrome ie safari mozilla and opera

2956578
client-side	server-side
it s worth saying because nobody else did yet that front-end refers to client-side executing code javascript css markup some other scripting technologies and things like flash back-end usually refers to server-side executing code c# php sql everything else...

2956589
equals	gethashcode
also you should take care about implementing gethashcode and equals there is a good explanation in the book essential c#

2956644
comparator	comparable
most places where you can specify a comparator also have a version without using a comparator at all in which case it uses the natural order it expects all objects to implement comparable and uses comparator

2956803
implements	extends
that you extends and implements to achieve a goal

2956879
hide	show
in this there is a very basic hide show of paragraphs

2956891
prepare	execute
this has solved using the script component which will prepare the sql script then execute so in a single hit i could get the full result set as it is not possible with lookup to retrieve result set

2956897
gif	png
also it would only support jpeg png gif wbmp and gd2

2956951
put	get
to get such a beast to work i would put every group into it s own usercontrol

2956993
libzip	libpng
after that you should eliminate library dependencies between the libraries themselves this means you should link the output of some projects to another projects if your libpng library uses libzip it means you should first compile the libzip and link that output static library to your libpng project

2957046
super	self
the super class might choose to replace the self returned by +alloc with a different object

2957049
hash	md5
it converts the md5 hash to a string hexadecimal numbers of the least significan byte of the character

2957071
implements	extends
for instance in java if your module requires a method toxml to be implements in a bunch of classes originally defined in another module it s complicated because you can not write toxml somewhere else than the original class file which mean you can not extends the system without changing existing sources in smalltalk or other languages you can group method in extension which are not tied to a particular file

2957072
super	self
in most cases setting self to super init does nothing since super init will wind up returning self anyway

2957076
width	height
seems like i have to walk the list of div tags in an outer loop n and have an inner loop another n to compare against all other div tags and do a containment test position width height building a list of contained div tags

2957078
domxpath	domdocument
i recommend using domdocument and domxpath

2957151
notepad++	textpad
as you ve said you are unconvinced by e you could try notepad++ or textpad

2957172
move	drag
so if user want to move from page 1 to page 100 he can just drag the thumb and reach there

2957176

the issue is that everything is on one page and i am using asp panel to show and hide different areas of the webpage

2957503
teamcity	nant
you might also want to look at nant or msbuild to script your build and unit-tests you ll have to do this with cc.net and teamcity anyway and then periodically run it from a powershell script

2957507
memcached	ncache
i d also take a look at out of process caching solutions such as ncache and memcached to increase your speed and scalability further

firefox	safari
it is a bit vague what you are after but display none hides the rows and does not save space on all ie firefox and as far as i know but i dont develop specifically for safari safari

2957694
width	height
of course every item would need a left and top property then and maybe also a width and height property

2957734
expander	togglebutton
since the togglebutton has a name expander in the default template you can find it and apply the verticalalignment you want

2957737

2957866
post	get
that s why i suggest you use the post redirect get pattern that s very well supported in asp.net mvc

2957866
post	get
your controller actions should redirect to some get action after post has successfully completed as it is in your case

2957866
post	get
and if you display all previously entered data you can provide those in in the get action or transfer them from post to get action using tempdata dictionary

2958004
pipe	file-descriptor
the idea is to get file-descriptor 3 of a pipe | cat 0

2958006
swt	swing
a common databinding framework for swt is jface databinding i m sure something similiar exists for swing

2958036
int	double
instead of double mean it has to be int mean as the prototype defines

2958074
int	chars
if the type of the switch expression is sbyte byte short ushort int uint long ulong bool chars string or an enum-type or if it is the nullable type corresponding to one of these types then that is the governing type of the switch statement

2958074
int	chars
otherwise exactly one user-defined implicit conversion â 6.4 must exist from the type of the switch expression to one of the following possible governing types sbyte byte short ushort int uint long ulong chars string or a nullable type corresponding to one of those types

fadein	fadeout
in jquery use the load method to retrieve the results using ajax and then use some combination of the jquery fadein fadeout and fadeto methods

2958228
int	double
here you define mean as returning double but the prototype says int mean ...

2958228
int	double
when you link there is no more information about the size of arguments and returning value and bad things happen like reading an int as a double

2958228
int	double
well in the struct there s a double and int can t be nan

2958308

so my adding the class and onfocus and onblur attributes was the problem

2958355
kerberos	ntlm

2958396
strcpy	strncpy
using strncpy instead of strcpy is normally safer but here you alloc eachtime the right amount of memory needed to store inpoint into mpoint so i cant see what s the point

2958397
getter	setter
but if you make a getter and a setter then you may as well make the variable itself public

2958397
getter	setter
if you find yourself later in a position that you made the wrong choice then you must refactor your code from using the public variable into using the getter setter which may not be a problem

2958397
getter	setter
if you use getter and setter from the start you will reduce that risk in exchange for a little effort

2958451

2958703
hide	show
slider works only when you drag handle when you drag the slider the divs show and hide as expected divs change as slider slides.. but if i click on any point on slider instead of dragging divs change only if i click on a precise spot where a div is supposed to switch otherwise div does not switch

post	get
when using foreach to iterate over an object i get the following error fatal error objects used as arrays in post pre increment decrement must return values by reference...

2958826
setinterval	clearinterval
you should use setinterval clearinterval which is made for this kind of tasks

2958849
hide	show
you also need a good shot of css to get it all nicely aligned and some smart piece of javascript to show hide the detail row

2958888

client-side	server-side
my python team has been using dojo on the client-side for a few years now and we settled on cherrypy as our server-side about a year ago and are pretty pleased with it

2959051
django	turbogears
initially we looked at django and turbogears as well but we needed to do some things vis-a-vis user authentication db tuning and templating that didn t really fit well in the full stack frameworks so we ve rolled our own stack instead

2959051
client-side	server-side
as for why dojo and python go well together i can only speak for myself but they seem to have a similar feel to me so i can move from writing code on the server-side and client-side without having to make too much of a cognitive shift

2959055
int	double
btw the safe way to read half of a double as an int is

2959107
internationalization	localization
as you mentioned internationalization i highly recommend this wpf localization guidance document which compares several localization approaches in a very detailed way including the way proposed by microsoft using locbaml.exe which in my eyes is completely unusable

you then change its contentsize to the height width that you want it to scroll

2959126
ubuntu	linux

2959176
ssl	https
i am assuming perhaps incorrectly that if _server https is not set ssl is not enabled on the server

2959178
udp	rtp
however there is no way to heuristically determine if a udp packet is a rtp packet so we have to do more work before we can capture the data

2959180
put	get
you put your data and logic on the datamodule then have both forms use the datamodule to get access to its data and methods

2959182
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox

afp	smb
when i mount a volume using either afp or smb even though i can write files

2959343
put	get
i realise you can create pgscript but it doesn t appear to be very good for example if i do the equivalent of above it doesn t put the single quotes around the value in x nor does it let me by doubling them up and you don t get a table out after - only text.

2959363
background-image	background-position
for rollovers you can make two images one for normal state one for hovered and swap between them using the css hover style to choose a different background image orâ better as it requires no preloading and reduces http requestsâ combine both images into one and use background-image background-position to display the right part of that image in each state as a background image

2959371
uitableview	nsindexpath
all you gotta do is switch on the row or section of your nsindexpath and return the appropriate uitableview cell...lets say u have tableviewcella and tableviewcellb one for row 0 and other for row 1

i know there is a way to show the toolbar when a textarea is focused into and then hide on textarea blur event - so that could be one route

2959417
irc	xmpp
it is possible to have multiple bluetooth sockets in use simultaneously so you may also consider configuring to act as a server like an irc or xmpp server which brokers all communication from any client to another

2959480
put	get
extends collection will only let you get values from the map since then it s sure that what you get is a collection or child of collection but if you try to put something in the map you won t be able to since mymap may be but since you only see it as you might try to put a list in it which wouldn t be ok

maven	pom.xml
we use maven here but i find that once you get outside of a simple project the pom.xml starts to get more and more complex

2959528
ant	maven
easy to do in ant can t do it in maven unless you use the antrun plugin which allows you to write ant code to handle issues that maven cannot handle without a full blown plugin

2959528
ant	maven
what i found is that ivy and ant can do most of the dependency checking that maven does without all the issues of writing and maintaining the poms

2959528
ant	maven
if you re not already using maven try ant with ivy first

2959531
afp	smb
when you are accessing files via smb or afp you are effectively using those as the file system and they are file systems that are not very rich in capabilities

2959531
afp	smb
unfortunately you cannot assume that all the capabilities of the actual file system on which the files are stored will be available via smb or afp

2959569
ant	maven	ant	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml
ant with ivy does the same dependency management maven does in fact it uses maven s whole dependency management infrastructure including the same url repositories but without all the pom.xml configuration mess

2959569
ant	maven
ant with ivy might be a way of handling the dependency issues for people who really don t want to use maven

2959600
equals	gethashcode
if you want custom rules such as equality based on id fields you need to override the equals and gethashcode methods

2959606
int	chars
unbeli s answer is probably the best for what it sounds like you want which is an array of chars that happen to represent int

2959606
int	chars
however if your end goal is to reassemble all of the int chars you ve pulled out into a number i d suggest regular expressions

2959621
equals	gethashcode
in order to get around this you will have to override the equals and gethashcode methods which means you should probably implement and override the and

2959658

2959839
crypt	md5
encrytpion functions are more like md5 sha1 and crypt

2959839
salt	md5
md5 is considered broken so you should use sha1 for encryption or at the very least salt your md5 when hashing

2959847
rtp	rtsp
vlc uses the live555 library for the rtp rtsp side of things so perhaps that will be useful to you it s licensed under lgpl

2959975
hash	md5
when you calculate the md5 hash of a file you just need to take the result and place it in as the text of label control

2960023

2960127
google-chrome	firefox

int	double
indicates that the compiler doesn t know that strtof returns a float so it s going to push an int to the printf call instead of a double

2960141
getter	setter
but generally speaking you want to call ensurechildcontrols as the first line of the setter and likely the getter too

2960185
int	double
there are classes in com.google.common.primitives such as int double floats etc

2960205
instances	transient
then it is not sufficient to add implements serializable to make it serializable you must declare all instances fields transient to prevent a serialization attack and provide a readresolve method

jtextfield	jlabel
i want to add a background image to my jframe but when i do it using the code below i m unable to add other elements like jlabel or jtextfield

2960356
post	get
if you want to get the response in a callback you can t post the form

i would honestly suggest doing both client-side and server-side validation

2960364
hide	show
this is just like a control that appears in medial players hide when mouse out and show when mouse over

2960375
accessor	properties
a properties declared retain or copy rather than assign gets a synthesized accessor method the setimage method that the syntax translates to that releases its old value when setting a new one

2960398
accessor	properties
if you do not specify nonatomic then in a reference counted environment a synthesized get accessor for an object properties uses a lock and retains and autoreleases the returned valueâ the implementation will be similar to the following

2960398
accessor	properties
if you specify nonatomic then a synthesized accessor for an object properties simply returns the value directly

2960732
width	height
and in your html markup make sure you define the height and width in the rel attribute of the a tag

2960750
jar	manifest.mf
for example the jar entry name for the manifest file is meta-inf manifest.mf and not meta-inf manifest.mf

2960752
implements	extends
if not i think you would have to extends the dialog class and implements your own

2960755
getter	setter
you could extend the button class maybe call it a percentbutton whatever and give it a bindable property call it _pctwidth say give it a public getter and a public setter and in your setter you do this

2960928
post	get
while get requests are limited in their length post requests are not

2960928

some scripts don t care whether their data comes from a get or a post so you might consider having javascript post a form to the iframe on page load

you really want to translate the painter so that the it starts painting at the topleft of the rectangle and then extends for the specified width and height

2961019
antivirus	mcafee
it would have security ramifications such as presenting a fake mcafee antivirus dialog to folks who had mcafee antivirus installed

2961025
width	height
as soon as resize fires then the width and height are accurate

2961064
chgrp	chmod
so i did a chgrp -r webdevs var www and a chmod -r g+rwx var www command to give all members of the webdevs group read write access

i publish the web app to it s https location on the same server the wcf service resides under the same ssl certificate

2961228
google-chrome	firefox
this stuff works perfectly in google-chrome and firefox

2961273
int	boolean
it is though in nearly all cases the old dinosaur computers that had special addresses can be neglected because a null pointer can also be used as a boolean and by using an int of suffisent size to hold the pointer value it is easier to represent in the common isas of modern cpu

2961305
invokerequired	begininvoke
you can accomplish this using the invokerequired property and begininvoke method found on the form or control object

2961350
comparator	comparable
i ve got a class accumulator that implements the comparable comparator method and i m trying to put these objects into a hashset

2961413
post	get
althrough you pick up all parameters at once post and get through request

i need and put it in a variable but for some reason i get a zero as a result

2961490
postgresql	mysql
mysql is popular so is sqlite and postgresql

2961525
postgresql	mysql
you can just change mysql to postgresql or sqlite in your settings.py

wikitext	mediawiki
one option would be mylyn wikitext which is used by some eclipse projects to generate eclipse documentation from the eclipse wiki which is based on mediawiki

2961555
hash	md5
1 i am planning to hash passwords using md5 before i write them to the database or to authenticate the user but i realize that to do that i would have to transmit the password in plaintext to the server and hash it there

2961555
post	get
2 i have heard that anything that when the action is readonly you should use get but if it modifies the database you should use post

2961567
cout	cin
however within terms of just cin cout then you can t

2961584
hash	md5
1 i am planning to hash passwords using md5 before i write them to the database or to authenticate the user but i realize that to do that i would have to transmit the password in plaintext to the server and hash it there

2961584
post	get
2 i have heard that anything that when the action is readonly you should use get but if it modifies the database you should use post

2961584
post	get
using post and get for the right things is not a matter of security

2961647
post	get
the reason for the difference between get and post is the way the browsers interpret the requests

2961647
post	get
if you had a page that logged out the user in a get request someone could embed an image tag into a comment or forum post like and the browser would be forced to execute the logout operation

2961707
pop-up	dialog
the only difference is that annoying dialog pop-up everytime i start to debug my application

2961711
for-loop	loops
you could use a for-loop to loops through printing fields 2 through nf built-in variable that represents the number of fields on the line

2961761
ubuntu	linux
i have a programming running on linux ubuntu which tries to connect to a server port using tcp

2961774
chi-squared	kolmogorov-smirnov
donald knuth describes a couple popular goodness of fit tests in seminumerical algorithms the chi-squared test and the kolmogorov-smirnov test

2961788
post	get
got it the simplest implementation can be http get post using name-value nv pairs

2961873
cos	sin
the equation of the ellipse is then given by a cos t b sin t

2961873
cos	sin
|| a cos t b sin t - c || 2

2961877
folder	directory
the system.io.fileinfo class should still work on a unc path myserver some folder provided the user running the application has appropriate permissions to access that directory

2961905
width	height
so div is a box block with height and width span is inline

2961909
jar	war
i found mention to how to add the subversion revision to manifests in jar files but not with war files

2961923
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
but they are part of the css 3.0 specification and only supported by a limited number of browsers namely firefox 1.5 opera and safari

2962037
idictionary	icollection
now there are obvious cons to this approach as well the most glaring is the fact that the keys and value and anything else that returns icollection on idictionary has to return a new array for every call

2962038
vbscript	jscript
vbscript jscript

2962051
dns	spf
-i ve added spf domain keys and a ptr record to the dns

2962098
multiplying	division
now calculate by division -- you ll never have to multiplying by 0.001 or 1000 since you re always converting in the same direction

2962164
width	height
one minor point the height and width properties of elements should be numbers rather than strings

2962222
ssl	https
one more thing is tht recently we implemented ssl and from http we move to https with name change in url also bfeore it was and now its

2962227
serializable	deserialization
it has only one method for serializable and assumes a specific constructor for deserialization as constructor cannot part of an interface

2962279
mouseover	mouseout
if apple had treated fingerdown as the counterpart to mouseover then the tooltip could be displayed upon fingerdown and made invisible again on fingerup which would be the counterpart to mouseout

2962280
hide	show
i am using some inline c# in the aspx to show hide certain controls depending on a user s role

2962280
hide	show
i would use the visible property but there are so many of them i just decided to do inline c# to show and hide i know not best practice but bear with me for a second

2962302
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
and its same across firefox ie opera safari and chrome...

2962312
getter	setter
getter and setter and it does not care about properties

2962329
google-chrome	firefox
works in at least firefox and google-chrome

2962416
put	get
i put if in italics because you should pretty much always use .val to get or set a value on an ...same goes for and

2962441
comparator	comparable
you must implement equals hashcode and after implementing the comparable interface comparator

2962448
comparator	comparable
in either case the item to be sorted should implement the comparable interface with a proper comparator method

2962492
tiff	png
lzw-compressed tiff offers no major advantages over png other than 16-bit-per-pixel support which you probably don t need

2962518
maven	pom.xml
the build number maven plugin sets the build number in the property that you can then use in your pom.xml

2962518
jar	war
i found mention to how to add the subversion revision to manifests in jar files but not with war files

2962529
min	max
my min and max latitude and longitudes are coming back as incredibly low numbers that can t possibly be right

2962529
min	max
you can see the sql query commented out to know how i plan on using the min and max lat and long values

2962605
uiview	subviews
clearly this isn t the right way to be doing this not only because it s contrary to what the docs say but because it -always- displays both subviews completely ignoring some other code in my uiview that sets the hidden property of one of the views it ignores the z-ordering etc.

2962629
post	get
i want to post russian text on a cp1251 site using lwp useragent and get following results

2962629
post	get
this code actually solves the problem but i do not want to add the third request wrapper function alongside with get and post

2962630
min	max
i m trying to create a custom route like search result city p1 state p2 zip p3 min p4 max p5 bed p6 bath p7 cats p8 dogs p9 parking p10 where search is the controller and result the action p1-p10 are variables

2962654
width	height
s webmaster guides guidelines repeats several times that it is better to always put the width and height attribute of the img tag

2962654
width	height
one of the most obvious reason is that the elements in the page won t seem to be jumping around to a new location after every picture is loaded always setting the correct width height sure gets rid of this behavior

2962654
width	height
if we don t want to manually edit all these width height attributes

2962657
width	height
when the webapp starts up we re recursively crawling the entire exploded .war looking for every single picture file and determining their width height

2962657
width	height
later on every single time we re generating an img tag we re calling a method that gives up back that picture s width height

2962657
width	height
the only drawback is that the map lookup and width height attributes generation are performed at runtime

2962664
hex	binary
so a hex address like 1 22 333 aaaa b c d e needs to be converted to its 128 bit equivalent binary

2962683
folder	directory
i am running a script that walks a directory structure and generates new files in each folder in the directory

2962699
spaces	delimiter
my data is in tabular format spaces delimiter and looks more or less like

2962702
unsigned	short
as for new code well there s so much example code out there using tchar that it may be easier to cut and paste and there is in some cases some friction between wchar as wchar_t and wchar as unsigned short

2962707
children	parent
it shows only the parent nodes task.name i couldn t figure out how to add children taskitems.name

2962709
width	height
.jsp and .html files have all their image width height set at build time

2962735
super	self
super and self pointing to the same memory and the major difference between them is method lookup order

2962738
children	parent
if you have multiple children within the parent and wish to leave no free space in the parent you should use

2962754
awt	swing
see painting in awt and swing for more about the clip rectangle

2962790
nswindow	nsimage
i notice that nswindow has this method and i m not a big fan of the nscolorwheel or nsimage background options but if they are the best willing to use

2962795
csla	.net
you could check some kind of unique identifier as previously mentioned or in the framework my company uses csla .net there is a boolean isnew field on our objects that when we create a new object the field is marked true

2962798
put	get
entities loaded by em.find are put and kept in the persistence context in memory to track changes so if you bulk load too much of them without precautions you ll just explode your memory and get oome

2962844
r5rs	r6rs
but the #lang r5rs and #lang r6rs don t do the same -- so these toplevel expressions are evaluated but never displayed

2962864
int	chars
the position here is an int so instead of comparing with chars 0 1 ... it should be compared with int

2962865
accessor	properties
edit for some reason the set accessor is hit only on the assetid properties and only the first time

2962874

swing	windowbuilder
editor eclipse via windowbuilder netbeans 5.0 non-free via swing gui builder aka matisse

2962877
folder	directory
if you haven t tried downloading the full scala package from scala-lang.org you should do so and then point tools scala platform platform folder at that directory

2962877
folder	directory
for instance on my laptop i have usr local lib scala-2.8 pointing at some place that i ve unzipped scala-2.8.0.rc2.zip and have set the platform folder directory to that link i m using 2.8 there obviously

2962904
filtering	grouping
seems if you don t execute getmembers recursively pass in false you get users and grouping and just need to filtering by structuralobjectclass

2962912
width	height
for example if you only wish to retrieve width height and length for a row you could use

2962930
post	get
this works great when editing a post but when creating a new post i get the following error

2962939
rss	feed
assuming my conditions for building a rss feed reader were i had to provide only a javascript snippet

2962978
uiview	calayer
a calayer represents a completely different thing from a uiview

2962997
aiff	riff
however before you do that be sure to check out the general purpose formats like aiff tiff iff and riff -- one might suit your need and there s no need to reinvent the wheel

2963001
uiview	subviews
adding a uinavigationcontroller as a subviews of uiview

2963053
uiview	subviews
your subviews should have their frame initialized to the bounds of the parent uiview

2963063
client-side	server-side
advantage 3 stored procedures abstract or separate server-side functions from the client-side

2963102
for-loop	arrays
it returns a byte arrays of all the pixels which can be iterated much faster than a for-loop with a call to getpixel inside nested inside another for-loop

2963102
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
unfortunately bytearrays are as their name implies 1 dimensional arrays of bytes so iterating each pixel 4 bytes requires using a for-loop not a foreach loops

2963108
converter	multibinding
if countries exists in address or some other viewmodel object you change your converter to implement imultivalueconverter instead of ivalueconverter and then use a multibinding to pass both countrycode and countries exposed as a property

2963126
post	get
if you could post some code it would be easier to get a more definitive answer

2963127
jobs	cron
cron jobs are only triggered only based on time while gearman functions are triggered by calls by other applications

2963211
implements	extends
assuming newframe extends jframe or frame you cannot do it via inheritance as java only supports single implementation inheritance extends and multiple interface inheritance implements

2963249
getter	setter	mutators	getter	mutators	setter
it only has accessor and mutators methods fancy names for getter and setter methods

2963250
pull	push
i made changes on one machine committed them and attempted to push them to the remote repository but i forgot to first do a pull to get the latest code first

2963250
pull	push
the push gave me a few lines of output suggesting i may have forgotten to pull first true

2963260
emacs	textmate
edit i m aware i can update the interval at which chrome reloads extensions which is a half-way solution but i d rather either making my editor emacs or textmate trigger on-save a reload or asking chrome to monitor the directory for changes

2963271
post	get
if you can switch from post to get you could then check query_string

2963299
portrait	landscape
in the landscape mode it is displayed thin it s height is smaller than in the portrait mode

2963355
config	ini
if you are worried about parsing time you could put those config in the php ini load path - this pre-parses all of the vars you need but you ll need to restart apache to load any changes

2963360
getter	setter
it allows you to either use getter and setter annotations which will provide getblah and setblah methods

2963360
getter	setter	equals	tostring	tostring	getter
or you can just use data and it will automatically implement your hashcode equals tostring and getter methods along with setter on non-final fields

2963417
superclass	subclassing
i have a situation where my subclassing is not seeing the superclass instance variable x

2963438
boost	stl
alternate answer re-implementing part of boost or stl yourself is a good way to keep your programming abilities sharp

2963455
inherited	subclassing
i m not sure if you are assuming that the models are going to inherited the subclassing or you are adding in the subclassing for each model

2963455
post	get
just know that the models don t get nested in your code because of their placement on the file system rather the modules that a class is in can t tell from your initial post though

2963456
punctuation	words
entries with words that are longer than x characters in this case 25 with no punctuation or spaces will cause the html on a printed a4 page to not wrap properly and therefore not to confrom to certain sizes correctly pushing the margins off

2963505
swt	swing
i d recommend you build a browser in java with swing or swt

2963505
google-chrome	firefox
i recently downloaded the code for firefox or google-chrome and this seems like a much more difficult place to start

2963606
ienumerable	iqueryable
the problem you re facing is deferred execution you should be able to find a lot of information on this but basically none of the code s being executed until you actually try to read data from the iqueryable convert it to an ienumerable or a list or other similar operations

2963626
int	boolean
you can provide more constructor overloads but obviously the number would explode as the number of parameters grow and you may even have multiple boolean and int arguments which would really make a mess out of things

2963626
superclass	subclassing
the superclass constructor runs before the subclassing constructor so the overriding method in the subclassing will be invoked before the subclassing constructor has run

2963736
free	malloc
the default memory allocator in libc is not good for multi-threaded applications when a concurrent malloc or free operation occurs frequently especially for multi-threaded c++ applications

2963736
free	malloc
when the default libc allocator is used the heap is protected by a single heap-lock causing the default allocator not to be scalable for multi-threaded applications due to heavy lock contentions during malloc or free operations

2963760
public	protected
another scenario where you would want to add an empty parameter-less constructor is if you want to change its access modifier from public to something else private protected or internal

2963812
kerberos	ntlm
this is because the backend system only supports kerberos iwa but the delegation for some reason - even though the incoming request is kerberos authenticated - converts the authentication to ntlm before forwaring to the backend system

2963817
getter	setter
synthesized properties not only synthesize the getter and setter they also synthesize the ivar if one is not declared

2963817
ivar	subclassing	accessor	ivar
you need to write explicit accessor in the subclassing and access the protected ivar via the self- myivar syntax

2963853
post	put
if you put the link in more than once you risk inconsistencies but then again you d have to post the specs for me to see what you want...

2963859
super	self
what is the point of self super

2963859
super	self
super and self pointing to the same

2963873
getter	setter
you can also use the explicit getter setter attributes to access even the private ivars of the base class

2963873
getter	setter
property assign getter intvar setter intvar int avar

2963885
getter	setter
java properties without getter and setter

2963891
getter	setter
then write functions to manipulate the car setter getter ... and put them in the same .c file as where the struct is defined

2963894
superclass	subclassing
the reason though is because allowing a subclassing to synthesize access to a superclass s internal state would quite explicitly break encapsulation

2963894
getter	setter
if a subclass needs to customize access do so with care by overriding the getter setter and preferably calling the super to actually get set the value

2963911
stdout	fflush
in most cases this means that stdout will be fully buffered instead of line buffered its only line buffered if stdout is a terminal so stuff that is output generally won t actually be output until you do an explicit fflush

2963932
memcpy	memset
sometimes functions like memcpy memset .

2963988
uipickerviewdelegate	uipickerviewdatasource
you can check state of segmented control in your uipickerview delegates uipickerviewdelegate and uipickerviewdatasource and return necessary values depending on this state

2964077
ant	maven
ant and maven are widely used

2964096
portrait	landscape
the navigation bar shrinks when we move from portrait to landscape mode and its because of this that my subview is 11px below

2964105
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the button shows up well in all versions of firefox google-chrome opera etc

2964105
width	height
only the image is not being shown some of the other class styling gets applied such as width height etc

2964106
uipickerviewdelegate	uipickerviewdatasource
here is an example where you have two objects that implement uipickerviewdatasource and uipickerviewdelegate

2964128
width	height
what i usually do is use the width and height of the main form and the modal form to calculate the location then use the pointtoscreen method of the main form to get the location of the modal form

2964154
postgresql	mysql
i m thinking about moving from mysql to postgresql for rails development and i just want to hear what other developers that made the move have to say about it

2964154
postgresql	mysql
i m looking for personal experiences not a mysql v postgresql shootout just the pros and cons that you yourself have arrived at

2964174
fortran	ada
fortran java and ada

2964181
put	get
you can use either rand or random to get an arbitrary random value then you can take the result of that and mod it by the size of the range and then add the start offset to put it within the desired range

2964187
folder	directory
another option would be to put a directory watch via filesystemwatcher on the fonts folder and automatically re-scan it

2964193
mp4	webm
in the same directory i got all 3 videofiles mp4 webm ogv

2964248
min	max
i ve had a couple of ideas one being pure brute-force involving performing a 3-dimensional loop ranging from 0..359 either in steps of 1 or more depending on results speed requirements on the set of vertices measuring the difference between the min max on both x y axis storing the highest results rotation pairs and using the most effective pair

2964277
put	get
this is kind of oddly worded but the gist is that any get operation whose onset is after some put operation s return is guaranteed to see the results of that put

2964291
boost	allocator
you should use a memory profiler like vld windows or valgrind linux to check if it can point to the bad allocator maybe you have a version of the boost library that contains an incompatibility bug with your current compiler and you might have to apply a fix

2964294
pascal	delphi
ð ++ builder s projects can have both c++ and pascal delphi code in the same project

2964296
starttls	smtps
debug smtps rcvd 530 5.7.0 must issue a starttls command first

2964321
srp	principles
rich domain model rdm and single responsibility principles srp are not necessarily at odds

2964346
db4o	eloquera
i am evaluating two object databases db4o and eloquera database for a coming project

2964357
touchesmoved	touchesended
unfortunately when uiscrollview detects a drag operation and cancels the touch touchesmoved and touchesended are not called even for the uiscrollview subclass anymore

2964357
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
looks like whatever uiscrollview is doing is not initiated from touchesbegan touchesmoved but instead it gets some notifications about the touches way before that

2964368
telerik	componentart
i have seen demos of componentart s and telerik s toolsets

2964378
postgresql	mysql
speaking from personal experience only we moved from mysql solely because our production system heroku is running postgresql

2964378
postgresql	mysql
another couple of nice things postgresql has over mysql

2964378
postgresql	mysql
in summary postgresql is like bricks mortar where mysql is lego

2964419
width	height
so what i am doing is trying animate the width and height and then also the offset to make it look like it animates from the center

2964436
ilist	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	idictionary	ienumerable	icollection	idictionary	ilist	idictionary	icollection
ienumerable icollection ilist idictionary

2964518
getter	setter
c# property is basically java getter and setter in one

2964525
getter	setter
this means that for me every class in java that is not a data structure has getter and setter for its fields that need to be accessible

2964529
post	get
if you still want to have people manually review post or if you want to get a large number of post manually rated in order to have a sufficiently large labeled dataset for training your machine learning algorithm you might be interested in mechanical turk which allows you to leverage a very large number of people really really cheaply

2964538
jquery	simplemodal
this div is hidden and is attached to a jquery simplemodal plugin

2964547
hash	md5
the name of the session cookie used by drupal is not constant but constructed based on an md5 hash of the cookie domain of the specific drupal installation - see conf_init in bootstrap.inc for details hashing occurs on the last line of the function

2964550
rsa	aes
there are key self-contained algorithms - particularly cryptography-related such as aes rsa sha1 etc - which you can find many implementations of for free on the internet

2964556
filtering	grouping
i have the grouping guid and am constructing a query using the memberof format and filtering by objectclass

2964587

what i d like to do is to get first 3 items along with all the tags in between and put it into another file

2964668
getter	setter
if all the operations are completely internal then getsomething is okay even for complex implementation - the whole point of getter setter properties is to encapsulate implementation details and hide them even if in the future they change to be something complex

2964691
avr	microcontroller
now i want to make it a baseline firmware which can be used with similar more or less features configurable on different microcontroller like msp or avr etc

2964780
nstextfield	nsimageview
the subviews are standard views such as nstextfield and nsimageview and are configured to be non-editable

maven	m2e
what s worse you cannot remove it to be replaced with maven s version as it keeps getting regenerated by m2e

2964848
multiplying	add
instead just add 1 everytime the question is answered wrongly and then run through the table regularly - say every midnight - and multiplying all by a constant - say 0.9

2964908
bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs	bazaar	perforce	perforce	cvs
git mercurial bazaar subversion cvs perforce and visual sourcesafe

2964964
perforce	cvs
subversion cvs perforce and sourcesafe are not distributed

2965001
cvs	svn
cvs is quite old and if you re planning to use that you d best ignore it and use svn instead

2965001
bazaar	git
git is something that you can add to the list but it s support on windows is not as good as that of bazaar and mercurial

2965025
inherited	properties
like firebug it should take into account inherited shortcut properties and all the other nuances of css

2965028
pdfsharp	itextsharp
in order to read the contents of a pdf file you will need a 3rd party dll file like the above mentioned itextsharp or pdfsharp

2965033
folder	directory
a low tech way of solving it might be to install pdf printer driver as the default printer and remove all others and set it up to automatically write all the files to certain directory on the network and then write a tiny app on another computer to monitor that folder for changes and if any new pdfs appear just print them out to a real printer

2965043
postgresql	mysql
haven t made the switch myself but got bitten a few times by mysql s lack of transactional schema changes which apparently postgresql supports

2965067
stdout	stderr
when the stdout and stderr are being redirected the program executed by the script is not being killed because it has a pid different than the one i got from fork

2965088
autocomplete	multi-select
like autocomplete datepicker color picker multi-select grids trees etc

2965128

2965150
getter	setter
please check you have the getter and setter correctly set

2965170
children	parent
but it also loads parent and all its children before deleting them

2965237
hash	md5
the md5 and sha1 algorithms both produce 128-bit hash so if you need 64 you can just truncate

2965261
uisplitviewcontroller	navigationcontroller
i have done this by adding two navigation controllers to my tabbarcontroller and assigning a subclass of uisplitviewcontroller as rootviewcontroller of both navigationcontroller

2965261
portrait	landscape
and also i have to show both viewcontrollers master and detail in both modes portrait and landscape

2965293
firefox	safari
i ve tested this on safari and firefox both exhibit the same problem

google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i wrote this piece of code which works for ie firefox and opera unfortunately it doesn t work for google-chrome

2965383
instances	transient
when there s an other scope than transient then the garbage collection of that scope will trigger the deactivation through the pipeline of all instances linked to that scope

2965410
getter	setter
with interfaces i would be free to use getter or setter but having many empty setter

2965410
getter	setter
maybe i should not hardcode the strings in the getter and put the strings in a reesource file because of localization then i need a setter anywhere in every sub class xd

2965420
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
if i remove the dropdownlistfor and checkbox then all works fine

2965420
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
the issue with this is that it will overwrite any dropdownlistfor checkbox selections that the user has already made

2965420
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
when i look at examples in books or online nerddinner all the validation examples involve simple forms with textbox inputs and don t seems to show instances with multiple checkbox and dropdownlistfor

2965450
soappy	suds
i am not sure how to do this in soappy but i do know how to do it in suds

2965450
soappy	suds
suds does the same thing as soappy but it is newer and is still supported

2965481
getter	setter
if the property is not abstract then any base class may choose to only override the setter the getter or both

2965481
implements	modifiers	getter	setter
if you want your subclasses not to have access to your setter except for only a given subclass you can use the internal access modifiers only to the getter and implements classes that shouldn t have access to the setter in another assembly

2965532
ubuntu	centos
this is on centos 5 on ubuntu 10.04 i installed mono packages via apt-get and vb.net just works

2965596
accessor	properties
that class should override a properties using both get and set accessor but will leave a properties abstract like this

2965668
setinterval	settimeout
in general never pass a string to settimeout or setinterval if you can avoid it there are other side-effects besides being bad practice.

2965669
implements	extends
this view should extends surfaceview implements surfaceholder.callback

2965696
addition	multiplication
this is what they do in mathematics they don t introduce exponentiation before multiplication and multiplication before addition because the former in each case is derived from the latter

2965758
hudson	phpundercontrol
cruisecontrol + a plugin system or a clean-interfaced hudson + a port of phpundercontrol

2965790
hide	show
in infopath you can not conditionally show hide or otherwise programatically affect specific rows columns cells in a standard table

2965790
hide	show
your best bet is to just show hide the fields themselves that are inside the row

2965807
layoutparams	viewgroup
you need to set the layoutparams of the viewgroup the imageview is sitting in

2965880
google-chrome	safari
this works in all browsers except webkit based ones google-chrome and safari

2965889

a user upgrading to the new versioning will no longer need the plug-in so it would be nice to uninstall it as part of the upgrade

2966079
mvvm	delegatecommand
if using mvvm you can use delegatecommand or relaycommand to do similar things from a viewmodel

2966085
gridview	objectdatasource

2966144
glassfish	weblogic	websphere	ibm
the concrete implementations are called application servers and or servlet containers like sun glassfish ibm websphere oracle weblogic apache tomcat eclipse jetty etcetera

2966150
interpreted-language	compiled-language
just to clarify for the sake of this question i define a scripting language to mean an interpreted-language like php python or ruby and a compiled-language to mean a strongly typed compiled-language like c# c++ java or vb

2966233
opera	firefox
i ve written a code that has successfully created a bookmark for any of the following browsers - ie firefox and opera

postgresql	mysql
while postgresql lacks a few things of mysql insert ignore replace upsert stuff and load data infile for me mainly the features it does have more than make up

2966247
for-loop	loops
i m not sure where you ve got for-loop and loopcount from but it looks like the for loops are off-by-one

2966248
maple	sage
but you can get the integration result as a function definition with a library such as maple mathematica sage or sympy

2966264
outputstream	inputstream
then in a servlet listening on an url-pattern of you just get the image as inputstream from some datasource from local disk file system as fileinputstream and then write it to the outputstream of the response the usual java io way

2966264
content-length	content-type
setting the content-type and content-length are also important so that the browser knows what the server is sending and can predict how long the download may take

2966272
post	get
you ve mentioned php java and .net in your post - it s time to get a job somewhere you can learn how to do it commercially

2966291
srp	principles
for me the one way was to start with test driven development and that lends itself to good class design as well as the srp single responsibility principles

2966295
hash	salt
as for storing securely on the server once you ve receive the user s password the first time you should use a one-way hash like sha256 with a salt

2966302
versioning	upgrade
the api supports database versioning so you can apply schema changes during upgrade or in your case

2966306
queue	fifo
you want to use a queue object for fifo operations

2966314
hide	show
i ve used jquery s show and hide functions extensively in my code and just encountered a bit of a problem they work by changing the display attribute of the element to block or none respectively so that if you have somethin that has display inline and then hide and show it you ve changed its display to block which screws up the layout in a couple of cases

2966314
hide	show
i d like the change show and hide to remove or add this class instead of directly changing the display attribute so that if you add the hidden class and then remove it again ie hide and show something then it s back to exactly how it was to start off with since adding a class overrides the attributes rather than directly changing them

2966314
hide	show
something like this this is a little pseucodey as i don t know how to set the function up properly - let s assume that this is the object that show hide was called on

2966327
interbase	firebird
firebird interbase and microsoft sql server use quite different data types their sql language dialect is somewhat different and so forth

2966329

i am looking for the outlook equivalent of the word 2007 show hide command that is in the paragraph section of the toolbar ribbon whose icon in the toolbar is a paragraph mark

2966344
ironruby	ironpython
so the dynamic languages like ironruby and ironpython make it very easy to do what you want

2966344
ironruby	ironpython
it can be done but i really prefer using ironruby or ironpython over this approach

2966416
for-loop	loops
i have a for-loop which extracts data from an xml document and adds it into some javascript objects each time loops executes i want it to run a certain function depending on the value of the attribute typ which is being retrieved from the xml

your parent list would be a listview that would have 2 table rows for each item on the first row your parent column on the second row use colspan and add a gridview wrapped on a collapsible panel

2966636
hide	show
specify slow as a parameter to show and hide

2966638
put	get
if it does region shouldn t be null i think except you put your handle in your view viewmodel of module and you hadn t get region manager and container on constructor

2966643
put	get
put and get will both overwrite

2966646
post	get
it happens with get and post

2966665
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i have tried using jquery.animate for this and it works on firefox google-chrome opera but it is super slow on the iphone

2966673

you would set your selected item template to contain another listview or gridview thats bound to your detailed data

2966742
int	double
i need to write a util function in my c++cli app that converts a string to a double or float or int

2966755
addition	multiplication
if you walk along with a pointer you just do the math to do the walk typically just an addition no multiplication and then return the result because you ve already done the second step

2966763
width	height
currently i have a for-loop which extracts each c node from the xml and also it s attributes width height x y

2966764
ati	nvidia
nvidia has supported such an extension since the geforce 256 days gl_nv_fences but there seems to be no equivalent functionality on ati hardware before opengl 3.0+.

2966896
freebsd	linux
after moving my mod_perl site from linux hosting to freebsd i have this error in the logfile

2966953
post	get
the problem is the urlrequest object in as3 only supports the get and post verbs

2966953
post	get
we re on a strict schedule and we d really rather not have to rewrite the whole api to just use get and post

2966963
int	double
in your case converting to int would mean invoking conversion to double which could and i suspect is less-efficient than plain conversion to int and evil rounding by your static_cast

2966965
put	get
2 and why does it get even slower when i put this in the inner loop

2967004
google-chrome	firefox
the latest versions of firefox ie and google-chrome on my windows vista box are all cutting the bottom off

2967007

2967122
post	get
changing the post to a get has not helped

2967125
rar	zip
in .htaccess every file zip rar txt ... is redirected to the tracker.php file because the stats

2967233
stdout	stderr
an alternative is to redirect stdout and stderr after the fork and run the command without the redirection

2967238
getter	setter
if you need to access the variables from another onject you use the getter and setter methods

2967252
getter	setter
in your getter setter why are you using specifically the syntax

2967252
getter	setter
let objective-c create your basic getter setter for you via the property line

2967306
expression-blend	silverlight
if you re looking for an application to create a mock-up design of a silverlight application i d recommend using expression-blend 3 version 3 or greater with sketch flow

2967329
mouse	keyboard
i am about to implement simple keyboard and mouse input on osx for my engine

2967329
mouse	keyboard
i want to abstract the implementation in more generic c++ classes like keyboard and mouse plus appropriate listeners for portability

2967329
hid	keyboard	mouse	keyboard
anyways the examples of the hid are very complex and i can t really wrap my head around it as fast as i wished i could so i was wondering if anybody has used it allready to get some basic mouse and keyboard input or knows about some good examples resources online

2967371
google-chrome	safari
even though the w3 spec doesn t disallow padding in select boxes for whatever reason webkit browsers safari google-chrome don t support it

2967397
ssl	https
rather than encrypting just the upload use https ssl to encrypt the entire connection between the client and server

2967407
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
we re using font-embedding so you ll only see the proper font in firefox safari and google-chrome

2967411
hide	show
setting hide show styles for each isn t a realistic option

2967411
hide	show
simple solution hide the body until jquery is ready and has built the elements then show the body

2967418
hide	show
you can also use the slide effect in jqueryui and specify direction up and down for hide and show

2967501
glut	fltk
fltk has a partial glut simulation but it s partial enough that a program that makes heavy use of glut may not work with it in the first place

2967553
cruisecontrol	teamcity
i can t comment on cdash or teamcity but i think cruisecontrol and hudson both have their advantages

2967553
ant	cruisecontrol	ant	maven
cruisecontrol is very well suited to projects that build with ant or maven and has a much clearer ui if you have a large number of projects

2967581
toolbar	tabs
i have an application which use tabcontrol and dynamically generates new tabs on each tab i have one textbox and now i d like to add an undo button to the toolbar which is not the part of the tab visualstudio like

2967606
dbcontext	objectcontext
my example is not meant that way that the generated objectcontext or dbcontext in newer ef versions should be edited manually which would be overwritten with every model update from the database as ctorx pointed out but that the entitycontainer element in the edmx conceptualmodels section of the edmx file should be edited by adding the attribute - either manually in an xml editor or on the properties page of the designer surface where this option is available as well

2967635
mouseup	mousedown
on mobile safari when you click on an element it gets a grey box around it between mousedown and mouseup

when i add this subviews on my view the event on this view are ok but the uibutton on my first uiview not work

2967667
put	get
if i put the dlls in configuration properties linker input additional dependencies i get

2967703
inherited	properties
you can inherited this control and override the properties .itemheight as follows

2967736
inherited	subclassing
ibm s j9 jvm seems to have a few bugs and incompatibilities in the parse routine of dateformat which simpledateformat likely inherited because it is a subclassing of dateformat

2967769
put	get
2 and why does it get even slower when i put this in the inner loop

2967769
disk	ram
if your working set the data that you need to operate on does not fit into registers or cache you will have to pay a penalty to fetch it from ram or even worse disk

2967780
portrait	landscape
i noticed that when running on the actual ipad starting in landscape the app would start in portrait then maybe rotate to landscape

2967780
portrait	landscape
on the simulator starting in landscape the app would start in landscape then the simulator would rotate to portrait

2967790
x86	64bit
you can have both an x86 and x64 distributions but if you re supporting both 32 and 64bit and you have native code or com introp then you have to have both 32 and 64bit binaries

2967811
opera	google-chrome
with opera and google-chrome i have the correct date displayed as 06 03 2010

2967871
winpcap	pcap.net
the library is pcap.net which is a wrapper for winpcap and includes a packet interpretation framework

2967880
google-chrome	firefox
similarly if you were making a web page and you wanted to make sure it worked in ie firefox and google-chrome you d test it in all three of those browsers

2967930
superclass	subclassing
when you create an object of a subclassing the superclass constructor is invoked

2967936
drawingvisual	rendertargetbitmap
i m using bitmapimage drawingvisual drawingcontext rendertargetbitmap bitmapencoder and bitmapframe but i m not seeing any properties related to dithering

2968078
portrait	landscape
however some of the photos are portrait layout and some are landscape

2968156
versioning	upgrade
with 5.12 you are supposed to just use cpan to install an upgrade versioning of a core module and it gets installed addtionally to the one shipped with the system but since the new one comes before the old one in the include path the new one gets loaded when you use require it

2968176
ubuntu	debian
my ideal scenario would be either something that installs as easily as a bundle or as a deb file in debian ubuntu

2968195
nfa	dfa
convert the regex to a nfa then convert the nfa to a dfa

2968222
disk	ram
this is bound to cause page faults in your cache so data has to be sourced from ram disk

2968290
post	get
here when the post is initially not a favourite favourite button is displayed and when i clicked on the button #add_favourite .submit gets called and unfavourite form is displayed correctly but now when i click on the un-favourite button #remove_favourite .submit does not get called

2968297
post	get
the examples use vanilla nhibernate but you should get the idea - the bit about configuring syscache is at the end of the post

2968306
pull	push
i would propose simply to use c arrays via ctypes on the python side and simply pull push the raw data through an socket

2968307
draggable	droppable
after submitting it i want the button handler to check if every draggable is above its correct droppable

2968312
boost	stl
3 use ideas from stl and boost and then build on top of them

2968312
boost	stl
never consider these to be a panacea for problems though -- stl is easy to ship with your code but boost is not

2968334
integer	unsigned
in addition convert ip to unsigned integer convert both useragent and request to unsigned int referencing lookup tables that are compressed using either innodb compression or the archive engine

2968397
width	height
i m hoping to move the contents of the data array around then swap over the width and height member variables

2968406
post	get
so i wanted to post my idea here on stackoverflow as a question to get some feedback on it and maybe some advice how it can be done better easier safer

2968483
button	checkbox
there should also be properties checkbox that you can check in order to control which button are accessible by default

2968511
draggable	droppable
thus you can just check if the right answer draggable is in the correct question droppable

2968564
folder	dir
and did a dir s xamlpad.exe to see if the windows index service didn t get to that folder yet

2968590
uilabel	uibutton
the problem is that uibutton creates its own uilabel and you can t override that safely

2968590
uilabel	uibutton
so if you choose to use a uibutton your only option for changing the label s behavior from that of a standard uilabel is to actually change the uilabel class via categories

2968590
uicontrol	uibutton
alternatively you could write your own uicontrol and mimic the functionality of uibutton

2968590
uilabel	uibutton
edit - if that fontlabel class extends from uilabel it may be possible to extend uibutton and use method swizzling to force it to instantiate a fontlabel as its titlelabel

2968606
folder	directory
i finally got this to work by moving the entire config directory into the src folder

2968640
width	height
edit the upper bound as i mentioned but forgot to correct should be around 20+ x500x500x5 20 iterations 500 width 500 height 5 dimensions where 3 comes from rgb and 2 for the coordinates the coordinates move and so do the pixels so i need to record the values which can and are decimals approx

2968740
move	drag
i designed every node to be a uiview subclass which implements drawrect and does some shape drawing.when i drag move the nodes i only redraw the dragged view which is ok

2968757
profiling	debugging
using sql profiling the insert updates never make it to the server and turning log4net up to debugging and show_sql true - the select statements appear but the insert update statements never make it into the log at all and never show up at the server

2968805
qnetworkreply	qnetworkaccessmanager
note that if you make the network request directly through qnetworkaccessmanager you do get a qnetworkreply with data available

2968806
jpopupmenu	jmenuitem
to get the graph i need to get the grapheditor component so i do a component component component e.getsource whitch is the actionevent passed to that action listener and at that stage is the jmenuitem save then i get the parent which is the jpopupmenu then i want to get that jpopupmenu s parent which should be the graphediotor but instead i get a null

2968946
caanimation	calayer
calayer and caanimation can do something similar to this you can read about it here

2968949
getter	setter
you can via privileged functions which in turn call private variables and functions but then you are basically creating a crapload of getter and setter which might just be doubled in your prototype public methods

2968967
openfire	ejabberd
this requires a separate xmpp server like ejabberd or openfire

2968989

2969023
rss	feed
folks this is what i m using to parse an rss feed for the last updated time

2969040
lxml	elementtree
use elementtree or lxml elementtree is in the standard library and will probably work fine for you

2969064
union	distinct
to keep the same semantics for the datastream column after switching to anthony s version you could do new hashset columnstoadd datastream but it might be easier faster to just add via concat or union or whatever the datastream string and then distinct the result and avoid the hashset creation might as well profile both

2969105
width	height
override updatedisplaylist in the titlewindow and when the height or width changes invalidate the displaylist on every item created inside the repeater

flyweight-pattern	singleton
one cool use of the singleton is when combined with the factory method can be used to create flyweight-pattern

2969621
int	chars
and as a good rule of thumb fundamental types int chars etc. and types with should be passed by value instead of const-reference because their size is small enough that copying will be faster than aliasing

2969630
int	chars
for small types like int or float or chars this doesn t worth the hassle since passing a reference is the same as passing an int

2969639

one option is to send the userid first to the website then let it respond with the salt and then send the hash password+salt back to the website

2969888
hash	salt
the third party developer is suggesting that we hash and salt the values

2969888
hash	salt

2969903
post	put
i put it on the page that i would like the post to parse on

2969941

hash	salt
you do hash a + salt and you store the hash and the salt the salt can be randomly picked

2969958
hash	salt
whoever is taking the client-supplied password during authentication hashing it and comparing it against the pre-hashed version needs the salt so that the password that the client supplies for authentication can be hash exactly the same as it was before

2970005
hash	salt

hash	salt
if it needs to know the userid for instance then you can t hash salt it before submitting it because the app will never be able to get the original userid back

affinity	processors
the os tries to not switch one thread between cpus you can make it try harder setting the threads preferred processors or you can even lock it to single processors via affinity

2973633
affinity	processors	cpu	processors	cpu	affinity
basically the os scheduler assigns the threads via a very adaptive round-robin algorithm to any free processors core as the affinity allows if the previous processors isn t immediately available regardless of the processes which means multi-threaded processes can steal much more cpu power

2973633
affinity	processors
as for affinity you can set affinity masks per-thread or per-process which supersedes all process threads settings but the os enforces least one logical processors affiliated per thread you never end up with a zero mask

2973633
affinity	processors
you may not set a threads affinity to a processors outside the process affinity but you can further limit it

2973633
affinity	processors
but it will not jump to a processors outside its affinity mask which may lead to considerable delays

http.sys	httplistener
depends on whether httplistener uses http.sys and making sure you bind to the exact ip address and port the fabric tells you to

2973889
post	get
the thing to note here though is that you can t do a post with a element as its requested through get

versioning	upgrade
this way windows installer will make sure your dll is refcounted and upgrade only if needed provided you maintain increase versioning info in your dll

2974141
translation	localization
i don t think localization is an easy-to-automate thing anyway as text held in the database often results in schema changes to allow for multiple languages and web html often need restructuring to deal with truncated or wrapped label and button text because for example you ve translation into german or something

first compare the output of this command in opera and for example firefox

2974504
put	get
to put a permanent performance hit on your system becasue this can reduce the use of indexes and becasue sending unneeded data over the network is costly and make it more likely that you will have unexpected problems as the database changes sometimes columns get added that you do not want the user to see for instance just to save less than a minute of development time is short-sighted and unprofessional

2974505
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works in google-chrome firefox and safari

it works for firefox but not for google-chrome and ie

2974628
getter	setter
the notion of giving such a property an getter and setter is not supported however

2974628
getter	setter
maybe that s clear if you think about it a bit it wouldn t be a dynamic property anymore if you already know what the getter and setter should do

2974630
yacc	bison
i might be wrong but it looks like that there s no direct flex bison lex yacc port for c# .net so far

2974643

sorting	filtering
the datasets underneath use these commands anyway and you can edit control them yourself or leave it for the dataset to build from your schema but the dataset also gives you other fast benefits such as designer support change tracking binding filtering sorting etc

a small question hopefully with a simple answer i am using jquery draggable and droppable to place items into a dock

2975108
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
if you really absolutely positively must implement a more sophisticated synchronization model then i highly recommend you brush up on manualresetevent its cousin autoresetevent semaphore keyword lock and concurrent programming in general

gridview	sqldatasource
also a gridview is bound to the sqldatasource

2975115
gridview	sqldatasource
with the textbox control as the source of the sqldatasource parameter update of the gridview works for the original page load and all postbacks

2975115
gridview	sqldatasource
why doesn t the bound gridview get updated on postbacks when setting the sqldatasource parameter programmatically when there is no control source

2975116
x86	64bit
my understanding is that as a 32-bit app on a 64bit windows that environment variable will point to the 32-bit program files folder - eg c program files x86

2975132
draggable	droppable
represents the droppable the draggable

2975143
x86	64bit
it should exist and point to program files without the x86 when running a 32bit application on a 64bit windows

2975148
int	chars
if your problem is caused by tab chars preceding the int run the code through expand to turn tabs into spaces then your original expression will work

2975186
post	get
you have to create a db with all databases and they passwords and servers to connect to the other servers and retrieve the version or create a plugin to wordpress that prints the version only if you send some password from get or post for security reasons and install it into all wordpress systems then you only have to read the plugin url

2975267

2975383
post	get
if you need more detailed information you will need to post any error messages you get from mysql

2975420
width	height
if you mean that you want the child panel arrangement to completely fill the center region there s not a simple way to do that other than calculating the inner dimensions of the region then assigning fixed height width to the child panels as you are now but based on your measurements

2975434
alloca	memset
calling other functions or allocating a moderate amount of memory with alloca and memset that area to 0 just before the call to fork would reveal if this is the case as the error would present itself earlier

2975436
hide	show
when i click on a link i hide the content area load the new data and show the content area again

octal	decimal	octal	hex	octal	binary	hex	binary
whether you interpret the number as binary decimal hex octal etc is up to you

2975583
octal	decimal	octal	hex
in c++ you have support for decimal hex and octal representations but they are all stored in the same way

2975622
filtering	grouping
the other thing to do would be to offer some type of categorization of the data so that they could filtering by category that would put people in probable grouping that would want all them all together

2975626
put	get
you re better off without it but at least this way you ll get something that sort of works and you won t waste time and effort on it that could be put to better purposes like improving your software

2975657

if you are on ubuntu debian its enhanced variant byobu is rather nice too

2975667
move	drag
like the user would drag something up down and i could just do an ajax call to the server with the id of the object that move and the new parent id of that object and then behind the scenes i could figure out how to reconnect things..maybe need more data than that...

equals	gethashcode
hash collisions are correctly handled by - in that so long as an object implements gethashcode and equals correctly the appropriate instance will be returned from the dictionary

2975784
equals	gethashcode
what you should be concerned with is whether the types you are using for keys implement gethashcode and equals correctly

2975784
equals	gethashcode
the basic rules are that gethashcode must return the same value for the lifetime of the object and that equals must return true when two instances represent the same object

2975787
cos	sin
a look at the generated assembly code shows that _mm_set_ps loads the sin cos results into xmm0 then saves it to the memory address of

2975846
maven	pom.xml
we ve recently done this and we just have all the devs run the maven eclipse plugin to generate or update their own .classpath files based on what s in the pom.xml file

2976020
int	double
that s probably the same issue as i mentioned in the comment where you aren t using an explicit cast and you re getting an invalid value because a double is being read as an int

2976020
int	double
because the double was attempted to be read as an int

2976023
int	chars
i will do this by creating a chars array and have the program scan each collumn of an int value

2976031
google-chrome	firefox
in addition to this firefox and google-chrome only show this error

2976033
button	checkbox
the behavior of the change event in javascript is a bit different for checkbox and radio button

2976033
hide	show
specifically i want to potentially hide or show certain divs depending on the radio button states

2976033
button	checkbox
aside it s because radio button seem to be handled differently than checkbox so i have a different radio-button-specific event

2976034
int	chars
suppose that the size of chars is one byte and the size of int and float is 4 bytes

2976072
int	chars
if nothing else just use an int array to begin with avoid casting from chars

2976072
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
but to loops through a 2d arrays you would just use a nested for-loop

2976143
switching	screens
the idea is that i ve drawn something on the window it gets temporarily switched to have an alpha of 1 255 for the drawing and then i switching it to full transparent mode alpha of 0 in order to interact with the desktop to be able to move the drawing around the screens on top of the desktop

2976184
textarea	textbox
this is only happens when i try to update from dropdown list otherwise from textbox or textarea i have no problem even if i use apastrophe or or white space

2976195

2976230
width	text-align	width	margin	margin	text-align
by setting display to inline and not setting a width each li will be centered by the ul text-align center and should space relatively evenly because of the right margin

subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
the multiplication takes precedence over addition subtraction

2976289
google-chrome	safari
keep in mind it s not a real test on an iphone but if you use it with safari or google-chrome for windows you ll come really close to how it ll look on an iphone

2976290
addition	multiplication
the equivalent multiplication and addition can be used but i see bit operators used more frequently

2976294
ciimage	cifilter
if i build the following code the compile step completes just fine but i get an error from the linker saying _objc_class_ _ciimage referenced from objc-class-ref-to-ciimage in appcontroller.o followed by a second error that looks identical except ciimage is replaced with cifilter followed by a statement that says symbol s not found

2976294
put	get
i put that import statement in because without it i get a compiler error on the first line of code that says no +filterwithname method found and i read somewhere that cocoa automatically includes ciimage.h but not cifilter.h

2976307
mouse	keyboard
send mouse and keyboard events to the window

2976315
fseek	ftell
with fseek and ftell

2976345
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
regarding point 2 i had thought the openfiledialog or savefiledialog weren t extendable in any way - they are provided by the os

2976418
google-chrome	firefox
firefox seems to understand it and i believe google-chrome will as well but ie ignores it enitrely

2976436
width	height
you re specifying the height and width properties as fixed values in the usercontrol

2976440
put	get
specifically i m looking for the width of the whitespace gutter the interface builder normally recommends you put get between controls and the edge of a view

2976453
set	bag
i changed the collection to bag or set and i get a different issue

2976517
google-chrome	firefox
while firefox manages ie and google-chrome refuse to collapse the div any further than the height of the picture

affinity	processors
the start windows shell command in cmd.exe appears to be able to start a process with a chosen processors affinity rather than starting the process then setting the chosen processors affinity some small period of time after it has started

2976611
xslt	xquery
xpath 2.0 xquery 1.0 has the fn boolean function which does smart xml schema aware evaluation of boolean values. to determine if a value is true in xslt you have to explicitly check it

2976626
children	parent
first of all why would i need to put the prefix for the children if the parent already has it

2976659
affinity	processors
i suspect what the start command does in this case is start the process suspended passes create_suspended when calling createprocess then sets the processors affinity then resumes the thread

2976659
affinity	processors
this way while the process exists without the process affinity having been set by the time it starts executing the processors affinity has been set so it only ever runs on the designated processors

2976674
getter	setter
personally if at all possible i dispense with the private variable and just use the getter and setter in the property

2976693
affinity	processors
i do not think that you can set processors affinity before starting the process because the first parameter of setprocessaffinitymask function is handle to the process

2976693
affinity	processors
on the other hand there is a program called imagecfg which allows to permanently set processors affinity for an executable but i am not sure how it works

2976699
entity-relationship	diagram
if you also want to create a good looking entity-relationship diagram there is a great project which introduces the . manage.py graphmodels command

2976711

put	get
how can i get excel to put borders around groups with the same number in the 4th column so that there is a border around the groups

2976935
toolbar	tabs
the above article talks about how instead of implementing the twitter application using tabs they decided to go with a home screen and a toolbar because of some of the limitations of tabs

2976976
post	get
i think the best way to get this question answered is to post some screenshots of your app

2977007
getter	setter
i have public getter and setter for the data members available in the class

2977007
getter	setter
but besides that having private members and so do their getter and setter doesn t seem to be of a logical one for me

2977013
children	parent
you could pull the comments into an associative array determine if they are a parent then attach children to the parent

2977016
getter	setter
getter and setter let you apply logic to the input output from the private members therefore controlling access to the data encapsulation to those who know their oo terms

2977016
getter	setter
keep in mind though that doesn t mean each and every private variable needs its own getter setter

2977016
getter	setter
neil brings up a good point in his banking example that sometimes getter setter just don t make sense

2977019
getter	setter
if you have getter and setter for each of your data items there is no point in making the data private

2977019
getter	setter
that s why having getter and setter for each of your data items is a bad idea

2977019
getter	setter
consider the std string class - it probably has one getter the size function and no setter at all

2977040
getter	setter
in the rather unlikely event that you do someday need logic in the getter or setter you can change the data type to a proxy class that overloads and or operator t where t whatever type you re using now to implement the necessary logic

2977040
getter	setter
using a getter or setter actually reduces the level of abstraction and exposes the implementation -- it requires client code to be aware that this particular class implements what is logically data as a pair of functions the getter and setter

2977045
getter	setter
there is no best practice with regard to using getter setter or having public members

2977045
getter	setter
personally getter setter are the lesser of two evils

2977045
getter	setter
because once you start making getter setter people stop designing objects with a critical eye toward what data should be visible and what data should not

2977045
getter	setter
it that natural interface involves exposing some internal properties using getter and setter so be it

2977045
getter	setter
but the important part is that you thought about it ahead of time and created the getter setter for a design justified reason

2977051
getter	setter
i also don t recommend that you have getter and setter for all of your data members

2977051
getter	setter
but don t make getter and setter for all of your members

2977051
getter	setter
if you expose everything through getter and setter you ve not improved anything over using public data

2977058
getter	setter
the return value also effects the use of getter and setter

2977059
getter	setter
on a strictly practical basis i d suggest you start by making all of your data members private and make their getter and setter private

getter	setter
as you find out what the rest of the world your l user community actually needs you can expose the appropriate getter and or setter or write appropriately-controlled public accessors

2977059
getter	setter
with getter and setter this is easy

2977063
getter	setter
in this case getter and setter are good idea

2977072
getter	setter
aside from the encapsulation concerns which are reason enough it is very easy to set a breakpoint whenever the variable is set accessed when you have getter setter

2977094
google-chrome	firefox
this happens in firefox but not in google-chrome

2977152
getter	setter
i ve always thought that getter and setter are deliberately verbose in most programming languages specifically to make you think twice about using them - why does your caller need to know about the inner workings of your class should be the question at the front of your mind

2977172
getter	setter
getter and or setter methods possibly accessing a private data member

2977172
getter	setter
the getter setter approach does not even expose the fact that the property is implemented by a physical object

2977172
getter	setter
there might be no physical data member behind the getter setter pair

2977172
getter	setter
taking above into the account it is strange to see someone claim that a getter and setter pair is the same as a public data member

2977178
prng	random
urandom is a prng which self-seeds from random .

2977183
ssl	https
this works fine but if i then edit the uri to remove the s from https it still loads the page but without ssl

2977192
getter	setter
using getter and setter will allow you to modify the way that you give the values to the user

2977215
folder	directory
both .bat files are within the same folder and i m not changing directory so i don t know what the problem is.

2977222
int	chars
int parse_obj_scene obj_scene_data data_out chars filename

2977261
cvs	svn
we moved from a combination of svn and cvs

2977275
put	get
i m sure the original developer s intent was to avoid the infuriating nullreferenceexception bug resulting from attempting to access the logpath property of some logginglistener object -- in which case it probably just seemed most sensible to put the null check in the get since that s where the exception was thrown

2977282
accessor	properties
i personally don t like when properties changes assigned value in either get or set accessor

2977310
scheme	prolog
for the final project in a programming languages course i took we had to embed a prolog evaluator in scheme using continuations and macros

2977310
scheme	prolog
the end result was that you could freely mix scheme and prolog code and even pass arbitrary predicates written in scheme to the prolog engine

2977314
chown	sudo
sudo chown -r www-data home administrator sites checkmyid

2977331
bluetooth	usb
you will need a windows pc download the nokia qt sdk and the nokia ovi suite you will also need a way to connect the phone where you want to deploy to your development machine bluetooth or usb cable and a tool included in the sdk to install sis files to and debug applications in your phone from your pc named app trk

2977364
clang	llvm
if you use llvm use clang not llvm-gcc

2977372
pop-up	dialog
in canchangepages i pop-up a do you want to save dialog and give the user an opportunity to select yes no or cancel

2977433
gridex	janus
as of today the janus controls gridex do not work with vs 10 .net 3.5 .

2977437
addition	multiplication
the difference is that in the second pattern the concatenation x followed by y in xy has higher precedence than the choice either x or y in x|y like multiplication has higher precedence than addition so the pattern is equivalent to

2977443
maven	pom.xml
to achieve the desired behavior in my maven project on netbeans i set up a profile defining an environment variable in my project s pom.xml and modified the test file action in my project s properties to activate my new profile

2977448
width	margin
otherwise if they are explicitly set in the width padding and margin attributes it would be something like

2977449
keydown	keyup
it works though by using keyup keydown also produces the same strange result

2977459
post	get
notice that initally it was a post operation that was performed in the form and the pagination performs a get operation

2977459
post	get
i am trying to avoid sending the form field values via get because i fear that the data may exceed the maximum permissible value in the url as it is less secure than a post operation

2977486
put	get	post	put	post	get
it s essentially a client application that you can use for get post put and delete queries on rest services

2977488
client-side	server-side
i m trying to create a json object on client-side and pass to a server-side function

2977498
hex	binary
editing the binary will work -- folks have been using hex editors to clear the hide design flag safely for years

2977506
post	get
first off get is no less secure than post

2977518
maven	m2e
this is possible whether you are using m2e or the maven eclipse plugin and is actually the default behavior for both

2977546
put	get
but note that you cannot put the definitions after the display line -- this is an expression that uses their value so if you move the function definitions after it you ll get a runtime error

2977552
width	height
the .elmchildren are width and height 100

2977556
explode	substr	strlen	substr
you can use strpos strlen substr but not other very useful functions such as explode strrev etc

2977622
yacc	bison
and bison i take it is a play-on-words deriving from yacc

2977701
serializable	deserialization
same question from a protobuf serializable and deserialization perspective

2977704
hide	show
the reason why i want to listen to the click events is because i want to show or hide the submenuitems commandbarcontrol given some condition when one clicks a menu commandbarpopup

2977712
nsentitydescription	nsmanagedobjectmodel
i wonder in which cases it would be good to make an nsmanagedobjectmodel completely programmatically with nsentitydescription instances and all this stuff

2977745
cdr	cons
so instead of adding if-checks in car and cdr whether the pointer is nil - which will slow every call - they just allocated a cons think list and assigned its head and tail to point to itself

2977758
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
technically monodevelop is a fork of sharpdevelop but its been a long time so they might be completely different now

2977831
getter	setter
with getter and setter i follow a few rules

2977834
for-loop	arrays
i want to try and put this all into a for-loop and define the variables using names from an arrays

2977838
wsse	ws-security
i would like to be able to use the ws-security schema as well as saml schemas to build the wsse security stuff.

2977930
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the google visualization graph renders correctly in google-chrome safari and safari for the ipad but not in firefox 3.6.3

2977953
haskell	scheme
first-class functions are an essential feature of any functional language ml scheme and haskell

2977968
disk	ram
think of it as a large ram disk without actually having to pay for the ram

2978027
coalesce	isnull
in sql server you get a minor performance improvement by using isnull instead of coalesce

2978037
getter	setter
i believe if you have an iboutlet you need to define getter setter

2978052
mouse	keyboard
the vml based ones are limited if you need lots of elements in your drawing and the flash based ones won t be limited by the number of element but by the interactivity mouse and keyboard events

2978081
datamapper	activerecord
you may also be interested in replacing activerecord with datamapper which works in rails 3

2978086
wordpress	joomla
i wonder if there is an open source cms coded in python that is as big as drupal or joomla or wordpress

2978141
jython	pypy
the python tools for visual studio are a great choice and they even support regular python jython and pypy as well

2978187
rss	feed
i implemented a small web application to create rss feed in java spring mvc

2978216
width	height
i don t know about you but i need tables which can handle dynamic width and height

2978251
wordpress	joomla
my first thought was to lay down a simple cms like wordpress or joomla when i discovered something rather unfortunate

2978253
ubuntu	linux
now when i tried to run the same sample code included in the ebay sdk on linux ubuntu it ran perfectly

2978277
awt	swing
generally the awt thread is used to change components in the swing framework

2978306
post	get
i want to post it on the fan page but in the album all have is post the album to profile and if i do it i get it in my own profile not on the fan page

2978308
ivar	subclassing
i have a custom model class with an nsmutabledata ivar that will be accessed by custom nsoperation subclassing using an nsoperationqueue

2978402
geronimo	jonas	jboss	jonas	jboss	geronimo
jotm used in jonas geronimotm jencks used in geronimo jbossts used in jboss and atomikos

2978412
put	get
the reason it is set up this way is to dynamically decide what icon to put in each row and in the implementation of arrayadapter i had to use an inflator to get to the label imageview

2978453
int	chars
int main int argc const chars argv

2978498
sorting	grouping
i changed the cells to td instead of th but now they don t stay in place when sorting for obvious reasons they just get grouping together

2978531
min	max
additionally the having clause is for aggregates - the simplified example you provided should trigger an error because no aggregate function ie count avg min max etc is performed on the 005 column alias

2978539
firefox	safari
everything works great in safari and firefox

2978582
uploadify	swfupload
if your intent is just to have a progress bar have a look at uploadify or swfupload

2978609
inherited	properties
if you go with a controltemplate your custom control can participate in properties inherited and be part of the visual tree receiving all the events

2978654
children	parent
as you have no doubt observed when you group model3ds in a model3dgroup the transform properties of the children combine with those of the parent

2978671
innodb	myisam
i would try with innodb and myisam engines to see if one is faster

2978783
post	put
edit so i did a little prototype python 2.6 and based on sqlite and put it up on -- it s a 3k zipfile including 225-lines lustdb.py too long to post here and two small test files roughly equivalent to the op s originals test0.py is...

2978800
post	get
post get

2978867
implements	extends
this expression instantiates a new object from an unnamed and previously undefined class which automatically extends the class named classname and which cannot explicitly implements any interfaces

2978867
implements	extends
this expression instantiates a new object from an unnamed and previously undefined class which automatically implements the interface named interfacename and automatically extends the class named object

2978867
implements	extends
the class can explicitly implements one and only one interface and cannot extends any class other than object

2978884
hash	md5
i then used the included bat file to generate the md5 hash

2978886
public	protected
the idea would be to try to think of the whole vacation-scheduler as a closed-program that has a set of features and doesn t bother with things such as authentication that should be internal protected being that the only public things i d let the outside world see would be its controllers

2978931
cgpoint	cgrect
cgfloat is a part of core graphics so if i would it also be alright to use cgpoint cgrect etc.

2978940
range	infinity
large but hardly the uncountable infinity of real numbers that exist in this range

2978963
rss	feed
i ve written a small app to parse some rss feed from youtube and launch videos selected by the user

2978989
google-chrome	firefox
the issue if fixed in google-chrome with bottom 5px but in firefox will be too high

2979006
uiview	uiwindow
there s more documentation here that you should read to understand the delegate pattern in cocoa and cocoa touch particularly with how delegation is used between uiwindow and uiview

2979052
emacs	aquamacs
i have tried this procedure on aquamacs carbon emacs and the release from

2979055
implements	extends
the myblockingqueue.take is used not in a thread extends thread but rather implements runnable

2979060
accessor	properties
said business objects enforce business rules the set accessor will throw an exception on the spot if the contract for that properties is violated

2979060
accessor	properties
well whenever nhibernate loads an object from the database when isession.get id is called the set accessor of the mapped properties are used to put the data into the object

2979060
public	protected
while this certainly works it does not seem ideal as it requires the bl to provide one public interface for the app-at-large and another protected interface for the data access layer

2979103
mouse	keyboard
likewise the presence of touch input support in the device doesn t mean the user will use that method of input - perhaps the device supports mouse keyboard and touch input and the user prefers the mouse or some combination of the three input types

2979125
put	get
i get the concept here but i cannot put button on it

2979148
subscript	superscript
if you only need numbers use unicode characters 2070..2079 for superscript and 2080..2089 for subscript

2979165
queue	fifo
i was wondering if the fifo queue presented in fober et al s paper was a multiple consumer and produce fifo queue

2979185
int	chars
the reason you get the bit about the conversion is that chars are small int and it s trying to stuff the null pointer into the first chars of each string

2979212
int	chars
the int that is mentioned in the diagnostic message is the first element of the chars array

2979212
int	chars
chars is an int type in c and when you write

2979226
internationalization	translation
internationalization i18n support and integration with the qt linguist translation tool

2979325
post	get
using this method i can use post and get methods using php scripts

2979419
client-side	server-side
aside from the correct responses that the others gave you judging from your question i think you first need to learn about client-side and server-side code

2979426
nunit	moq
2 added a ref to moq and nunit

2979482
filtering	grouping
how should one handle the situation where you may need to filtering by a grouping of users

2979492
free	malloc
basically there s just malloc and free

2979496
move	drag
in my previewmousedown handler i set everything ready in case there s a drag started detected in the move event however i set e.handled true

2979496
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
i have tried using the standard mousedown mousemove and mouseup events however there s an issue with messing up my multiple selection feature that means i need to use the preview version of those events

2979501
persistent	transient
my user entity class have several member variables string firstname which are persistent and some transient variables transient boolean selected which are not

2979569
width	height
i try to publish a movie with the values of 100 for the width the height

2979569
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
flash doesn t display in firefox but displays on opera google-chrome safari

2979594
put	get
if you only need exactly-matching get and put why can t you just make a single hash table that happens to use a dot-separated naming convention

2979675
postgresql	mysql
i m going to start development on a web app using ruby rails probably either postgresql or mysql and most likely apache

2979675
macvim	textmate	textmate	textwrangler
i don t need helping finding an editor there s plenty out there textmate textwrangler macvim but i do need help to make sure i m setting things up correctly to code build and run the web app from my mac

2979855
firefox	safari
for some reason on macs only and only in the browser tested in safari and firefox the masthead renders slightly darker than the repeating bg image creating this color inconsistency

2979855
box	myspace
the block that extends up behind the album artwork is a solid box made with css which blocks some of myspace s standard content

2979885
qimage	qwidget
i created my own qt widget parent of qwidget and has a qimage inside to manipulate images

2979918
children	parent
i tried first with cascade.alldeleteorphan but that works only for deletion of items from the children collection not deletion of the parent

2979921
post	put
you re already getting the html content back from the post or at least i would think this is the case so just put that response in the #recordingdialog using .html and then make the dialog call

2979992
children	parent
when sorting the children that are in a fieldset these need to remain attached to their current parent

2980006
hash	md5
afaik usually md5 sha encrypted password is not encrypted string but calculated hash

2980087
mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	children	parent
also .hover uses mouseenter and mouseleave rather than mouseover and mouseout the difference is when you go into a child or between children mouseenter doesn t fire again and mouseleave doesn t fire on the parent we care about

2980104
put	get
you can use the split and join methods to get the values and put them together again

2980157
width	height
now i dynamically create a div for displaying images based on image width and height

2980205
width	height
actually you can change the width and height after image loading

2980212
qmail	exim
that is how a mua mail-user agents -- your mail reader is orthogonal to your mta mail-transport agent -- mail server software like exim qmail postfix ...

2980221
hide	show
i want to show dialog after n seconds and hide it after m seconds but it don t work for me

2980300
spaces	delimiter
i think that should be newline delimiter not spaces delimiter

2980313
outputstream	inputstream	outputstream	bufferedinputstream	bufferedoutputstream	inputstream	bufferedoutputstream	bufferedinputstream
get the image as an inputstream from the db using resultset#getbinarystream wrap it in an bufferedinputstream and write it to the outputstream of the response wrapped in an bufferedoutputstream through a small buffer

2980320
post	get
this means that when you do a get request to journey the index action is executes and when you do a post request the create action is executed

2980324
ssl	https
i m thinking that this could have something to do with the fact that on the server there is an ssl cert which the isp uses to provide a generic https address to your site

2980341
google-chrome	firefox
even firefox and google-chrome are accepted

2980349
cvs	svn
and on a side note don t confuse keeping directories in sync with version control and the other way around both often happen imho i don t know what you re trying to sync but a git svn cvs repo might be better

2980371
jstl	taglib
you normally use the jstl fmt taglib for this

2980371
jstl	taglib
to install jstl just drop jstl-1.2.jar in web-inf lib and to use the fmt taglib just declare it in top of jsp as per its documentation

2980389
profiling	benchmarking
however i must say that practically i d advise against doing any of the above until you test the app against prod server and benchmarking and find the slow points using benchmarking and profiling

2980428
google-chrome	firefox
the probles is that it works in firefox but not in google-chrome i mean everything works but it seems like the is not working because it doesnt get the first tab

2980445
tcpdf	fpdf
options would be fpdf if you feel like rewriting your whole html into blocks tcpdf if you feel a bit less masochistic which has some limited html css support

2980459
ubuntu	linux
while i have not located the source of the error still looking i have verified this on ubuntu 9.04 running linux 2.6.34

2980483
webclient	webrequest
it can t use webrequest or webclient nor can it use asynchronous sockets

2980565
pkcs#12	pfx
you need to use one of the x509certificate2 constructors that are designed for pfx aka pkcs#12 files

2980570
getter	setter
you need to make your xslt generate static member variables instead of getter and setter

2980616
free	strdup
or you could split in the same way but use strdup to allocate new string buffers remember to call free

2980653
3-tier	n-tier
or is this totally wrong for n-tier 3-tier

2980698
children	parent
it ll become more fun if you want color of all layout s children to be affected by color of qvboxlayout s parent but i think that embedded dialogs demo from qt4 demo may give you an idea about how it can be done

2980737
addition	modulo
at any rate the sieve of eratosthenes performs no remainder modulo calculations only addition to move across a list in increments of p where p is the last prime to be discovered so far and crossing out

2980746
width	height	integer	unsigned
this might not be the case in your application but i have come across similar cases where a height or width of an object has been set to some unreasonable big number as the result of misuse of an unsigned integer in calculations for positioning height or width

2980746
integer	unsigned
i guess it is seldom a good idea to use an unsigned integer for stuff like x and y positions that can have negative values

2980752
post	get
it can handle get and post requests but there are other benefits as well

2980805
stringbuilder	stringwriter
i ve looked at several questions here including this one which comes closest stringwriter or stringbuilder but none in which the answers actually address the question of whether there s a reason to prefer one over the other for simple string assembly

2980839
int	chars
for most implementations when you assign an int to a chars the compiler generates code which accesses the low-order byte of the int and stores that in the chars

2980839
int	chars
in your example the command-line input would be stored in a variable larger than chars such as int and later assigned to chars truncating the bytes

2980852
stringbuilder	stringwriter
for a start a stringwriter uses a stringbuilder stringbuffer under the hood to hold the characters written to the stream

2980911
versioning	upgrade
you can use wix to help you create msi packages and this microsoft knowledge base article will give you a quick but complete rundown of how to initially deploy the package and how to upgrade it later when you have new versioning

2980934
free	malloc
you might be able to detect memory leak on tests by providing your own implementation of new delete malloc and free functions by adding memory tracking informations on allocation

2980974
inherited	properties
using vs var type you can probably avoid the need to actually inherited from the type and rather use aggregation for this proxy that way you will still have intelli-sense support and not need to make all the methods properties virtual

2980978
rss	feed
for example one of my tabs displays rss feed list after user clicks one of the rss feed it will switch to a view displaying a list of articles and after user clicks one of the titles a full article view will be displayed

2981006
put	get
i am trying to install cocos2d but when i put it into terminal i get the error

2981043
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
moreover you should find a webhost that offers you apache and lighttpd or nginx

2981053
ubuntu	linux
decided to start from a linux version run ubuntu

2981078
post	get
again it should include both fields included in the post and fields from the query string as in a get request

2981092
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
i and others gave you comments and answers there that will enlighten you about both getelementbyid and getelementsbytagname

2981146
stringbuilder	printwriter	stringbuilder	stringwriter
edit following robinst s comment above i now have three methods one which does printwriter stringwriter -style appending and two which use stringbuilder one with the append of the newline inside the append as in the original builder.append thing + newline

2981150
ready	each
you should also be ready to talk a bit about why you d pick one method over another and what the pluses and minuses of each are

2981195
expression-blend	silverlight
i m trying to open a silverlight 4 application solution in expression-blend 3

2981282
maven	m2e
environments maven 2.2.1 eclipse m2e

2981315
uitableview	nsindexpath
- void tableview uitableview tableview didselectrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

2981328
getter	setter
not the tool actually but you could use encapsulate method in visual assist x for example which makes getter setter methods for some private class member

2981375
post	get
everything compiles just fine and in that slide i am able to see the solutions to the three equations respective parameters in that itemized list for example the first item in the itemized list from that beamer slide is outputted as i am not able to post an image of the beamer slide but i hope you get the idea

2981385
key-value-coding	kvc
look at the docs for kvc key-value-coding

2981389
mouse	keyboard
it should be possibel to work without mouse using keyboard only

2981389
kate	jedit
from my experience there are two other editors that could be used as a vs replacement on linux - jedit and kate

2981416
ncover	partcover
ncover purecoverage partcover and a few others i can t remember their names

2981426
pop-up	dialog
just looking for something that pop-up a hello world dialog when it detects your in the car and its moving for the first time down the street

2981436
google-chrome	firefox
i m using google-chrome version 5.0.375.55 and firefox version 3.5.9 but i can t get the html5 code below to display a box

2981445
pyquery	lxml.html
i would choose python due to superior libxml2 bindings specifically things like lxml.html and pyquery

2981445
pyquery	lxml	pyquery	lxml.html
with any of these you get a truly superior html parser querying via xpath and with lxml.html and pyquery also built on lxml you get css selectors

2981468
width	height
where textureimage is a struct that has a height width and void data

2981471
implements	modifiers
in java you might see the same thing for example you could imagine a adapter class that implements the iterator interface and wraps an enumeration. the only difference is that in scala you can add the implicit modifiers to a declaration to tell the compiler to automatically insert calls to that method if it will make the code compile

2981480
playlists	autoplay
not sure whether it fulfills your exact requirement whether the feature can be combined with an autoplay setting but jwplayer supports xml playlists

2981535
getter	setter
i think you have to annotate the interface too with entity and we have to annotate transient on all getter and setter of interface

2981590
mp3	ogg
the decoding system is prepared for compressed audio decoding see the pcm decoder for example of how to write a decoder but there is currently no decoder for ogg mp3 or anything like that

2981602
rss	feed
in a twitter rss feed the pubdate is published as

2981616
bufferedreader	printwriter
my instructor requirement is bufferedreader to load the stream and printwriter to save it

2981655
gtk	cairo
however if you want to go this way then install msys and pull down the source for glib atk cairo pango and gtk

2981655
libjpeg	libpng
there will undoubtedly be other dependencies that you need to install such as libpng and libjpeg

2981657
mockito	jmockit
with ides like eclipse i find myself using tool support to generate stubs inside the test class more frequently than mocking jmockit mockito etc. in the recent time

2981657
easymock	jmockit	easymock	jmock
although i have only experience with jmock easymock and basic knowledge with jmockit

2981663
hide	show
this is fairly simple if you add to each link you want to hide or show as follows

2981705
width	height
specifying explicit values for width and height attributes seems like a wrong idea - the button should calculate its dimensions based on its contents automagically but keep its width and height equal

2981712
directx	directdraw	direct3d	directx	direct3d	directdraw
maybe you want to use some opengl library or windows directdraw direct3d from directx in case you want to do some 3d stuff with your graphics

2981720
bufferedreader	filewriter	bufferedreader	printwriter	filewriter	printwriter
save and load the state of a class and of related members assuming you only have the bufferedreader and printwriter io classes available along with filereader filewriter classes and no serialization framework in place in the language

2981749
directx	direct2d	directx	gdi	gdi	direct2d
windows offers gdi + wpf and directx including direct2d on vista+

2981755
ant	ivyde
i have installed subclipse ant ivyde red5 plugin for eclipse i added java_home and java_version to environmental variables i also added java and ant to the windows path

2981800
queue	fifo
in my scenario reader and writer can use separate buffers big data chunks independently and then only accessing a shared fifo object like a queue should be synchronized

2981863
stdout	stderr
the first one is to run ghostscript on the commandline dos box the second one will open two gui windows one to render the output another one which is console-like and shows gs stdout stderr or takes your command input if you run gs in interactive mode

2981882
onkeyup	onkeydown
to trigger it via a key override onkeydown or onkeyup

2981905
post	get
i asked in a comment on the main post about accessing the data you will have to get creative but it should be easy to do

2981923
jobs	cron
i m running two cron jobs

2981928
put	get
to get the buffer to be put in m_buffer

2981982
addition	multiplication
thus + and will be complex addition and multiplication

2982003
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
runs flawless in safari google-chrome firefox and the latest version of opera

2982007
width	height
problems can occur due to wrong format should be 320 width and 480 height yes that means you can see the status bar in your default.png or because you might have named the first file default.png which is wrong which worked in simulator because it seems to be case insensitive but then when it gets copied to iphone it won t be found cause it is case sensitive

2982037
getter	setter
if the reason you want a ref field is to make a getter and setter of another variable that s perfectly legal

2982040
svg	vml
raphaã l uses the svg w3c recommendation and vml as a base for creating graphics

2982048
bash	zsh
in bash and ksh and zsh if you use double square brackets you don t need to quote variables to protect against them being null or unset

2982052
post	get
i was wondering if there was a way to make controller methods in rails available only for specific http methods get post etc.

2982135
children	parent
either a node class has to keep track of its children or has to keep track of its parent or both

2982152
ready	each
method 2 will have to spit out a bunch of concat opcodes for each iteration of the loop and the very long string will be built in memory until you re ready to send it

2982169
google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to simply load a plain text file into a page at runtime using jquery- everything works fine in ie8 8.0.7600.16385 firefox 3.6.3 however in google-chrome 5.0.375.55 the data comes back as nothing- i get an empty alert box

2982195
width	height
i think you want to bind button s width to its height like this

2982208
recv	epoll
so it s likely more expensive than select or epoll and doing the read or recv yourself

2982220
put	get
when this new view is put in my xml layout i just get a blank screen

2982292
cos	sin
cos and sin take parameters in radians but you re giving them in degrees

2982312
entity-relationship	diagram
i use schemaspy to generate the entity-relationship diagram

2982327
width	height
you have both width and height set to fill_parent which means that the buttons and datepicker are off the screen

2982327
width	height
if you want the buttons to appear on top of the game engine view then you will have to either set the buttons as children of the game engine or you will have to set the height and width to values that will leave space for the buttons

2982342
width	height
i want to set the border to be 1 pixel with width 100 pixels and height 200 pixels

2982343
keyevent	onkeydown
you could try overriding the onkeydown keyevent method and change what happens for those keys

2982358
getter	setter
if i m right - this code enforces the property to be backed up by dependencyproperty which restricts it to be a simple property with a store from functional point of view not technically instead of being able to calculate the property value each time getter is called and setting other properties fields each time setter is called

2982362
width	height
divs don t have the width height border attributes

2982380
firefox	safari
firefox ie and safari

2982384
range	minimum
to get a random number in range minimum maximum inclusive

2982410
submit	submission
i have successfully submit the form using ajax but it still refreshes the page after submission

2982453
int	chars
you re comparing a chars to an int it should be

2982459
int	chars
you ned to compare a chars and you are comparing an int

2982495
subtract	add
i need to take each table add up every deposit and withdraws per user then subtract the withdraws from the deposits

2982511
pull	push
you can optionally add the .subhg directory to your .hgignore so you don t pull push all the subrepository s history

2982521
emacs	textmate
textmate and emacs are both garbage i m baffled as to why these plain over-glorfied notepads get so much attention

2982578
jquery	curvycorners
also you might want to read a good article on making dropshadows curvycorners gradients using jquery

2982581
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m working on this javascript script that works nice in safari and google-chrome but for some reason it doesn t work at all in firefox

2982587
websphere	ibm
so if you were using ibm websphere source

2982597
post	put
i am currently creating an widget that need sprite animation and i have put a blog post on how to animate home widget

2982611
postgresql	mysql
edit i ll be using either mysql or postgresql + spring templates

2982665
put	get
so if you try to put an input directly into a form without a container element and validate under xhtml 1.0 strict you get this warning

2982687
hash	md5
no problem just explicitly open the file openfile read the contents data.bytestring.lazy.hgetcontents perform the md5 hash let

2982722
int	chars
the correct version does int arithmetic on the chars which works as expected

2982730
mouseover	mouseout
i don t want to manually add a mouseout event to each link and i don t want code anywhere other than within the class and the mouseover event creating the class instance

2982733
int	chars
the reason that your code outputted a bunch of random chars is that strings are not int like most other data types but pointers

2982766
width	height
the scrollderid is the containing div with a set width and height

2982835
jqgrid	datatables
ok - i just built a quick and dirty version of the datatables and the jqgrid - loaded 1000 rows of data from an sql database and performed console.time tests in firebug

2982835
jqgrid	datatables
the results where surprisingly similar with datatables barely edging out jqgrid in some situations - not enough to choose one over the other purely on performance imo

2982836
int	chars
it may be possible to shrink the resultant int a bit smaller with some dechex conversions but ultimately you ll only save a few chars

2982857
maven	m2e
if you use m2e to import maven projects into eclipse you won t have any problems with a maven-typical nested tree

2982857
children	parent
the typical nested structure has a top down hierarchy where the parent is doing the aggregation of the modules below it and the children are inheriting values from the parent

2982885
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox but not in google-chrome and ie

2982889
subtraction	addition
you can also do everything using addition subtraction and operation

2982962
int	boolean
this turns your number into an array of boolean or int in the range 0 1 then we add functions to operate on those arrays

2982972
getter	setter
properties in objective-c have to be synthesized with the synthesize keyword to create the getter and setter methods

2982978
gmail	hotmail
most webmail clients will completely strip out any stylesheets which makes the print and forward statistics irrelevant for clients like gmail hotmail and yahoo

2982996
uiview	subviews
instead the piece should be a subclass of uiview which adds the image as a subviews to itself when it is init ed with a frame

2982996
uiview	subviews
you add it as a subviews to self because self inherits from uiview

2983012
glut	sdl
find the mouse s x and y coordinates using whatever function your windowing system glut or sdl has for that and use gluunproject to get the object coordinates that correspond to those window coordinates

2983099
xfs	ntfs	filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	xfs
although i myself have prior experience in implementing filesystems much simpler ones than ntfs xfs or ext2 i would not tackle this job

2983120
filesystems	xfs
but a recent filesystems failure btw never ever ever use xfs without a battery-backed hardware raid has me spooked and thinking of using a dvcs for all that

2983161
width	height
the size of the grid consists from width and height of number of diamonds

2983182
free	malloc
new and delete are said to be preprocessors while malloc and free are functions

2983185
free	malloc
new and delete are c++ operators like + etc. whereas malloc and free are c functions

2983202
children	parent
the owned one to many bidirectional relationship just means that the children have a reference to the parent

2983203
post	get
my requirements are to do post and get queries on a url and retrieve the result

2983206
int	double
javascript will cast all of its double values into signed 32-bit int to do the bitwise operations details here

2983227
portrait	landscape
if all are set to sensor then they will all change if one is fixed to portrait or landscape then the others must follow and whoever sets it last wins

2983250
rss	feed
but in this specific case i actually need to generate the event which will be fired every time another running thread of my app wakes up and refreshes its list of news from an rss feed

2983271
apache	nginx
i d recommend doing this on apache nginx whatever you re using though

2983294
int	double
javascript represents all numbers as 64-bit double precision ieee 754 floating point numbers see the ecmascript spec section 8.5. all positive int up to 2 53 can be encoded precisely

2983294
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome and ie i m getting the following

2983297
swt	swing	awt	swing
eclipse uses its own gui library called swt it doesn t use java s awt or swing and it needs some native non-java libraries for this

2983302
opencv	emgucv
then to process the captured images i m using a wrapper for opencv called emgucv that comes in both 32bit or 64bit flavors as well

2983302
opencv	emgucv
now being on vista64 i went for the 64bit versions of flycapture point grey s sdk and emgucv which includes opencv in its install hoping to maximize performance

2983315
udp	tcp
since i need confirmation that the clients received the information and don t want to build an ack structure for a udp connection i decided to use a tcp streaming method

2983322
put	get
i am trying to translate this code but i don t understand how to use the get put part of the code in another language like c++ or c#

2983346
int	chars
the first argument is that they are only safe for pods like int or chars passing a non-pod c++ type has undefined behaviour

2983357
put	get
get and put are simply used to read and write binary data from the file

2983367
children	parent
i didn t feel this rule before but it seems that a binary tree or any tree each node can have many children but children cannot point back to any parent then this data structure can be represented as 1 table in a database with each row having an id for itself and a parentid that points back to the parent node

2983396
post	get
this means i want to get the blog post from outside the wordpress installation using php and do a loop

2983397
hash	salt
at best you could resort to sending up a salt hash of the value along with the salt but even that in itself could be used to test guess values before actually submitting it

2983398
width	height
i set the width to wrap_content and height to fill_parent

2983398
width	height
in hierarchy viewer the width is 2 px and height is 120 px

2983402
rss	feed
yes you can use the rss feed of your blog

2983402
rss	feed
use a javascript or some server side rss client to fetch the top 5 entries from rss feed and show it on your homepage.one such script is

2983462
vb.net	vb6
i am upgrading my application from vb6 to vb.net

2983502
postgresql	mysql
mysql is reportedly not as good as postgresql for these kinds of workloads

2983509
put	get
if you put resource cleanup code in a java finalize method then it may get called at some indeterminate time in the future or never so is not recommended

2983527
children	parent
what i mean is when you move an element around the sortable parent its children the sortables skip around instead of smoothly animating to their new position which besides from being an eyesore can also make it a bit difficult to figure out what has moved where

2983547
width	height
the problem is that the stage size variables often take a few milliseconds to be set while the swf loads so if the code positioning the menu runs before they are initialized it will see a width and height of 0

2983599
ubuntu	linux
c language in linux ubuntu

2983620
vb.net	vb6
i think there should a control like databound list control of vb6 in vb.net windows form application too which can show up data from database

2983658
doc	rtf
if you want to commit such documents consider committing uncompressed variants - rtf instead of doc tex instead of pdf etc

2983658
doc	rtf
edit i just wanted to note that even rtf is horrible but not as horrible as doc

2983672
matlab	simulink
there is of course the possibility to use the mex compiler to generate c-code from matlab simulink models but we would like to avoid the associated license fees

2983704
hash	salt
i would recommend you hashing the passwords with salt and store the hash password and the salt into the database

2983708
ubuntu	linux
under windows it works well but on linux i only tried on ubuntu 10.4 so far the images aren t displayed

2983713
post	get
if you wanted to get all the post without any comments not just the ten most recent post then it would be

2983734
postgresql	mysql
on my development side i use mysql however heroku uses postgresql

2983781
getter	setter
if you follow the rules and wrap your instance variables in getter and setter you ll find yourself rarely having to write retain or release

2983901
post	get
there are also plugins to get recent post

2983908
folder	directory
update it is strange -- i just tried to look at a project i cloned using mercurial the working directory not including the .hg folder is 126mb but the .hg folder is 239mb

2983944
vb.net	vb6
i assume the same control in vb.net would be datagridview and i m fairly sure that you can probably make it look better than in vb6 but if you want really good looking ones you might want to look at thirdparty grid controls

2983953
free	malloc
don t throw calls to malloc and free all over your codebase

2983961
hash	salt
in either case it is also likely a salt hash is included which prevents the user from tampering with the cookie s data

2983979
cgpoint	cgrect
the myview.frame.origin gives you a cgpoint origin also a struct of the copied cgrect

2984016
entity-relationship	diagram
make an entity-relationship diagram

2984016
rss	feed
document each and describe the main issues for example how timezones are to be handled how this certain model is to connect to the currency service how that model is to parse and manipulate some crone file what algoritm you shall use to decide top 5 articles depending on your app. describe what libraries you use how and for what purposes example we are to use curl to scrap so and make rss feed

2984049
entity-relationship	diagram
i have drawn an entity-relationship diagram for a database projecta dn i need a software which transfers this drawing to tables

2984133
accessor	ivar	accessor	properties
there s not much to recommend one over the other except that the direct ivar access is slightly faster the properties version creates a temporary array and sends an accessor message to make the new condition create its copy of that array

2984133
profiling	instrumentation
you may want to use the property access version first then profiling your application using instrumentation to determine whether the overhead matters on hardware you care about

2984150
put	get
the service and page work fine when i test it locally from visual studio but when i put it on my staging server i get a timeoutexception

2984211
qpainter	qwidget
note that if i was using a custom qwidget instead then i would use qpainter setwindow and qpainter setviewport to create a custom mapping mode but i can t see how to do this using the graphics scene support

2984222
audiotoolbox	avfoundation
add the audiotoolbox and avfoundation frameworks to your project by right-cliking on frameworks - add - existing frameworks

2984238
for-loop	loops
the outer for-loop executes a constant number of times around 100 and the inner loops executes log2 n times

2984241
addition	multiplication
but if you use big integers for example that s not really ok anymore as addition and multiplication are no longer o 1

2984268
division	modulo
there are ways around this that actually allow use of all n slots and eliminate the division implicit in taking the index modulo n

2984286
children	parent
i have a control in my parent mdi form which i wish to be given the focus if all mdi children have closed

2984337
onfocus	onblur
you should probably use onfocus and onblur events in order to support keyboard users who tab through forms

2984396
versioning	upgrade
if you re concerned about the 4gb limit then upgrade to the new express versioning 10gb or move up an edition

2984418
pop-up	dialog
when your loading a dialog you are loading a element in the dom document object model the html elements on your page which will appear as a pop-up dialog on top of the current page

2984450
wiimote	infrared
avoid the use of the infrared sensor on the wiimote

2984504
testdriven.net	specflow
the specflow tests are run using the nunit gui which needs to be invoked externally or alternatively testdriven.net or resharper can be installed to support running the tests from inside visual studio

2984538
dataoutputstream	bytearrayoutputstream
i thought of using a dataoutputstream to solve the data writing with writeint int i and and to be able to put that into a byte array i should use bytearrayoutputstream method tobytearray

2984554
dataoutputstream	bytearrayoutputstream
use the former case - wrap dataoutputstream around the bytearrayoutputstream

2984554
dataoutputstream	bytearrayoutputstream
when you are finish close or at least flush the dataoutputstream and then use the tobytearray method of the bytearrayoutputstream

2984556
hash	md5
btw i happen to be using a different md5 hash lib the difference is not significant

2984562
portrait	landscape
possibly related i ve noticed that the button in portrait mode is slow to disappear after rotating to landscape the button appears for a second after the rotation finishes

2984562
hide	show
perhaps there is a more efficient way to show hide the master view button

2984569
outputstream	inputstream
you could use a stream approach if you connect your outputstream to an inputstream through a pipedinputstream pipetoutputstream

2984573
dataoutputstream	bytearrayoutputstream
could you make a variable to hold on to the bytearrayoutputstream and pass it into the dataoutputstream

2984577
freebsd	linux
mac os x uses the mach-o object format and freebsd uses elf like linux

2984637
postgresql	mysql
rails uses sqlite3 by default though you can edit your database.yml file to use a different adaptor mysql postgresql etc. if you d like

2984669
hex	binary
you can use the ord function to get the ascii value and then decbin and dechex to convert it to binary and hex formats

2984679
put	get
in wishcontroller# load you put three different items into the array so of course if in wishlistcontroller# tableview numberofrowsinsection you return data count as the number of rows you get three rows

2984680
mouseleave	mouseenter
a hover event which is actually shorthand for two events mouseenter and mouseleave is added to all elements with the picturetrigger class

2984680
mouseleave	mouseenter
the two functions represent the mouseenter and mouseleave events respectively

2984680
hide	show
the event handler functions find the img with the id myimage and show hide it

2984715
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
all s well in firefox and google-chrome but safari and opera aren t displaying the plotted points

2984728
put	get
so i put in the debug statement to get the database version and it is zero

2984762
implements	extends
i want to implements an activity that extends the base folder activity at the very least i want to add the ability to rearrange items in folders but i can t figure out the class name.

2984770
nsobject	nsmanagedobject
any property of nsobject or nsmanagedobject

2984770
nsobject	nsmanagedobject
any method name of nsobject or nsmanagedobject which does not take a parameter

2984803
mouse	keyboard
ideally i do not want to handle all possible mouse and keyboard events

2984832
junit	cactus
my guide is the apache cactus framework with junit and tomcat jboss etc.

2984862
.htaccess	httpd.conf
this goes in your root .htaccess but if you have access to httpd.conf that is better

2984879
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome at least the timeout starts from when the user clicks ok

2984885
stateless	stateful
anyway i ll assume you are using stateless session beans since you said i could use stateful beans which by definition are stateless

2984930
put	get
i have put the following configuration in my web.config to get rid of the problem

2984941
content-disposition	content-type
i m using x-accel-redirect so implicitly nginx content-type and content-disposition to download a file everything works great

2984966
copying	overwrite
i updated a table in my sql server 2008 by accident i was updating a table from another by copying cell by cell but i have overwrite the original table

2984983
opencv	emgucv
after much testing it turns out that the x86 opencv + emgucv combo performs 1.408 times slower than x64 on a test using a sequence of 14 different typical opencv methods smoothing image copying image format conversion etc.

2985014
post	get
i ve noticed three main ways python web frameworks deal request handing decorators controller classes with methods for individual requests and request classes with methods for get post

2985045
serializable	deserialization
something in the serializable deserialization seams not to work

2985067
integer	unsigned
typically when you build a custom protocol on the top of tcp ip you use a simple message format where first 4 bytes is an unsigned integer containing the message length and the rest is the message data

2985085
put	get
if you put the if statement at the top then when it executes there would not yet be anything defined with the name func so you would get an error

2985101
maven	pom.xml
i know my hibernate.reveng.xml is being read by hibernate3-maven-plugin as i experience maven errors whenever syntax errors appear in the file so pom.xml seems to be correct and hibernate.reveng.xml syntactically correct

2985147
implements	sealed
alternatively you can try and mock an interface that the sealed class implements that only your code consumes

2985156
vmware	virtualbox
the vm mentioned in here is not like in vmware or virtualbox it is more like java virtual machine jvm as well as python and ruby

2985180
profiler	yourkit
if you think you have a memory leak garbage collection not kicking in due to references not being released then a profiler such as yourkit may be of use

2985205
google-chrome	firefox
it s working in firefox but for some reason it s not working in ie and google-chrome strange combination

2985205
google-chrome	firefox
like i said the videos are changing perfectly in firefox but in ie and google-chrome nothing happens

2985210
width	height
i assume depth is based on the stage s width and height and that is why assigning the same depth of the same display object appars mismatched with different stage sizes

2985222
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
for some reason in firefox only not in google-chrome opera or safari being on osx i haven t tried ie there s a conflict between yahoo css grids and swfobject

2985231
free	malloc
but if you malloc don t forget to free

2985241
apache	nginx
i ve read that using nginx as a reverse proxy allows running apache and nginx on the same box

2985243
postgresql	mysql
also as i learned today heroku offers postgresql instead of mysql for rails apps

2985245
wordpress	joomla
look at some of the sample sites for wordpress joomla etc

2985268
post	get
get or post this allows ioloop to

2985268
pylons	cherrypy
for example i wrote a methoddispatcher for tornado that makes it work more like pylons well i had cherrypy in mind when i wrote it

2985295
addition	multiplication
i d suggest selecting a chunk size dynamically for each multiplication in order to keep each column addition in memory

2985320
int	boolean
if you define setfoo int and setfoo int boolean there will be no property foo in your class

2985323
gtk	ncurses
for example i want to use qt gtk or even ncurses as a building block for my user interface for the same application

2985328
hash	salt
to prevent people from using rainbow-tables or brute force to guess which number you hash you can always add a salt

2985329
post	get
get and post are the two most common but there are several others including head

2985407
daemons	systemd
i m trying to write a perl script that will work better with kde s kwrited which as far as i can tell is connected to a pts and puts every line it receives through the kde systemd tray notifications with the title kde write daemons

2985450
ubuntu	debian
both use debian packages and ubuntu is based on debian but is more user friendly

2985450
ubuntu	linux
i d recommend ubuntu if your new to linux on a desktop

2985451
ant	maven
this has the advantage that all the junit tools work seamlessly specifically ant maven most ide s and continuous integration tools

2985453
getter	setter
for instance you can generate getter setter like in lombok at compile-time or use a dynamic proxy that do that at run-time

2985456
ubuntu	debian
remember that ubuntu is based on debian so it works the same

ubuntu	linux
ubuntu is the more user-friendly of the two i think ubuntu is actually one of the most newbie-friendly linux distros so if you are new to linux ubuntu is the way to go

2985486
client-side	server-side
as shown in the example in msdn s button.onclientclick property page onclientclick will call client-side script while onclick will call the server-side script

2985533
ubuntu	debian
since ubuntu is based on debian development is almost exactly the same for both

2985533
ubuntu	debian
the fundamental difference is that debian follows a free software ideology while ubuntu sacrifices that purity for practicality when no free equivalent exists for important proprietary software

2985533
ubuntu	debian
if you choose debian you will have a choice of distribution series unstable testing that may get you newer releases of pre-packaged software a few months sooner than ubuntu

2985533
ubuntu	debian
the ubuntu bug reporting tracking system is far more user friendly than debian s

2985557
width	height
we want to keep the same height width ratio

2985557
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png
if we can convert gif bmp jpg png to one standard format it would be greate

2985558
disk	ram
with 7 free hard disk your server is probably running out of space to page out memory from either your process or other processes hence it has to keep everything in ram and therefore you are unable to allocate additional memory more often than on the server with 50 free space

2985562
width	height
for example i want to crop 100x200px box from image or i want to make thumbnail with width or height not bigger then 300 width or 500 height pixels

put	get
to get the results you want you could either put the data in the cell as a string in whatever format you choose or you could divide by 100.0 before you store the value in the cell

2985694
winpcap	pcap.net	winpcap	libpcap	libpcap	pcap.net
in pcap.net i use pcap_stats_ex but it s probably only available on winpcap and not on libpcap

2985704
mockito	jmock
jmock and mockito both work well

2985704
junit	testng
you ll need to use them in conjunction with a test framework such as junit or testng

when i drag the draggable div on the droppable divs i want to find which droppable has been affected

2985721
int	chars
i would like to allow the entering of int values only no floats no other chars

2985725

uiview	subviews
i have a catiledlayer that is used to display a pdf page this catiledlayer is the layer type of my uiview which is a subviews of a uiscrollview

2985778
disk	ram
the index in memory and on disk too takes 4 bytes per line of the textfile being indexed and performance should scale in a perfectly linear way so if you had about 100 million lines 4.4 gb i would expect about 4-5 minutes to build the index a minute to extract and print out three arbitrary lines and the 400 mb of ram taken for the index should not inconvenience even a small machine -- even my tiny slow laptop has 2gb after all

2985795
children	parent
as a practical solution i would build an inverted search tree with pointers from the children to the parent where each pointer is marked whether it is coming from a left or right child

2985797
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
basicly what i need for the program to do is to act a as simple fraction calculator for addition subtraction multiplication and division for the a single line of input for example

2985808
put	get
however when i put the require statement require sunlight in sunlight.rb in config initializers i get the following error

2985831
mousemove	mouseup
instead of just waiting for mousemove you can also wait for the mouseup event - in the first case you can continue moving and in the second case you can return from the loop and stop drag drop this is actually discussed later in the book in section 16.4.5

2985833
printf	strcpy
so rats will report every call to strcpy strcat printf but these can be safe if for instance you are just copying static text

2985898
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
one idea is to create four functions add subtract multiplying divide like this one

2985899
inherited	properties
to include a .vsprops file in a visual studio 2008 project one could right-click the project icon in the solution explorer panel choose properties go to the configuration properties | general section and modify the inherited project properties sheets properties to contain a list of .vsprops paths

2985899
inherited	properties
the inherited project properties sheets properties seems to have been removed

here at the top right you can see the navigation to the site in ff3 win 7 firefox safari mac some menu items show 1 char on a seperate line to the rest of the menu item

2986116
width	height
but if that were the case then i d think width height and bpp would all be radically wrong and it wouldn t look as correct as it does

2986130
mapquest	directions
mapquest s directions api is http querystring based i m not sure if it s entirely restful

2986136
put	get
i can t get a page to display in the navigationplaceholder the placeholder i put in the white box but thats because the actual page is frontpage.aspx and not whateverisinthenavigationplaceholder.aspx

2986200
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
working with firefox 3.6.3 google-chrome 5.0.375.55 opera 10.53

2986216
pull	push
it s an imperfect replacement for git s push it mirrors the local repo instead of merging it with the remote so make sure the local repo is up to date with git pull first

2986252
post	get
in the script above only the post parameters get sent and the get query is ignored

2986263
google-chrome	firefox
finally figured out something that works in ie firefox and google-chrome

2986263
google-chrome	firefox
it seems a little unusual to do it this way but it works in ie8 firefox google-chrome so it sounds good to me

2986337
put	get
from semi-related examples online i put together the following service but get the error onkeydown is undefined for the type service

2986378
super	implements
it better than it will see it in a while since he started to use the app because a need fro it is rare because you implements a super duper merging logic that asks user only in very special cases.

2986384
width	height
what i really want to do is have a view that s maybe 70 of the width and height that lays over the normal view as a modal

2986397
inherited	subclassing
if you have control over all of the object types that you will be using dynamically another option would be to force them to inherited from a subclassing of the dynamicobject class that is tailored to not fail when a method that does not exist is invoked

2986432
width	height
i think that your tab container has been created successfully but you don t give it a size so it appears to be zero width and zero height

2986445
folder	directory
if you don t like the default installation directory you can install to a custom location instead and export a pythonpath environment variable whose value is the path of the installed package s parent folder

2986471
bazaar	git
pip lets you install files gives a url to the subversion git mercurial or bazaar repository

2986480

i use std ostream operator and a simple function that will quote a string if necessary

2986496
tesseract	tessnet2
you could try the tessnet2 a .net 2.0 open source ocr assembly using tesseract engine

2986500
maven	pom.xml
but btw i am very wary of anything that uses maven because most people like spring who write the maven scripts and pom.xml don t have the expertise to write it in a way that would spew out messages and verbosity appropriately to make it easy for me to locate model errors

2986503
vim	emacs
programs like emacs and vim demand that you invest time and effort before they start paying off

2986508
hide	show
yeah i could open a window with a pink background show the thumbnail take a screenshot then hide this temporary window but thats a horrible user experience and a complete hack i would rather not have my name on

2986509
free	malloc
if i was making a high performance version i d look into caching some smaller sized arrays as malloc and free tend to be slow

2986528

saturday dateadd dd 7 - datepart dw getdate getdate

2986713
hide	show
i have gotten to the point where i can hide or show all s the obvious easy part but i am not sure how to go about targeting each since every website has different id s for them while still using the tag

2986717
versioning	upgrade
you may want to try increasing your versioning number to force an upgrade

2986720
hide	show
that will allow you to itterate through the collection and gather data about them show hide etc

2986732
range	max
so range 0 len temp 2 returns an array with the range like range start max steps

2986755
hide	show
the basics are that it s just a textinput control where you use the popupmanager to show hide a list object depending on the user action click typing etc...

2986794
postgresql	mysql
it looks like mysql uses concat postgresql || oracle concat or || t-sql +

2986797

in a python program i m writing i ve compared using a for-loop and increment variables versus list comprehension with map itemgetter and len when counting entries in dictionary which are in a list

2986970
affinity	processors	cpu	processors	cpu	affinity
some operating systems have no sense of thread affinity - they don t care what processors a thread is running on - so when time comes to re-evaluate what resources are being used several times a second at least they ll move a thread process from one core cpu to another

2986988
mp3	wav
or convertion from mp3 wav to pcm

2987266
jar	war
i have a war and jar project in my eclipse-based jsf project

2987266
jar	war
the war project has all of my .xhtml files as well as the project s faces-config.xml my jar project has all of my faces related java code action beans managed beans custom converters etc.

2987283
gridview	rowdatabound
i m going to guess that the reason it doesn t work is because rowdatabound fires before the gridview actually gets the data

2987303
cos	sin
i can find rotation angle by the matrix cos î sin î -sin î cos î 0 0 but i could not get the exact coordinates of rotated textframe

2987326
hide	show
the difference between the 2 states is that i hide show some labels

2987339
google-chrome	safari
in webkit browsers i tested both google-chrome and safari the overflow hidden cuts the text outside the border

2987378
lan	localhost
in either case its best to just go around the proxy if the hg is on the local localhost lan network

2987424
queue	fifo
although i am not sure why you need to wait since i think the queue implementaion will pick the tasks in order of their submission ie it will be fifo and hence the tasks should get executed when you invoke msgqueue.get in the order of their submission

2987447
button	checkbox
hey guys quick question i have a checkbox system where a list of items can be checked and deleted on the click of a button

2987478

trie	tree
place the words in a tree trie or radix placing a number of occurrences counter for each full word so you know which nodes are endings and how common they are

2987585
zipoutputstream	zipfile
if you re creating the zipfile from scratch use zipoutputstream instead of zipfile

2987585
zipoutputstream	zipfile
i m not sure if zipoutputstream supports adding to an existing zipfile so if that s what you re doing i m afraid i don t have a useful answer

2987616
mp3	wav
maybe peter morris converting wav to mp3 and back could help

2987640
getter	setter
the flow is something like you call the setter - flex updates the data by calling the getter

2987672
viewdidload	viewdidappear
when i load my viewcontroller i used viewdidload method to init my view but this take much time to make the view appeared .so i had the idea to use viewdidappear method to accelerate the appearance of my view but the load of the informations about my view are now loaded to the memory every time that i push my view which is normal or i pop to it and there is my problem

2987693
inherited	subclassing
you can subclassing the httpapplication class instead and inherited from that in code so in your supporting library do something like this

2987709
getter	setter
some other comments a class that has setter getter for all the attributes is hardly encapsulated

2987731
stateless	stateful
stateless conversions work for short strings but may fail if you try to convert a data chunk greater that streambuf internal buffer size utf is essentially stateful encoding

2987737
pull	push
if multiple users work push pull simultaneously

2987740
post	get
not really a security issue an attacker can craft any get post request he wants anyway and even send it from a legitimate user s browser via csrf but a maintenance problem because accidentally a cookie value can overwrite a request parameter

2987740
post	get
you should accept only post for requests which change data or internal state and get for everything else

2987788
interpolation	splines
you might also want to consider splines interpolation which could be more accurate

2987792
google-chrome	firefox
when loading it in firefox google-chrome the page gets loaded gradually

2987792
google-chrome	firefox
we have one laptop on which ie8 loads the page like firefox google-chrome and we ve been searching for a setting on ie8 to indicate that it doesn t have to wait until all javascript is executed before showing the page or part of it

2987797
jboss	resin
current implementations are jboss weld apache openwebbeans and resin candi

2987802
division	multiplication
bit-shifting operators are very rarely used as a replacement for arithmetic operators for example you should never use shifts to perform multiplication division by constant

2987834
valgrind	memcheck
jl ubuntu work dsr_analysis valgrind --tool memcheck --leak-check yes . test

2987834

free	malloc
28940 address 0x0 is not stack d malloc d or recently free d

i doubt anyone would ever think using bit shift operations for int or double as a regular day-to-day thing is a good idea

2987843
hash	md5
it shows how to calculate md5 hash in objective-c

2987865

2987933
apache	nginx
i m trying to move from apache + passenger to nginx + passenger on my ubuntu lucid lynx box

2987937
subtraction	add
because + is for concentration if you want to add two numbers you should parse them first parseint and - sign is for subtraction

2987945
listview	gridview
also the listview control is a very good alternative to the gridview as it provides many of the databinding selection paging sorting modifying features of the gridview see here but gives full control over the output template

2987968
int	chars
the type of the expression must be chars byte short int chars byte short int or an enum type or a compile-time error occurs

2988072
portrait	landscape
my application starts in the portrait mode and then eventually switches to the landscape one

2988072
portrait	landscape
what is strange is that when switching back from landscape to portrait mode onorientationchanged callback is called twice and what s even worse - the second call is dealing with bad context - findviewbyid method starts returning null

2988083
changeset	cherry-pick
if its some following commits that you aren t ready to port yet you can of course use rather than cherry-pick to retain the history cleanly - future merges are also smart about not duplicating commits changeset

2988095
versioning	upgrade
you should change your ftp and mysql passwords upgrade to the latest versioning of joomla currently 1.5.18 and check all of your components and plugins for vulnerabilities in this list

also neither safari nor firefox treated your third case as nested title tags instead viewing it as one title tag containing the literal string

2988223
firefox	safari
neither firefox nor safari treated your third case as nested title tags instead viewing it as one title tag containing the literal string

2988224
post	get
embperl provides fdat hash which contains full set of form data passed via either post or get

2988224
post	get
fdat makes no distinction of whether the value originated in get s query string or form field via post

2988224
post	get
if you absolutely must have only the values from get s query_string here s a simple example of a function to get it - although why would you want to separate get from post data is escaping me at the moment

2988256
int	boolean
note that the add method is generically typed boolean add e o so in your case of set the add method will take a short whereas the remove method is not generically typed boolean remove object o so i - 1 autoboxes to a int

2988279
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
my solution to this is to not use the preview handlers instead i use mousedown mousemove and mouseup

2988398
icomparer	iequalitycomparer
ms documentation seems to suggest that i should use stringcomparer which implements both iequalitycomparer and icomparer but this only seems to support the ignorecase option from compareoptions and not ignorekanatype ignoresymbols ignorewidth etc

2988410
getter	setter
just setting request and connection in constructor and having getter setter for them

2988467
width	height
the ratio for width is 4.14 rw and the ratio for height is 4.17 rh

2988477
getter	setter
rozer i guess you mean why the class is marked serializable and no functionality related to serialization is put there except getter and setter

2988482
post	get
i want to get the post from the articles.example.com and movies.example.com to show up in the main site at example.com

2988526
strlen	substr
than means mb_strlen instead of strlen mb_substr instead of substr and etc

2988536
maven	m2e
then either a install m2e and then import the project using import existing maven project you should be up and running

2988550
int	double
you can not assign null values to .net value types structs including c# primitive types like int and double so in .net 2.0 there is concept of nullable type is added to assign null value

2988585
children	parent
if you use rarouå â method then you will have to update path entries in your table for all the children when the parent path changes

2988610

portrait	landscape
to the activity tag of every activity that you don t want to restart on a change from landscape to portrait mode

2988611
portrait	landscape
but be carefull this will only work if you use the same layout file for portrait and landscape mode

2988612
versioning	upgrade
it is not at all possible to use wpc and wcf using 2.0 if you want to use those concepts then you need to upgrade your dot net versioning to 4.0 so that you can use all facilities of .net

2988685
int	double
columns properties of this data are user definable and are of the usual data types string int double date

2988685
filtering	grouping
to be able to filtering grouping the data and perform aggregations

2988753
rvm	bundler
you could use bundler or rvm s gemsets to make the i18n gem unavailable from within your app

2988776
spaces	delimiter
i basically first split the line by using the as delimiter then i split again using the s+ which basically splits a string and return an array containing the words that were separated by white spaces

2988789
put	get
will get you the list and modify the required column and then can be put into the select statement

2988812

you should know that there re different implementations of the heap such as raw windows heap accessed by heapalloc heapfree or crt-wrapped malloc free or new delete

2988850
google-chrome	firefox
window.location works for me in google-chrome as well as in firefox

2988867

2989078
db4o	eloquera
i might argue with carl regarding db4o the easiest database on the market since eloquera can do the same things from api perspective

2989144

for more information click here - but note that this is only supported by very few good browsers firefox safari - maybe opera - but no ie until some day ie9 comes...

2989461
subtract	add
however when you add or subtract a number from a pointer the compiler takes the size of the data into consideration thus in your case assuming the size of int is 4 bytes a+1 will be bigger than a by 4 because you move the pointer one integer ahead but a+1 would be bigger by 40 because you more the pointer one array of 10 integers ahead

2989478
innodb	myisam
and from myisam to innodb

2989874
plot	heatmap
i m trying to plot heatmap in ggplot2 using csv data following casbon s solution in

portrait	landscape
i have a portrait app with a button when pressed video must play landscape

2989957
hide	show
what i wanted to see was what would happen if the socket receives data faster than the browser-side script handles it for instance receiving 2 requests per second after receiving which browser should show and hide a gif animation for half a second without interrupting it and if they try to modify the same array so i did a few tests

2989957
opera	firefox
in case of multiple functions inserting values into an array and a single one popping them and clearing their intervals when there is too much data in the said array it worked as if the browser uses a fifo method to handle when to execute those functions i don t know if different browsers handle this in different ways i used firefox and opera they won t interrupt the function which is being executed

2989992
bmp	png
can be used through the terminal to convert from input format gdl etc. to output format png bmp html etc. â

2990191
width	height
how it is setup is a mapview inside of a frame layout also using fill parent for the height and width but with an offset down the screen

2990217
hide	show
define the columns at design time then simply show hide the columns you actually need want the user to see

2990253
hide	show
it s quite straight forward if you always hide show all rows

2990253
hide	show
more tricky if you show hide specific rows

strlen	substr
strlen substr etc

2990276
firefox	safari
at first looking at my server logs made me believe it affected only firefox 3.6.3 but i ve found an example of safari being afflicted as well

2990325
post	get
once i truly grokked the web part lifecycle things became much simpler for me and finally taught me why in java portlets they went with the post redirect get cycle to try and avoid this very granular coordination between various portlets on a page

2990336
expression-blend	silverlight
i m using the mvvm light toolkit and silverlight 3.0 without expression-blend

mri	rubinius	ironruby	rubinius	jruby	mri	jruby	rubinius
but that is actually not the case in current implementations i tested mri yarv rubinius jruby and ironruby

2990723
accessor	properties
the synthesized accessor for properties are supposed to manage retention and if you release anywhere else you can easily make the instance think it has a properties object it does not

2990727
width	height
to do this i need to iterate over the rows draw lines iterate over the columns calculate width height wrap the contents if contents do not fit on one line etc

2990730
getter	setter
by creating a class interface you avoid the need to write a bunch of getter and setter

2990730
getter	setter
if you really need to generate public getter and setter for all or even most of your attributes probably better is to just make it a struct then no such generation is needed

2990751
children	parent
you can t have a 2-way lists children in trees pointing to their parent etc

2990767
nfa	dfa
placed on the size of the nfa dfa needed to describe a regular language

2990767
nfa	dfa
provide a short-hand mechanism to specify what would otherwise lead to very large complex nfa dfa

2990767
nfa	dfa
an nfa dfa does not stack state information so cannot

2990767
nfa	dfa
so given a non-recursive language definition there will be some nfa dfa but

2990792
children	parent
to answer the question in your title yes you can create nodes which have links to their parent as well as their children

2990804
nsstatusbar	nsstatusitem	nsmenu	nsstatusbar	nsmenu	nsstatusitem
so i have done it pragmatically - declaring an nsstatusitem adding it to the nsstatusbar and then giving it a nsmenu object

2990844
vim	emacs
pretty much like vim emacs windows linux kind of debates

2990863
datamapper	activerecord
if you come from the validation in the model camp - does model mean oop representation of data activerecord datamapper as entity to borrow the ddd terminology - in which case you would i assume want all model classes to inherit common validation constraints

2990870
post	get
the fact that c has high accuracy while accepting 80 of the post tells us that overall spam must be surprisingly low -- if spam overall was the same 40 as for a then c would have to accept half of it even if he was perfect on always accepting non-spam to get the overall 80 accept rate and that would be hardly high accuracy

2990874
filtering	grouping
these users belong to an spgroup which includes users who should not see this data so in this particular case i cannot filtering based off of grouping membership

2990887
uiview	subviews
i create a custom view in cocoa touch that is superclassed by uiview and in my main controller i initialize it and then add it as a subviews to the main view but when i add it to the main view it calls my initializer method again and causes an infinite loop

minizinc	prolog
examples of cp systems that have an associated language are eclipse sicstus prolog cp package comet minizinc .

i want to get these variables through post and print them

2991026
innodb	myisam
method innodb myisam

2991067
disk	ram
an outofmemoryexception is more likely to indicate fragmentation in your page file - not that you are out of ram or disk space

2991067
disk	ram
it is generally wrongly assumed that the page file is used as a swap disk - that ram overflow is written to the page file

2991131
public	protected
a solution that works in a similar way to publish private protected public properties that works for methods

2991167
freemarker	velocity
i ve used freemarker velocity and stringtemplate

2991168
google-chrome	firefox
if you examine the resulting dom via firebug in firefox or dev tools in google-chrome etc. you can get an idea of what the resulting structure is

2991193
post	get
we ve found one of the best indicators of spam is the number of external links in a post comment since the whole point of the spam is to get you to go somewhere and buy something and or make the friendly googlebot think the linked-to page is more interesting

2991214
crypto++	botan
take a look at botan or crypto++

2991218
datamodel	powerdesigner

post	get
i ve tried some things to work around this problem different methods get and post explicitly giving a connection keep-alive to the response with the following php code at the beginning of my script

2991388
minimum	max
so you can see from this that the absolute minimum ratio you d be able to achieve using the more simplistic math of total data size max row size is approximately 139 bytes per row

2991410
width	height
the length of the grid lines must span well over half the width and height of the image

2991419

int integer 4 bytes -2 147 483 648 to +2 147 483 647 0 to 4 294 967 295 unsigned

2991421
client-side	server-side
the .jar on the client-side and server-side are different resulting in two versions of the class to be deployed which are considered different

2991421
implements	extends
encoderimpl extends unicastremoteobject implements encodeinterface

2991442
thin	unicorn
you could use thin or unicorn with nginx

2991459
norton	mcafee
i use dll injection since years in different version of operation system from windows nt 4.0 till windows 7 and i had no time any problem with any virus scanner inclusive both norton and mcafee in different versions

2991462
g++	gcc
these days i use flex bison generated some codes to develop a sql-parser alike tools these code can t compiled silently may be this another topic in vs2005 but gcc g++ works well then i compiled these code with mingw in dll in windows xp and then linked these function facades in vs2005 but it seems can t link the dll during linking

2991462
g++	gcc
but with gcc g++ you do not need to do such boring things just use ar you can get these apis so my .h file do not add call protocol and no .def just like common function declaration

2991470
accessor	properties
if you don t do anything special with a transient properties then in most cases the synthesized accessor will manage the properties s object life-cycle for you

2991484
versioning	upgrade
have a look at the onupgrade method from the notepad demo as you need to write some code that handles what happens when your db tries to upgrade itself it will do this when you change the db versioning number

2991490
antialiasing	transparent
if i had to guess i d say that when underlying pixels are transparent the text renderer draws any antialiasing gray pixels as solid black

2991520
x86	64bit
in x86 a stack frame is the area between the stack pointer s value sp esp or rsp for 16 32 or 64bit and the base pointer s value bp ebp or rbp

btw i found a directory org.apache.axis_1.4.0.v200905122109 in my plugins folder but that is old stuff

2991596
getter	setter
if method1 2 access private fields of tbase then you should have properties or getter setter to those field in tbase

2991624
min	max
you would visit each node you possibly could and keep track of the max and min points for the object

2991627
antialiasing	transparent
antialiasing cannot work when on a transparent background

2991633
hide	show
my expect script show password user in clear text and i want to hide it

2991639
lisp	smalltalk
ruby and python are for those that preferred pascal or smalltalk to c like lisp etc

2991732

then in your oncreate execute the create table and onupgrade do whatever you need to do to upgrade without checking the versioning this method will only get called when sqlite has already checked this for you

2991755
int	double
these types include the exact numeric data types int smallint decimal and numeric as well as the approximate numeric data types float real and double precision

2991779
post	get
after messing with your post on fiddle i get this to work

2991829
subscript	superscript
there are also superscript and subscript characters available in unicode that could be used

2991857
dateadd	datepart
dateadd datepart number date

2991927
dlsym	dlopen
the problem comes in that the a library also defines a function af defined in a afort.f that is intended to by dynamically loaded loadlibrary getprocaddress on windows and dlopen dlsym on linux

2992055
postgresql	mysql
current_timestamp is ansi standard and works on oracle mysql postgresql sql server.

2992119
x86	64bit
i could not find a download link for 64bit jdk jre 5.0 for windows x86

2992119
x86	64bit

inherited properties are also enumerated

2992362
hide	show
try adjusting the display property of the form using hide and show

2992366
fadein	hide	fadein	fadeout	hide	fadeout	hide	show	slideup	slidedown
you could use any number of jquery plugins and methods for showing the form including show hide fadein fadeout slideup slidedown as above etc

2992367
width	height
as you might have guessed the x option lets you determine the width in pixels of the output and y does the same for the height

2992374
hide	show
if you want to show and hide using same link use the slidetoggle instead

2992380
keystore	jks
there is a private key that is installed on the server and a public certificate file was exported from the jks keystore file

2992392
hide	show
you could then either dynamically add the appropriate control a quote control or an order control to your ui or have both controls already added and just show hide them as appropriate

2992402
put	get
it may take a bit of time to set up the first time around but i think you will get a much higher quality of data that is put in for testing

2992437
codeigniter	kohana
i ve been looking at codeigniter although i know that kohana is a branch out

2992473
fflush	gets
then i learned that there s some fflush close action going on in the response object before it gets to the filter so if i want to manipulate the data i need to extend httpservletresponsewrapper and pass that to filterchain.dofilter

2992540
google-chrome	safari
this works in ff3.6 and ie8 but not in webkit google-chrome or iphone safari

2992551
pop-up	dialog
my problem is that the stream.publish always shows up in a pop-up window instead of an on page dialog

2992555
codeigniter	kohana
i was doing research saw kohana was a branch of codeigniter codeigniter and supposed to be better

2992558
hash	md5
i m java guy so i would use md5 to hash which means i get id like mysum + 32 characters

2992669
google-chrome	safari
i d recommend testing in safari first and google-chrome second

2992725
google-chrome	firefox
everything looks as desired in firefox but google-chrome reveals my unknown blunder somewhere

2992725
google-chrome	safari
incidentally explorer shows the tool tip as expected although i m getting a funky bottom margin issue below the names and safari has the same issue as google-chrome must be a webkit rendering setting that i need to accommodate for

2992749
cvs	svn
maven jsp validation javascript editing or validation cvs or svn mylyn spring or hibernate natures app servers like a bundled tomcat glassfish etc j2ee tools or anything of the like

2992759
opencv	emgucv
opencv also has c and c++ bindings or you can use emgucv for a .net wrapper

2992768
glassfish	weblogic	jboss	weblogic	jboss	glassfish
however in the main they are so the small incompatibilities would be much easier to fix if you changed application server vendors than attempting to move the architecture you described to a glassfish jboss or weblogic server

2992779
stateless	stateful
2 ejbs are stateless beans stateful beans and message driven beans

2992813
client-side	server-side
recently i updated a crystal report that was doing all of its work on the client-side selects formulas etc and changed all of the logic to be done on the server-side through stored procedures using an oracle 11g database

2992814
mouseover	mouseout
i assume the qtip disappears on mouseout so no need to remove anything since it will be replaced on next mouseover

2992822
stdout	stderr
for non-interactive use it s often best to write stdout and stderr to log files

2992822
stdout	stderr
one way to do this is to write a wrapper script that checks for the underlying command logs the commandline redirects stdout and stderr and closes stdin if you want to be careful then execs the commandline

2992852
stdout	stderr
all its standard io stdin stdout stderr operations will be redirected to the parent process through three streams getoutputstream getinputstream geterrorstream

2992859
int	boolean
if you re using a language that supports boolean you should use the boolean not an int ie

2992859
int	boolean
there is really very little reason in most modern languages to ever use an int for a boolean operation

2992876
int	boolean
when using int as boolean i prefer to interpret them as follows false 0 true non-zero

2992884
int	boolean
in language where int that are not 0 represents the boolean value true and 0 false like c i will tend to use because it represents the same meaning as if int whereas represents more the int value being equal to 1 rather than the boolean true

2992884
int	boolean
in languages that support the boolean type always use it rather than int

2992896
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i found a pretty decent solution with html5media - but ran across an issue with a jquery dropdown falling behind the the swf object this only happens on firefox ie - works fine on safari google-chrome because it s loading mp4 instead of a swf object

2992901
folder	directory
i have set up a subfolder under my public_html directory called domains where i create a folder for each separate website

2992980
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox is really friendly to a lot of validation errors but google-chrome and safari seem to be much more strict

2992990
post	get
you can use standard a http post or get to send the request to your server

2993021
profiling	benchmarking
if you want to monitor the performance health of programs benchmarking and profiling that measure are probably what you want

2993036
client-side	server-side
a server-side controller would then handle the request appropriately and the client-side would know what data to expect when it returned

2993040
google-chrome	safari
for webkit browsers however google-chrome safari the search input is styled as a client created html wrapper for the internal webcore cocoa nssearchfield

2993065
put	get
these escape functions take care of any characters that might be malicious and you will still get your data in the same way you put it in there

2993094
free	realloc
changing the buffer size affects this issue in some strange ways - sometimes it crashes on the realloc and other times on the free

2993101
width	height
source image is 400w x 600h and thumbnail size needs to be 100w x 225h - the output image will be 100w x 225h and the images will be vertically centered with a width of 100 the maximum and height 150 with a top and bottom border of 37.5 pixels

2993133
free	realloc
the call to realloc here can potentially free the old buffer before returning the new one

2993178
setinterval	settimeout
rather than setinterval you could use settimeout and set it within your oncomplete handler within the ajaxfunction

2993189
pull	push
if i were in your position though i d keep the central code in one branch do my dev in another branch then have scripts which would push pull as appropriate

2993234
int	chars
here is that code adapted for chars instead of int with some example data

2993267
implements	extends
if you are extends a listactivity then you can implements the onlistitemclick method

the environment it has to work on is centos with python 2.4 but i m testing on cygwin with python 2.5 so it could be that it fails on my machine but will work on the linux one the linux machine is very slow and this error is rare so i haven t been able to get it on there

2993488
post	put
this form has a post put action to search_set

2993488
put	get
at this point if the user simply hits enter on the location bar i get an error that says no action responded to show i am guessing because the url contains search_set which uses a put method and even though i have a search_show get action which simply reruns the search in the session or saved in the database does not get called

x86	64bit
as for any cpu versus x86 this is a problem only on a 64bit computer

2993663
x86	64bit
the solution is to build the application targeting x86 as that forces the jit compiler to generate 32-bit code even on a 64bit machine and thus ensures compatibility with the dll you wish to call

2993726
kde	gnome
if i recall correctly both gnome and kde will do this by default

subtract	add
you can either do as mark byers suggests and subtract an interval or use the date type which does allow you to add subtract integers

2993949
free	malloc
call every destructor and do a c style free if you are using malloc and placement new

2993996
for-loop	arrays
all of the suggestions have been helpful but since i can only mark one answer as the correct one i will give it to durandal for both suggesting arrays optimizations and being the only one to precalculate the for-loop header

2994013

2994324
awt	swing
behavior pure java design allows for a greater range of behavior for swing components since they are not limited by the native peers that awt uses

2994324
awt	swing
performance swing components are generally slower and buggier than awt due to both the fact that they are pure java and to video issues on various platforms

2994648
int	double
you could have a struct with a type field and an union field containing a string double bool and int

2994648

then you could write an operator ostream youtype overload which first reads the string from the ostream and tries to convert it to the most specific type 1 becomes an int 1.0 a double and so on .

2994658
button	checkbox
this is my selectall button code..on clicking this i am selecting all checkbox

2995762
post	get
in your ashx you need to get the data from reading the post data.

2995828

type adb shell and check contents with the ls command if there s a folder sdcard then you can use other commands to push and pull files

2995981

the put works fine but the get accumulates in my opinion way to much cpu time

2995985
puts	gets
no gets and puts system calls please in the name of the lord

2996023
getter	setter
so you can access the array value into the another file so you need to set an array by setter method and where you want that array you just use getter method

2996026
stdout	stderr
be aware that if the bash script creates a lot of output you must use communicate or something similar to prevent stdout or stderr to become stuffed

2996040
int	double
you d have to explicitly define what types you re using it for and would have to typedef things like unsigned int or double complex or the token paste won t work

2996058
width	height
i am designing a website that has 100 width + height div containing a graphic overlaying the home page

2996078
put	get
if you have a session running you could also consider putting the query string into a session variable with a random small number and put that random number into the get string

2996142

2996254
gtk	gdk
critical section in which gdk and gtk

2996269
hash	md5

2996280
jobs	cron
i know i could use just simple timers but i ve to use cron jobs using quartz

2996288
superclass	subclassing
the best way is giving the superclass a constructor that takes the string as an argument so the subclassing don t forget filling out the value

2996295
hide	show
instead of showing then hiding hide then show

2996332
google-chrome	safari

2996350
post	get
i ve tried to convert the post variable to utf-8 by using iconv but i get only question marks

the best practice is to define an abstract get-method at the abstract super class interface

2996377
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works great with firefox 3.6.3 google-chrome can deal with it fine although not so fast as firefox but new safari gives a awful experience distorting all content if you do fast resizing

2996381
versioning	upgrade
so you have three options either upgrade your rails versioning or override the to_d method or just use bigdecimal.new 28.04 instead of to_d

2996399
google-chrome	firefox
i came up with the following idea which only works with firefox ie and google-chrome say nan

2996457
jdom	dom4j
any library like jdom or dom4j will allow you to do this

2996465
width	height
you can use .resize to get every time the width height actually changes like this

2996465
width	height
you can view a working demo here it takes the new height width values and updates them in the page for you to see

2996478
cos	sin
i highly doubt this approach impacts performance cos and sin are damn fast in our days

2996485
min	max
for min and max values changed listening for these events

2996492
serializable	deserialization
it offers a very high performance java pojo to xml serializable and deserialization framework

2996564
folder	directory
the asp.net membership database seems as if it was designed with this goal in mind because it allows you to setup multiple applications however i believe the purpose for which this was built was to allow applications to be run under virtual directory folder not on separate urls

2996587
google-chrome	firefox
browser can be ie google-chrome mozilla firefox and many more

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
here s a google find which answers the other browsers than google-chrome firefox safari issue

2996740
post	get
since the .load will internally use a post request when parsing an object you might consider to replace it with .get if you require a get request

2996745
post	get
so instead of get use .ajax with http post option

2996752
inline	inlining
other things that could potentially improve speed at cost of readability inline sigmoid function manually the jit has a very tight limit for inlining and the function might be larger

2996764
calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	malloc
since there is no portable way of checking if the stack is enough to hold that array you should use some methods that can really be checked - like malloc calloc free

2996765
post	get
the following post indicates how to make a simple get http request with erlang s inets

2996771
width	height
next you need to target the image in order to obtain its height and width before it is resized these values are stored in imginitheight and imginitwidth respectively

i does not work in any way as of the moment i define a height and width on the tabcontainer and try to align in the center my tabs disapear

2996887
stdout	stderr
all i know is that it will output something to stdout and stderr and return with an exit code

2996887
stdout	stderr
to work for both stderr and stdout

2996887
stdout	stderr
being able to differentiate between stdout and stderr because i may want to display only one of the to the console or i could try to output stderr using a different color - this means that will not work

2996887
stdout	stderr
remark modifying the popen to use only one pipe is not allowed because in the real life i will want to do different things with stderr and stdout

2996943
firefox	safari
since you mentioned firefox and safari you may want to use web workers firefox 3.5 and safari 4

2996954
postgresql	mysql
example the back-end can be a database mysql postgresql ms sql which is usually accessed through sql statements fed to an adapter connector but could also be taken care of by a framework rubyonrails zend etc using activerecord orm

the warning appears to jquery 1.4.2 keyup and keydown not on keypress

2997032
rss	feed
you ll want to subscribe to the wix users list at sourceforge and the 3.5 release rss feed

you could change the url by javascript before sending the request but the better way is to use the post redirect get pattern prg

2997098
x86	64bit
the issue is that for some reason the visual studio appears to be generating 64bit data blocks for some of the gui control properties which it is then unable to load when compiling to x86

2997533
stdout	stderr
now for the subprocess part i don t know how you want to wire the subprocess s stdin stdout and stderr to your stdin stdout stderr and file sinks but i know you can do this

2997574
tinyint	nvarchar
i know i must take tinyint but due to some reasons consider it as compulsion i am taking every numeric field as bigint and every character field as nvarchar max

2997576
versioning	upgrade
how can i find what versioning of browser a user is using and ask him to upgrade it

2997695
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
graphicsmagick is a port of an earlier version of imagemagick

2997695
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
but because imagemagick changes their api a lot pythonmagickwant won t work with graphicsmagick

2997695
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
graphicsmagick also seems to be faster than imagemagick using better multitasking

2997721
width	height
you should remove any width and height settings and set the button s horizontalalignment and verticalalignment both to center or left right or top bottom resp.

2997738
stdout	stderr
in your situation you can simply write stdout stderr to a file first

2997759
uiview	subviews
just create a uiview then add multiple uiimageviews as subviews

nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
on illegalargumentexception vs nullpointerexception

2997863
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
while your original code throws illegalargumentexception on null arguments guava s preconditions.checknotnull throws nullpointerexception instead

2997863
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
if a caller passes null in some parameter for which null values are prohibited convention dictates nullpointerexception be thrown rather than illegalargumentexception

2998039
vb6	vba
if i understand you question correctly i m fairly sure you have to have code somewhere i don t think vba supports as i seem to remember that vb6 did to just add the items in a property but you don t have to create a separate module just something like this should work

2998041
post	get
see how you get on with those and perhaps post any updates if you get stuck

2998052
folder	directory
you just need to save your class to a class file .vb and put the class in your app_code directory if you are using a website project or put it anywhere in a web application project preferrably a folder for classes but include it in your project namespace

2998075
textview	imageview
efficient implementation of custom listview with list items having a textview and an imageview

2998089
asdoc	swc
in the end i found it was because i wasn t telling asdoc the location of the flex swc files

sorting	grouping
sorting each grouping individually merge sort would probably be easiest to implement with good results

2998103
slideup	slidedown
ok but jquery has animations like slidedown slideup etc.

2998544
jython	pypy	cpython	pypy	cpython	ironpython
the classical implementation cpython is often called just python for short -- but it s just one of several production-quality implementations side by side with microsoft s ironpython which compiles to clr codes .net jython which compiles to jvm codes pypy which is written in python itself and can compile to a huge variety of back-end forms including just-in-time generated machine language

2998553
getter	setter
personally i wouldn t go the route of using getter and setter in php

2998558
cpython	ironpython
i have these entries in the ironpython site.py to import cpython standard and third-party libraries

2998558
cpython	ironpython
this code works just fine in cpython but it looks like the pyodbc module isn t accessible from ironpython

2998574
children	parent
what you re looking for here is event bubbling - with event bubbling you can assign just one event handler to a higher element and the browser will pass any events on its children up the chain to their parent

what i want to do is put my web services into unity and get them via dependency injection.

2998669
ubuntu	linux
you might want to try going to ubuntu s website and installing linux and just using it day-to-day the way you d use windows

2998707

superclass	subclassing
you have your basefunctionality general superclass and two more specific subclassing

2998932
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
on the information you ve given it could be related to a difference between bash and bin sh which on some systems - including debian ubuntu flavors of linux - are different and support slightly different syntax

2998951
for-loop	loops
you need to change the inner for-loop to loops backwards like this

2998964

2998986
pop-up	dialog
also i d like to avoid that the whole page has to be refreshed just for the confirmation dialog to pop-up which would also be possible without ajax

2999037
.htaccess	httpd.conf
generally shared hosts allow you to set configuration parameters in .htaccess files so you can override httpd.conf without modifying it

2999051
metaclass	subclassing
you could use a metaclass and getattribute to decorate all methods dynamically if you are using python 2 be sure to subclassing from object

2999058
nfa	dfa
the traditional way of constructing a dfa for a regular expression is to first build an nfa using thompson s algorithm

2999058
nfa	dfa
the algorithm works like usual where we simulate multiple runs of the nfa by making our dfa states correspond to subsets of the nfa states we could possibly be in

2999058
nfa	dfa
in the traditional algorithm a dfa state is an accept state if any of the nfa states was an accept state

2999067
hash	salt
i pass that salt to a login page and then use javascript to create a sha hash of the salt + password which is submitted rather than a plaintext password

2999067
hash	salt
since the salt is stored in the session i can then use that to see if the login hash matches the salt + password hash stored in the db

2999068
freebsd	linux
a new release will be available soon for php 5.3 now only compatible with php 5.2.x and should be available on windows and macosx now only for freebsd and linux systems

2999083
ant	maven
if you use a build software like ant or maven you could use a placeholder inside the persistence.xml and create a different copy by just using different build parameters

2999084
put	get
you can get fancy and put it and the array together in a struct if you like

2999105
hash	salt
system generates a salt value from random data could be a hash of the time pid or something

2999105
hash	salt
systems generates a hash value of the password salt value and stores both of these in the registration table

2999105
hash	salt
system pulls the salt value from the database and hash it and the password and compares that against the hash password value put into the database during registration

2999143
hash	salt
a salt is simply a piece of text that you append or prepend to a password before generating a hash

2999143
hash	salt
eg if your password is password and the salt is salt then the hash will be hashfunction saltpassword instead of hashfunction password

2999143
hash	salt
salt are generally used to avoid rainbow password cracks - this is where a large list of passwords and their hash are checked against the hash password

2999143
hash	salt
because if you pick a random salt every time chances are your hash salt+password will not be the same d

2999169
pop-up	dialog
then you create a showdialog.gsp that pop-up the dialog

2999215
hash	salt
the salt has to be stored with the hash for verification to be possible

2999224
joomla	phpbb	wordpress	phpbb	wordpress	joomla
it runs extreamly popular sites like facebook and powers popular web programs like phpbb invisionboard drupal joomla and wordpress

2999227
hide	show
you predefine all select and show hide and disable enable the other selects

2999228
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
best come up with your own one weave the salt and password to create a new string then hash as md5 password + salt is vulnerable to dictionary attack still

2999239
hash	salt
traditionally the salt is stored alongside with the hash password but non encrypted typically preappended for example in unix passwords

2999241
disk	ram
it fly on my home machine with an ssd but it s almost unusable on my work machine win7 4 gig ram but standard disk

2999247
hash	salt
using a unique salt for each user is so that if two users have the same password they won t get the same resultant hash

2999247
hash	salt
you then store the result of hashing the salt and password in the database hash salt + password along with the salt for each user

2999247
hash	salt
however if your database is compromised either due to someone gaining local access or via sql injection attacks then both the salt and final hash will be available which means a brute force attack on the users passwords would be trivial

2999247
hash	salt
so using hash hash salt + secret + password etc

2999247
hash	salt
when the user enters their password you can retrieve the salt and number-of-iterations from the db and the sitewide secret from a local file and validate that when you run the same number of iterations with the salt and password the resulting hash matches what you have stored

2999247
hash	salt
above i suggested hash hash salt + secret + password but equally it could be hash hash salt + hash secret + hash password

2999247
hash	salt
relying on the design of how you hash the password and salt together to provide security is called security through obscurity and should be avoided

2999255
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i am working on a site and it works looks great in safari firefox google-chrome and ie8

2999261
cout	ofstream
your custom stream buffer would then tee the data to cout s original stream buffer and to a stream buffer stolen from an appropriate ofstream

2999273
inherited	properties
they inherited from a base class because they all have properties such as foo and bar and the reason i used a base class is so that i dont have to manually implement all of these properties in each derived class

2999281
textview	imageview
you might use a vertical linearlayout with an imageview and textview children for example

2999281
listview	gridview
here is a free excerpt from one of my books that shows how to do this sort of thing for a listview -- the same technique holds for gridview

when a user clicks on a particular image a dialog window is supposed to pop-up and display a larger version of said image

2999921
parallels	bootcamp	vmware	bootcamp
that said i d recommend bootcamp and parallels vmware

2999930
codeigniter	cakephp
you could use routing like the technique used in codeigniter and cakephp but that s just syntactic sugar that does the same thing -- control your routes to actions

2999932
range	max	range	min	min	max
for an integer value in the range min max

2999945
post	get
i can do an intent with the action url but can t get the post data to feed into it

subshell	ash
use the subshell backticks escape if you want to be able to use it for sh ash and variants thereof

3000001
bash	zsh
if you will be guaranteed access to bash or zsh you could use the syntax instead

3000041
ironruby	ironpython
i think autocad has ironpython and ironruby built in

3000108
navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller
you are calling pushviewcontroller on detailviewcontroller this is calling it on navigationcontroller

3000157
vbscript	vb6
if you re willing to use vbscript rather than vb6 you might be able to just use the msscriptcontrol to run the commands rather than creating your own

3000164
union	distinct
you are looking for union distinct instead of just union

3000202
google-chrome	firefox
the following v3 example does not allow the marker to move around tested in firefox and google-chrome

3000222
ant	maven
you might like to look into the documentation for a version control system one of subversion cvs git etc and for a build system for example in java there are ant and maven

3000266
ant	maven
even if you don t plan to use javac for development fix this issue because tools like ant or maven use it and it will cause problems in case you introduce them at some point

3000284
bazaar	git
bazaar my personal choice is similar and then git is the next nearest in terms of similarity but probably more popular than either at least atm

3000299
put	get
if i call the getuploadurl method and put the wrong path i do not get an event.complete but some other event and getbaseurl should not be executed

for continuous integration software there is teamcity for one also cruisecontrol and its .net counterpart are notable

3000403
post	get
based on your overall use case i d say that the best way to do this is to have the website that s referring to you pass a special post or get param whichever is appropriate

3000507
public	protected
with regards to usage using abstract on a class declaration but having no abstract members is the same as having the class public but using protected on its constructors

3000595
post	get
make sure you re doing a post and not a get method

3000597
post	get
you can use post instead of a get although it wouldn t be bookmarkable not very seo friendy less friendly then a long url even

3000602
post	get
i am assuming it defaults to a get not a post

3000629
hash	salt
by contrast if you have a password hash or a salt password hash then you should use john the ripper to break it offline which is much faster

3000636
post	get
however if you need to do a post instead of a get to send the data perhaps something like the following

3000665
client-side	server-side
the server-side validation are for catching errors before they reach your database data-layer but also to protect against crackers anyone can work around the client-side validation if they want to so never trust data from the client

3000907
stdout	stderr
when i run that wget command directly from the command-line and redirect stderr to a file something sane happens - the stdout will be the downloaded page the stderr will contain the info about opening the given page

3000907
stdout	stderr
i can see i ve simplified the code to the point where it s not clear why i want to use open3 but the general plan is that i wanted to stream stdout to another filtering program as i received it and then at the end i was going to read the stderr from both wget and the filtering program to determine what if anything went wrong

3000990

3001035
bazaar	svn
if you want to be able to work with a dvcs and tfs i believe the best way is to install the svnbridge for tfs and the use bazaar which is afaik the only dvcs that easily integrates with svn and since your tfs now looks like a svn you magically get bazaar tfs integration

i think the conclusion here is you ll end up with a lot less code and a lot less headaches if you just declare the method abstract in the parent and implements it with new whateverclassimin in every class that extends it

3001540
superclass	subclassing
i m a bit rusty on my java but i believe that reflectively code executing in the superclass in this example class a will think it s part of the subclassing

3002750
post	get
this will turn your post into a get

3002765
imperative	declarative
most functional programmers would agree that you shouldn t try to imitate an imperative style i think recursion shouldn t be taught at all but should develop naturally and self-explanatory in declarative programming it s often at various points evident that a function is defined in terms of itself

3002805
inherited	subclassing
this is based roughly on the scala implementation of these lists in particular the idea of using inherited and a nillist subclassing rather than using null pointers

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox google-chrome safari etc

3002976
google-chrome	firefox
if it was possible to add to the manifest.json some google-chrome internal pages like google-chrome extensions it would be possible to create a plugin that would interact to the reload anchor and using an external program like xrefresh a firefox plugin - there s a google-chrome version using ruby and websocket you would achieve just what you need

3002976
emacs	textmate
you could try to find third-party solutions instead that after seeing modifications in a file i don t know emacs neither textmate but in emacs it would be possible to bind an app call within a save file action just clicks in an specific coordinate of an specific application in this case it s the reload anchor from your extension in development you leave a chrome windows opened just for this reload

lxml	elementtree
this is a bit odd in lxml or elementtree

3003061

3003828
rss	feed
while implementing rss feed i was wondering what if any rules or guidelines exist for using a querystring to filter what content an rss feed shows

3003850
put	get
edit i see well if you want o container that can hold entities of different types there s no way you can have complete type safety since when you declare your container you can only put one type on the container and then you may be able to put objects in but you can t be sure what you get back

3003850
put	get
you may put in it things childofthings or grandchildofthings but when you get it back you re only guarantee is that it s a thing you can t tell if it s a child or grandchild without actually testing it

3003859

while implementing rss feed i was wondering how common it was for an rss feed to display items in an order that s different from chronological

parsley	robotlegs
i found that parsley and robotlegs are two popular frameworks for implementing di in as3

the idea behind using get over post is that using get you have a search url that you can modify in the address bar bookmark and pass on

3005525
post	get
one big difference between get and post is that get parameters shouldn t exceed 1-2 kilobytes in size

3005539

post	get
i want to get request post body from http.serverrequest but do so not straight when my request function is called but only after some time redis query

3005579
implements	extends
so they need to make a other project and extends the product class and overwrite the method getproductprice so they can implements there own logic

3005586
post	get
by doing a redirect-after-post the redirected url which renders the results of your search can be made friendly and short while you can use post to pass more parameters in the request to the server and avoid the long query string associated with the get url

3005613
google-chrome	safari
when you f5 refresh in google-chrome safari or ie8 all the get resources are requested again even if they ve been cached

xslt	xquery
while xquery can be used for simple transformations it lacks the power and sofistication of xslt especially templates and the instruction

3005956
xslt	xquery
in cases when accessing an xml database it would be a good decision to use the efficiency of xquery to extract the necessary xml nodes and then do the transformation with xslt from here on

3005956
xslt	xquery
some xslt 2.x xquery processors do allow this via extensions even now

3005956

3008461
inherited	properties
create a concrete class in your test project that inherited from your abstract controller and exposes tenant as a public properties

3008461
accessor	properties
you could use visual studio s private accessor assembly feature to generate a type where you can access your tenant properties

3008468
button	checkbox
it can be more semantic and in some cases leads to a better ui by eliminating non-clickable spaces between radio button or checkbox and their labels

3008486
jndi	jta
for whatever reason i have found that when using jta you must specify a jndi data source within persistence.xml as well

3008767
firefox	safari
it works great in safari or firefox

3008772
width	height
the quick way to solve this is to actually provide two options 1 scale from width 2 scale from height

3008774
folder	directory
it might be a little harder to get a folder built in your output directory and have the file added to that

3008786
jsf	seam
although a majority of seamâ s work is done in the jsf servlet these additional filters allow seam to

3008789
innodb	myisam
myisam will follow the steps above and lock the entire table even if it is split into multiple partitions where an engine like innodb will do row level locking instead

3008789
innodb	myisam
if you re not reaching the necessary performance benchmarks with myisam and you have shown your bottleneck is waiting on table locks via updates i would suggest changing the storage engine of your table to innodb

3008801
width	height
calculate the new dimensions for both variants scale by width and scale by height then use the one that fits in the display

3008801
width	height
depending on which aspect ratio is larger the height or the width needs to be scaled

3008840
median	minimum
instead of subtracting maximum or minimum subtracting the median can work well though you have to choose the filter size such that there s usually a majority of background pixels inside the filter mask

3008856
width	height
because you want to maximize showing as much as possible the scaled image of the original in your window the area in your designer you would take the larger of either the width or height of the original image and scale that to 200

3008856
width	height
pseudo-code width height are dimensions of original

3008869
width	height
if you mean image pixels you need to know the physical size of the image height width and then you can calculate how wide a pixel is

3008890
postgresql	mysql
ps you can also migrate to postgresql it s smarter than mysql when choosing right indexes

3008922
accessor	properties
properties accessor

3008922
accessor	properties
then the properties accessor operator is used

3008922
accessor	properties
also host objects can implement accessor properties that can have a logic get and set methods not just simple value properties

3008922
accessor	properties
in ecmascript 3 we didn t had the power of creating accessor properties only the host objects could implement them but the 5th edition of the standard allows us to do it

3008922
google-chrome	firefox
note the above illustrative example works on ie9 pre firefox 3.7alpha google-chrome 5 and webkit nightly builds

3008966

3009072
hash	salt
this is only secure if the server sends a non-reusable salt and of course if you use a secure hash

3009085
hash	salt
if you let the server pick a hash salt every time a user logs in that will protects against replay

3009085
hash	salt
if that is a problem you could hash the salt with another fixed salt use the result as a checksum and add both to your login form as hidden fields

3009138
google-chrome	firefox
target is the originating element in firefox google-chrome srcelement is the same element in ie

3009138

i am a bit worried that if this could be done from landscape to portrait it should also be possible from portrait to landscape thus making my hack unnecessary

3009211
serializable	deserialization
i would recommend xml serializable and deserialization

3009217
partition-problem	np-complete
if you want exact same values then for number of columns x 2 it is the classic partition-problem which is np-complete but has pseudo polynomial solutions

3009274
put	get
p1 is as close as it can get to o1 so it stays put

3009284
folder	directory
i have a directory with lots of folder sub-folder and all with files in them

3009530
int	double
for a given int sequence check number of double palindromes where by double palindrome we mean sequence of two same palindromes without break between them

3009532
hash	salt
you can protect this scheme against man-in-the-middle attacks by using the salt database hash to generate a secret key for symmetric encryption

3009532
hash	salt
server looks up the password hash in the database h d along with salt s d

3009543
16-bit	64bit
passing a 16-bit value or 32-bit value rather than a 32-bit or 64bit address

3009621
int	double
this is probably true for built-in types such as int or double

3009625
punctuation	words
despite the frequently expressed antipathy for regular expressions on the part of many in the python community they re really a precious tool for the appropriate use cases -- which definitely include identifying words and phrases thanks to the b words boundary element in regular expression patterns -- string-processing based alternatives are much more of a problem .split uses whitespace as the separator and thus annoyingly leave punctuation attached to words adjacent to it etc etc

3009625
punctuation	words
this will form the pattern bcat b| bdog b which will locate either cat or dog as stand-alone words ignoring punctuation but rejecting hits within longer words

3009646
free	malloc

3009810
min	max
that means there could be those min dates and max dates stored in a database which php would retrieve and it would have to differentiate between normal dates and min max date and eventually they would trickle down to some javascript which again would have to differentiate between normal dates and min max date

3009830
hash	md5
-adding a column to pages storing the md5 hash of the url and indexing it

3010179
pop-up	dialog
the only advice i can give is if you open up the property manager for the project and right click on one of the configuration folders it should pop-up a menu with an item called overidden properties... which in turn opens a dialog box that lists each property set in the project configuration that overrides a property sheet property sheet - along with the facility to select some or all and delete the overrides

3010764
cout	cin
try replacing cout with wcout cin with wcin and string with wstring

3010791
getter	setter
generally the nsfoo class defines data members getter and read-only operations and the derived nsmutablefoo adds on setter and mutating operations

3010791
getter	setter
while you certainly could take that approach it seems to me that a more concise approach is to create a single foo class mark getter and read-only operations as const functions and also implement the mutable operations and setter in the same class

3010792
versioning	upgrade
instead use scripts to create all your objects including indexes relations constraints everything and use upgrade scripts to control how to upgrade each schema versioning to the next versioning like described in versioning control and your database

3010828
vim	emacs
gui-based ides like visual studio and eclipse have several advantages over text-based ides like emacs or vim because of their display capabilities

3010828

3011046
addition	multiplication
i know i can set colormatrix s m00 m11 m22 to 0 0 0 respectively and then put a new value in m40 m41 m42 but that new value is calculated based of a value multiplication and addition of that pixel s components and the result of that - luminance - is multiplied by the color component

3011060
lisp	smalltalk
this works exactly the same as in any other programming language if you have multiple references to a mutable object in say python java c# c++ c lisp smalltalk javascript php perl or whatever then any change to that object will be visible no matter what reference is used even if some of those references are final or const or whatever that particular language calls it

actionscript	mxml
see the mxml code is compiled into the actionscript code and then into bytecode which is then executed by the flash player

3011645
actionscript	mxml
so it s get easier to work in mxml but there r some limitations of the mxml so sooner or later u have to use actionscript thats what we all do daily

3011648
actionscript	mxml
mxml files can include actionscript inside tags - similar to how you can have javascript in an html file

3011648
actionscript	mxml
most of the things that you do in mxml can also be done with actionscript but it ll take more lines of code to do it

3011648
actionscript	mxml
an mxml file creates an actionscript class of the same name that extends the class corresponding to the root tag of the mxml file

bindingsource	dataadapter
when using a dataset datasource a tableadapter is generated by the dataset which can be assigned to the dataadapter property of the report or the bindingsource

3011814

profiling	debugging
i ve only just started profiling today firmly believing in not optimising too early so i imagine there s some kind of reference floating around somewhere but i can t see where and what would be super helpful would be the ability to debugging and see a list of objects that reference the target object

3011981
entities	entitymanager
point to note that is entitymanager keeps track of entities through java object references.

3011981
entities	entitymanager
i think if i have new entitymanager in both listings 1 and 2 i should be able to persist same object in database because entitymanager keeps track of entities through java object references and in each iteration i have new entitymanager which dont know or should not know the object references saved persisted in database in previous iteration by some other entitymanager object instance

3012169
qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsitem	qlist	qgraphicsscene	qlist	qgraphicsitem
since most of the convenience functions of qgraphicsscene and qgraphicsitem such as items collidingitems childitems etc. return a qlist you re forced to do lots of qgraphicsitem_cast or static_cast and qgraphicsitem type checks to get hold of the actual items when you have lots of different type of items in the scene

3012194
getter	setter
the actual source code should have the getter setter because you probably want to add validation and change notification to the setter as needed

3012205
getter	setter
note isrunning is a getter setter

3012243
unsigned	short
this enable reading packets and calls a function that decodes the packet s header unsigned short and resize the buffer to send it to another function that reads the real data from the packet

3012285
centos	linux
store running on linux centos

3012294
public	protected
while compiling it shows clone is protected and cannot be accessed but i had extended object class hence the clone method will be public to my class

3012304
hex	binary
the kernel program ihex2fw called from makefile in kernel_source lib firmware on .hex files converts these hex files to an arbitrary-designed binary format that the linux kernel then picks up with request_ihex_firmware because they thought reading text files in the kernel was silly it would slow things down

3012342
inherited	subclassing
and because object#clone is implemented as a protected method any subclassing of object every class in fact can access its inherited clone method and every class inside the java.lang package can access clone methods from other objects too

3012360

for gsm phones connected to a pc this is typically implemented on top op bluetooth or usb

3012987
google-chrome	firefox
you can verify this in google-chrome and firefox by checking the list of computed styles

3013027
post	get
only store user id in the post object and run 2 queries one to get a list of post and another one to get list of users where user id is in the list of post authors

3013096
getter	setter
putting code validation coercion logic change notifications logging etc in the getter and setter of dependency properties corresponding clr properties instead of using the propertychangedcallback validatevaluecallback and coercevaluecallback

3013112

bazaar	git
i thing it should be a distributed one i think git is the lingua franca but there is also mercurial and bazaar which should have some advantages since they exist -

this is the standard behaviour for the mouseout and mouseover events

3013406
min	max
the problem is that library declare min max function

3013406
min	max
i want to disable min max function in stl like #define nomnmax if i could

3013443
int	boolean
you can call bitmap.createscaledbitmap bitmap src int dstwidth int dstheight boolean filter

3013446
min	max
the min and max functions are defined in the std namespace so this code should not compile

3013463
min	max
as both min and max and every other standard library member are defined in std namespace you just mustn t import that namespace don t use using namespace std

3013464
min	max
i sometimes have problems with something like that as well because iirc opencv #defines its own min max as well as i think does windows.h

3013464
min	max
for me the problem arises that with some headers #defining min max i can t even use std min

3013480
websphere	ibm
i also can get ibm websphere and the like for free as well

3013480
websphere	ibm

ubuntu	linux
i also plan on installing everything i had running under linux itâ s almost entirely java based development software so itâ ll run on both only reason i went with ubuntu during the year was because the apache build seemed better

3013529
min	max
i m guessing your libary defines min max as macros so the fact that stl min min are in a namespace won t help

3013529
min	max
that way min and max are translated to something else while algorithm is compiled

3013539
ant	maven
neither maven nor ant easily intrinsically support the file dependency concept of make

3013551
jquery	jqmodal
there are other alternatives of showing popups instead of using the old school alert for example you could use the jqmodal plugin based on the popular jquery framework

now the height and width variables were supposed to be height and width of the layout used for the popup window popupcontact

3014228

what you are doing is the right way to go according to msdn but it does suggest that another option is to hide show the pages as needed

3014229
folder	directory
just in case you created an eclipse rcp application then there is an elegant way to bundle the application with a java runtime environment just create a folder named jre inside your applications directory same level as plugin and features folder and copy a jre to that folder

3014277
spweb	splist
the recommended way to do this is to use propertybag key value pairs through the .properties of spfarm spweb.rootweb for site collections spweb splist etc depending upon the scope that you need

i think there is no need to use popupwindow yourself to create this view and the dialog stuff will get you to a result much easier

3014516
width	height
if you want to stick with the popupwindow and you don t want to change the width and height of your window just use another constructor for popupwindow there are some available that don t need height and width

3014602
google-chrome	firefox
created a new version miming your script and tested it on firefox google-chrome ie8 ie7 and it worked flawlessy

3014630
put	get
if the file can be put into an element in firefox you can use javascript to automatically upload the data to the server without user intervention but you would need something to initially get the file into the page s memory not the file system

3014644
cvs	svn
ive been using sourcegear vault and subversion visual svn for quite a while now and am a big fan of the cvs disconnected style edit - merge - commit way of using source control

facade	service-locator
if your concern is having a dependency on unity throughout your application you can combine the service-locator with a facade to hide the ioc implementation

3014809
goto	break
in c# it won t compile without break or goto case statement except when there s no pre-action

3014817
int	double
you could get overflow problems converting a double to an int - this actually returns a long for that reason

3014820
int	double
if you re actually trying to implement something close to this yourself one way to do so is to take the double and explicitly cast it into an int

3014863
google-chrome	safari
when viewing said effects in safari google-chrome and ie the double dashed border effect looks great

3014880
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
question is now should you go for a checked exception which you need a throws declaration or try catch clauses or an unchecked-exception an exception that extends runtimeexception

you should also override gethashcode if you are overriding equals

3014968
equals	gethashcode
you need to override equals and gethashcode methods of your key class

3014983
google-chrome	safari
en-us applewebkit 533.4 khtml like gecko google-chrome 5.0.375.55 safari 533.4 is google-chrome

3014990
equals	gethashcode
in order to use your own classes as dictionary keys you should override gethashcode and equals

3014992
equals	gethashcode
if you do not have the ability to override equality operators equals gethashcode as others have mentioned as in you do not control the source code of the object you can provide an implementation in the constructor of the dictionary to perform your equality checks

3014994
equals	gethashcode
you need to override the equals and gethashcode methods of your key class

3015012
maven	pom.xml

3015096
public	protected
whether a property is public protected or private has nothing to do with how the properties memory is managed

3015100

objective-c only allows private protected and public modifiers on instance variables although you can essentially make a property or method private by declaring it in the implementation .m file rather than the header .h file

3015124
inherited	properties
immediately i see an issue with this wsdl testresponse does not contain the properties inherited from responsemessage

3015139
dictionary	map
use a dictionary to map nsurldownload s to rows cells .

3015144
equals	gethashcode
then you will need to override gethashcode and equals on the key class

3015150
equals	gethashcode
overriding a class gethashcode and equals methods so that it will work properly in a dictionary is not a very good approach

3015154
ftp	telnet
i had initially thought that i could display a sign on screen where they would enter their username and password then establish an ftp connection or telnet or something similar with the aix system but this would not be a reliable method as the functionality may be locked down eg

3015171
getter	setter
jaxb does not properly generate boolean field getter and setter this bug is left unfixed for backwards compatibility

however in f# it is usually recomended to use subclassing inherited only when there is a really good reason for that you need to implement some virtual class and pass it to a .net library

3015534
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome work fine

3015558
chown	chmod
make sure you run man chmod man chown

3015569
yacc	bison
typical parser lexer like antlr yacc bison seems cannot deal with this kind of stuff one idea i have is to convert the syntax diagram to a character bitmap and define some function like more_up move_down left right or so in order to traverse the whole diagram to simulate the understanding process as human naked eye

3015570
put	get
1- in the onclick attribute get the value after the productid and put it in its own variable

3015570
put	get
2- in the onclick attribute get the value after the orig_price and put it in a variable orig_price so in this case it would be 22.95

3015570
put	get
3- in the onclick attribute get the value after the width and put it in a variable width so in this case it would be 330

3015570
put	get
4- in the onclick attribute get the value after the height and put it in a variable height so in this case it would be 300

3015605

3015866
folder	directory
i was trying to access the root directory and list the contents of it but i got 0 folder listed there

3015871
std	ostream
you could use a boost iostreams array_sink wrapped with stream to give it an std ostream interface for that

3015904
nsstring	nsdata
and i m aware that i can convert nsstring to nsdata so i ll see if this leads me anywhere

3015929
put	get
and even though the cost is not really noticeable if you really need the extra performance boost you can simply create custom subclasses for the list class one for each primitive type they are not many so that s not a problem and simply override the methods that put and get values in the list and limit them to accepting each primitive

3015980
opera	google-chrome
i read that the hover fires functions off twice on hover in google-chrome but tried it in opera and the same error occurred so i don t think that s the problem

3015992
codeigniter	cakephp
cakephp is newer more feature rich and heavier than codeigniter codeigniter is designed to have a much smaller footprint so you will most likely find yourself creating functionality in codeigniter to match cake s

3015992
codeigniter	cakephp
cakephp also handles some core capabilities differently than codeigniter

3016009
hide	show
it doesn t answer your question but you could hide your p when the mouse is out and show it when the mouse is over

3016020
mouseover	mouseout
creating elements on mouseover mouseout is much more work on the browser then having those elements created already in the markup with display none

3016020
mouseover	mouseout
your mouseover and mouseout are probably both firing and it can t find the element to remove and continues to add it

3016044

if bob needs bigimportantclass then bob needs to get the people who own project a to sign up to guarantee that bigimportantclass will be written to meet his needs tested to ensure that it meets his needs is documented as meeting his needs and that a process will be put in place to ensure that it will never be changed so as to no longer meet his needs

3016183
width	height
you can manage the width pretty easily but web pages are flow documents and do not understand the concept of height not easily at least

3016210
crossover	mutation
on the other end if the fitness function is the same then it makes sense to compare results given different parameters such as different mutation rate different implementations of crossover or even completely different evolutionary paradigms such as coevolution gene expression compared to standard gas and so on

3016220
getdate	dateadd
dt_wstr 11 bbd + substring dt_wstr 4 dateadd day 30 getdate 1 4 + substring dt_wstr 2 dateadd day 30 getdate 6 2 + substring dt_wstr 2 dateadd day 30 getdate 9 2

uitableview	nsindexpath
the cell frame is going to be something like 0 0 width size i dont believe it will have its x and y relative to the tableview...you want to use - cgrect rectforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath for this this should return you the correct frame for the cell relative to the tableview...here is a link uitableview ref

3016441
width	height
as gnoupi observes with level it s not clear how width and height are initialized

3016441
implements	extends
to meet a similar need this example extends defaulttablecellrenderer and implements icon for easier control over the geometry

wordpress	joomla
my question is do i need to have knowledge of one or more cms and or frameworks like drupal joomla zend wordpress etc

3016728
gridex	janus
i understand from the janus gridex folks that the cause of the problem is that linq presents a static list to the grid that is not refreshed after refresh is called on the datacontext

3016732
multiton	singleton
if these programs are running in the same session you can create a separate class to handle writing to files and use either singleton or multiton to map to many file names design pattern to guarantee only one instance of this class

3016766
post	get
you are using associative arrays as they are called in javascript in php object literal notation in javascript but since you use them as the data to the post method they should get treated like normal form submits

3016779
codeigniter	kohana
i would personally go for codeigniter or kohana improved framework from codeigniter but with less commnutiy support

3016782
inherited	properties
apparently the text properties is automatically set to the objects name when you inherited from usercontrol

3016787

post	get
could you not post the tracking id to an endpoint and have it redirect to a get of resourcea for this client and resourceb for another client

3017197
hide	show
i ve been asked to create a hide show function with a select tag

since you are hard-coding the width of the labels you could simply give your text a left margin of a slightly-larger value

3017227
move	drag
move drag the fruits you want to group next to each other

3017264
getter	setter
so i thought it would be great to use on getter and setter

3017267

if you want to include field during serializable but ignore it during deserialization then you can use ondeserializedattribute to run a method which will set default value for id field

3017272
put	get
the problem i have is i want to use a variable for the image when i put the variable name instead of the image name i get an error

3017281

you would compare the window width height to the window s scrolltop scrollleft etc

3017290
inline	inlining
i don t inline anything until a profiler has specifically told me that not inlining is resulting in a performance problem

3017314
getter	setter
in general having getter and setter is showing poor abstraction don t do it

3017335

by the way width and height are definitely not deprecated in css

3017355
uitableview	uisegmentedcontrol
i am working on an iphone view that has some header text along with a uisegmentedcontrol at the top and a uitableview beneath it

3017355

i am updating my answer because i didn t realize you are using both jscript and vbscript

3017407
int	chars
simple things like chars and int are typically atomic when transferred

3017442
put	get
so if you attempt to put something that s not a string you ll get a compile time exception

3017464
public	protected
i would use them for private internal members but use result classes for public protected members

3017465
boost	stl
you can look to c++ stl and boost for examples of how tuples are used in other languages but in the end we will all have to experiment to find how they best fit in the .net environment

3017468
postgresql	mysql
i m relatively new to mysql have been using mssql and postgresql earlier and every approach i can think of is blocked by some feature lacking in mysql

3017515
width	height
edit just tested it myself and even if i set width and height of well the repeating img

3017517

3017529

3017604
short	base
it would keep the code base clean and the xslt s themselves should be pretty short if the data is as simple as you state

3017604
inherited	properties
if you decide you absolutely want to have one class per xml or if you perhaps got a .net dll instead of xml from one customer then i would make the proxy class inherited an interface or abstract class based off your internal class and implement the mappings per properties as needed in the proxy classes

3017652
base	fractions
floats don t represent exact data values they just represent data values that can properly be represented as the sum of fractions of base 2

3017669
udp	tcp
the udp protocol does not guaratnee delivery you should switch to tcp if you need to guaratnee packet delivery

3017695
maven-compiler-plugin	maven-resources-plugin
configuring for the maven-resources-plugin or the maven-compiler-plugin also doesn t fix it

3017697

when i go to post i get the correct form and i fill it out

3017872
intersect	contains
i have a set of simple no holes no self-intersections polygons and i need to check that they don t intersect each other one can be entirely contains in another

3017872
intersect	contains
since no polygon can intersect any other then any contains polygon has a unique container

3017879
post	get
that will allow the query to get all the post for a tag in the correct order without filesort

3017887
short	base
the short of it is it would be great if all events could summarily invoked asynchronously but it is imperative you execise the same caution you would with any multithreaded code base

3017899
inherited	properties
when specifying event objects for events or eventsources omitting this properties will make it inherited from alldaydefault which is normally false

3017947
rss	feed
i am trying to generate a google merchant rss feed using php s simplexml and domdocument

3017969
for-loop	arrays
write a for-loop over your arrays be sure to use lbound and ubound instead of looping from 0 to x

3017994
intersect	contains
for your purposes if edges intersect but one polygon is not contains within the other then you know they overlap in a non-permitted fashion

3018007
ciimage	nsimage
so one solution to this problem is to create a nsciimagerep from the ciimage then add that representation to a new nsimage then it is easy to display the nsimage in a variety of ways

3018034
linefeed	delimiter
this script should run on every platform for every kind of line delimiter cr linefeed crlf

3018043
int	chars
and fwiw you can convert between chars and int just by casting

3018050
textview	imageview
it appears to the casual observer that there s an entire layout object pinned to the bottom of the edittext containing an imageview a textview and a button

3018149
put	get
if functions get big i normally put them in a seperate file and call them at the bottom of the file below in the section

3018162
wan	vlan
i need to export 100 million data rows avg row length 100 bytes from oracle 10g database table into sql server over wan vlan with 6mbits sec capacity on a regular basis

3018173
hash	hmac
now this is fine but if this is all we did then the server would have the stored hmac and since the client only needs to send the hmac not the plain text password an attacker could use the stored hash from the server to access anyone s account in the catastrophic scenario where someone would get such an access to the database of course

3018205
public	protected
if the access modifier on the object is set to friend protected friend or public and the object reference is not read only that is it s mutable then you can simply re-assign it

3018206
inherited	properties
scaling is affected by the form s autoscalemode and whether or not they inherited the container control s font properties

3018241
put	get
to put it another way if someone can get hold of the hash that s stored on the server that s all they need to log into the system.

3018265
hash	hmac
i think it hinges on the statement naturally we don t want them stored in plan text so we hmac them locally before storing and or sending. if the system is altered so that the hash password now has the same power the password once had the same level of caution should be used with the hash password

3018279
google-chrome	safari
the fact that the videos are working on desktop versions of google-chrome and safari suggest that the problem is how your videos are encoded

3018292
hash	salt
also as another poster said make sure you are using a salt on both hash

3018292
hash	salt
edit - actually thinking about it since you are using a hash as the password you don t really need to use a salt on the server

3018306
hash	md5
1 hash it with md5 and sha1

3018326
short	base
you should read this explains very nicely the difference between the base sdk and deployment target -- in short the base sdk is the highest sdk version you expect to support whereas the deployment target is the lowest version you will support

3018372
equals	tostring
i d also like to have this implement the standard java equals hashcode and tostring methods

3018388
int	chars
is a positive int that specifies how many chars of character_expression will be returned

3018421
int	chars
is a positive int that specifies how many chars of character_expression will be returned

3018470
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox google-chrome but not in ie

3018470
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome this works fine

3018482
inherited	subclassing
i also have some subclassing of the above using single table inherited

3018495
getter	setter
i would guess that accessors getter setter are missing

3018523
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
because most filesystems these days except fat on windows but ntfs is ok organize the list of files in a directory into a b-tree structure so checking for a file existence is a fast operation o log n instead of enumerating whole list

3018536
getter	setter
right now i have things divided into about six classes with getter setter

3018536
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
also instead of using math to figure out which indexes data should be placed in i ve used precomputed lookup tables so i don t have to use constant multiplication addition subtraction division per frame

3018574
getter	setter
i seriously doubt that getter and setter are at the root of your problem

3018580
firefox	safari
but they grab the data in safari and firefox

3018608
action-filter	onactionexecuting
then an action-filter or base controller s onactionexecuting method will walk the modelstate errors take all the modelitemexception errors there and merge them into single error

3018610
stdout	stderr
will redirect stdout and stderr to the same file

3018624
submit	submission
it seems that the return false statement that prevents default form submission will neglect any further submit calls even if an instance variable was set

3018642
put	get
you also get the added bonus of being able to access your fields via keyword lookup and being able to put metadata on your objects which defrecord gives you for free

3018655
accessor	properties
the correct usage of -will|didchangevalueforkey is when you are modifying a properties without using kvc-compliant accessor setters such that the kvo mechanism would not notice the change

3018655
accessor	properties
of course it would be better to use a properties declaration and to use kvc-compliant accessor setters either manually coded or synthesized but this is a contrived example

3018661
filtering	grouping
the view model is used by the data binding process as a safe way to allow you to sort filtering grouping the records as seen by a specific control without necessarily making changes to the actual bound data set that is unless until you tell it to

3018694
post	put
do post put requests to create edit a resource on my server

3018718
post	get
according to last.fm api documentation you should use get method instead of post to pass parameters

3018718
post	get
when i ve changed post to get i ve received the answer about incorrect key

3018719
maven	pom.xml
i added the jboss maven repo to my pom.xml file like this.

3018741
stdout	stderr
from within a ruby script you can redirect stdout and stderr with the io#reopen method

3018791
put	get
in the olden days i would simply put that code in the code-behind and call it at the same time i was building the order but i want to get a step closer to solid proper architecture so i wanted to get some information

3018808
rss	feed
this seems very counter-intuitive to me as now the xmlns declaration is on almost every line of my rss feed intead of just once in the root element

3018822
folder	directory
take all the directory there and put them in your application s folder

3018877
int	chars
if one is int and the other is chars you won t get any records from the association and no warnings

3018922
implements	extends
you can implements multiple interfaces but only extends one class

3018945
google-chrome	firefox
no properties of objects will not mysteriously disappear for no reason -- at least not barring implementation bugs which should be easily ruled out by seeing if the same thing happens in ie google-chrome and firefox which each have their own and very different implementations of javascript

3018945
inherited	properties
most but by no means all of the properties objects inherited from their prototypes tend to be functions and so the result of that can seem to be a data-only copy

3018980
width	height
so a box with a width and height of 1 if set to 0 0 will take up space from 0 0 to 1 1

3018992
.htaccess	httpd.conf
just make sure you have the appropriate modules enabled in this case mod_rewrite and make sure that in your httpd.conf you allow the directives that you need to be used from the .htaccess files and all should work

3019036
serializable	deserialization
deserialization is harder than serializable

3019059
rubygems	bundler
in this case sequel was installed with bundler not rubygems

3019068
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have an excel file which can be downloaded..for example name.xlsx well it works in firefox but in webkit safari google-chrome it appends to the name also the extension .xhtml so then name it will be name.xlsx.html it should be only .xlsx

3019070
interpreted-language	compiled-language
and perl like any interpreted-language is much slower than a compiled-language

3019089
google-chrome	firefox
if the portal is misbehaving i recommend clearing your cache and using the latest browser version i personally use google-chrome and firefox regularly on the portal w o issue

3019092
gitolite	gitosis
this isn t quite what i was looking for and i don t think gitosis can do it without some serious scripting but gitolite apparently has a way to have permissions for personal branches

3019112
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it works great in almost all the browsers i ve tested firefox google-chrome safari opera v10 at least and ie 8

3019126
keyup	mouseup
i updated patrick s demo using a bind with mouseup and keyup

3019130
onmousedown	onmouseup	onchange	onsubmit
yes i already see you re missing onmousedown onmouseup onchange onsubmit etc

3019158
typedef	struct
if you swap the order of the structure definitions moving struct people above the typedef of person it will fail again

3019179
google-chrome	safari
i ve not had this function fail yet -- it works with all the office 2007 2010 files that i ve tried so far in safari windows and google-chrome

3019200
portrait	landscape
however when one loads up the iphone application on an ipad the videos play portrait mode with letterboxing on the top and bottom instead of landscape left like they do on the iphone

3019220
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome also have some built-in debugging tools

3019284
cpu	hyperthreading
note that each physical cpu physical id can have multiple cores core id which can further be broken up into additional logical cpus by hyperthreading

3019307
subnet	packets
that s why i am exchanging broadcast packets with the pc to get a good ip address from my other software running on a pc which knows what the current subnet is even in a network with static ip addresses and no dhcp server

3019313
strlen	substr
you ll want to use strlen in a comparison setting substr to cut it if you need to and the concatenation operator with ... or

3019332
boost	stl
try to put all function definitions in the implementation file and leave the pure declarations for the headers unless of course you re template metaprogramming stl boost etc in which case pretty much everything is in the headers

3019339
cout	cin
in my examples stdin or std cin and stdout std cout were sometimes in utf-8 sometimes iso-8859-2

3019350
accessor	properties
using the dot notation is only possible if the variable has an associated properties declared or if there are key-value-coding compliant accessor methods available

3019350
accessor	properties
the properties syntax allows you to synthesise accessor methods for your variable that are key-value-coding compliant and really this is how the dot notation works

3019386
getter	setter
you re not accessing the instance variable directly the dot notation is only used for getting at properties via the getter and setter methods that you synthesized

3019386
getter	setter
you re sending a message to the object which in this case causes those getter setter methods to get called

3019435
width	height
i ve tought i can create a fixed sized image 200 width x 600 height for example with my personal frame top left bottom right element graphics and in the center a transparency

3019438
getter	setter
you can use the obj.prop getter syntax provided handwavily that the compiler has a prototype for the method call obj prop and the setter syntax provided there s obj setprop blah

3019484
public	protected
i ve come to the conclusion that protected data is just as bad as public data in a class

3019493
put	get
you can put oauth_callback parameter to get request token

3019499
pong	minesweeper
a long time ago netscape 4-era i wrote javascript-based games pong minesweeper and john conway s life among them

3019499
google-chrome	safari
use javascript and html 5 - it should run on google-chrome safari or maybe an ipad

3019516
internationalization	localization
this is useful in localization internationalization

3019526
google-chrome	safari
ie 8 crashes with the following javascript but the same code works fine in ie6 ie7 ie8 ie7mode ff3 google-chrome and safari

3019535
if-statement	while-loop
it jerks a little probably due to my programming logic below it s running a while-loop and constantly checking if-statement so it ends up trying to turn left and right every few milliseconds which explains the jerking part

3019561
firefox	safari
at the time there was no real support for text in canvas so my solution didn t work using excanvas but worked fine on safari and firefox

3019565
tostring	string.format
i have found the former approach using string.format very useful when overriding tostring methods in entity classes

3019598
komodo	aptana
i used eclipse pdt aptana netbeans and komodo

3019601
ienumerable	iqueryable
i believe system.linq is linq-objects specific ienumerable iqueryable etc

3019638
stdout	stderr
this directs what would normally go to stderr to go to stdout instead

3019675
jquery	scriptaculous
my advice would be to look at the jquery ui demo page - - and look at each demo and search for the main one or two keywords from each demo like you would probably do for scriptaculous

3019688
awt	swing
i have done some digging and haven t found any information as to how devices are implemented or plugged into swing awt

3019701
width	height
take a width and a height input and then render the image gradient accordingly so i can save it upload it and then use it in my designs

3019758
stdout	stderr
duplicating stderr to stdout is given in the posix page for dup2 as an example usage of the function

3019777
firefox	safari
in second turn is firefox after that is safari then opera.

3019780
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
in a custom uiviewcontroller if i have a member uinavigationcontroller that i initialize with self as the root view like this

3019796
stdout	stderr
since popen runs the command via shell probably one can tell it to redirect stderr to stdout and send stdout to dev null

3019809
nuxeo	alfresco
i have not much experience with nuxeo but here is for alfresco

3019809
liferay	alfresco
alfresco and liferay work very well together

3019811
maven	m2e
i am using m2e 0.10.0 maven 3 in projects

3019811
maven	m2e
i can add maven dependency using m2e

3019824
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
you also shouldn t mix uinavigationcontroller with uitabbarcontroller if you want to have a tab bar in a navigationcontroller page you can build a custom uitabbarcontroller

3019829
vmware	virtualbox
virtualbox kvm xen vmware vmware fusion on the macbook etc

3019845
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i think you need to check all the major browsers at least ie safari firefox google-chrome opera..... and verify that the website looks ok and functions normally

3019846
pull	push
since repositories in a dcvs are all the same you can push pull from any other repository no matter the location

3019867
post	get
you can post whatever you like and get the results in a similar way

3019890
post	put
you can use php input only to read from the standard input if php is being run from the command line or to fetch the request data post or put http request data except for a multipart post

3019899
getter	setter
the jit will inline simple getter and setter - although you shouldn t depend on it to inline anything else in very tight loops - like your blitter.

3019910
range	minimum
it becomes even more complicated to me anyway if i introduce a minimum for the range

3019910
range	minimum
therefore any number i evaluate should be either within range or the minimum value if it s below range and the maximum value if it s above range

3019954
terminate	timeout
i want to limit a block of code and only allow it to run for x seconds after which i will terminate that code block and return a response to the user that the script timeout

3019958
int	boolean
first in c c++ a boolean expression can be converted to an int

3019973
width	margin
inner wrapper position absolute left or margin left -1 2 width of content 480px for a 960px layout

3019975
post	put
looking at the ultracart documentation it looks to me like they aren t passing the the body of the xml in as a post parameter but probably as an http put which is fairly whacky

3019999
min	max
putting it together assuming min max

3020026
awt	swing
i think you need to go beyond what swing awt would typically call an adapter and create the bridge yourself to the graphics device using jni java native interface

3020026
awt	swing
have a look at this wiki page which describes the jni aspects of javas awt layer - there are links in that page to details of jni and swing which are fairly low-level

3020052
min	max
probably the simplest way is to use whatever max and min are available in your language like this

3020052
min	max
in some languages java javascript and c# and probably others max and min are static methods of the math class

3020083
x86	64bit
once you do that you should be able to use the same command line as above with tcouple small changes - for cl you ll have to define d x64 1 or d_amd64_ and for link you ll have to change the machine x86 to machine x64 to produce 64bit version of your program

3020190
width	height
let s say the model of the cube is centered at the origin and is of size 1 length width and height

3020190
width	height
it will take up 1 256th of the width and 1 240th of the height of the viewport see also graphicsdevice.viewport

3020190
xna	spritebatch
you probably want to use xna s spritebatch - not least of all because it s heavily optimised for drawing sprites

3020190
width	height
spritebatch assumes your world space is the same as client space top left is 0 0 width and height are the size of the viewport and handles the projection for you

3020190
xna	spritebatch
it is worth noting that in the new xna 4.0 you can use spritebatch to draw with custom vertex shaders and so you may use arbitrary world-view-project matrices

3020207
mef	prism
after some research i found out that prism and mef are possible solutions to these goals

3020221
postgresql	mysql
env jboss h2 mysql postgresql jpa hibernate 3.3.x

3020221
integer	unsigned
should it be integer or long or should i use the unsigned versions of the above declarations

3020295
rss	feed
i have seen in some browsers firefox for example the rss feed icon gets activated only when a page contains a rss atom feed

3020328
cout	cin
it means basically that you will have a black window that pops up and you can use things like std cout to output to standard output and std cin to get input from that console as well

3020333
aim	instant
check this article talks about status in skype instant messenger status indicator - aim yahoo icq msn skype ...

3020395
ienumerable	iqueryable
ienumerable whereas system.data.linq is provider-specific linq to sql which relies on iqueryable

3020410
folder	directory
how can i create a temporary folder in tmp directory

3020418
post	get
before doing another get post etc make sure you reset controller by calling or else response doesn t seem to get updated on subsequent requests

3020425
implements	extends
i have an interface called iview which has init method.i want to derive a new class called planeviewer implements above interface and extends another class

3020445
width	height
assuming you mean width and height you would do

3020456
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
google-chrome opera ie7 and firefox all work

3020559
width	height
given a specific width i want to find out the height of a qtextdocument

3020631
int	boolean	int	double
int double floats boolean dates etc.

3020646
ant	maven
any idea why i successfully compile with maven ant plugin java project

3020651
inherited	properties
since you don t want the bind all the single properties but only the one you care you can inherited from defaultmodelbinder and then bind the single properties

3020681
postgresql	mysql
in the introductory tutorials it talks about mysql postgresql and sqlite3

3020694
post	get
you may need to post code and more info to get a propper answer

3020711
postgresql	mysql
activerecord rails default orm supports mysql postgresql and sqlite3

3020712
inherited	properties
you may wonder why we need to call the hasownproperty method well that s to ensure that only own properties properties that exist physically on the object the ones we defined are enumerated not any inherited properties

3020729
equals	gethashcode
i need to override the equals and gethashcode methods but that doesnâ t really work

3020729
equals	gethashcode
the problems are in equals and gethashcode where i try to get hashcode or equals from itemtype

3020729
equals	gethashcode
a dirty way to fix it is to capture the nullreferenceexception and return false by equals and return base.gethashcode by gethashcode but i hope there is a better way to fix this problem

3020754
stateless	stateful
here s the thing rest is about stateful communications over a stateless protocol

3020754
post	put
note that i used put not post

3020754
post	put
the postback model pretty well obliterates any real hope of doing true rest with real webforms .aspx put and delete are always post and thus fail the rest model

3020770
client-side	server-side
javascript is a client-side language that runs in the browser node.js notwithstanding and mysql is a server-side technology that runs on the server

3020804
mouse	keyboard
techniques such as preventing the left-click of the mouse intercepting keyboard events or converting your entire article into images just make your website less usable

3020810
minimum	max
the minimum for all operations was 0.2085 microseconds and max was 0.2412 microseconds

3020875
rss	feed
java library for reading rss and atom feed

3020882
asterisk	ivr
you can use asterisk and implement an ivr flow using agi php scripts

3020887
jcl	rexx
if the parameters together with the rexx member name exceeds 100 bytes the method mentioned by ron patterson won t work as jcl syntax only allows a maximum paramater length of 100 bytes

3020897
post	get
one is for the get and the other for post

3021079
rss	feed
most blogs and sites have an rss feed

3021079
rss	feed
here is a list with some rss feed

3021103
getter	setter
if j has a public no-arg constructor and for every getter in j with type t and name n there is a corresponding setter with the same name and type

3021107
opera	firefox
and i can t figure out why there are a couple of instances of document.all in the code but my attempts to replace these have broken the code besides the fact it works in firefox and not opera makes me think that document.all is not the issue

3021144
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
opera ie google-chrome firefox will carry over the anchor to the new page

3021151
google-chrome	firefox
by default google-chrome and firefox block disabling the right click menu

3021153
kerberos	ntlm
it will return ntlm or kerberos

3021153
kerberos	ntlm
if it s ntlm you ll need to do some work configuring sql server to use kerberos

3021191
put	get
i have tried to put edit box but unable to get the click event .

3021200
hide	show
for example - i want to show or hide button for user depending on role

3021204
versioning	upgrade
the solution is to upgrade to the latest versioning of jquery

3021233
inherited	properties
is faster than the in operator because it doesn t checks for inherited properties

3021275
n-gram	words
in this way your terms will be indexed twice and will appear both as exact words and as n-gram

3021302
inherited	properties
as you may know these two tables have modifieddate and rowguid columns so the person class should not have these properties because it inherited them from the businessentity class

3021302
inherited	properties
my question is how can i modify the model to support inherited and optimistic concurrency on both person and businessentity classes tables on modifieddate properties column

3021350
put	get
just remember to put correct indices on your database table or you will get bad performance

3021377
int	chars
do_assign chars const chars const unsigned int

3021379
width	height
def examplecontents vrule height 1in width 1pt par some text

3021467
folder	directory
now goto conf folder under jboss_home server instance2 directory

3021476
hide	show
the problem is that i have to hide all the divs on page load and show only specific div inside this hidden div on image click

3021488
gif	png
create a jpg or gif png which is 6px heigher and 6px widther than the given thumbnail

3021495
button	checkbox
it just works as a two option checkbox button

3021500
vcard	vcf
you can use the contacts- import from vcf function to import contacts from a vcard file

3021509
hide	show
if you want something like the status bar in chrome you just need to have a qframe at the bottom of your windows and show or hide it when you need it

3021509
width	height
frame.setgeometry 0 this- height - frame.sizehint height this- width frame.sizehint height

3021525
parallels	bootcamp
parallels will work with a bootcamp partition but has some drawbacks

3021525
parallels	bootcamp
for me the biggest pain was that parallels vms from a bootcamp part can t be suspended and resumed quickly and easily as ones running off an image file

3021536
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
newer videos on this site works with ie 6 7 8 through fall back to flash player not tested on ie9 firefox had to render a separate ogv file since no h.264 support safari google-chrome iphone safari android browser the desire model didn t figure out the browser type

3021579
rtos	ecos
ecos another open-source rtos but somewhat more than a scheduler kernel

this uses both shadow copying so my algorithm would need to be discovering and loading them from the shadow-copy drop folder not from the bin folder and it sets up the privatebinpath as being relative to the base directory

3021643
fiddler	charles
either use wireshark or better is fiddler or charles proxy

3021678
width	height
set the width for the qtextdocument object to your desired with and then call the function size height this should return the height required for the width you have give it before

3021695

the iphoneos scales every picture with above 2 million pixels width height 50 down

3021746
ncover	partcover
only do line coverage using the profiling apis for pre-.net 4 ncover free partcover

3021768
int	double
also i need an angle because the user can rotate these elements so i can also make a int int is okay i do not need a double value therefore

3021784
folder	directory
for simplicities sake take the path name folder from the bin directory in your android project and place it in the above directory

3021786
button	checkbox
you can skin them to look like checkbox if you like but most users know what radio button do and how they are meant to behave

3021797
moq	moles
a cool feature of moles is that it can mock static non-virtual methods and sealed classes which is not possible with frameworks like moq

3021814
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i tried the code in firefox 3.6.3 internet explorer 8 opera 10.53 and safari 4.0.5 and it works just fine

3021828
accessor	properties
dot notation can be used with any accessor method whether declared as a properties or not provided that the compiler knows that the object to the left of the dot has the accessor

3021876
width	height
width height width height

3021881
google-chrome	firefox
it s only this way in ie8 and works fine in google-chrome and firefox

3021903
width	height
you basically multiply the user s x y coordinates with the width height ratio

3021903
width	height
edit2 in the case of a webpage the safest way would be to record the user s viewport width height and then embed the same webpage in a container like an iframe with that exact size in order to replay the actions

3021919
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
when the application releases memory the addresses blocks are marked as free and will be reused on subsequent allocation requests new malloc realloc etc by the application

3022051
getter	setter
as far as the arraylist field is concerned you should use a generic strongly typed collection and use a property with getter and setter instead of field for better encapsulation

3022065
hide	show
i think what u basically want to a button show hide which can be controlled at the time of oncreate call

3022187
urdu	arabic
we use arabic characters with little modification like parsi urdu etc

3022206
versioning	upgrade
having just upgrade to a newer versioning of htmlunit 2.4 i ve noticed certain tests are failing when comparing the output of astext

3022233

3022260
cos	sin
i ve found instead of -g cos pitchangle sin rollangle

3022295
int	boolean
you might want to try parsing the result into an int instead of a boolean

3022300
listboxitem	textbox
the problem is that i also want the listboxitem to be selected when one of its textbox s child gets focused

3022322
addition	multiplication
it is useful to describe multiplication to someone as repeated addition when you are trying to get him or her to understand the concept but you wouldn t want him or her to continue to think of it that way

3022322
addition	multiplication
you would want him or her to learn the rules of multiplication instead of always translating back to the rules of addition

3022334
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
on illegalargumentexception vs nullpointerexception

3022334
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
while your original code throws illegalargumentexception on null arguments guava s preconditions.checknotnull throws nullpointerexception instead

3022334
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
if a caller passes null in some parameter for which null values are prohibited convention dictates that nullpointerexception be thrown rather than illegalargumentexception

3022341
maven	pom.xml
the maven mindset appears to be that configuration is the responsibility of the pom.xml author not the mojo implementor

3022359
ssl	https
if https is used to work in the admin ssl certificate should be valid

3022372
queue	fifo
there are multiple algorithms available i ended up implementing the an optimistic approach to lock-free fifo queue which avoids the aba problem via pointer-tagging needs the cmpxchg8b instruction on x86 and it runs fine in a production app written in delphi

3022382
put	get
i get sql logging on standard output when i run unit tests if i put the following line in either config environment.rb or config environments test.rb

3022399
puts	gets
nomatter wich id # i puts in my url i always gets the first tab

3022426

3022430
google-chrome	safari
note that it uses webkit rendering engine so you ll see how the site would look on safari or google-chrome

3022447
post	get
i think what you are after is the message that are displayed when trying to reload refresh or back a page that you have posted data to with a post request in oppose to a get therefor since the post-data might be old information you recieve that warning

3022452
fast-forward	merge
allows subsequent merge from design to production to be a fast-forward one

3022487
int	double
personally i d go with three double however if you say you only need the resolution precision of int then three separate values is a perfectly acceptable solution

3022488
cdr	cons
anyway i m currently learning about lists and before that i learned about cons car and cdr

3022523
cdr	cons
you get a list with 1 2 as the first element the car and 3 4 as the rest the cdr because the first argument to cons is the first element of the list and the second argument is a list containing the remaining items

3022548
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome the height variable increases as the inner div expands to fit all the text

3022554
int	double
without knowing the language grammar i expect you would be better served by having token types for less_than less_than_or_equal and also float double int etc

3022583
srp	principles
s srp single responsibility principles the notion that an object

3022583
ocp	principles
o ocp open closed principles the notion that â œsoftware â should

3022583
lsp	principles
l lsp liskov substitution principles see also design by contract

3022588
yacc	bison
i d like to suggest you to lookup to the flex and yacc aka lex bison tools of the u x operating systems these are powerful parsers and scanners generators that take a grammar and output a compilable and readily usable program

3022603
ant	maven
actually i don t think that wrapping an ant build into a maven project is enough for sonar sonar won t discover your source and output directory

3022625
accessor	properties
in accessor methods for properties

3022629
hide	show
the view will use the bool property to hide or show the control

3022687
int	chars
now if the expression t 0 compiles if 0 can be converted to a t then foo result is sizeof chars 1 and else foo result is sizeof int

3022728
cdr	cons
that s the reason cons a b draws only the car part as a separate list and not the cdr

3022754
width	margin
if that s not possible then giving it margin-left equal to the width of the green box plus its margin will be your best bet

3022758
many-to-many	one-to-many
so securitygroups is in many-to-many relationship with user table and one-to-many with lookupapplciation fk

3022790
accessor	properties
here is the accessor for the default timestamp properties in a core data template project

3022811
width	height
which is better but the width appears to be stretched and the height is messed up

3022812
submit	submission
when submission i d like to submit changes to all of them

3022820
width	height
you can use getdevicecaps getdc getdesktopwindow vertsize to obtain height in millimeters of the physical screen. and similarly with horzsize and the width

3022827
inherited	subclassing
inherited if you have two subclassing

3022841
jtree	jxtreetable
- the one which is easier to explain is that in jtree embedded within a jxtreetable i no longer have leaf file icon but gray bullet instead..

3022864
getter	setter
so i m hosting a project of mine on codeplex where i use a very jquery-esque technique for defining properties self-contained getter setter functions very similar to the one you re using

3022864
getter	setter
take notice that the property is a single function where providing a value as the first parameter invokes the setter and leaving out the parameter invokes the getter

3022921
textblock	itemscontrol
details area is just a stackpanel with a itemscontrol wrapping textblock which repeats 6 times

3022934
ready	each
i develop my app in linux for both unix and win32 cross compile at each build platforms so a ready to use function would be nice

3022964
int	chars
chars should be of type int or better

3022979
getter	setter
if you want to have extra logic in your domain model classes besides the normal getter and setter for your properties you ll have to add them yourself

3022981
post	get
meanwhile if i figure it out before i get a response i ll post my own answer.

3022998
listview	gridview
if yes in my opinion it s pretty slow so i ended up using listview with gridview

3022999
folder	directory
i did it more than a year ago so i m not totally sure if it has to be directly in the directory or under a folder called plugins

3023001
persistent	transient
if i interpret this as how do i add a method that is not related to persistent then you need to use the transient annotation on the getallchildnodes method

3023024
put	get
here is a fairly common validation to ensure you don t get nonsensical dates put into a timestamp

3023030
ssl	https
https and ssl in general is there to stop third parties anything other than server or client from being able to read the data exchange

3023047
pull	push
this will create a local branch abranchname tracking fetch pull push the remote branch abranchname

3023077
nsmutablestring	nsstring
also it returns an nsstring instead of an nsmutablestring which is not a big deal but i feel that if you say you are returning an immutable object you probably should

3023098
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox i get and while in safari and google-chrome i get but

3023138
x86	64bit
one possibility your programm is compiled with x64 or anycpu on a 64bit machine but the dll has been compiled with support for x86 only

3023144
width	height
i should always set width and height could be determined by the server when the user posts the image - would work as long as the image doesn t change.

3023145
persistent	transient
short answer you define them as transient of an undefined type and then store their values in one or more persistent attributes

3023224
pull	push
you can use the local protocol a simple shared path is enough for two git repositories on two pc on the same lan to push pull from each other

3023282
google-chrome	firefox
in my app i send down a deep tree and it fails in google-chrome but succeeds in firefox

3023348
put	get
the out put i get for the above is

3023360
radiobuttonlist	checkboxlist
i have two radiobuttonlist and one checkboxlist on the page

3023384
submit	submission
when the user select a value the form will automatically submit i want the item that the user has selected to be selected after submission the form

3023409
int	boolean
and you could use a boolean or int return type depending on which scenario you have

3023455
postgresql	mysql
likewise you can find similar information about postgresql and mysql

3023507
put	get
stanford university have put up an excellent series of lectures for free from their iphone course that will get you up to speed with iphone development with a few assignments to do on the side this is good because it offers some structure to your learning

3023544
fgets	fgetc
maybe you should use fgets instead of fgetc while youre reading lines

3023673
updatepanel	scriptmanager
add a scriptmanager put the content you want refreshed inside an updatepanel and then add the ajax timer

3023748
maven	m2e
i am not sure if m2e import a maven project internally using maven-eclipse-plugin to convert into an eclipse project

3023763
doxygen	miktex	graphviz	miktex
neither do i want to have to go to all the web pages and check manually if there are compatibility issues with the new version of doxygen graphviz and the latest version of miktex for example nor do i want to have to navigate to the download pages and run the setups all by myself

3023765
mouseup	mousedown
using settimeout defers the execution until the call stack is empty again which would be when the browser has finished processing all the events that happened when you clicked mousedown mouseup click focus etc

3023776
width	margin
so i think you could bind the margin of the help menuitem to the width of the menu

3023776
width	margin
but you would have to use a converter to calculate the margin from the width

3023794
junit	jsfunit
the jsfunit faq says currently you can use the junit 4 jar but annotations such as test will not work

3023816
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i m wondering if the behaviour differs for each version of google-chrome firefox safari and opera

3023826
jsf	seam
i d considered spring.mvc and seam as framework alternatives and jsp jstl and facelets jsf as view technologies before realising the cms may drive this choice

3023836
updatepanel	scriptmanager
i have an asp.net site that uses jquery and asp.net updatepanel and scriptmanager

3023864
nsurlrequest	nsmutableurlrequest
you re initializing a nsurlrequest instead of a nsmutableurlrequest

3023965
abc	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
abcs allow classes that don t actually inherited from them to be registered as subclassing anyway so that such classes can be subclassing of the abc for such checks

3023977
rank	max
the table will usually have 30-40 rows max but if the user drags row 1 far down the list then potentially all the rows would need to be updated to update the rank field

3024045
folder	directory
this gives you a set of all the files in the containing folder without any of the hidden .svn directory

3024053
width	height
the gldrawtexioes parameters are x y z width height and since every other part of your code seems to reference those numbers as 320x480 that might be contributing to the cropped incorrectly problem - try switching the 320 and 480 in the cropping rectangle and the width height in the gldrawtex call

3024067
width	height
if you are trying to get the value of the height and width immediately after setting insance.htmltext you are not going to get the calculated size of the container

3024130
wadl	wsdl
the most popular usage of wsdl and wadl in the same way is code generation

3024213
range	max	range	min	min	max
i personally used the range filter and the internal datetime timestamps for max min

3024271

post	get
i suggest you get your retalliation in first post on daily wtf now

3024295
centos	linux
i got a teammate to play around with xvfb x virtual framebuffer on centos linux

3024308
wordpress	phpbb
it s the world s most popular database software it s what they use in wordpress phpbb and drupal

3024312
sorting	filtering
note that i talk of a list to select an item from but actually it is some more complex structure that allows quick sorting and filtering that is also the reason why i do not use an itemscontrol here but i don t feel like that s relevant for the question

3024343
folder	directory
as javax.media is a jvm extension javac would look either in the jvm s extensions directory or that provided by -extdirs then in user class folder then in user source folder

3024349
int	chars
oh keep in mind that the array is of type int and is full of numerical representations of ascii chars

3024360
int	chars
since your array is of type then -- assuming that each element represents a single ascii chars -- you ll need to convert those int s to byte s first

3024392
int	chars
the first like skips 1000 int takes them while they re not a null-terminator and then converts them to a chars as appropriate for int representing ascii codes

3024405
stateless	stateful	decoder	encoder
yes it should be safe to use the same encoding object as it s designed to be stateless - whereas encoder and decoder are stateful maintaining incomplete characters etc if necessary

3024409

i m trying to display a qlabel without parent at a fixed position using pyqt

3024528
post	get
if you do not want use sessions as matthew suggested you can pass post params in get to the new page consider some limitations such as security and max length of get params in query string

3024528
post	get
anyway consider passing your data from post in get to the proper view in case data is not sensitive of course

3024538
versioning	upgrade
when we decide to update a dependency project we release it to ourselves which requires manual tagging manual copying current.zip into a releases area and giving it a versioning number and copying that into the build of the projects that depend on the upgrade

3024570
pull	push
you will have to set up your own deployer which can pull the updated code out of these branches and push them to stage

3024578

3024604
erlang	lisp
i d recommend learning a functional language such as erlang lisp or perhaps certain aspects of python

3024627
versioning	upgrade
this is the recommended solution - it allows the user to upgrade to later versioning of qt easily

3024664
put	get
in fact i ve put debug statements in every single onxxx method within the searchable activity and i never see any of them get triggered

3024677

hide	show
my last thought was that i could have 3 different chart controls and just hide and show them as appropriate

3024743
google-chrome	firefox
inside of your firefox installation it s inside google-chrome classic.jar the path is skin classic global media throbber.png

3024770
maven	m2e
m2e does that since it embeds maven

3024770
maven	m2e
i am not sure if m2e import a maven project internally using maven-eclipse-plugin to convert into an eclipse project

3024801
ubuntu	linux
the character map on ubuntu and i assume most other linux distros is fantastic

3024817
cruisecontrol	teamcity
we re considering migrating from cruisecontrol cruisecontrol.net to teamcity

3024817
cruisecontrol	teamcity
a portion of our product is a cocoa app and i need to figure out if i want to try to migrate it to teamcity as well or if it would be better to leave it running under cruisecontrol

3024821
serializable	deserialization
there are potentially several data transformations happening db relational format - orm - web service xml serializable - web tier deserialization

3024861
bids	ssis
you can use business intelligence development studio bids to create an ssis project and have much more granularity over your data source the transformations on your data and how you want to import it into your destination database s

3024879
bazaar	git
i think in the end all three git mercurial and bazaar will do the job

i wrote a query to directly get post from the wp_posts

3025223
serializable	deserialization
the usual best course of action is just to match your serializable and deserialization code to each other carefully and suppress the warnings that result

3025246
hide	show
when i used show function for it nothing happened it seems that hide and show methods are for css set of a control not visible property.

due to the folder structure of the project i am unable to use ajax-related background load methods since the files i need are loaded a few directory up and over.

3025286
put	get
when you finally get something you think works put the query into a script on a webserver and hit it with ab apache bench

3025287
stdout	stderr
beware that if you redirect stdout stderr and the buffers fill up which is entirely possible using gcc it can deadlock so harvest those into stringbuilders

3025293
stringstream	ifstream
what i have already is the whole ifstream and internal string stringstream storage so i can read word per word

3025299
post	get
i want to be able to get a handler i ve created in the service class to post messages from the activity

one for mouseenter and one for mouseleave

3025496
hash	salt
you need to store the salt in the database along with the password hash

3025497
jar	manifest.mf
you should build a jar that s an osgi bundle so it contains the required manifest.mf with a plug-in id and a version number this does not change the fact that the jar remains executable

3025534
folder	directory
instead of grabbing the last folder name i actually wanted to find everything up until some known directory name

3025542
uptime	reboot
you can use mach_absolute_time and it s used internally by some things but that s just system uptime so it fails if the phone reboot

3025604
disk	ram
the paging file fragmentation causes a lot of disk head seeks badly affecting the odds that another process can swap itself back into ram in a reasonable amount of time

3025612

i upgrade my cygwin installation at home and ran into a similar problem though maybe not the exact same problem -- the perl debugger still responds to my input but does not display my input and fubars my input even after i quit the debugger

3025680
glassfish	weblogic
oracle has pretty much said that glassfish will be meant to be a development environment and referenceimpl only where weblogic is the production server

3025681
width	height
also make sure that the height and width of things are specified such that the layout doesn t change as things are downloaded this makes the site feel slow

3025681

postgresql	mysql
sql server mysql postgresql oracle etc. you need to rewrite your database access layer using sql so you don t corrupt data

3025705
hash	salt
the salt is a static thing that you generate when you create you user record and you store it along with the user id and the hash of the password + salt

3025705
hash	salt
when the user tries to logon you use the id to lookup the salt combine that with their password hash it and compare to the stored hash

3025705
hash	salt
the salt exists so that an attacker with access to your security database cannot pre-prepare a database of password - hash mappings and then perform simple reverse lookups to try to determine passwords

you might not end up with the most optimal of sql queries but if you get an array of all the post ids you want to use by using your own sql first then using wp_query along with the arguments post__in and posts_per_page wordpress will handle everything for you including sql limits pagination and so forth

3028609

if you are ok with keeping every cookie in memory during operations simply pickle ing the jar is simplest and of course put the blob in the db and get it back from there when you re restarting -- gives you a big byte string for the whole jar and policy thereof of course not just the cookies and rebuilds it once you ve reloaded s as a blob from the db

adding a new child updating an existing child or deleting a child has no effect on the parent object so there s no need for the parent to know explicitly about all the children except when it comes time to pay college tuition

children	parent
however removing the parent has an adverse effect on the children objects as they need to be deleted or re-parented otherwise are orphaned and in an invalid state

3029887
moq	typemock
most mocking frameworks including moq i think but i don t use it myself do not dictate how the fakes are passed to the class under test typemock isolator is an exception here in that it has magic that can inject the dependencies into the class under test

3029887
moq	nmock
there s no reason why you couldn t use an ioc to register your moq-created fakes and supply them to your class under test but that really has nothing to do with moq or nmock or rhino mocks

decoder	encoder
so i have some other full example of encoder and decoder

3029997
hash	md5
hash uri with md5 or sha1 and that s all

3030014
getter	setter
my problem is that i know our application will grow substantially in the future and writing all the getter setter serialization factories etc

3030014
getter	setter
i ve then written an annotation processor to preprocess my shared models and generate an implementing class with all the getter setter serialization lazy-loading etc

3030020
chunked	transfer-encoding
edit this is the intended behavior after all - nick points out that the files are being transferred with the transfer-encoding chunked header

3030036
stateless	stateful
secondly when contemplating converting an access app for deployment in the web browser the whole application model is different from stateful to stateless and so it s not just a matter of a few access features that are unsupported but of a completely different fundamental model of how the ui objects interact with the data

3030067
hide	show
for example when i hide one and show another widget in same place.

3030083
int	double
in templates.h i will have to nm_template_declare_list int nm_template_declare_list double while in templates.c i will need to nm_template_define_list int nm_template_define_list double in order to have the code behind a list of int double and so on generated

3030086
dictionary	map
instead of this looping for match approach you could use a real map dictionary whatever is called in stl from string to number and then switch on that number as the above example

3030125
post	get
if this answer doesn t help you can post real example maybe we ll get better idea why you need this done like that

3030126
width	height
my question is if i am storing the width and height of the client and the x y position of the click

3030135
width	height
width and height

3030146
touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesmoved	touchesended
basically impliment override touchesbegan touchesended touchesmoved on the uiview in question and put in your custom code there

3030174
opera	firefox
for the security reasons opera and firefox don t allow to trigger file input

3030189
profiling	benchmarking
but if it matters that much to you then profiling or benchmarking it

3030199
width	height
the creator of the plugin gave me a quick tip for the expanding part but the code i m using has a set height and width and i want them to be variable depending on how much content is in the expanded state

3030210
width	height
if i am storing the width and height of the client and the x y position of the click

3030221
cvs	svn
if i don t want certain files in the cvs or svn i add them to the ignored files context menu team add to svn cvs ignore

3030236
accessor	properties
use accessor properties

3030237
accessor	properties
each element in the enumeration will then be a datarow which has an index rather than properties accessor or

3030258
free	malloc
for the specific example of containers i wouldn t bother - just create a list with void data in it and either use malloc and free to create the data or give the list have a pair of function pointers to create and destroy values

3030329
innodb	myisam
increase your buffers innodb your key_buffers myisam and some query cache buffers

3030353
int	chars
i have a bunch of int ranging from 1 to 999 and i need to convert these into strings but when i do that i need them to be 3 chars long

3030395
range	minimum
if they should all have the same minimum maximum range then they should all be parameterized with the same model values controlling the comment validation

3030440
post	get
if you receive numerical values from for example a form you just need to ensure data quality by converting the input into a number any input from get or post are always regarded as strings by php unless you convert them and any malicious code will be removed

3030455
getter	setter
now xcode generates getter and setter methods for you that will handle the retain statement for you

3030553
post	get
you realise that varybyparam creates a new entry in the outputcache for each varying parmateter set in the http get post querystring

3030697
int	double
this is working fine when i am adding two int or two double

3030709
tunnel	vpn
using a ssh vpn tunnel so that the one connects to the db via the middle server seems to remove any possible benefit of maintaining middle

3030760
int	double
you can define overloads for all the possible combinations of all the instantiations of the template so you d effectively have operators defined for double + double int + double double + int etc.

3030764
hash	salt
either the salt is wrong your password is wrong or the hash somehow got screwed up

3030786
equals	gethashcode
if you are creating a custom list type then you could override the equals and gethashcode methods to support this behavior but it isn t going to happen on the built in types

3030807
integer	unsigned
oh and in production code you ll probably want to properly namespace that and add something for signed unsigned mismatches in integer types

3030830
setinterval	settimeout
if so then you can just pop lines off the array using settimeout which is better than setinterval for most animations

3030841
getter	setter
you can use an anemic approach attributes plus getter and setter to keep things simple and avoid the step of writing business logic in the same step

3030859
google-chrome	firefox
this doesn t work in any browser i ve tried it with ie firefox google-chrome

3030914
disk	ram
you ll need to tweak the 30 seconds a bit to calibrate because of course the power available ram disk speed etc of your development machine can t just happen to be exactly identical to google s and also many subsystems esp

3030935
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
i began to run out of screen real estate so i decided to kill my normal uinavigationcontroller title which was text and added the following code moving my searchbar from the table to the uinavigationbar

3030960
post	put
the docs for uploading have a complete example of the headers multipart-related formatting and xml you would be sending with the addition of the access control tags as per this part of the docs -- but the example is a post not a put because it s uploading a video not changing its info and access control

3030960
put	get	post	put	post	get
to send http methods other than get and post via python s standard library use httplib make an httpconnection and then call its request method with put as the first argument then url the part after the host see the examples at the end of this section of the python online docs body the part that in the example in the docs for the youtube 2.0 api starts

3030972
pop-up	dialog
what i want to do is create a dialog pop-up where a user enters text to search for and the code would take that text and search for it within all the text in an edittext control and if it s found highlight it

3030988
width	height
my plan is just to position an empty div over the image absolutely with a background color width and height 100 and opacity 0

3030988
mouseover	mouseout
then using jquery on mouseover i d have the opacity fade to 0.3 or so and fade back to zero on mouseout

3031003
uwsgi	cherokee
so i went through the docs in the cherokee cookbook and replaced the uwsgi line with a tweaked version of what was replied in my mailing list question

3031016
struts	wicket
the browser interfaces have been ported from struts 1.x to wicket

3031041
int	chars
i understand that the amount of chars in the string will make the int increase greatly forcing the value to become a long not an int

3031049
mouseup	mousedown
when the drop shadow is added i can only mousedown to drag and mouseup to drop the sprite if the mouse events occur within the original location of the sprite when it was added to the stage

3031068
put	get
also you can put in front of the person s name and they will get a message flag

3031068
width	height
normally hidden content has a height and width of zero

3031068
width	height
but jquery is able to determine the hidden content size but it still has some problems because you might need to limit the width or height of the hidden content

3031068
width	height
so what i ended up doing was adding the hidden content in a inside of the box and adding a data-size attribute to the box which contains the width and height of the expanded hidden content for example

3031115
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

3031130
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to a newer versioning of perl

3031139
rss	feed
i am trying to style an rss feed using xslt

3031145

i need to get the content complete html of a page say. someotherdomain.com somepage loaded in iframe from an asp.net mvc c# application without using webclient or httpwebrequest

3031155
multiplying	multiplication
it s not the multiplication s fault of course -- remove the statement where you multiplying nb and you ll see similar issues anyway

3031239
getter	setter
i have the following typical field with a getter and setter and i would like to insert the indicated code into the setter method that records if the field was modified as well to insert the indicated isfirstnamemodified field to also track if the field was modified or not

3031265
uwsgi	cherokee
i recently got my first app to work in uwsgi with cherokee

3031278
decimal	ieee
the new ieee 754 has support for floating-point decimal and some chips notably ibm pseries have such support in hardware

3031300
javassist	bcel
yes you can one approach is to use some form of byte code manipulation javassist asm bcel or a higher level aop library sit on top of one of these tools aspectj jboss aop

3031391
inherited	properties
an interface defines what methods and properties must be publicly available in any class that inherited from the interface

3031391
inherited	subclassing
rather you have to instantiate a subclassing that inherited from the abstract-class

3031402
webkit	gecko	google-chrome	firefox
due to the complex history of ie5 6 7 firefox gecko webkit google-chrome css2 and boxmodel there are some shortcomings to layout model

3031416
fadein	fadeout
sometimes the slideshow on my website which uses fadeout and fadein to cycle through three main images will fadein a new photo without fading the old one

3031461
subtract	add
then you can say if hours is greater than or equal to 12 then subtract by 12 otherwise add 12 to it for example by

3031551
folder	directory
in terms of a directory structure for an analysis project i ll often also have the following folder

3031581
getter	setter
create a getter and setter for session and use lazy initialization in the getter

3031590
persistent	transient
you can solve this problem by declaring your custom getter as transient that says this getter does not represent a persistent property

3031598
chunked	transfer-encoding
it s possible it s being served using transfer-encoding chunked which is a perfectly legitimate way of transferring responses over http

3031616
min	max
heap is needed for priority queue for example getting the min max element will cost o 1 inserting an element o log n

3031676
google-chrome	firefox
example - works on google-chrome release and nightly builds of webkit and tracemonkey firefox

3031771
ubuntu	linux
i have done this on windows vs2008 c# sockets but not on linux ubuntu 10.04

3031773
versioning	upgrade
tapestry has done a lot of non-compatible upgrade with no continuation of support of older versioning

3031774
rss	feed
i have a class dataimporter which has the code to download an rss feed

3031803
client-side	server-side
it all boils down to server-side - you are in control client-side - public so prone to abuse

3031851
cvs	svn
as far as i know there is an option in cvs2svn which stores the cvs revision in an svn property

3031862
postgresql	mysql
between postgresql and mysql postgresql copied the syntax limit from mysql in v6.5 and added the offset syntax it may be that that was copied as well but i think mysql only had the comma-syntax back then

3031880
int	double
now for example if you add double and int it will yield double as the result

3031884
background-color	transparency
but in case you re merely looking for a transparency background you can set the background-color using the rgba rrr ggg bbb aaa construct in which the last number is the alpha transparency value

3031954
integer	radix
parses the string argument as a signed integer in the radix specified by the second argument

3031957
put	get
i want to ask how to get a json file from the server that has more recent messages and put them to the top i mean above the first

3031962
put	get
the only sane way i can see is to put it in dialoga b but i would then need to pass the controller all the way down through classes that dont even need it and it ll get all spaghetti

3031995
short	base
in short you can t use .live like this it has to follow a selector base of some sort this is from the .live docs

3032009
hide	show
depending on this id value we either show or hide the with the end date

3032012
int	double
you could use an int or a double to store a distance but then you have to add some more information to make the value make sense for example naming the variable distanceinmeters

3032048
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
no luck they are only enabled for openfiledialog not savefiledialog

3032066
width	height
exception in thread main java.lang.illegalargumentexception width -1 and height -1 cannot be 0

3032066
width	height
i have tried to find a place in the code where width and height can be

3032066
width	height
the width and height errors are now

3032076
int	chars
i m new to the c++ so maybe someone can say what the proper way to write a function that gets a string chars represents number and converts it to the int number

3032085
ada	pascal
in a language with strict range checking such as ada or pascal the method might be implemented as pseudo code

3032090
disk	ram
when you program trying to access a memory location that is not currently loaded to ram a page fault occur and the page is brought from the disk

3032109
oncreate	recreate
after the user switches back to my activity its oncreate method is invoked again and tabs are recreate

3032122
hide	show
i also have the problem want main window with child window user controls to show hide on button click from the mainwindow.

3032126
pull	push
publication push pull

3032138
apache	nginx
use a cluster of mongrel services for which loads of alternatives exist mongrel-cluster or using apache nginx .

3032170
hide	show
i can hide the windows althought i have to call one of the methods two times with sw_hide option but when i call the method with a sw_show flag it simply doesn t show

3032173
disk	ram
there may be less ram installed 1 gb than there is address space 4 gb therefore some stuff the least-recently-used stuff may be swapped out by the o s from ram onto a page file on disk

3032173
disk	ram
free some ram by swapping something least-recently-used from ram to disk

3032173
disk	ram
swap into ram from disk whatever is supposed to be at that address which at some time in the past had been swapped out from that address to disk

3032188
keydown	keyup
you can test it a bit here keep in mind this fires on blur usually though you may want the keyup keydown or keypress events rather than change if you re looking to do it per character

3032207
dictionary	map
i use a dictionary to map this id to the client sockets file descriptor

3032222
cvs	svn
as khmarbaise says to keep a record of the old cvs revision numbers in svn use the --cvs-revnums flag when converting

3032222
cvs	svn
keeping the cvs revision numbers as an svn property on the revision seems like a good idea but in my experience they never get used

3032224
scheme	racket
so invoking it requires a single value as racket requires which helps clarifying what happens here mit scheme seems to silently treat it as unspecified

3032315
firefox	safari
i needed to use .replacewith data instead of .html data . evidently firefox was compensating for this but safari wasn t

3032327
free	realloc
for example i ve seen implementations of realloc the c standard one which checks to see if the current block can just absorb a free block following it

3032328
google-chrome	firefox
it runs in google-chrome using jquery and is very handy...it also includes links to the same question on meta that follow the comment trail on the tweaks needed to get it running in both google-chrome firefox

3032363
ubuntu	debian

3032375
nsstring	nsdata
both of the classes have nsstring and nsinteger maybe also nsdata and nsdate

3032407
ironruby	ironpython
ironpython and ironruby ship with the source code for the .net 4.0 implementation of system.linq.expressions

3032430
public	protected
however it can still be indirectly instantiated as a protected private member of a public class

3032459
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i am building a custom uinavigationcontroller not subclassing it i subclass uiviewcontroller for this i would like to have the instances of uiviewcontroller that are added to my custom navigationcontroller to get a reference to the custom navigation controller when they access the self.navigationcontroller

3032459
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
you would from a uiviewcontroller that belong to a uinavigationcontroller do this to push a new view controller to the stack

3032459
navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller
so in the above case when it is the custom navigation controller getting a controller pushed to it it will in the pushviewcontroller method set the navigationcontroller to the custom controller it self so that when the newly added view controller does self.navigationcontroller it will also get a reference to the custom nav-controller

3032459
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
but his approach runs into the issue mentioned above i have no way to get a reference to the custom uinavigationcontroller owning the pushed uiviewcontroller from within these added controllers

3032473
hide	show
you ll have to register an onchange event handler to your dropdown list so that when it s value changes you ll check if it s current selected item is the one you want and then show the input or hide it otherwise

3032538
folder	directory
store it in user data folder which are usually hidden under the user s profile directory

3032571
trie	tree
i am building a suffix trie unfortunately no time to properly implement a suffix tree for a 10 character set

3032610
.htaccess	httpd.conf
setting in .htaccess or httpd.conf would be easy - but i don t have access to that

3032628
maven	m2e
using eclipse 3.5 when i create a new maven project m2e automatically adds j2se1.4 to libraries and compiler compliance level to 1.4 project properties java compiler

3032649
ant	maven
i am not sure if you can easily hook it into a svn precommit hook filter but integration into maven could be done with an ant call like this taken from this demo.xml build script

3032684
accelerometer	gyroscope
if you are relying on hardware features such as camera compass gyroscope accelerometer for your application you d need a device that has this feature as the emulator does not them

3032714
post	get
to get your fields passed as query string parameters instead of form post data

3032728
junit	easymock
however if you really want classic unit tests i guess the closest you can get is compiling your jsp into a servlet class then calling the servlet methods directly from junit using a mocking framework like easymock to prepare the http request response etc

3032786
min	max
as long as and it always should be it s impossible for randx to be both less than or equal to min and greater than or equal to max

3032786
min	max
instead you can get a value in between min and max using

3032790
uwsgi	cherokee
so the way this works is that cherokee is managing a running uwsgi instance in the back ground for you

3032790
uwsgi	cherokee
what i ve noticed so far and i ve not finished looking at is that if you shut down cherokee it doesn t seem to also shut down running uwsgi instances

3032790
uwsgi	cherokee
so your app code is actually run via uwsgi and cherokee is more like a proxy server

3032790
uwsgi	cherokee
that should cause uwsgi to update to your app changes regardless of cherokee

3032815
mongoid	mongomapper
i would expect performance to be the same last time i checked mongomapper lacked rails 3 support - so i am looking at mongoid for now

3032822
inherited	subclassing
work in the constructor such as creating initializing collaborators communicating with other services and logic to set up its own state removes seams needed for testing forcing subclassing mocks to inherited unwanted behavior

3032849
profiling	debugging
if you just specified the mirror element with repository manager location and what repositories urls you want to proxy without that profiling enabled which is practically changing policy for getting snapshots you would have something like central repository disabled messages in your debugging log

3032849
maven	pom.xml
if this works then the reason must be either in maven settings or pom.xml definition

3032854
hash	md5
suppose i have any long hash like a 16 bytes md5 or a 20 bytes sha1

3032916
maven	m2e
in other words you need to configure the maven compiler plugin for 1.6 level compliance and then m2e will derive the appropriate settings under eclipse

3032916
m2e	pom.xml
the pom.xml is the master not m2e

3032920
maven	m2e
this thread reminds us about the difference between m2e within eclipse and a maven script

3032920
m2e	pom.xml
one thing worth to mention that this only applies to the development mode when m2e is configuring eclipse tools such as jdt ajdt and wtp according to the configuration from pom.xml

3032927
put	get
if you put your class in mycompany.collections.generic then you ll get exactly the same level of seamlessness that is achieved by the .net framework itself

3032949
put	get
however if i don t put it around single quotes i ll always get a javascript error when no user is logged in because the syntax is invalid -

3032956
organization	naming
slapping everything into system is a lot like naming all of your variables x or temp and implies that the creator doesn t really understand the point of this level of code delineation and organization

3032966
gif	png
android supports png gif and jpg - i would choose either png or jpg with preferences for jpg since this is presumably a photograph

3032968
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox and the like have it and don t require the client-side code to do anything special

3032974
iprincipal	iidentity
the current authenticated user should be the name in the iidentity assigned to the identity of the iprincipal on the user property of the httpcontext

3033017
getter	setter
but you define properties as getter and or setter functions for the class

3033017
getter	setter
actually you don t even need a variable for a setter getter

3033017
getter	setter
as3 reference on getter and setter

3033023
put	get
and if you actually put a double cast like that into a real project then you deserve to get your ass kicked

3033042
put	get
ps last time i asked similar question but put it wrongly so people got misunderstood and i didn t get my answer

3033073
google-chrome	firefox
i have built a gwt application which runs perfectly in firefox and google-chrome

3033097
width	height
when i start the second activity it sets the background as a gradient occupying the entire window space that is it appears to be fill_parent d for both height and width

3033146
free	malloc
only to get malloc error for object 0x100108e98 incorrect checksum for free object - object was probably modified after being freed. as far as i understand this error memory has already been allocated for this object but i don t see where this happened

3033204
int	double
int to long float or double

3033212
integer	unsigned
but if you are trying this way to know the max value a n bit unsigned integer can have you change 0 into the known value treating n 64 as a special case and you are not able to give a result for n 64 on hardware with 64bit integer unless you use a multiprecision bignumber library

3033223
button	checkbox
i usually use it to detect changes in forms select unselect checkbox and submit them automatically without having to click on submit button which is hided

3033236
google-chrome	safari
because google-chrome and safari are both based on webkit you can try to change the line to to see if that works

3033331
awt	swing
mvc was quite simple with swing but awt and it s paint methods are much more complicated

3033353
min	max
sorting time in stack is o nlog n while you can extract element of maximum priority max min in o log n time

3033362
ironruby	rubinius	jruby	rubinius
and even if they did their compiled methods are vastly different rubinius s compiled methods are rubinius bytecode yarv s compiled methods are yarv bytecode jruby s compiled methods are jvm bytecode ironruby s compiled methods are dlr trees

3033376
versioning	upgrade
all you have to do is import this category copy paste this category into the classes where you want the upgrade uiimage versioning

3033382
awt	swing
view should be just swing or awt classes

3033387
cpython	ironpython
it s possible that jython and ironpython are much faster than cpython as well as they are backed by heavily optimized virtual machines jvm and .net clr

3033407
put	get
edit based on some answers i get here i put this

3033459
cos	sin
most people know that sin cos of 45 is one over root two so normalizing 1 -1 0 will give an easily recognisable value

3033471
affinity	processors
in windows i can set the processors affinity of driver code using kesetsystemaffinitythread and check which processors my code is running on using kegetcurrentprocessornumber

3033526
setinterval	settimeout
using settimeout instead of setinterval allows you to stop the animation with cleartimeout and the use of a variable

3033534
post	get
depending on whether or not your form uses the get or post method you ll have to change the variable name appropriately

3033535
post	get
if you post the form then the variable will be if you get the form default then it will be

3033562
queue	fifo
you can use the existing fifo std queue

3033584
super	implements
remember i am new at php and probably won t implements a solution that is super hard

3033584
put	get
i have to get it for my to put it in my site

3033585
queue	fifo
for example if the container is a fifo queue the pointer would reference the next node in the queue

3033592
uilabel	uibutton
uilabel uicolors uibutton etc. the instantiation of uielements is just taking up space complicating matters and if you need to change a button or color that is used in 14 places it is really bad to have written all the setup code in different places

3033592
initializer	class-method
because these are all class-method i don t need to initializer the isinterfaceelement class to use them

3033601
queue	fifo
for fifo look into std queue

3033602
post	get
verseid id_of_the_verse this way when an user submits a reply in the post array will be the reply related data and in the get the id of the verse

3033608
filesystems	ntfs
...of course you ll still have a problem because now all of your ten million files will be in a single directory and in my experience ntfs a directory with more than a few thousand files in it still over-taxes the filesystems

3033609
post	get
the method of a form in a html page can be post and the action url can contain get arguments being something like so to say

3033611
post	get
yes it is possible to mix both get and post values with one request

post	get
the problem you have is probably that you pass the get value to reply.php which then passes post values to postreply.php

3033611
post	get
you can do this by either specifying the get value in the action parameter of the form tag or you could even switch to a post value with that by adding a to the form

3033718
cgal	gpc
cgal and gpc are only free if my own project is free

3033718
cgal	gpc
but i may want to use my code for a future commercial project so i m hesitant about cgal s open source licenses and gpc s freeware-only restriction

3033754
hide	show
the below code enables me to show and hide row data categorized as quo and cal eventually there will be other categories

3033755

3033841
int	double
when execution subsequently arrives at b ci.get will return a double object---the one that was passed in a ---were the declaration of ci says that its get method is guaranteed to return an int

super	extends
replace all occurrences of extends with super in your declarations including the one you omitted in the loop and it compiles

3033873
google-chrome	firefox
here is what i see in firefox google-chrome ie

3033906

once you do get 64-bit python setup using the methods outlined above above i also found this blog post by aaron meurer helpful for verifying that python is in fact installed as 64-bit

3033968
equals	gethashcode
fun then if you change equals override gethashcode

3033991

3034047
solaris	bsd
i believe the question is platform-independent and would have the same answer as if to do the same thing on a nix bsd solaris system

3034049
folder	directory
i don t know if i got the regular expression search and replace syntax exactly right but the point is you already have a good project you should be able to cut paste regex-replace it to get the same set of files only referenced from a different folder and with the same directory structure

3034086
config	ini
it then reads in config data from a ini file and stores this in the site object

3034108
folder	directory
if you re using bundler it ll download it into a seperate folder hidden in your home directory

3034118

3034176
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png
almost all bitmap formats bmp gif jpg png use 1 or more forms of compression

3034178
sudo	passwd
assuming you understand the risks then you ll realise that you need to build a number of constraints before applying the change which must be implemented in the privilege level which allows passwd to be changed - the code to run this must be a standalone executable with either setuid executoin or called via sudo from your php code

3034196
bazaar	git
etckeeper puts etc under version control it supports multiple version control systems including git mercurial and bazaar and integrates with the package management systems of a number of linux distros apt yum pacman

pretty much all mouse and keyboard events and most anything else initiated by the user are really win32 messages

3034242
int	boolean
i can t speak on the tiny int it might very well be the same but i would not index boolean for the simple reason that they can assume only two values

3034262
folder	directory
in my experience git is very good about storing only binary deltas - i have tested this by adding a directory full of mp3 files to a repository and committing them changing the id3 tags and then committing the changes and before i ran git gc there were clearly two copies of each mp3 in the .git folder but after the git gc the size went back down to just slightly larger than the original working directory

3034270
matplotlib	scipy
you will first need to understand how sampling works then you should use scipy fft routines they are pretty fast in order spit out frequency intensity values then you can use matplotlib to plot such graphics

3034284
qmap	qdatastream
all of the basic collections in qt are supported by qdatastream check for support in the qmap docs as you are only storing other basic qt types and ints you should be ok

3034291
ati	nvidia
i tested the code with the latest nvidia and ati drivers in all three oses on different pcs

3034297
wordpress	joomla
i ve developed several real estate sites using joomla and openrealty and i have tried to create a decent real estate site for my wife using wordpress due to it s ease of use for end-users but unfortunately programming a real estate site in wordpress is tricky

3034306
client-side	server-side
the problem with client side security is cwe-602 client-side enforcement of server-side security are created when the server side is trusting the client with secret resources like passwords or to send report on sensitive information such as the players score in a flash game

3034328
folder	directory
the directory should be a source folder src and the schema-name is the filename of wherever you downloaded the schema to

3034488
ubuntu	linux
i would like to know the ami image which has linux preferably ubuntu php 5 memcached eaccelerator or xcache

3034489
qgraphicsitem	qobject
qgraphicsitem is not derived from qobject and hence does not have an event queue which is needed to handle timer events

3034489
qgraphicsitem	qobject
try using qgraphicsobject or multiple inheritance of qgraphicsitem and qobject which is exactly what qgraphicsobject does

3034501
apache	nginx
there are some great guides on writing apache modules nginx components and lighttly extensions that can ease you into the field

3034523
tabcontrol	tabitem
the template for tabcontrol to generate tabitem

3034591
children	parent
however for normal inheritance scenario superclass might have pre-defined implementation and children who overrides the function will have their vtables pointing to different content than the parent

3034642
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it is pure javascript so it works in firefox google-chrome opera

change all your int type variables to double or float

3034696
int	double
use floats not int an int int is a whole number floats allow decimal places as do double

viewdidappear	viewwillappear
and i love to put initialization and clean up code a nstimer in those viewwillappear viewdidappear viewwilldisapper and viewdidappear methods

3034775
moq	moles
this seems to be a part of microsoft research team and was wondering if anyone here has selected moles over other matured mocking frameworks such as moq

3034781
mbunit	nunit
or maybe instead of writing four different methods you can use rowtest attribute in mbunit or testcase in nunit 2.5.5 onwards to have parametrized tests - here you just write one method and pass in different parameters by specifying them as attributes

3034802
getter	setter
you should probably change zoomcontroler to private so that other classes have to access it via getter and setter

3034805
portrait	landscape
if i rotate my device in landscape then open my application it will present as portrait mode i need to rotate my device to another orientation then it will update

3034806
post	get
you will also need to perform your updates on your ui thread as updating your ui from a background thread can just get lost in the post

3034879
rss	feed
i m not sure how well it handles atom feed but it should pipe in any flavor of rss just fine

3034879
rss	feed
the name comes from its ability to handle rss 1.0 feed which are built on rdf.

3034962
libsvm	liblinear
check out both libsvm and liblinear

3034969
width	height
the idea is that parent div should be positioned relative and child divs absolute and then using top left width and height properties

3034981
ubuntu	debian
if you are just ensuring that the data is safe if the hardware is stolen you might use a full disk encryption solution like truecrypt or pgp wde or ubuntu debian or fedora s built-in approach and require a pin or password on every boot

3035022
config	ini
if you are using the application and bootstrap classes you should probably use .ini style config loading to put some of these parameters into an ini file and maybe register them for use throughout your application with zend_registry

3035053
rss	feed
in my c# asp.net 3.5 application i am using rss feed to get current updates of my website

3035053
rss	feed
there also this rss feed is opening and showing the data

3035053
rss	feed
let me know how to work with rss feed in cloud environment

3035068
google-chrome	firefox
it seems to me that you want to store passwords in a similar fashion as firefox and google-chrome

3035210
integer	unsigned
the zu is used insted of d as the pointer will be a unsigned integer size

3035254
oncreate	ondestroy
i think i should open the db at the oncreate and close it at the ondestroy

3035288
vim	emacs
the only other thing i could reccomend that will run just about anywhere are the two stand bys vim and emacs

3035289
google-chrome	firefox
and use firebug mozilla firefox addons but apparently they applied to google google-chrome too

3035293
vim	emacs
a lot of developers i have worked with use either vim or emacs

3035322
firefox	safari
this table works ok in firefox safari and ie8

3035342
src	attr	rss	feed
for instance on your page that is served through https i would introduce an iframe that would replace your rss feed and in the src attr of the iframe put a url of a script on your server that captures the feed and outputs the html

3035376
int	chars
i m having problems converting a chars array read from file to an int array

3035429

if people need to maintain your code and are coming from stl boost background the expectation is that things work in a certain way

3035449
width	height
move the note â œleftâ relative to itself by half its width and â œdownâ relative to itself by half its height

3035454
glassfish	weblogic
i am migrating a framework from weblogic to glassfish

3035467
integer	unsigned
with printf try using the zu instead of x for printing out a pointer because the pointer is of unsigned integer type ie zu

3035469
equals	gethashcode
override equals and gethashcode appropriately and it should work fine

3035474
equals	gethashcode
if you haven t overloaded the equals and gethashcode in your class the fallback object equality check will fail since the sequences contain two different objects

3035493
opera	firefox
i also install other versions of firefox and opera on those virtual images as well

3035494
disk	ram
create a ram disk to write and read the file from

3035564

i have two iphone sdk 3.0 and 4.0 on two different folder i want to add images to my iphone simulator 4.0 how could i do that the directory such as application support media does not shows when selecting iphone simulator 4.0 please guide me how i could do that

3035587
typedef	struct
as this is tagged c++ can i just point out that you do not need typedef when creating struct in that language

3035588
cvs	svn
same as svn or cvs you need to fetch changes into the second repository before you can commit back to the first and it s this that creates the conflict

3035598
int	double
if you need just one constant number const int or double etc. would be definetly better than enum

3035600
swt	swing
i don t no if that is available for kde but for windows i usally use the eclipse swt file chooser because it is more native than the pure swing implementation

3035635
width	height
chrome is wrongly reporting width and height values for images during or just after load time

3035635
width	height	google-chrome	firefox
also if you specify the width and height values in the img tag the script seems to work as expected in both firefox and google-chrome

3035635
width	height
or will i need to specify the width and height for every image in my code

3035674
draggable	droppable
after i posted my question i had no patience and i decided to ignore ui.sortable altogether building the required functionality from draggable and droppable and using special divs as spacers that would swell up on dragover to facilitate dropping in between tasks

3035730
typemock	moles	moq	typemock	moq	moles
moles is more often compared contrasted to typemock in that it offers a set of facilities outside of moq and or rhinomocks sweet spot

3035738
gif	png
some version of gd generates only png but recent version can ganerate gif and png

3035748

vb.net	vb6	versioning	upgrade
quite a few versioning of visual studio have a built-in upgrade wizard to help you with converting vb6 to vb.net code

3035760
getter	setter
another remark - maybe you should rewrite your getter setter methods for products to export an unmodifiable list and to read the input in a newly created list

3035768
forth	brainfuck
and so forth or a ag ay b brainfuck bx .

3035790
getter	setter
public data members vs getter setter

3035802
getter	setter
with getter and setter you can often change the internal implementation details without changing the visible api and thus avoid having to change any of the code that uses the api of the class in question

3035803
getter	setter
you use setter and getter as an interface to interact with your object so that you can - for example - later add any functionality like validating input data without touching the code that uses the class es

3035804
getter	setter
getter and setter can do validation and lazy instantiation whereas public members cannot

3035815
getter	setter
setter and getter apply to properties whatever properties are in your code

3035815
getter	setter
you can then define setter and getter for this variable with any angle unit that you think relevant

3035881
put	get
expression non-capturing syntax is used so that the delimiters captured don t get put into the result array split puts capture groups into the result array if they appear in the pattern

3035963
post	put
when doing an http post you shouldn t put the data you want to change into the url

3035975
accessor	properties
lock the properties accessor for each object using a critical section

3036034
put	get
i think you can get hold of the text from inside the textboxes using something like activedocument.shapes 1 .textframe.textrange.text and then you could delete it by doing something like activedocument.shapes 1 .delete and after that you d have to put the text you retrieved from the text box in the relevant part of the document

3036041
extjs	mootools
prototype mootools extjs dojo yui

3036057
post	get
send either http query parameters get or post to the server or possibly a json object and get json or html in response

3036182
inherited	properties
in resume you need it for signals and slots to use tr for translation to retrieve class name in real time from a qobject to know if it inherited from other class instrospection to set properties and to be able to call newinstance

3036185
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
to look like this you have to select the hidden field by using getelementsbytagname - or set an id for the hidden field and use getelementbyid

3036190
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome 1+ there are known problems with firefox 1.0.x

3036190
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox

3036313
put	get
i used to get the array and put it in javascript var

3036320
fadein	hide
this will hide them all grab at random a next hidden one fade it in and 50ms later start the next one creating a random-ish fadein effect

3036353
gif	png
please note that this is not a solution for displaying gifs you must modify the content of the web and convert split gif animations into different files one for each frame in any format jpg png etc

3036356
put	get
the only issue i now have is that if i put in a discriminatesubclassesoncolumn tagtype i get the same syntax issue creeping in

3036373
min	max
scan all glyphs that are left en fill in x y min max values in head

3036396
int	chars
i m getting the expected warning argument 4 of sscanf is type chars int expected

i need to distinguish wether it s a show or hide action so i can pass the variable elsewhere here s what i have

3036405
hide	show
but then i don t have a show hide variable

3036461
public	protected
i mean method are generally used to define functions inside a class where several types of user access right like public protected private can be defined

3036496
put	get
edit you d get an linker error if you would put into the second file as well

3036516
gif	png
creates an imageicon from an array of bytes which were read from an image file containing a supported image format such as gif jpeg or as of 1.3 png

3036533
getter	setter
so generally i use friend and i write them as though they were member functions not using getter and setter

3036579
ilist	icollection	idictionary	ilist	idictionary	icollection
very different from the .net ones their core is the icollection idictionary and ilist interfaces

3036579
ienumerable	ienumerator
make sure to understand the difference between ienumerable implemented by the collection and ienumerator implemented by the iterator

3036651
super	abstract
1 in this case it might be better to abstract these properties in a super class.

3036677
folder	directory
sometimes i even delete files and they don t delete on svn in a directory hierarchy only the very last item will delete so i have to delete each folder one at a time

3036702
x86	64bit
in the latter case you need only the vc_redist in either x86 or 64bit variant

3036707
int	chars
you can use hhd under glibc s scanf msvc does not appear to support int storage into a chars directly see msdn scanf width specification for more information on the supported conversions

3036726
datalist	repeater
take a look at this tutorial custom buttons in the datalist and repeater

3036742
gcov	lcov
lcov or just gcov can be run from there

in most contexts you save little to nothing by using chars for an int

3036843
air	flashdevelop
i m creating air apps in flashdevelop using the free flex sdk

3036854
treelistview	objectlistview
the objectlistview project has a treelistview

3036859
post	get
if you re using get and the request uri gets pretty long over 2kb then consider using post instead of get else the uri may be truncated by the server

3036859
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
serialize the java object write it raw to the urlconnection#getoutputstream using objectoutputstream and retrieve it raw from the httpservletrequest#getinputstream and unserialize it using objectinputstream

3036902
int	chars
since there an implicit cast from a unsigned chars to an int if the number is more than 0xff it is going to use bytes max 3 next to the variable in the stack and corrupt their values

3036902
int	chars
it does not seem sscanf support storage of numbers into a chars i suggest you use an int instead

3036902
int	chars
although if you want to have the chars roll-over you can just cast the int into a chars afterward like

3037004
shadowing	named
that being said it is confusing and unwise to named types the same both in sql and pl sql you run into shadowing issues

3037005
qdialog	qwidget
i believe your login is a qwidget dashboard is a qdialog

3037007
rsa	aes
encrypt this aes key with bob s rsa

3037014
int	double
invalid syntax it highlights closing double quote in this line print not a valid int s e

3037037
put	get
first thing is i am saving my username and password in the file.on sucessful login i will be saving and moving to internal home screen.the problem is when i logout or close the application and reopen the application i am able to read the data but when i convert it to string i get out put as aaaaaa each as 4 bytes

3037094
children	parent
if you are in an ascx generally you are searching parent if you are in a page generally you are searching children

3037099
vbscript	jscript
you can embed the ms-supplied script engines including jscript and vbscript using the script interfaces

3037116
post	get	client-side	server-side
rather than writing server-side ajax code you should use client-side ajax jquery to get the runtime value of the textbox and post that value

3037137
stdout	stderr
also you need to handle stdout and stderr - not sure if adding 1 home out would work with popen

3037146
post	get
i have read some post that show you how to set up a single ton and just get an instance of the persistancemanager when you need it but this does not seem to work either

3037161
gif	png
if you have control over the images make them load progressively save gif png as interlaced jpeg as progressive

3037169
for-loop	loops
for the last three replacements the for-loop seems to be unnecessary since loops body doesn t use loops variable

3037257
hash	md5
if you want an easy solution just stick with a good hashing algorithm like md5 and store just the hash inside your application

3037338
put	get
temporary tables get put into a schema called pg_temp_nnn where nnn indicates which server backend you re connected to

3037401
qapplication	qcoreapplication
qapplication calls oleinitialize in its constructor but qcoreapplication does not so that s why you get the error 0x80010106 rpc_e_changed_mode when you use qapplication

3037496
hash	md5
if you re okay with a microscopical risk of collisions you could use some hash function such as md5 as you suggest and rely on the hash

3037496
trie	tree
another alternative possibly with a larger memory footprint is to store the already encountered strings in a trie a special type of tree

3037507
hash	md5
md5 is also inappropriate since two different strings can yield the same hash

3037543
bitblt	gdi
i would recommend to use bitblt of the old gdi instead of drawimage

3037552
post	get
in my code i have a section that extracts and lists the different categories of post but my problem is how to get exactly the post that fall within that category and list them only

3037598
super	extends	inherited	properties
this loop is part of a js implementation of classical inherited where classes that extends existing classes retain the super properties of the extended class when invoking a member of the extended class

3037642
post	get
i am using wordpress and i am wondering how do i get just the permalink and name of the category of a post when using

3037647
inherited	properties
things like inherited and interface implementations attributes methods properties with code etc

3037686
printf	strcpy
after updating the question with code from a comment both the strcpy and the printf calls are excellent candidates for stack corruption

3037795
google-chrome	firefox
i have to admit that this is not a standard method to parse anyways firefox and google-chrome perform well on that kind of date string

3037862
spweb	splist	spweb	spsite	sharepoint	splist	sharepoint	spsite	splist	spsite
example sharepoint object types would be spsite spweb splist splistitem spfield spfolder

3037901
width	height
there is a new property in css3 that you can use to change the way the box model calculates width height it s called box-sizing

3037921
inherited	properties
you can create a class that inherited from listitem to add the properties

3037924

the solution is to use get or post method for sending and retrieving the values instead of session

vbscript	vb6	vb.net	vb6	versioning	upgrade
most vbscript is valid vb6 code so one option would be to just rename them from .vbs to whatever it was vb6 used and then add them all to a vb6 project and see if the vb6 - vb.net upgrade wizard that comes with some versioning of visual studio can help you out

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i m using the html5media library and the test page they provide no longer plays in firefox 3.6.3 though it plays on the latest safari google-chrome opera and ie

3038067
range	max	range	min	min	max
i can obviously do this with min and max aggregates easily but the range overlap and other business code expect non-overlapping range

3038074
ubuntu	debian
seems to be included with ubuntu and debian but the licensing is confusing

3038075
typedef	typename
typedef typename t3 xtype xtype

3038077
mouse	keyboard
beware though the wm_syscommand message is sent for keyboard messages as well as mouse messages

3038097
int	double
ip is an int and dp is a double

3038117
int	chars
asm instructions all operate on binary values bytes words dwords etc without caring too much about whether the program thinks that a given set of bits is an int a chars or something else

3038127
width	height
you ll probably want to change the width and height of that bitmap object do it in some smart way or something

3038145
versioning	upgrade
as of the june 2010 release versioning 1.2 os upgrade are automatic but you can opt out of automatic upgrade from the portal

3038176
post	get
i use httpurlconnection to do http post but i dont always get back the full response

3038182
hash	md5
also i would advise against using md5 as a hash

3038182
hash	salt
i suppose you could apply a similar salt hash pattern to the username but then you have pitfalls

3038187
crypt	salt
unix passwords used to be encrypted with crypt that would use a random salt

3038187
hash	md5
to expand on this a little bit an md5 hash is a one-way function - if you hash the same value you get the same hash but you can t take the hash and somehow turn it into the value

3038198
jquery	scriptaculous
short tests show problems even when enclosed in a self executing function if scriptaculous is already loaded although jquery doesn t seem to cause a problem

3038233
int	double
this tempts me to claim that it s even more important to use volatile for long s than it is for int s since not even a read is atomic for non-volatile longs double

3038234
redland	jena	jena	rdflib	rdflib	redland
see jena java redland c rdflib python trine perl etc

3038254
stateless	stateful
asp.net webforms engine creates a stateful abstraction over stateless http

3038310
post	get
i have a php script that when loaded check first if it was loaded via a post if not if get id is a number

3038353
int	boolean
my envisioned scenario is this you have some sort of state object for each client consisting of many properties strings int boolean etc

3038375
hex	binary
basically what i do is compile a binary from a test program for my processor dump all the hex s from the binary into a vector in my c++ program convert all of those hex s to decimal integers and store them in a datamemory vector which is the data memory unit for my processor

3038375
int	chars
convert the whole decimal int element that is being pointed to to its ascii chars representation and then search from left to right to see if the string terminates if not then just load each chars consecutively into a filename string

3038389
firefox	safari
i can t get it to work in firefox safari

3038389
firefox	safari
it works great in ie but firefox safari won t play ball

3038480
width	height
width x height y

3038480
width	height
if the image of that width and height does not exist i use imagemagick to create it

3038484
inherited	properties
in asp.net mvc you may set the page with the form to submit to inherited an instance of a class which properties are set automatically

3038494
table-per-subclass	fluent
i ve been trying for ages to find an example because i can t get it to work myself of the correct mapping for a one-to-many relationship on an abstract class of a table-per-subclass implementation in fluent nhibernate

3038604
vim	emacs
if you can t live without an ide then eclipse is ok assuming you have some pretty well specced dev boxen but i have to say the best code ninjas i ve encountered all use either emacs or vim

3038606
inherited	subclassing
sometimes varname self and methodname is a method of this class or a method inherited from some other class if the current class is subclassing some other classes

3038626
post	get
i am creating an application in vc++ using win32 wininet to upload an image to flickr.i am able to get frob token correctly but when i try to upload the image i am getting error post size too large

3038648
cassini	iis
the web server is either going to be cassini built into visual studio or iis

3038719
hash	salt
you could use a properties file as you mentions just hash the password for extra security salt hash the password

3038719
hash	md5
you can then either use md5 or sha1 password to hash it personal choice

3038720
ironruby	ironpython
this is kind of follow up questions of integration of c# f# ironpython and ironruby

3038747
post	get
here is some general code to send a http post and get a response from a server though that may be helpful

3038748
folder	directory
these files are generated into the directory of the eclipse project under a gen folder

3038748
folder	directory
in the project properties this is correctly reflected since two source folder exist - src and gen. however when the project is built for some reason all the generated sources under gen are not compiled checking the bin directory i only see .class files from the src directory

3038790
put	get
the plus side is that once you get used to the language of vbscript and the process of looking up object api references and examples on msdn and other sites it does become very easy to put together complicated and powerful scripts

3038798
elementtree	beautifulsoup
update i discovered beautifulsoup just now a tag soup parser as noted below in the answer comment and for fun i went back to this problem and tried to use it as an xml-cleaner in front of elementtree but it dutifully converted the into a just-as-invalid null byte

3038823
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
actually for wcf you should not use wsdl.exe - use svcutil.exe instead

3038839
stdout	stderr
php stdin php stdout and php stderr allow direct access to the corresponding input or output stream of the php process

3038839
stdout	stderr
it is recommended that you simply use the constants stdin stdout and stderr instead of manually opening streams using these wrappers

3038847
width	height
float all paragraphs to the left give them half the width of the containing element and if possible set a fixed height

3038863
macports	homebrew
i use macports including installing python via port to create a very linux-ish command line environment although lots of python devs seem to prefer homebrew

3038863
vim	textmate
my text editor of choice is usually textmate although i often use vim as well

3038887
ubuntu	linux
i m working with both ubuntu mac but i like staying with the linux system feels faster and more stable for me

3038890
post	get
i am fixing some old defects and as part of one defect i need to make sure that some requests are being only post to the jsp page instead of a get request

3038890
post	get
the application have a form which submits data to another jsp page i know its wrong and against mvc but too late to fix it since it is a jsp page so we can post the request or else we can get the request

3038931
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried this in firefox google-chrome and ie

3038945
freebsd	linux
apologies if i miss the boat on the freebsd vs standard linux though

uitableview	nsindexpath
- uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath

3038970
g++	gcc	x86	64bit
if you re compiling for 32 bit x86 then gcc and g++ default to using the x87 for floating point math on 64bit they default to sse however the x87 can and will produce different values for the same computation so it s unlikely g++ will consider vectorizing if it can t guarantee that you will get the same results unless you use -ffast-math or some of the flags it turns on

3038973
suppressfinalize	finalizer
the suppressfinalize method simply sets a flag in the object header which indicates that the finalizer does not have to be run

3038994
dictionary	map
the ideal solution is to track the keypresses in a table std map dictionary etc

3039119
glut	glew
just link to glew and glu glut if you use them

3039126
children	parent
if you attempt to use any type of serialization against this model you will like run into circular reference problems as a serializer moves from a parent to a child and then back to the parent as the linq2sql serialization behavior automatically includes all children in the graph

3039133
free	malloc
i was using nedmalloc in a single threaded setting and got excellent performance but i m wondering if i should switch to something else -- as i understand things nedmalloc is just a replacement for c-based malloc free not the c++-based new delete operators which i use extensively

3039139
children	parent
the issue i m having is that my chart model is a parent that has children

3039140
rss	feed
i am trying to make app that displays an rss feed with text and images into a table but i am really struggeling with it

3039168
free	malloc
often the default c++ new delete operators will use malloc and free under the hood to do the actual memory allocation before after calling the constructor destructor

3039177
free	malloc
simply link it into your application at it will replace the behavior or malloc free and new delete

3039199
free	malloc
well usually c++ new and delete operators internally calls plain c library functions malloc and free plus some additional magic like calling ctors and dtors so providing a custom implementation for these functions may be enough this is not infrequent in embedded c++ development but requires some linker-level work

3039221
free	malloc
you can overload global operators new and delete to call the new versions of malloc and free that you re using

3039260
rtp	rtsp
we are working on a c language application which is simple rtsp rtp client to record video from axis a number of cameras

3039294
width	height
scrollview setframe cgrectmake x y width height

3039295
ienumerable	iqueryable
edit - you usually see ienumerable instead of iqueryable because you don t want layers past your repository a determining when the database hit will happen or b adding any logic to the joins outside the repository

3039295
ienumerable	iqueryable
there is a very good linq video that i enjoy a lot- it hits more than just ienumerable v iqueryable but it really has some fantastic insight

3039419
children	parent
i am trying to figure out children processes of a given parent from ps fwaux there may very well be a better way to do this

3039489
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

you can use class as attribute for querying sorting and grouping by

3039599
pull	push
just remember to pull their changes before you push your own

3039602
post	put
the usual workaround is to do a post request with an extra field that holds the method _method put in the post values

3039632
titlebar	window
that is the thing that has the close minimize and maximize buttons and a titlebar etc is the frame . whereas the things that show up when you do a c-x 3 split-window are called windows and when you do something like m-x shell-mode you get a new buffer which may or may not be in a new window

3039665
int	boolean
the former is an int which will be implicitly converted to bool in c++ via but the latter expression yields a boolean directly

3039676
int	boolean
it means that in java the boolean value true is not interchangeable with the int value 1 or more accurately with any non-zero int and the boolean value false is not interchangeable with the int value 0

3039678
int	boolean
languages like java do not allow you to treat int as boolean values in this way

3039691
invokelater	invokeandwait
when running in your new thread be sure that any gui updates use invokeandwait or preferably invokelater to get back to the edt

3039707
int	boolean
to put it another way c c++ don t have a real boolean type they just use int

3039720
put	get
if you can get away with it put your error handling in a global exception handler all errors should log and give a code to look up the log in production for security reasons esp if web but give the full details back during development for speed reasons

3039752
google-chrome	safari
the link won t work in google-chrome but it does in safari

3039755

i have a superclass of communications with subclassing of call text and data

3039952
superclass	subclassing
when i try to insert data into one of the subclassing its entry doesn t appear in the superclass

subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
i am able to add subtract divide multiplying pixels from ems or any other fixed unit but i have no clue how you would add 10px to 60

3039962
portrait	landscape
if you load the view in either portrait or landscape mode the table loads fine

3039966
dlsym	dlopen
if you are running under a system with dlopen 3 and dlsym 3 like linux you should be able to

3040015
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox 3.x and google-chrome 5.x

3040021
libevent	epoll
libevent uses os-specific non-blocking i o dev poll kqueue epoll to improve performance

3040031

3040090
mouseover	mouseout
set up handlers for mouseover and mouseout on the tags that show only the with matching class

3040114
for-loop	loops
for loops which loops over an integer that is incremented i would prefer the for-loop

3040134
folder	directory
i ve tried to set same working directory in processstartinfo so starter will also execute real application in that folder but this isn t helped me

3040191
viewdidload	dealloc	viewdidload	viewwillappear
i m not using viewdidload and dealloc to init release these objects as what i am doing requires me to use viewwillappear and viewdiddissapear

3040214
children	parent
namely i d like to move them up one level so they re children of their current parent s parent

mongodb	bson
there is a limit on bson objects mongodb records of 4mb

3040312

also this is only happening in ie google-chrome firefox and opera both open the modal instantly with the datalist binded.

3040385
post	get
however flash has issues with using the post and get functions on the localhost which makes uploading data files and downloading results files difficult

3040385
post	get
lastly if anyone knows how to get flash to execute post and get functions with localhost addresses i d love to have that information to avoid all this jumping through hoops

3040386

in entity-relationship diagram we model the logical relationship not the eventual physical relationship with a join table for many-to-many relationships

3040508
union	distinct
i want to join union columns b from sheet1 and c from sheet2 together and find the distinct values of the new list

3040537
curlpp	libcurl
use the c++ abstraction for libcurl called curlpp

3040572
javadoc	scaladoc
the library i am trying to write adds some methods to java.lang.class and java.lang.reflect classes using the pimp my library implicit conversion process to help you go and find documentation initially with google then later possibly with a javadoc scaladoc viewer and maybe the stackoverflow api eventually

3040679
vbscript	vba
i use a lot of vba and vbscript and i would agree that anything under 100 lines is usually pretty straightforward and taking the time to plan a good oop design is just a waste

3040707
post	put
but i am not sure if how the same approach could be applied to post put and delete requests

3040707
post	put
edit the question for me how to embed login and password into the web service s url so that i can perform post put and delete requests against the web service

3040725
french	polish
danish dutch english french german italian japanese polish portuguese russian spanish swedish

3040733
pci-dss	hipaa
however unlike hipaa and pci-dss its a standard that governs the strength of cryptography and doesn t take the system as a whole into consideration

3040784
treemap	treeset
treemap used by treeset by default will then regard them as the same object which is not true

3040818
rss	feed
now i m trying to generate a rss feed using the new feed framework featured in django 1.2 but without any luck.

3040843
bellman-ford	dijkstra
it contains a bfs implementation among other algorithms and it also includes dijkstra s algorithm and the bellman-ford algorithm for weighted graphs

3040873
hash	md5
avoid using md5 hash if you can as it s pretty flawed

3040879
inherited	subclassing
i think you might get away with public new string runfunction in the subclassing but i d also suggest that if v2 isn t supposed to provide it s own specific behaviour then using inherited isn t the right approach

3040889
client-side	server-side
if you do track time on client-side - always validate it on the server-side

3040940
post	get
you could have javascript record the time on that page i answered how to do that here here using ajax this time could be sent that way or by using get post

3041020
filtering	grouping
i d skip using values until after taking the union but i need to use annotate to take the sum of a field and filtering on it and since there s no way to do grouping by i have to use values

3041043
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
i got it to work as a poco by implementing inotifycollectionchanged instead of inotifypropertychanged

3041057
ubuntu	debian
on a debian ubuntu type system this will be in etc apache2 mods-enabled the file you are looking for is php5.conf

3041070
comparator	comparable
2 equality must be consistent with the comparison mechanism either comparator or comparable

3041121
firefox	safari
this worked in safari and firefox

3041124
google-chrome	firefox
this works as expected from google-chrome and firefox but for some reason ie displays all of the images the same as the first image

3041124
google-chrome	firefox
what should happen as it does in google-chrome and firefox the page loads the same 4 iframes but the random numbers in the images will be different

3041124
google-chrome	firefox
notes i don t really need iframes just the images but if i only use img tags the problem appears in google-chrome and firefox as well

3041126
super	implements
it s super easy to implements and javascript is a very powerful language for that sort of thing being entirely prototype-based

3041143
firefox	safari
this worked in safari and firefox

3041149
equals	compareto
the issue you re running into is that compareto returning 0 means that the objects are equals

3041149
equals	compareto
either re-write your compareto so that unequal elements return different values or use something like a java.util.priorityqueue which allows multiple copies of equals elements

3041166
appfuse	spring
i m using hibernate from spring appfuse usually as detached objects

3041240
daemons	launchd
it launchd a telnet daemons on startup which watches on a particular port and launchd a program when a connection is received

3041318
accessor	properties	getter	setter
according to the apple developer documentation the default names for the getter and setter methods associated with a properties are propertyname and setpropertyname respectivelyâ for example given a properties â œfooâ the accessor would be foo and setfoo

3041319
many-to-many	one-to-many
the former two tables each have a one-to-many relationship with the visits table which basically works as a many-to-many relationship only the visits table has its own primary key and extra fields

3041334
hex	binary
the ciphertext is binary and it might be encoded into text in database like base64 or hex

3041357
pull	push
the model is pull from the read end and push to the write end so a thread is needed to pull from the read end

3041364
postgresql	mysql
coalesce is the ansi standard means of handling null values and is supported by mysql sql server oracle postgresql etc

3041382
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
once you grab the a element with getelementsbytagname or getelementbyid

typically i use a database such as mysql or postgresql on the same machine as the application using it which makes access easy and secure

3041443
rss	feed
i am experimenting with the new safari 5 extensions js api and i am having an issue right from the ground up i want to use an xmlhttprequest to get an rss feed from a website however upon the .send it immediatly kicks off errors

3041445
postgresql	mysql
mysql postgresql etc don t

google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
ie google-chrome safari opera etc has the expected behavior

3041507
post	get
edit just so everybody can get this clear i am going to post this up here

3041555
memcached	apc
in order to do this you ll need to utilize one of the php caching solutions - apc xcache memcached

3041555
memcached	apc
when using zend_cache switching from apc to xcache or file-based to memcached is as simple as changing a single string

3041603
src	attr
jquery #download attr src

3041619
bash	tcsh
i don t know about tcsh but with bash you can use set -e to do this

children	parent
i need a xpath query which must return me parent tag only if all its children are equal to 5 a 3 in this case

3041670
put	get	post	put	post	get
this can be improved with checking for the different types of methods get post put and delete

3041727
unsigned	short
use unsigned short int or long int

3041728
bmp	png
if it can help when i try to save my qimage in a bmp file i can access its content but if i try to save it to a png it is completely white

3041781

once i get a selection back from the uiimagepickercontroller i save 2 images a resized version of the edited image to use for a thumbnail and a 800x600 version of the original unedited image into a relationship attribute transformational using the same uiimage to png transformations found in the recipes demo code for display use the resize methods are based on the one demoed in this so post .

3041805
lisp	scheme
scheme is intentionally more compact than common lisp and you ll find that you can learn the language very quickly

3041832
lisp	scheme
my hurdle with lisp and scheme was simply lambda

3041832
lisp	scheme
if you re interested a a lisp a language which is essentially from the lisp family then scheme is a good choice

3041832
lisp	scheme
but scheme is not common lisp which is what lisp typically means today they are really different languages

3041832
lisp	scheme
if you want to learn common lisp i would start with common lisp and skip scheme

3041834
pull	push
since all work is done locally you can commit revert update and the like to your hearts content without any network overhead and only make network operations to pull and push changes which is relatively rare

3041865
mouseover	mouseleave
the main idea - it must start to scroll the page when we hover .top-scroll block mouseover and stop when we hover it out mouseleave

3041866
folder	directory
.idea directory is a replacement for the old .ipr idea project file and if you want to share the project between users then you need to share .idea folder with the exceptions mentioned in the faq and all the .iml files

3041896
perforce	svn
so an alternate solution is to pull the perforce repo into git as a remote ref which i have already done successfully including all the proper commit details and authors now the trouble i m having is pushing it out to a separate svn repository

3041935
bmp	png
the image files can be either bmp jpeg or png

3041949
disk	ram
i wonder how much ram is allocated to the sql server or what sort of disk the database is on

3041949
disk	ram

at start-up the app runs the steps in the upgrade array until the on-disk versioning matches the current app versioning

3047523
versioning	upgrade
so an upgrade goes through all intermediate versioning

3047523
versioning	upgrade
also if your deployment target is only one location ie a web app where there is only one target the web site db then ability to upgrade any previous versioning looses it s appeal

3047571
accessor	properties
call the function via an object properties using properties accessor notation either dotted notation obj.foo or bracketed notation

3047602
portrait	landscape
i have it working for portrait mode but when i rotate to landscape the image disappears

3047619
post	get
you ll likely use jquery to pass some get or post data to those smaller views

3047621
queue	fifo
java.util.deque is a java interface that provides both lifo and fifo queue behaviour and thus stack behaviour as a subset

3047622
post	get
you do get data from the post try var_dump with your vars eg

3047633
vsto	add-in
it turns out that vsto 4 doesn t trust add-in on network locations by default

3047649
submit	submission
from there on submit i am submission the entire change array to server

3047706
ubuntu	debian
that s the source to ifconfig debian ubuntu here

3047721
ready	each
each item could be a few characters or a few hundred characters long and i just want them to enter a sentence and then tab to the next row and always having another blank one ready to go at the bottom of the list

3047755
ubuntu	linux
i am running hp netbook ubuntu linux 10.04 firefox for ubuntu 1.0

3047756
google-chrome	firefox
all it s working great on firefox and google-chrome but on ie the asp button click event is not working

3047756
google-chrome	firefox
works ok on firefox and google-chrome

3047795
google-chrome	firefox
in my experience gzip compresses extremely well for text content and i have been working with content-type gzip and a gzipoutputstream with no problems against ie firefox and google-chrome for a number of years

3047827
min	max
using min max with the exact numbers you need will be more accurate and avoid the greedy

3047853
crossover	mutation
it s also a pretty broad term---arguably the system of the op is a limiting case of gp with 0 crossover and 100 mutation

3047909
versioning	upgrade
on compilation of the cuda sdk i m getting a nvcc fatal unsupported gpu architecture compute_20 my toolkit is 2.3 and on a shared system i.e cant really upgrade and the driver versioning is also 2.3 running on 4 tesla c1060s

3047921
webkit	blink
i would recommend feature detection going forward but chrome and webkit blink in general is notorious for lying to feature detection mechanisms as well so even that isn t as great as it s cracked up to be anymore either

3047926
xsl-fo	xslt
you should look into using xsl-fo with the xslt

3047964
postgresql	mysql
i doubt you need cloud solutions for this though a standard database mssql mysql postgresql etc. should do just fine and one of these will come with almost any hosting plan that allows you to deploy your own code

3048091
post	get
a browser obviously can easily send get and post requests but i have no good ideas on delete and update

3048142
gif	png	gif	ico	png	ico
the below example will unset them for all files matching the extensions ico jpeg png gif js css

3048147
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
when i am trying do it the best what i get is working editor in ie 8 but other browser not opera firefox google-chrome

3048206
comparator	icomparer
take a look at icomparer and comparator

3048212
stdout	stderr
my requirements are that i am simply trying to create a daemon process whose stdout stdin stderr i do not care about

3048222
gtk	cairo
cairo is a generic vector 2d library that is used in gtk since many versions ago

3048229
mp3	wav
if it s one of the supported formats in java wav mp3 etc.. then you can just open this file like you have done for wavs already

3048245
width	height
exstyle int32 x int32 y int32 width int32 height string name

3048253
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
a jframe implements serializable so theoretically it is serializable as an objectstream you could use objectinputstream and objectoutputstream and write the stream to the database

3048268
post	get
i don t require help writing the scraper to get the html bodies of possibly relevant job post

3048280
width	height
where you of course can set backgroundcolor width height etc

3048315
textview	imageview
there is first an imageview the light and then two textview

3048369
int	double
iâ m assuming this since in the first example where double type is being converted to int type checked operator works as expected

3048401
filtering	grouping
this grouping all records by slug then adds a num_records attribute that says how many records have that slug but the additional filtering is not performed and i don t even know if this would work right anyway since given a set of duplicate records one may have and entry and the other may have an article

3048519
sorting	filtering
the next step for me is getting the filtering paging and sorting working

3048547
alloca	malloc
alloca is almost identical to malloc except that it alocs memory on the stack instead of the heap so no matter how you function exits throwing or now the memory will be reclaimed and no deletes or frees are necessary

3048569
hide	show
the filter uses show and hide which i presume means it switches it from display block to display none

3048574
google-chrome	firefox
also poster for firefox and the less-mature poster for google-chrome

3048586
ubuntu	mint
or you could use the info on ubuntu help it should work for you since mint is based on ubuntu

3048630
matlab	simulink
likewise you can generated embedded code using matlab and simulink

3048666
int	boolean
the only downside is that you have to pass primitive types int string boolean but i m sure you ll figure ways around this

3048698
required	placeholder
the _1 is a placeholder required during a bind indicating that the method function pointer being bound required a single argument

3048710
put	get
but when i put this code in page_load i don t get the full id which is ctl00_contentmain_divpanel i just get divpanel

3048740
ubuntu	debian
for debian ubuntu based systems you can type below command

3048761
googletest	gmock
so i created mocks i use googletest and gmock for testing

3048763
webkit	gecko
what should happen and does in gecko webkit is that the overlay contains a table with a heading a scaled centered image and a nav menu

3048792
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
when i push a uiviewcontroller within a uinavigationcontroller the uiscrollview in the view changes dimensions

3048795
decltype	auto
supported by the miracle of auto decltype

3048820
versioning	upgrade
that way you are not selling modified versioning of the core software which would kill your ability to easily upgrade the system

3048826
for-loop	arrays
the main view copies information contained in an arrays from the application delegate and pushes the useful information into a for-loop which then takes the name gps coords and other identifying information and passes that into a series of methods and classes which result in a custom annotation

3048845
textview	imageview
i have a scrollview that contains an number of other views textview imageview etc.

3048848
rss	feed
i want to develop a jqtouch web app that will display a list of the titles from an rss feed and then display the title and description when the title is tapped

3048853
post	get
how do i get to display the number of post on a topic like a forum

3048865
google-chrome	firefox
where as in javascript in at least google-chrome and firefox the answer is .2

3048872
prepare	pdostatement
a better option is some kind of prepare statements such as pdostatement or mysqli_stmt

3048873
range	minimum
however you ve got no way of knowing which peers overlap from tracker a to tracker b so the best you can really do from scraping multiple trackers is to come up with a range of the minimum maximum number of leechers and seeders in the swarm

3048876
superclass	subclassing
for editable objects we have a superclass which adds validation behaviors to the subclassing

3048877
vsto	add-in
i ve been installing my vsto outlook add-in to the outlook 2007 on the account that has no security limitations

3048883
innodb	myisam
moving off of your myisam tables and onto innodb will provide a huge performance increase in almost all cases

3048897
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
moreover whatever selection you ultimately make from within either view will push a common uiviewcontroller onto the uinavigationcontroller stack

3048897
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
still more info we don t want to use a separate uinavigationcontroller just to handle this pair of views and we don t want to split these apart via a uitabbarcontroller either

3048941
activemq	rabbitmq
something like rabbitmq or activemq

3048946
ostream	istream	std	ostream
i ve been using std istream and ostream as a polymorphic interface for random-access binary i o in c++ but it seems suboptimal in numerous ways

3048946
put	get	stringstream	fstream
stringstream has independent get put positions whereas fstream does not

3048946
stringstream	fstream
there is a device class but it s not polymorphic and is just an implementation helper class not necessarily used by the supplied device implementations. i m primarily using large disk files but i really want polymorphism so i can easily substitute alternate implementations use stringstream instead of fstream for unit tests without all the complexity and compile-time coupling of deep template instantiation

3049027
width	height
if you are publishing from flash ide you can go to and set the width and height

3049070
hash	md5
i thought that it is impossible to decode md5 hash but i found tools which decode them here

3049095
hash	md5
it doesn t decode an md5 hash

3049095
hash	salt
that s why it s so important to use salt hash instead of storing the hash directly.

3049103
hash	md5
it is impossible to decode an md5 hash as it is a one way algorithm they will have a database of pre-calculated hash and the string that was used to generate the hash and then perform a lookup

3049115
hash	md5
it says clearly this tool searches multiple databases for the unencoded version of a md5 hash

3049121
hash	md5
note from the site any data which is md5 hash is stored for lookups

3049167
width	height
once you drop a word see if you can extend the bounding box to be the width of first box + second box + space and the height of max first box second box

3049170
width	height
essentially i want each div to have 50 width and 100 height but it isn t working

3049172
installation	downgrade
there should be no need to downgrade your java installation to develop for java 1.5

3049201
width	height
so that any elements inside won t report their actual width and height 0 in most browsers

3049240
min	max
and to be clear i mean the min max of the all items in the array not the min max of a particular dimension

3049248
mouse	keyboard
it allows low level access to the pixels of a single window or the full screen plus the keyboard mouse and soundcard and works on most windows osx and linux

3049260
min	max
you could implement a list and find the min and max foreach and store it to a list and then you can easily find min and max from that list of all the values in a single dimensional list

3049266
mouse	keyboard
testapi actually wraps up sendinput internally and exposes a couple of simple classes -- mouse and keyboard -- to help you simulate input

3049297
x86	64bit
this should output amd64 in 64bit mode and x86 in 32-bit mode either native 32-bit or 32-bit emulation on a 64bit processor

3049305
cos	sin
this means you can precompute cos b and sin b and at runtime compute just cos hp and sin hp

3049305
cos	sin
you ll be trading a couple of sin s and cos s for some multiplications and additions almost certainly worthwhile

3049322
int	boolean
i d normally index the fields that are the most queried and then int boolean enums rather that fields that are varchars

3049343
width	height
image will be an int with length width height

3049389
lisp	scheme
lisp dialects like scheme and common lisp required then that there is no difference between interpreted and compiled code and thus interpreted based implementations had to implement lexical scope too

3049410
hide	show
i can t for the life of me find a way to hide them again and i have no idea why they started to show

3049576
vsto	add-in
he said you can include the scripts in the vsto deployment and you can do post-deployment steps with a vsto add-in if you are targeting .net 4.0

3049583
button	checkbox
when you are ready to check for any leaks that may have accumulated click on the check for leaks now button below that checkbox option

3049601
goto	break
it can end in a break return goto continue throw or a detectable infinite loop

3049602
filesystems	hfs+
the filesystems on device is case sensitive hfs+ while the filesystems on the mac is likely to be case insensitive by default

3049629
width	margin
set the right margin of the image div to the width you want it away from the text

3049653
int	chars
reads and writes of the following data types are atomic bool chars byte sbyte short ushort uint int float and reference types

3049682
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
the best option would be to use a bufferedreader for its readline method wrapping an inputstreamreader for its ability to specify the encoding wrapping a fileinputstream for actually reading the file

3049687
outputstream	inputstream
the reader and writer classes can be used for string data where the inputstream and outputstream should be used for binary data byte arrays

3049692
width	height
when i upload images using ckfinder in the ckeditor the image displays nicely using css width height

3049692
width	height
i would like images to have default width and height attributes

3049707
gitolite	gitosis
if you have multiple developers you may just want to take the time to setup gitolite or gitosis and a remote git repo

3049711
bazaar	git
this example is with bazaar but it applies to git very well

3049729
put	get
i have a tool that will allow me to put files and registry changes on the device but i don t know where stuff should go to get certificate installed

3049740
width	height
you can however use create a plugin for ckeditor to change the image width height when using the image dialog of ckeditor

3049740
width	height
btw that dialog allows you to change the width and height of the selected image before placing it in your document

3049740
width	height
the values that are placed there by ckeditor are the real width height of the selected image

3049749
hide	show
it hide that you see in first half of the picture #writecomment and show #sctryvote what you see in the other half picture to the right

3049762
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
another approach is event forwarding which means overriding touchesbegan withevent and similar methods like touchesmoved withevent etc to send some touches to a different object than where they first go

3049848
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
however on google-chrome safari and firefox you would see both hello and world at the end of 5 seconds

3049910
folder	directory
i read somewhere that that gcov tries to reproduce the directory structure where the .gcno files are stored in my project folder which would make sense as the directory above is where the .gcno files are located on my machine

3049915
uitableview	nsindexpath
void tableview uitableview tableview accessorybuttontappedforrowwithindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

3049943
cvs	svn
if your coding style is such that you commit one logical change in a few cvs svn operations then setting a longer quiet period would prevent hudson from building it prematurely and reporting a failure

3049948
free	malloc
if you need a really large array you should dyncamically allocate it using malloc and if you do so be sure to free it using free when you are done with it

3049975
pascal	delphi	fortran	ada	ada	pascal
the direct answer to your question about languages is that yes some languages e.g. c c++ ada pascal delphi fortran etc. can produce programs that will run without a runtime environment like .net or jre

3050032
viewdidload	viewdidappear
the flipping animation if you want it would then have to be handled in the view controller s viewdidload or viewdidappear method

3050053
cpython	ironpython
i foolishly assumed there is something wrong with cpython pipes cause running commands under ironpython on the same machine worked

3050053
cpython	ironpython
if you are serious about making it work on windows contemplate ditching cpython for ironpython + nwsgi look for it on codeplex i use nwsgi for simple wsgi apps and can run subprocesses with a subprocess.py specifically written for ironpython

3050081
regasm	tlbexp
they re usually generated for com components in the case of tlbexp and regasm the tlb is created from the assembly metadata

3050096
width	height
cgrectzero is literally a zero rect 0 0 0 0 so adbannerview should never show up if it really has a width and height of 0

3050099
nullreferenceexception	targetinvocationexception
it seems that the exception is first of targetinvocationexception with an inner exception of nullreferenceexception

3050104
postgresql	mysql
if you come from mysql what mysql calls loosely databases are schemas in postgresql - sort of namespaces

3050116
try-catch	exception-handling
this could cause your try-catch to miss the exception-handling if the exception-handling occurs in an anychronous thread that s not finished before you leave the try-catch statement

3050142
multiplying	modulo
in this special case with only uppercase letters as mentioned by the op in comments and digits 0-9 you could also omit the order table and instead multiplying both differing characters by 4 and compare the results modulo 256

3050153
google-chrome	safari
i can trigger mouse wheel events using the magic mouse and track pad in both safari and google-chrome

3050187
bufferedreader	gzipinputstream	gzipinputstream	gzipoutputstream
use a gzipoutputstream at the server and a gzipinputstream at the client with an inputstreamreader around that and a bufferedreader around that

3050206
subtract	add
won t automatically be updated with the count every time you add or subtract from the filearray session

3050209
int	chars	int	double
to my knowledge the attribute parameters are limited to bool byte chars double float int long short string object system.type and enum type with public accessibility and single dimensional array of the above types

3050231
put	get
i d like to get the current directory during a gnumake file run put into a make variable

3050262
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i need this implemented for as many browsers as possible but is only required for internet explorer google-chrome mozilla firefox safari and opera

3050296
width	height
it will simplify the thing as #hintdiv height and it will always return the actual width of the div

3050311
stdout	stderr
need stderr as well as stdout

3050328
rss	feed
the xe library was designed for generating syndication feed atom rss etc. and i think it is easy to use

3050359
spaces	linefeed
it looks like you have linefeed without spaces prepended to the additional lines which according to rfc 2822 â 2.3.2 is illegal

3050463
trie	tree
i m loading a dictionary of words into a trie prefix tree

3050467
chunked	transfer-encoding
to take http as an example you can use transfer-encoding chunked for this

3050530
versioning	upgrade
for users that are hand-cuffed by corporate it prohibitions they cant just upgrade their flash versioning and the page will not work

3050535
versioning	upgrade
if you re on a versioning of ubuntu older than lucid you ll have to upgrade your os or enable the universe repository in order for python3 to show up in your package manager

3050537
qscrollarea	qtextedit
if i initially have sizehint return some large constant number then the qtextedit is very big and is contained nicely within the outer qscrollarea as one would expect

3050537
width	height
also it does seem odd that the single framewidth integer is used in computing both the width and the height

3050611
google-chrome	firefox
the user is able to press keyboard function keys to process something in the emulator i used stoppropagation and preventdefault javascript function to stop cancel browsers invoking their function key shortcut f1 will invoke firefox to open its help page and the code works fine under firefox and google-chrome

3050618
ada	pascal
my understanding is that gcc and perhaps eventually if not already llvm may have java and other frontends ada for example maybe pascal

3050623
division	modulo
the simple modulo and division for powers of two

3050636
inherited	properties
i wrote an automaticlock class that has an inherited attached dolock properties

3050636
width	height
trigger on dolock to apply a layouttranform or rendertransform to your items or to set other properties like width and height

3050639
width	height
the managed part of a texture2d object is only about 100-200 bytes - which stores the aforementioned reference and a cache of the texture s width height format and so on.

3050667
google-chrome	firefox
not only ie but some old firefox and google-chrome releases as well

3050679
filtering	grouping	sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping
for example you can skip hidden columns apply string formats in binding honor filtering grouping sorting etc

3050700
eventlet	gevent
comparing gevent to eventlet

3050700
eventlet	gevent
reports from users who moved from twisted or eventlet to gevent

3050700
eventlet	gevent
eventlet and gevent are not really comparable to stackless because stackless ships with a standard library that is not aware of tasklets

3050700
eventlet	gevent
both eventlet and gevent could be made to run on stackless rather than on greenlet

3050731
exif	xmp
if no rating was found in the exif data it may be in the adobe format xmp section

3050739
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i am using a uitabbarcontroller as well as a uinavigationcontroller on my app

3050770
wonderware	historian
ask your wonderware administrator to give you access to the wonderware historian you can track the values of the tags pretty easily via mssql calls over sqlalchemy that you can poll every so often

3050809
disk	ram
it will trust me - just a matter of time - plus also a waste of resources disk space and ram in your sql server machine which is really not necessary

3050823
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
it sounds like you have a uinavigationcontroller as the main vc of your app and a uitabbarcontroller as one of the vc s on its stack

3050823
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i think you should embed the uinavigationcontroller inside the uitabbarcontroller instead of the other way around or you could just choose to use another way of showing what you want to show

3050920
post	put
check out ben is pretty sharp and if you dig around on his blog he has some nice post about how cormvc is put together and why

3050959
datamapper	activerecord
it s working fine with ar activerecord but i get into trouble when i d switch to dm datamapper or sequel as both don t natevily support polymorphic associations and discourage it s usage

3050991
glut	sdl
or you could use glut instead of sdl

3051017
keydown	keyup
it contains the key code of the key which was pressed to trigger the event eg keydown keyup

3051041
width	height
so i want to resize images to a fixed width but proportional height

3051041
width	height
i want it to fill or resize to the 380 width then resize shrink the height by the same factor it used to shrink or resize the image to 380 wide

3051077
folder	directory
if you re not sure where you installed perl to and can t find it in the default c perl bin you can find the directory by going to start menu finding activestate perl folder and right -clicking on perl package manager icon then pick properties from the right-click menu

3051112
mockito	jmockit
also you can use a mocking framework like mockito or jmockit

3051135
int	double
i am facing an issue while dividing a double with an int

3051171
vim	emacs
you might also want to use code browsing tools like ctags or cscope which can also integrate with vim and emacs or use an ide if you like that better

3051173
vim	emacs
to read code you need a good editor vim emacs or ide eclipse and some tools to navigate through the source

3051200
division	modulo
if you need to display a difference to users simple division and modulo can be used to compute the components

3051238
jsf	tapestry
there are many more options like jsf tapestry click play etc

3051253
kerberos	ntlm
regarding your question about the passwords windows authentication either uses kerberos or ntlm and neither protocol transfers passwords in clear text

3051312
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome safari it add new row in the first and new added cells are starts from end

3051318
maple	sage
as nuriaion suggests you could use a computer algebra system though i think that mathematica or maple or sage or macsyma would have been better suggestions

3051345
backgrounding	multitasking
that said here s my answer 4.0 s interpretation of multitasking can t run arbitrary third party apps as full blown backgrounding processes

3051345
backgrounding	multitasking
if you re asking specifically about an app that plays music in the backgrounding similar to a new pandora app will under 4.0 you want to support the audio backgrounding mode as discussed in the document titled supporting multitasking in your applications and linked from the 4.0 sdk section of the apple developer site

3051381
gridview	linqdatasource
if it s to any help i use a linqdatasource as source to my gridview

how can i get mathematical symbols like - sqare root to the power of subscript superscript

3051509
post	get
this is the same for post and get

3051512
post	get
name is needed for post and get .

3051549
post	get
name is required so that you can post or get the values in the next page

3051560
post	get
name is used for post and get

3051591
getter	setter
the main argument against putting too much weight in code coverage numbers is that easy blocks like getter and setter that give no real value and could hardly go wrong... count just as much as more error-prone blocks of code

3051654
mouse	keyboard
you might already have thought about it but otherwise remember to handle cut and paste also and that the user might be doing that with the mouse rather than the keyboard

3051675
folder	directory
since svn does not have distinguished handling for tags and branches the typical workflow is to copy the desired svn directory into the tags folder example svn cp file path to my repo branches xyz 23 file path to my repo tags xyz_production_lastproductiondate

3051745
google-chrome	firefox
with firebug in firefox or web dev tools in google-chrome you can see the changes.

3051763
put	get
ideone seems to put cnt somewhere else in relation to pr so it does not get overwritten

3051773
put	get
i would suggest that you get the file names and put them in a database

3051784
keydown	keyup
for keydown and keyup events this is relatively simple it s the key code for the key pressed and returns the same value as the event s keycode property

3051784
keydown	keyup
since all browsers support the keycode property and ie 9 does not support which you should generally use keycode for keydown and keyup events

3051806
isbn	vin
entities that exist outside of the application enterprise usually have their own identifiers a car has a vin a book has an isbn etc maintained by an external trusted source and in such cases the guid adds nothing

richfaces	icefaces
still waiting for the next major release of richfaces icefaces which fully supports jsf 2 - currently only alpha builds can be downloaded

3051861
cdr	cons
any list safe the empty list specifically is a cons cell whose car field contains the first element and whose cdr field contains the list which contains the remaining elements

3051861
cdr	cons
which is why cons 0 1 2 3 evaluates to 0 1 2 3 and not 0 1 2 3 we create a cons cell whose car is 0 and whose cdr is 1 2 3 so a list 0 1 2 3

in firefox this code works great but not in ie and google-chrome

3052006
installation	upgrade
the admins would probably prefer a webapp which would probably make installation upgrade and maintenance easier but the users would probably prefer a well-written desktop app that gives them the rich user interface they re used to

portrait	landscape
if i add a second view however it is rotated again like the landscape view is shown in portrait mode rotated 90 degree counterclockwise

3052054
children	parent
i have a model withs parent children and grandchildren in a many-to-many relationship

3052054
children	parent
when i query the parent or children directly using linq the sql reflects the linq query a .count executes a count in the database and so on - fine

3052054
children	parent
the parent class has a children property to access it s children

3052054
icollection	iqueryable
but and now for the problem this doesn t expose an iqueryable interface but an icollection

3052054
children	parent
so when i access the children property on a particular parent all the parent s children are read

3052054
icollection	iqueryable
changing the type of the children property from icollection to iqueryable doesn t solve this

3052135

3052347
cos	sin
usually in games there is a lot of pre-calculation sin cos values and other stuff that is used very often inside a video game and it would consume a lot of cpu cycles if not pre-calculated

3052400
children	parent
because it belongs to the parent class it means that it s an attribute to all the children

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
its working great in firefox ie but for some reason - google-chrome safari behaves differently

3052503
google-chrome	safari
when i run a .each loop on the response google-chrome safari seems to omit everything that is under the section of the page

3052547
put	get
this would only get useful when such an attribute would replace multiple method calls for instance when having to put code inside try catch finally statements

displaymetrics can give you the ldpi mdpi hdpi designation and configuration can give you small normal large screens size long notlong aspect ratio locale mobile network codes and other hardware information

3052976
getter	setter
normally when you have accessor methods for getting and setting a variable you would have to set the value and from to return the value however actionmailer uses something called adv_attr_accessor to define the from method so that if you call it with a parameter then it acts as a setter but if you call it with no parameters then it acts as a getter

serializable	deserialization
what i do not know or rather have not investigated is the effect of pushing the serializable deserialization into nhibernate

3053040
spaces	delimiter
just rename all the images to their respective keywords delimiter by spaces

3053089
ienumerable	iqueryable
1 cannot convert from iqueryable to ienumerable

3053112
put	get
i don t want to have to put the images in to the theme as when other users come to get my plugin the image won t work

width	height
use inline if you want to apply a style to a short span of text a few words and use block for rectangles areas with width height

3053150
ceil	floor	sum	floor
if you know the total of the numbers in your case it is 16 you can go from the beginning or the end of the map and sum up the counts until you get to round n 2 th element or in case the sum is even to average of floor n 2 th and ceil n 2 th elements median

3053235
width	height	disk	ram
if i remember right its width x height x bits per pixel 8 mem usage so for a full screen image 1024x768x 16 8 1 572 864 so around 1.5 mb of ram while on disk it may only be a couple hundred kb

google-chrome	firefox
though one issue still remained it doesn t allow user to select text in the textbox and this only happens on google-chrome work fine on ie for the first time d not tested on firefox

3053573
fink	macports
if you install python from fink or macports you have the liberty of updating it

3053573
fink	macports
another important advantage of managing your own version of python with a package manager fink or macports is that they help a lot with the compilation of module dependencies for instance when you use a module that depends on compiled c code

3053584
uitableview	uisegmentedcontrol
i have a situation where i have a single uitableview and a single uisegmentedcontrol with 3 bar buttons.now my requirement is if i change the segment of segment control i want different data source to be loaded to my tableview.but i failed to achieve this every time i change the segment cellforrowatindexpath is showing same data in my table view

there s also things like oprofile lttng and perf comes with recent kernels in the kernel source it s under tools perf you need to compile it on ubuntu i think it s in the linux-tools package

now i m looking for a solution in order when i delete a record that is parent like id 1 or 4 it deletes all children automatically all records that have a parentid 1 or 4

3053869
folder	directory
sure you can iterate over windows c program files folder or nix s usr local or other directory to check for browser names but you might run into user-privilege issues and you re never guaranteed to get all browsers nor is this os independent

inherited	properties
there is a field properties called type that i am using as the dicriminator and i have created a base type and a single inherited type there will be more later if i can actually get this to work

profiling	debugging
this is what step debugging and profiling are for logging is the last bastion of the lazy

3054096
sorting	filtering
again the purpose of using this is not to return a stateid object it s to just identify that property off of that entity for sorting filtering and other purposes

3054141
public	protected
since classes have private public and protected access specifiers i feel a taste of security

3054186
wxpython	pyqt
i want to take my mockups and export them to code using any python gui library wxpython pyqt etc

3054186
mockups	balsamiq
i need a fast easy high level mockups tool like balsamiq not a slow low level tool like boa constructor

3054264
hash	md5
another thing is basically rwmnau s suggestion but don t use predefined hash functions like md5 - use running totals

3054264
subtract	add
for each subsequent ones simply subtract the lost byte and add the new one

3054272
getter	setter
this is an awful practice because developers will expect enums and their associated values to be constants but you can still define a non-final field in an enum with getter and setter

3054289
telerik	radwindow
one of them is telerik radwindow

3054300
agile	sprint
the critical success factor might be having that product owner team and all stakeholders really invest in participating in some of your dev team s agile processes showing up for demos being accessible for questions during the sprint etc

3054306
uilabel	uibutton
another solution could be to use a uibutton with its type set to custom instead of a uilabel

3054347
rss	feed
i d like to get the title tag and rss feed address if there is one from a given url but the method s i ve used so far just aren t working at all

3054347
rss	feed
i ve managed to get the title tag by using preg_match and a regular expression but i can t seem to get anywhere with getting the rss feed address

3054376
ant	maven
what you want is a build system like ant or maven you may or may not be familiar with the very old school make - they allow innumerable actions before and after compilation including building distribution binary source control commits documentation generation testing.

3054381
min	max
one approach i considered was to binary search the min max of each disk to determine the disk that should hold that number if it exists then binary search on the disk itself

3054419
ant	maven
yes ant and maven are preferred but if you insist on doing it manually

3054446
public	protected
start by learning the difference between public private and protected methods.

3054521
pull	push
in that same way you can clone a bare repository to a shared server on your internal network have your developers commit to that repo and then have your maintainer pull from the internal repo integrate changes and then push up to github

3054531
stdout	stderr
after researching i have noticed that the correct way to use java s processbuilder is to spawn two other threads to manage gobbling up the stdout stderr of the newly created process so that it doesn t hang as is shown here

3054601
post	get
for java ee in order to make simple http get post calls to some web services like in soap web services but transport format must be json

3054601
post	get
in short my purpose is to serve web services using json and http get post in a maximum possible lightweight solution

3054638
stdout	stderr
because the child could write to both and you would get a deadlock when the buffer for stderr is full child waits for parent to read stderr parent waits for child to close stdout

3054644
lapply	strsplit
more generally take advantage of the fact that strsplit returns a list and use lapply

3054716

yacc	bison
it s easy to parse these simple expressions using lex and yacc of flex and bison they re the same

3054890

fifo queue

3054964
getdate	dateadd
dateadd dd 7 cellularpayments.date getdate

3054989
getter	setter
in many cases hibernate creates at run time a subclass of your entity classes and overrides the getter and setter methods of the persisted properties

3054989
getter	setter
thus you cannot reference the properties directly in equals and hashcode but instead should access them using the property getter and setter even internally in the entity class

3055044
folder	directory
i even have another code that will move the folder and its contents from one directory to another

3055066
put	get
short answer put vspace -0.1cm after latex adjust the size of the space to get the effect you want

3055093
fflush	gets
handle the output buffering yourself instead of letting the library do it for you keep your own set of 146 or however many you might need output buffers and buffer the output to those and perform an open fflush close when a particular output buffer gets filled

3055100
daemons	systemd
the error is telling you that the daemons gem used by delayed job does not work on windows because there is no fork api in windows fork is a unix linux systemd call

3055126
folder	directory
the problem is that the test data files i have made have a folder structure and this folder structure is only maintained on my machine when copied to bin debug whereas on my friends machine only the files are added to the directory

3055193
opera	firefox
the following javascript code works perfectly in opera v10.5x but fails miserably in firefox v3.6 and ie8

3055211
implements	extends
i have a class that extends the thread class and has its run method implements as so

3055264
implements	extends
then handle packet like any other dictionary-like class you could extends this so that packet implements idictionary or go the other direction and make or set protected so that only valid keys are used

3055266
implements	extends
your functionality would be easily implements by extends the memcached class for your specific purposes which might not be what the rest of the world wants

3055291
agile	sprint
the plan is to create user stories that the development team can use in their agile process with 1 month sprint

3055318

3055470
debian	linux
my problem is the assembly code dumped by gdb in my computer i m doing this on a debian linux image running on vm ware is different from that of the example in the article

3055481
daemon	cron
look for mail that the cron daemon might have sent to the user under which the cron job is running

3055481
daemon	cron	stdout	stderr
if a cron job produces output on stderr or stdout the cron daemon will email that to the owner of the cron job

3055481
daemon	cron
if something is going wrong possibly because of a path issue like rob suggests above you might see a helpful error message in an email from the cron daemon

3055493
children	parent
however that does not match children with their parent for some reason

3055576
post	get
yes this uses get instead of post but looking at your code it shouldn t make a difference

3055581
ant	maven
if maven isn t your cup of tea they do have an ant plugin i don t know if nant can call java ant tasks directly or not

3055581
maven	pom.xml
so i ve got one project with a lot of modules and 1 maven pom.xml

3055607
width	height
try not specifying width or height use it like this instead

3055635
xunit.net	specflow
as of specflow 1.3 xunit.net is supported

3055652
prototypejs	mootools	extjs	mootools	extjs	prototypejs
as to what extjs is it s a javascript library and framework - a la jquery yui mootools prototypejs etc

3055687
children	parent
so eclipse is doing the correct thing - it is renaming the directory which automatically changes the name of the parent directory of the renamed directory s children to state the very obvious

3055693
pull	push
you won t be able to push or pull from them anymore

3055726
button	checkbox
remember that using checkbox in places where you should be using radio boxes will be confusing your end-users as they wonder why that checkbox is suddenly de-activated while when using radio button the confusion factor is non-existant

3055743
serializable	deserialization
when i need some custom serializable really fast and my case doesn t require deserialization i just write django template that can make any format i want from list queryset object

3055761
children	parent
if a parent is passed to save update or saveorupdate all children are passed to saveorupdate

3055769
google-chrome	safari
you can get google-chrome and safari to play along better with your styles on an html5 search field including background images if you apply this in your css

3055801
width	height
i just want to have a few ellipses that no matter how the container changes the height and width should always be the same

3055820
min	max
you can use min and max to make the code more concise

3055830
postgresql	mysql
can t say on postgresql ou mysql since i didn t used any

3055841
merb	ruby-on-rails
i first heard about datamapper in reading about merb so it makes sense that it s in ruby-on-rails 3

3055948
ienumerable	iqueryable
since iqueryable inherits from ienumerable i believe the underlying query sent to the server would be the same

3055961
put	get
and when i put text inside this control like above i get this error

3055970
post	get
supposedly you are parsing the post or get data with php so that you can mantain the same name mpan with no problem

3055976
mouse	keyboard
i doesn t act similarly when a user select a choice using mouse to using keyboard arrows

3055976
mouse	keyboard
when using keyboard everything is fine and the value appears after select in the input text box but when using mouse it sticks with the old typed value not the selected one

3055981
cvs	svn
vss cvs and svn handle it just fine

3056037
nstextview	nstextstorage
if you want the two nstextview to have difference nstextstorage then you have to create two parallel text systems

3056040
filtering	grouping
i have an access report that generates 36505 pages un filtering and about half of each page is taken up by grouping headers and page headers though the footer at the bottom of the report page says 36505 of -29031

3056118
icomparable	compareto
as the container classes are primarily based around a generic list object my first instinct was to write the inner classes with icomparable and write the compareto method that compares the properties

3056168
mouse	keyboard
this will correctly handle all mouse and keyboard updates such as

3056175
post	put
i d try it on your jfiddle post but you haven t put the css source into the css frame

3056203
getelementsbytagname	htmlcollection
the for-in statement is enumerating also the item and nameditem methods present on the htmlcollection that getelementsbytagname returns

3056203
inherited	properties
inherited properties are also enumerated this can be another source of problems

3056215
hash	md5
once the cache is set i redirect to something like searchresults e6c86fadc7e4b7a2d068932efc9cc358 where that big long string on the end is the md5 hash of my query

3056228
jsfl	fla
i ve created a jsfl file for building a few fla s and then testing my main swf file

3056260
ant	maven
it is possible to invoke eclipse to build your project in headless mode or write ant scripts that can be executed both with the jdk and within eclipse or install maven support for internal and external building

3056274
rss	feed
i m working on a site with a simple php-generated twitter box with user timeline tweets pulled from the user_timeline rss feed and cached to a local file to cut down on loads and as backup for when twitter goes down

3056277
folder	directory
oddly enough if i unpack the jar so now i have a folder in the root directory called ext the last command works just fine

3056279
onkeyup	onkeydown
especialy the onkeyup onkeydown events

3056339
for-loop	arrays
on this line you had 2 calls to getarray which will call getarray on the instance of bubblesort created in main whereas the arrays has been set on a the instance of bubblesort created in run so the 2 calls to getarray in the for-loop need to be a.getarray

3056376
hash	md5
and using the md5 hash function the result is

3056376
hash	md5
i want to know how can i create a php script that will call md5 hash function with the inputs given above and based on that it will generate the hash function value that will be the checksum value for my coding

3056384
arp	dhcp
you can either look at the arp addresses registered sbin arp -a or a dhcp lease table

3056384
arp	dhcp
if you go the arp route you will on find addresses that your system has recently received sent packets to the dhcp lease table will give you the ability to see everything

3056388
uiview	subviews
create your own custom uiview or uiscrollview in case if you need more number of tabs with the frame of inbuilt tabbar view and fill up especially with array of uibuttons then add your custom view as a subviews of the tabbarcontroller

ingres	oracle	ingres	mysql
but my experience is only oracle sql server ingres and mysql

3056428
accessor	properties
i know how to use properties and i understand that they implicitly call underlying get and set accessor depending on whether we are writing to or reading from a properties

3056428
accessor	properties
wouldnâ t it be more effective if properties had the ability to also detect whether weâ re trying to access members of an object returned by get accessor assuming backing field is of a reference type

3056433
button	checkbox
i have a grid that has the add new record button clicked showing the textbox with role textbox and the checkbox and cancel button below it

3056433
button	checkbox
when i click the checkbox button i am firing the insertcommand that uses an objectdatasource with three parameters applicationid applicationname rolename

3056521
children	parent
i believe what s happening is the listview is setting the state of the item s viewgroup and the children are duplicating the parent s state

3056546
post	get
your sending json data to the login page but your trying to pull get post parameters

3056589
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it goes almost without saying this works perfectly in google-chrome firefox and safari

3056598
accessor	properties
if you don t want that it should be a private field or if you want to provide read but not write access a properties with a private set accessor

3056599
ssl	https
when you look in the svclog file there two base addresses that are returned when ssl is enabled one for http and one for https

you should be able to implement this in a fairly restful way with http put and get operations

3057260
pop-up	dialog
i need to display an image in a resizable dialog so far all the specific image pop-up libraries i have tried do not fit my needs

profiling	debugging
and for the purpose of finding out the memory usage of an app during debugging profiling the hack is good enough

3057298
width	height
the control then slices it up into separate tiles based on the image list s configured width and height

3057359
google-chrome	safari
en-us applewebkit 533.4 khtml like gecko google-chrome 5.0.375.70 safari 533.4 had i instead been a web crawler i would have used something else something the web server would identify as a crawler and the web server the web developer could have return a optimized page for indexing

3057400
client-side	server-side
javascript is client-side code php is server-side so you cannot execute javascript while building the page in php

3057421
post	get
i would suggest using post to process your database modifications instead of get

3057449

remove them from the menu and represent them as data objects in the work area of the page or another page if they are rarely used using controls like radio button dropdownlistfor and checkbox

3057461
folder	directory
i ve tried just creating a new folder and naming it jquery but it gave me a cryptic error the directory is already on the disk .

3057470

it appears that every time the bindingnavigator moves to an element the listbox is told to move to the first item in its collection and thus overwrites whatever value used to be in the variable bound to its selecteditem

3057479
x86	64bit
misaligned pointers were a killer in x86 where 64bit architectures were not nearly as prone to the crash or even slow performance at all

3057513
accessor	properties
i understand how declared properties work - i just need a clarification on when objective c is using the accessor method vs

3057553
daemons	systemd
the real way to do it would be to code an actual daemons in w e language and just make a systemd call to etc init.d daemon_name start and .

3057568
dynamic-languages	introspection
may i suggest python a nice very high-level dynamic-languages which has rich introspection included and by usage of compile eval or exec permits a form of self-modifying code

3057612
folder	directory
on the mac many things are placed in the bundle folder so that there are no external files directory and since windows has no equivalent people get confused as to what path they re in

3057640
range	max	range	min	min	max
i m attempting to build a tiny or perhaps not so tiny formula that will contain numbers between a set min and max but also loop these numbers so they are not clipped if they are outside of the range

q max width height min width height

3057661
division	subtract

3057692
kerberos	ntlm
sharepoint uses ntlm or kerberos authentication

3057707
protovis	infovis
you could also have a look at protovis and possibly infovis toolkit

3057751
serializable	deserialization
is there a way to ensure that the enum type has not been manipulated between serializable and deserialization

3057789
public	protected
but the more i thought about this explanation the less it made sense because if i recall correctly as soon as you take the pointer to a member assuming you initially are within access control of the member all access control information is lost i could define a function that returns an arbitrary pointer to a member that alternately returns a public protected or private member depending on some input and the returner would be none the wiser

3057795
button	checkbox
maybe the user clicked on the checkbox but before release the mouse button he moved the mouse away from the component

3057797
recvfrom	datagram
if you could recvfrom without bind you d essentially be asking the stack to give your program all udp datagram sent to that computer

3057815
union	distinct
it s common to use either strings or enums for these in c# java but discriminated union seem more appropriate in f# because these are distinct read-only values

3057834
hex	binary
a your file has random junk or a big chunk of binary zeroes apppended to it -- this should be obvious in a hex editor

3057834
spaces	delimiter
or b the delimiter is a string of one or more whitespace characters spaces tab the first few rows have tabs and the remaining rows have spaces

3057838
int	boolean
rather than having a half dozen boolean in my db i can just use an int and assign each payment method an int like so

3057853
min	max
edit if you want max to be a valid value instead of overflowing to min replace max by max+1 in all 3 places

3057928
backgrounding	multitasking
actually i am working for multitasking and facing error please assist me as i need to work on backgrounding application and also in foreground application

this should work in a vsto add-in as it does in any other form

3057988
jboss	glassfish
and these could be implemented with your own server tomcat apache glassfish jboss etc..

3057988
post	get
if you post a little more detail on what you are trying to do you will probably get some more specific recommendations also

3058015
hide	show
i know about the uisearchbardelegate protocol but i don t know how to show hide the scope bar with animation

3058016
gif	png	tiff	png
it can read convert and write images in a variety of formats over 100 including dpx exr gif jpeg jpeg-2000 pdf photocd png postscript svg and tiff

3058055
width	height	min	max
you can view a demo here you can also destroy and re-create it...but that s a bit wasteful so just create it above specify the max min height width in the resizable instead of the dialog if needed

3058057
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox 2.x even when you use the typeof operator with a regexp object you get function because they implement the internal method

but webclient and httpwebrequest throw exception

3058112
imagemagick	mogrify
i ve been using imagemagick s mogrify on cygwin but at some point it stopped working

the context for this question is generating unique ids a 64bit id might be composed of several 16-bit hashes of various 32-bit values

3058150
concave	convex
btw i should have mentioned that the quadrangle can be convex or concave

3058169
hash	salt
password is hash salt and compared to one in the database

3058182
ssl	https
if you use https ssl for your page your ajax requests will by default be handled the same way so yes this would eliminate all the clear-text issues and you ll get all the security benefits of ssl with your ajax requests as well

3058184
hash	md5
i would say just apply a standard hash like sha1 or md5 and then grab the last 16 bits of that

3058208
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works just fine in google-chrome safari firefox but is really slow in ie

3058220
servicebehavior	was
what actually worked for me was setting the servicebehavior attribute for my service class

3058241
google-chrome	firefox
alright this code works in google-chrome and firefox but not ie which is to be expected

3058276
post	get
the browser cache should automatically invalidate the cache when you do a post to the same uri that you did a get from

3058311
post	get
use button.postbackurl to change the page which the button post to and then on the target page use page.previouspage to get a reference to the source page and therefore its controls

3058326
width	height
press button touch to show dialog 90 height and width - ok

3058330
width	height
css this is the simple example with 2 images you ll need to set the height + width

3058335
twitter	bit.ly
they will often shorten the url with tinyutl or bit.ly and get it out with the usual social engineering methods email message board twitter hijacked facebook accounts etc.

3058361
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
right now i use and it works like a charm no opera firefox or whatever because if i set the background to the image as i do in safari they will all be ruined

3058373
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
sure all newer browsers firefox 3.5+ newer google-chrome versions newer safari and opera versions ie 9 will support it but they make up a very small portion of the internet right now

3058453
children	parent
my initial thought here is to access the parent and then retrieve a list of children within it

3058469
lisp	scheme
as to which is easier lisp or scheme being dialects of the lisp family at the beginner level they are pretty much the same thing and interchangeable

3058469
lisp	scheme
i learned common lisp from peter siebel s practical common lisp then picked up sicp and worked through all the exercises through the first two chapters using common lisp rather than scheme

3058475
concave	convex
a collection of documents has lat lng values and i want to find all documents within a concave or convex polygon

3058492
setinterval	clearinterval
this is only an idea you can use a setinterval function to put the focus in the username field and you can interrupt it when you want with clearinterval function

3058526
post	get
the included page file must account for that when setting up post targets for instance or you will get very bizarre errors

3058533
post	put
when i put ajax on my code i send a group of variable via post but when i received the data it is in a obj.responsetext ie text format

3058571
google-chrome	firefox
i have spent the last half hour working with google-chrome s inspector and firefox s dom inspector - all to no avail

3058574
rss	feed
actually if your sites publish atom or rss feed parse those instead

3058588
folder	directory
just create the directory structure you want inside the repo - move all files and folder to subproj1 folder

3058604
versioning	upgrade
android cannot be tricked into installing the premium versioning over the free versioning and treat it as an upgrade

3058605
rss	feed
if at all feasible use the blogs rss or atom feed instead -- they re well-structured xml rather than not-so-well structured html and universal feed parser is enormously helpful at getting to feed contents in python

3058609
rss	feed
you can still use regex for parsing the rss feed or you can use existing python modules such as universal feed parser

3058634
portrait	landscape
in case of landscaperight and landscapeleft and portrait top home button the views shows correctly but when the app start in portrait bottom home button the views show in landscape mode..

3058654
post	get
the plugin doesn t permanently change urls in the database so if you disable the plugin you get your category base back with no 404s for post

3058702
fadein	fadeout
i am trying to create a jquery fadein fadeout effect for my page content using the code below

3058769
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the cookie itself is just a rgb colour value which gets set using .click and is working fine in google-chrome and firefox yet in safari the value of the cookie is incomplete showing up as rgb 193 instead of rgb 193 184 76 as the other browsers do

3058782
accessor	properties
instead declare a different properties themutablearray corresponding to no instance variable and write this accessor

3058787
put	get
can i get this logic into the model or will i have to put it in the controller

3058822
folder	directory
i have this script which moves all my folder and files from my c projects directory into a rar archive in c backup

3058838
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
the jquery code below works ok with firefox safari opera but not with ie

3058851
jruby	rubinius
rubinius and jruby are optimizing next for the builtin types because it is very difficult to implement in particular on the jvm

3058856
hash	salt
however if you are storing passwords be sure to only store them as a salt hash since apps with root permissions if your app is ever installed on a rooted phone read and even alter the sqlite databases of other apps

3058948
google-chrome	firefox
my application is working fine and looking good in google-chrome and firefox

3058948
google-chrome	firefox
that is working good in firefox google-chrome but not in ie

3058952
multiplying	add
in this case you can t just multiplying two numbers by different factors and add

3058952
post	get
my original post would have an interest ratio of 1 2000 while this post which got 28 views and 1 comment right now it would get a score of 1 28

3058999
int	chars
the generic it takes is primitive type always int chars bool string etc

3059003
activemodel	mongomapper	devise	activemodel
the only versions of devise that support rails 3 have removed the orm adapters for mongomapper due to mm relying on a custom validatable gem which uses a different syntax than the activerecord activemodel style

3059014
width	height
another more elegant solution involves setting width and or height and overflow

3059051
post	get
1. did classic asmx web services standard http post get use soap to

3059076
mongoid	activemodel
mongoid uses activemodel s to_json method and by default that method includes the root object in the json which i don t want

3059092
onresume	onpause
so i guess u can override the onpause and onresume functions to put your bit of code

3059112
implements	extends
you mentioned that you ve created an class that extends sqliteopenhelper and implements the oncreate method

3059160
ubuntu	linux	x86	64bit
ubuntu linux 64bit x86

3059199
folder	directory
i am troubling from this problem i want to find the list of folder but there is some problem i have a support folder in root directory first i have the subfolder of this support folder then in each folder i have to find a specific say x folder and then in this x folder i want to check each file and folder

3059287
sqlconnection	sqltransaction
as thief master said - when the using block is exited the sqltransaction or sqlconnection is closed

3059315
ready	each
i would set the link destinations into the fadeurl attribute on each link and then your document ready code could look like this

3059322
portrait	landscape
in portrait mode it is working fine but when i changed to landscape mode the ad size i am getting in portrait mode is the same size of the ad displayed in landscape mode

3059346
equals	gethashcode
you will have to define your own container possibly wrapping the list to get useful semantics for equality-hash-equals gethashcode and equals

3059346
equals	gethashcode
to avoid mutability issues and a changing gethashcode equals results which would make use of your new object in a hashing dictionary problematic

3059346
equals	gethashcode
you can use sequenceequal to implement equals rather trivially but you ll need to implement a gethashcode in a relevant way -- a simple method is a shifting xor of the gethashcode of each element

3059346
equals	gethashcode
note in .net4 there is a set of tuple ... classes which override gethashcode and equals

3059347
portrait	landscape
iâ ve got a view that has to be presented both in landscape and portrait

3059358
int	chars
so results in const chars and results in int

3059363
int	chars
ord c will return an int representing the chars

3059366
put	get
don t forget that when you use an integer in a map you can get put int as well and java will automatically box unbox it for you but if you rely on this - you can get npes when asking the map for a key that does not exist

3059427
terminate	timeout
sometimes you get lucky and you have more than corepoolsize threads alive so every worker thread will go into a conditional logic branch that allows it to terminate after your specified timeout period of 10 seconds

3059448
getter	setter
even if the properties in question are not all called name you can still use the nterface solution by adding a name property to each and having its getter and setter access the other property

3059483
post	put
i have a jquery post ajax call that calls a controller method but i did not put any authenticity code in it and yet the call succeeds

3059490
implements	extends
icy and http are very similar and if you ve already implements icy on top of socketserver you could probably extends basehttpserver.basehttprequesthandler to respond to both icy and http requests on the same port

3059498
google-chrome	firefox
whereas google-chrome and firefox takes the maximum width of the items in the select box

3059540
margin	height
try height margin border and padding with

3059595
qpainter	qimage
because qimage is a qpaintdevice subclass qpainter can be used to draw directly onto images

3059595
qpainter	qimage
when using qpainter on a qimage the painting can be performed in another thread than the current gui thread

3059730
getter	setter
and then let compiler generate setter and getter methods for you automatically with desired memory management behaviour

3059738
allocator	stl
with standard stl containers like list string etc you may or may not want to use custom memory allocator

3059798
int	double
converting between double and int might be faster or slower for you

3059808
int	boolean
this is a reflection of my programming background that has led me to the belief that boolean are a different type from int and pointers and that assignments are not expressions even though in the case of the c implementation i am wrong

3059812
folder	directory
for development your media_root may point to an arbitrary local directory on your machine containing the files it need not even be below your django project s root folder see

3059876
debian	linux
my system is debian gnu linux

3059905
firefox	safari
firefox 3.6.3 shows everything as excepted looks the same as before except for spaces and hypen but safari on mac and win

3059905
margin	height
versions 4.0.5 5.0 changes the height of my text lines or at least it looks like that or as if a padding margin has been increased - but nothing has been changed except for the font

3059987
tstringlist	tlist
scan the file structure for each hit add the path+file to a tlist tstringlist or similar using syncronize

3060014
addition	multiplication
addition multiplication square root and so on

3060028
getter	setter
however getter and setter need not map to actual members

3060050
uilabel	uitextview
i have a uilabel and if i adjust the size of the text i can make it look loke a uitextview however the left margin is different on the uilabel the text is right up against the left border where the uitextview has a slight margin

3060064
addition	multiplication
my guess was that the computer did repeated addition to achieve multiplication

3060093
multiplying	addition
repeated addition would be a very inefficient way to multiplying numbers imagine multiplying 1298654825 by 85324154

3060093
multiplying	add
to multiplying them together multiplying the mantissas and add the exponents

3060123
versioning	upgrade
it is already in the our development versioning trunk and 1.1.x but you might not want to upgrade to any of them if you consider this go for 1.1.x

3060154
textarea	textbox
i have created web application and textbox as a textarea

3060184
luasocket	iup
so i m using luasocket for the comms and iup for the ui bits

3060214
accessor	properties
if the string resides as a properties in a class you could make it a read-only properties - accessor method but no setter method

3060232
uitableview	reloaddata
i ve been playing with this problem for a couple of days and think that subclassing uitableview s reloaddata is the best approach

3060232
uitableview	reloaddata
i ve subclassed uitableview to send methods to the delegate before and after reloaddata

3060247
hash	md5
using sha1 or md5 might be a good idea but this requires going through the whole file to create that hash

3060312
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
in comparsion to git hg and bazaar it is true git hg or bazaar can handle these situations svn at the moment doesn t

3060320
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this only happens in firefox i ve tested already in explorer google-chrome and opera

3060396
width	height
w is the width function and h is the height of the original array data

3060416
subtract	add
i don t know what you want to achieve but you could add one day add a month and subtract one day

3060453
public	protected
in my own components plugins modules should i follow this convention or use a more secure private public and protected keywords

3060493
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
which worked only in ie and not in firefox safari google-chrome and opera

3060493
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
which appears to fix the position only in firefox and not in safari google-chrome and opera

3060507
public	protected
it is very difficult to add php 5 s new oop features like private public protected to a complex system like that

3060511
superclass	subclassing
i have a subclassing and a superclass

3060511
superclass	subclassing
i do not prefer creating a superclass instance and then passing the values from the subclassing instance

3060565
implements	extends
if it is too much of a burden to implements all six methods on this interface you can extends the mouseadapter instead which provides default no op methods for all the event types and you can just override the ones you need

3060565
jlist	jtree	jlist	jtable	jtree	jtable
it seems on closer inspection that jlist jtable and jtree require a bit extra for drag and drop support

3060587
jobs	cron
you should probably use a cron job which schedules a task google cron jobs and that can execute and run a mysql query on an interval

3060610
children	parent
since offset is always relative to the parent element all you have to do is to add offsetleft and offsetwidth to get the total width of all children

3060617
multiplying	multiplication
multiplying the mantissas 5.1 2.6 13.26 nb this can be done with integer multiplication as long as you track where the decimal point should be

3060619
width	height
not the height and width from getheight and getwidth

3060627
g++	gcc
if you re interested in a concrete implementation i would still recommend you take a look at the gnu compiler collection especially gcc or g++ as it is perhaps the most popular open-source c compiler that s available

3060656
width	height
so it turns out setting width and height for the image will show alt text incase the image is unavailable not otherwise

3060680
csv	tsv
the new bulkloader supports delimited csv tsv etc and xml formats at a minimum but much like the old bulkloader it s possible to support any format you wish

3060696
webkit	gecko
if you re talking about line art then svg is a good choice because embedded in xhtml its properties become scriptable in gecko or webkit via javascript

3060718
width	height
i think you ll want to look at activity.getwindow and window.getdecorview and get the width height of that

3060751
integer	unsigned
- doesn t matter to a 64-bit unsigned integer

3060754
post	get
with get the parameters are appended to the url with post they are in the http message body

3060778
versioning	upgrade
note that if you don t have administrator priviledges then you can install a local versioning of the toolkit alongside the sdk but you would need admi to upgrade the driver

3060886
hide	show
i m writing a jquery plugin and i would like my code to take advantage of the jquery ui and functions which allow you to show and hide elements with a nice animation

3060886
hide	show
however i d also like my plugin to degrade gracefully if jquery ui isn t available switching back to use the basic non-animating show and hide functions present in the standard jquery api

3060886
hide	show
i ll need to test for the show and hide functions specifically as even if jquery ui is available it could potentially be a custom version without the effects components included

3060915
public	protected
the compiler is free to reorder different access levels as it wish lay out in memory public before protected before private... but many don t

3060934
profiling	debugging
nvidia s parallel nsight formerly codenamed nexus has opencl profiling features in the beta and will support opencl debugging

3060945
google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly in firefox and apart from google-chrome not getting the textarea content perfect there too

3060951
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
but in general you can use a nice sqlconnection object and a sqlcommand call a stored procedure and get a nice sqldatareader full of data from which you can build a datatable or an ienumerable list of data objects

3060951
gridview	repeater	listview	gridview
you then have a repeater type control listview gridview etc in the ui simply by binding your datatable or list to that control will render the results

3060951
filtering	grouping
if you still want to show the data as an ordered list then use a listview define a template for each data item then you can use linq to grouping or filtering the data you like the data item template can contain whatever html or asp.net controls you like and that template gets rendered for each data item in the list of data

3060955
postgresql	mysql
postgresql can do this with the --table parameter mysql seems to do this when the table names are listed after the database name

3060993
integer	unsigned
you can get the ip address as a 32-bit unsigned integer from client_addr.sin_addr.s_addr

3061058
hide	show
or if you want it completely read only you can set or if you don t like the look of that i sometimes have two controls one readonly textbox and one combobox and then hide the combo and show the textbox if it should be completely readonly and vice versa

3061146
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox safari google-chrome all work as expected

3061180
filesystems	fat
to be exact fat filesystems uses so-called fat table - it is a table located close to the start of the hdd or partition adress space and it contains map of all clusters little storage cells

3061180
filesystems	fat
ok so now when you want to save some file to the hdd os filesystems driver looks into fat table and searches for the value 0x0

3061190
division	modulo
i have added all the ranges and some checkings using modulo division to avoid incorrect values set directly in the value field using the keyboard instead of the arrows

3061196
ienumerable	ilist
of course you can search through an ilist or ienumerable etc for a matching key but that will take o n time rather than o 1 for hashtable or dictionary

3061198
ienumerable	ilist
if you are using list ilist or ienumerable generally this means that you are looping over data well in the case of ienumerable it definitely means that and a hashtable isn t going to net you anything

3061272
integer	unsigned
this means that anything of integer type that is narrower than an int is promoted to an int or possibly unsigned int before the operation is performed

3061272
int	chars
this means that is performed as an int calculation but because the result is stored back into a which is a chars the result has to undergo a narrowing conversion hence the warning

3061304
mousemove	mouseenter
if i use for example a mousemove event handler on a div and check the layerx property of the event it changes when my mouseenter a positioned element inside that div like an image

3061360
accessor	properties
wpf and silverlight have a data binding model whereby i can provide a binding with a path which comprises a dot-notation of properties accessor down from a datacontext to a specific value inside a complex object graph eg

3061360
getter	setter
i have a non-ui requirement to accept such a path expressed as a simple string and to use reflection on an object which is hopefully of a type which exposes the right property getter and setter in order to read and or write values to those properties

3061362
chunked	transfer-encoding
transfer-encoding chunked

3061400
width	height
to clarify say i have a canvas having its width height as 100 100

3061435
folder	directory
can you put you logic into a webservice hosted by yourself if not you may want to look at using mef directory catalog to view a folder without having to compile it

3061453
button	checkbox
so i have a set of checkbox button generate using yui markup and javascript

3061473
move	drag
it seems that if you drag a uiview display into a secondary display in interface builder and save the xib then either disconnect that display or open it on a computer with a secondary display in a different postion left v right of the screen for example then the view can t be seen closed move

3061481
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
go to adobe.com and download the plugin for other browsers firefox safari opera and re-install.

3061492
mouse	keyboard
if your listview items don t need mouse or keyboard interaction you can just put a rectangle with a visual brush to the right of it

3061496
cil	ildasm
using ildasm to decompile the resultant executable gives us the following cil listing

3061514
getter	setter
the beauty of dot notation for accessing the getter and setter of synthesized object properties is that you can think of the dot-notated properties as data fields

3061514
getter	setter
the bottom line of it is dot-notation is for accessing data fields while knowing that it s really a convenient piece of syntactical sugar around synthesized getter and setter methods and method calls are for instructing objects to do something

3061526
uilabel	uibutton
some cells have uilabel and some have uibutton

3061526
uilabel	uibutton
however the uibutton repeat when i scroll down appearing over the uilabel

3061533
division	multiplication
but using multiplication and division isn t as interesting or inefficient as this 17-character solution

3061542
user-controls	datarepeater
oh btw the user-controls is in a datarepeater so it occurs for each of the user

3061547
client-side	server-side
note that server-side caching is not nearly as effective as client-side caching

3061595
uitableview	uisearchbar
here is an article about how to filter the record from uitableview using uisearchbar

3061608
centos	linux
i used 5.3.2 on linux centos .

3061612
implements	extends
i ve noticed that extends idisposable so i m required to implements the dispose method

3061645
google-chrome	firefox
i ran your code in firefox google-chrome and ie8 with no trouble

3061680
ecj	javac
a few examples where ecj is preferred over javac is

3061759
implements	extends
class myenum e extends myenum implements mycomparable e

3061766
client-side	server-side
you can remove it client-side by removing the session cookie usually asp.net_sessionid or server-side by calling session.abandon

3061770
width	height
no matter what i input for padding the width and height of the button never changes

3061776
superclass	subclassing
this is required for superclass to define methods using the generic parameter that work transparently natively if you will with their subclassing

3061776
superclass	subclassing
and hence you can provide method implementations in the superclass that remain useful and specific in all subclassing

3061776
superclass	subclassing
basically the conclusion is that this trick is useful when you want to provide some functionality in a superclass that somehow gets more specific in subclassing

3061776
superclass	subclassing
by declaring the superclass like this you are locking down the generic parameter for any subclassing to be the subclassing itself

3061776
superclass	subclassing
this is why you can write a generic compareto or createchild method in the superclass and prevent it from becoming overly vague when you re dealing with specific subclassing

3061779
implements	extends
di ioc aims to satisfy interfaces with concrete classes and given that your static class along with its static methods by definition cant implements an interface or extends a class the question makes no sense

3061793
actualheight	actualwidth
makes sure to check the following canvas properties actualwidth actualheight opacity visibility

3061823
pop-up	dialog
i am having a button in the pop-up dialog

3061841
ant	maven
you can use maven instead of ant

3061841
ant	maven
using maven you can specify packaging type and you don t need to write ant script

3061859
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this will work for firefox 3.0+ google-chrome and safari

3061869
elf	dwarf
use objdump -w to look at the elf file s dwarf debug information to see the .debug_str table

3061921
uiview	calayer
in most cases you make an uiimage out of a uiview s calayer

3061985
onresume	onpause
the proper way to do it is stopping the thread onpause and recreating it onresume

3062001
width	height
first set image s layout height and width to fillparent then use below code

3062063
rss	feed
i parsed the following elements from a rss feed title dc creator and enclosure url an image

3062105
put	get	post	put	post	get
the generic activeresource class has the four main verbs get put post delete as methods which it calls against a specified resource url passed in at cunstruction

3062105
post	put
of course you can also use the other verbs on the object to put post and delete

3062105
put	get	post	put	post	get
the code basically wraps up the underlying http post put get functions and takes care of the serialiasation of the payload to objects

3062117
post	get
could be a caching issue try using post instead of get

3062128
websphere	ibm
i ve recently started on a project to develop some portlets which will run on ibm websphere portal server 6.1

3062128
ant	maven
does anyone know of any scripts ant tasks maven plugins etc

3062212
multiplying	add

3062264
regasm	gacutil
i use regasm to register the type library for com and gacutil to install the assembly into the gac

3062307
joomla	phpbb
now i have to refactor the whole page with joomla and want to integrate the phpbb3 directly into the main page so that header menu and footer of the joomla page are still beeing displayed only the content shall be the phpbb

3062327
children	parent
i use libraries i created that effectively allow one datacontext to save changes back to a parent datacontext and for a parent datacontext to notify its children that it just received changes

3062327
children	parent
when the child datacontext writes back to the parent this causes all controls bound to objects in the parent to update and for the parent to broadcast the changes to all children so they can update too or not if they are in snapshot mode

3062406
xslt	xquery
i have been watching this thread for a bit and wondering this myself as i am a vim user and work with a lot of very large xml files and associated xsd s xslt s and xquery files all of which could benefit from this sort of thing as i am sure you can imagine

3062454
udp	tcp
if you want real-time you have to use udp sockets not tcp pipes

3062473
integer	unsigned
an array can t have a negative number of items so an unsigned integer is a much better match for the kinds of values this method will actually return

3062484
range	max	range	min	min	max
the effects table might have better descriptions of what sp stands for maybe the min and max range etc

3062504
hash	md5
a create md5 hash for all the files

3062509
jdom	xom
edit i wound up pimping jdom after all because xom doesn t compile xpath queries ahead of time

3062525
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
firefox unlike opera or epiphany but like google-chrome builds the codec directly into the browser

3062600
hide	show	slideup	slidedown
i used slideup and slidedown functions to show hide elements

3062624
voltdb	acid
voltdb is an opensource commercial database acid scalable and very high throughput 50x from leading oltp dbms

3062666
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
firefox ie6-9 safari opera google-chrome

3062669
getter	setter
is-accesible allows an object to be updated regardless of access modifier and presence of getter setter essential for objects generated using jaxb

3062675
joomla	phpbb
note that phpbb isn t running exactly inside of joomla since that would be disadvantages for performance reasons.

3062700
implements	extends
to accomplish this i would suggest implements a action extends abstractaction to deal with when the user attempts to open a file

3062741
sequence	permutation
this implies that most permutation of a long sequence can never be generated

3062746
division	multiplication
basic arithmetic operations are + - and not xor or left shift right shift multiplication and division

3062787
put	get	post	put	post	get
i am able to perform the get operation but i am unable to perform put post or delete requests

3062797
put	get
i randomly get this excpetion when i try to reach my session to put a variable

3062826
children	parent
following code returns all parent on the top and then the children

3062826
children	parent
i would like to get data parent 1 â his children then parent 2 - his children then parent3 â his children

3062879
post	get
as far as i know webinvoke only supports get and post at this time

3062879
post	put
i use post to perform put and delete action instead

3062884
jsf	wicket
component based mvc frameworks jsf wicket

3062891
integer	unsigned
sprintf will then write it as an unsigned integer

3062956
onchange	onkeyup
this javascript is triggered on the onchange standard asp.net behavior event but i would like that this javascript is triggered onkeyup

3062961
free	malloc
if malloc simply takes a long time you re probably traversing a fragmented free list many of whose entries have been swapped out

3062961
free	malloc
for more information on malloc implementations including understanding fragmented free lists the wikipedia article is good

3063014
move	drag
this is fine and working as intended however the problem is that now my collision detection is tripped whenever you try to move this player because its sitting underneath a wall and because of this you cant drag the player anymore

3063022
children	parent
i personally do not like them when i can avoid them but it would give you a way to grab one parent at a time and then all that parent s children

3063084
post	get
i am doing phonegap app i want to access web service from server in coding javascript get post or ajax methods working fine for http url request but it cant work for https url request

3063159
min	max
what i want is the min and max values for paraid column for each group of errorid values.

3063159
min	max
for example for errorid 3 the min paraid is 125 and max is 129

3063172
setinterval	settimeout
alternatively you could stop using setinterval entirely and just use settimeout

3063173
int	chars	int	boolean	int	double
environment entries limited to string chars byte short int long boolean double and float

3063236
firefox	safari
tested in firefox safari ie8

3063267
hash	salt
remember also that you have to store your salt along with the password or you won t be able to check the plaintext version against the hash version

3063333
virtualbox	parallels	vmware	virtualbox
alternatives to virtualbox include parallels desktop vmware fusion and crossover mac

3063378
getter	setter
a safe practice in oop is to use setter getter methods

3063403
daemon	cron
instead try something else to schedule tasks like cron or my scheduler daemon gem

3063406
button	checkbox
i want to display checkbox or button at the same position based on user role

3063410
onresume	onpause
although when the child activity is started the onpause event is fired and it stops the camera until onresume is called

3063410
onresume	onpause
to the onpause and a similar one to the onresume methods

3063411
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
run as non-root and use a standard webserver apache or a lightweight one such as lighttpd or nginx on port 80 to redirect to your instance

3063432
trie	tree
you can also use a trie which is a prefix tree data structure - for sorting in memory

3063432
trie	tree
sorting requires you traversing all the trienodes of the trie tree using dfs depth first search - o |v| + |e| time

3063453
post	get
i have a get post json function on an aspx page

3063456
hide	show
if the purpose is to show or hide a part of the page then you can do the following things

3063471
lxml	elementtree
my personal suggestion would be lxml as i m currently using it on a project and it extends the very usable elementtree interface already present in the standard lib xml.etree

3063471
lxml	elementtree
lxml includes added support for xpath xslt and various other features lacking in the standard elementtree module

3063487
folder	directory
i m trying to code a batch file to copy only the most recently dated file in a given folder to another directory on the local machine and simultaneously rename it as it does

3063535
post	get
the difference is that an encrypted parameter that is sent with get verb will be visible in the address bar while the one sent with the post verb will not of course this doesn t mean that the user cannot see the encrypted value

3063541
post	get
post can send more data than get

3063547
post	get
if you re using an encryption library to encrypt the data then you can use get or post but this will be an added pain and you might not setup the encryption correctly so i d still recommend using post over https rather than rolling your own encryption setup

3063554
uiview	subviews
i have a uitextview object and i want to load a label object or a set of label object over it but i dont have a view property for uitextview.the only thing i have is subviews property in uiview class which is parent class of uitextview.how should i really go about it.

3063567
int	double
calcmove point pt double angle int speed point pt is the current object location

3063610
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
as an overview i m having issues with a uinavigationcontroller inside of a uitabbarcontroller calling viewwillappear whenever a view is popped from the stack

3063654
pop-up	dialog
it opens up a pop-up window with pdf file inside it but fails to open the print dialog box

3063654
pop-up	dialog
opens up the pop-up window and show the print dialog box

3063712
kde	gnome
d-bus is a lightweight ipc protocol and object request broker orb very similar to com and heavily inspired by both com and d-bus s predecessors dcop kde and corba gnome as well as netlink linux kernel

3063712
kde	gnome
gnome had bonobo which was based on corba and kde had kparts which was based on dcop

3063712
kde	gnome
in the end under the umbrella of the free desktop organization whose goal it is to create cros-desktop standards both the kde and gnome developers got together to develop an ipc messaging system based on the best parts of dcop and netlink and the result was d-bus

3063712
kde	gnome
in current versions of both gnome and kde d-bus has completely replaced corba and dcop thus making it possible to run gnome applications in kde and vice-versa with much higher fidelity

3063725
cos	sin
sin î +î² cos î² sin î + sin î² cos î

3063725
cos	sin
cos î +î² cos î cos î² â sin î sin î²

3063754
post	get
so to get an event handler called with the right context this value you have to take special steps as outlined in the post linked above

3063787
post	get
when making an ajax call when contenttype is set to application json instead of the default x-www-form-urlencoded server side in php can t get the post parameters

3063798
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i tested it on my local iis server and on an internal build server in ie7 google-chrome opera firefox and it worked fine

3063800
int	chars
another issue i ran into is using strings to make switches function reason being if i use int in a switch if the user inputs a alphabetical chars the program goes into an endless loop

3063811
hash	salt
whichever you use use salt hash

3063857
strcpy	strcmp	strlen	strcpy	strlen	strcmp
obviously a lot of functions are missing strcpy strlen strcmp etc.. here s a link to the actual header file

3063867
int	chars
1 is an int that holds the chars value of 1

3063912
hash	salt
my recommendation would be to use the highest level of the sha algorithms that you can in your programming language and hash against a salt value you can create a random one by hashing the current time if you like that you store in the database record with the hash password

3063930
spaces	delimiter
the problem is when i look at the output it also includes spaces as delimiter and chops up my results

3063955
maven	cargo
it also works well with our build and deploy - the war is built using maven so all necessary dependencies are included and also can be deployed to our qa app servers using the cargo plugin

3063969
google-chrome	firefox
there are two problems while it works just fine in firefox ie and google-chrome do not create the table if the page is refreshed

3063979
integer	fractions
okay from what i understand an integer that is a fractions will be rounded one way or the other so that if a formula comes up with say 5 6 - it will automatically round it to 1

3064003
copying	overwrite
further if a function returns data allocated on its stack it will require copying semantics on the caller s part or risk returning something that will be overwrite by the next function call

3064040
vim	emacs
i was very happy with my vim but once i heard of org-mode i started learning emacs

3064041
client-side	server-side
it s better to do as much as possible on the server-side because 1 you don t know if the client will even have javascript enabled and 2 you don t know how fast the client-side processing will be

3064054
spaces	delimiter
set it to true and it will only parse on the delimiter not the spaces

3064069
hide	show
i would make the initial startup form your login page and authenticate the user if their details are correct hide the login form and show you other form

3064076
postgresql	mysql
please also tell me where would be difference when i use different database like postgresql or mysql within steps

3064140
dictionary	map
no a many-to-many table can only map the keys plus index or map key if it s a list or dictionary and its own id if it s an idbag

3064164
nsscanner	nsxmlparser
that said i think nsxmlparser on it s own uses nsscanner or similar + extra processing for bells and whistles related to xml

3064185
versioning	upgrade
so i then created the new mde but when users try to open it gives them the message that it is not the correct format and that they should upgrade to a newer versioning of access

3064199
width	height
i need to have a crossdomain iframe with dynamic width and height

3064203
union	distinct
if you know the records by design such as each table is for a differnt clinet or each table has a differnt date range cannot be duplicated union all not try to distinct the resultset and thus runs much faster

3064216
lxml	elementtree
another option is lxml which provides useful extensions to the built in elementtree

3064229
accessor	ivar	accessor	properties
it s common for properties like this to do everything through self except in the accessor themselves or in dealloc and possibly in init opinions seem to differ on this where you would access the ivar directly

3064229
accessor	properties
also never call -- the properties accessor doesn t give its caller ownership

3064266
pypdf	reportlab
for pdf generation you could use the reportlab toolkit or pypdf

3064310
matplotlib	scipy
python with numpy scipy and matplotlib

3064328
cpu	processors
if the process is entirely cpu bound then you divide the processors speed by the number of cycles to get the throughput

3064380
hide	show
if status is private i want to show the list if status is public i want to hide the list

3064426
prng	random
if randomicity is required ensure random numbers may be reproduced exactly at a later time look at seeding with pseudo random number generators prng or use canned random sets

3064427
user-controls	tabcontrol
the user-controls will need some means of finding the tabcontrol

3064427
user-controls	tabcontrol
this would potentially allow you to walk up and find the tabcontrol instance containing this user-controls

3064443
silverstripe	modx
from what i ve been reading silverstripe or modx sound like good candidates

3064483
springsource	grails
there s a grails plugin available that turns a grails application into an osgi bundle that can be deployed on springsource s dm server

3064487
xstream	jibx
spring ws is nice and i believe you can pick from jibx jaxb or xstream

3064487
xstream	jibx
xstream should work fine in gae but i don t know about jibx as it uses bytecode manipulation

3064511
rss	feed
i ve spent ages on this all i m trying to do is extract the title contents from an rss feed everything else can be ignored

3064511
rss	feed
theres a whole bunch of unneeded tags thats coming in from the rss feed all i need is the title tag it looks like this title my title 3.0 title

3064532
oncreate	findviewbyid
it is a good practice to define private variables and to bind them to the references returned by findviewbyid once in oncreate then accessing them throughout your code

3064579
realloc	malloc
it does not use malloc realloc

3064579
subtraction	addition
this cheapens the cost of end which no longer needs an addition ever so slightly at the expense of a marginally more expensive size call which now needs a subtraction

3064597
vmware	virtualbox
virtualbox or vmware both work well

3064623
spaces	delimiter
remove the spaces in the delimiter

3064652
cassini	iis
i ve recently moved my silverlight solution off of cassini one for service one for sl app and over to iis to simulate production

3064652
cassini	iis
everything works fine in cassini with a clientaccesspolicy xml file but in iis something is replacing localhost 2002 with my machine name in the wsdl

3064724
ubuntu	linux
unless you have a very powerful machine the overhead of windows + ubuntu linux + rails server + database server + ide editor will be painful

3064845
vsto	add-in
i would like to know what are the possible ways to solve this problem and what is the best approach to implement this add in xla or vsto or com add-in

3064868
validationsummary	customvalidator
following an example which you can rewrite easily to validate a checkbox customvalidator in a gridview with a validationsummary control

3064894
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
make sure you re consistently using malloc realloc free throughout your class

3064894
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
this is actually pretty close to what vector does in my implementation gcc glib except it uses the c++ low-level routines operator new and operator delete to do the raw memory management instead of malloc and free rewrites the realloc routine using these primitives and delegates all of this behavior to an allocator object that can be replaced with a custom implementation

vsto	add-in
unlike add-in which extend the whole application and as such apply to any open document a vsto document project is a customization of a specific document to which extra code is attached

3065037
textview	imageview
if you just want the look and not the functionality though just adding a linearlayout with a gradientdrawable background containing an imageview a textview and a checkbox styled as a star to your activity s layout should get you there a lot more easily without requiring custom widgets

3065060
stdout	stderr
whenever i open a pipe using the python subprocess module i can only communicate with it once as the documentation specifies read data from stdout and stderr until end-of-file is reached

3065075
disk	ram
you can also use snmp to figure out responsiveness of the processor and ram and remaining size on hard disk among many other options

3065092
free	malloc
i realize that the answer for an arbitrary address is no you can t but i do think it is possible to override malloc free and keep track of allocated memory ranges

3065104
accessor	properties
fields shouldn t be public so to do this properly you would have a properties and you would therefore have to call the set accessor

3065105
bazaar	svn
since i won t have access to the svn repository for a while i wanted to use bazaar as a helper version control to keep the intermediate commit history before i commit everything back to the svn repository

with a dirty dirty hack i was delighted to be told just last week this can also work for multipart form-data get raw post data

3065263
colt	jama
jama colt and parallel colt are not fast

3065339
cvs	svn
our developers would then clone from this and push back to it using more of a cvs svn development model - if joe is working on something in branch then leaves we d just like hank to take over by checking out the branch

3065339
pull	push
if i m correct i d add upstream as a remote to my personal checkout pull it then push it back to our shared repo

3065341
post	get
let me know if i should post more code to get help thanks

3065378

tosource is non standard and works in the gecko engine only so will not work in google-chrome safari or ie

3065429
int	chars
i use string for the const chars int for int and so on

3065448
width	height
first try to set the parent both width height with pixels not pct

3065456

postgresql	mysql
please also tell me where would be difference when i use different database like postgresql or mysql within steps

3065508
folder	directory
i have this code i have been using....but i need a conditional where it will read all the sub directory of bg to select an image as opposed to a specific folder if they were on a subpage

3065517
serializable	deserialization	ord	enumerate
besides ord some important type classes are eq equality comparisons but not less greater than enum types you can enumerate values of such as counting integer s and read show simple serializable deserialization with strings

3065528
post	get
my problem is that when i click on the link i am reaching the delete action via a get rather than a post and the confirm dialog is not taking place

3065531
public	protected
making the virtual functions private protected with a public method wrapper - allows you to enforce some other workflow of stuff to do before and after the virtual method

3065565
jsr311	jax-rs
if you really intend to do this with plain vanilla servlet api instead of a more suited rest api like jax-rs i.e jsr311 with jersey as reference implementation then i recommend to go for the front controller pattern as depicted in your first example

3065602
firefox	safari
i have some event handlers that work in firefox and not in safari

3065602
firefox	safari
firefox breaks and safari remains broken

3065609
put	get
if you re allowed to get extra code locally eg your own personal modules you could take text csv_pp and put it somewhere locally then access it via the use lib workaround

3065612
mockito	easymock
i have used easymock earlier but now i m using mockito

3065612
mockito	easymock
i found mockito simpler as compared to easymock

3065612
mockito	easymock
for the detailed comparison of easymock and mockito you can refer here

3065626
children	parent
in the code example the author assumes that the reader knows that the sample is for an element class that has parent name attribute children and parser properties

3065643
int	double
runprediction int location double int location referenced from

3065643
int	chars
mainframe respondto chars int in mainframe.o

3065688
getter	setter
this will change if the getter or setter of a property performs some sort of work like possibly returning one of two or more values based on the state of some other field property whatever

3065708
int	chars
do we have a standard way of converting a chars to int or long in a strict way we should get proper result only if all chars are digits and can fit in an int or long -- some way by using strtol etc

3065714
nsoperation	nsnotification
-when the nsoperation is finished writing the file it fires a nsnotification defaultcenter which tells the cell s view to update the label and image and i set self setneedsdisplay

3065736
min	max
so i get the max and min prices for all items in that category and assign the sliderextension max min values appropriately

3065736
min	max
i change the item category and go get a new max min value for the slider control

3065736
min	max
i set the max min values then i set the target textbox values each to the corresponding max min values

3065736
min	max
like say for example my initial min max is 1 100

3065778
getter	setter
well just use the getter and setter methods or configure it correctly in ib.

3065778
getter	setter
because you are confusing getter and setter

3065804
svg	vml
either revert to gif or consider a javascript-based library that renders svg or falls back to canvas vml

3065812
width	height
using a width or height of 0 and hiding overflow

3065857
pecl	pear
you may be able to run pear or pecl inside mamp to do the install easily

3065867
profiling	debugging
i agree with ideas about using a profiling - but you might also want to consider just using log4j or apache commons logging etc to get some cheap stats about program performance - in that the log entries in the resultant logfiles will get timestamped to the nearest millisecond since logging is generally a useful thing to do when debugging anyway it s probably worth doing this first

3065876
stdout	stderr
however you will run into problems with synchronyous reading if you try to read both stdout and stderr of the process there is no way of reading 2 streams synchronously and simultaneously - you will deadlock if you read stdout and process is writing to stderr and waits for you to consume its output or vice versa

3065900
toggleclass	slidetoggle
but in reality jquery can animate the toggleclass with slidetoggle

3065904
move	drag
the jquery code for drag drop and clone would not work when in the index.php page so i move it to the page that gets called to request the products as each product has drag drop code created for it

3065904
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
works fine in firefox even ie but not in safari or google-chrome

3065952
getter	setter
the above does not work because the moment the log property is touched by a setter invocation it causes the code path related to the getter to be executed...which means the internal logfactory instance data is always set to the baselogger setting the logobject is always too late

3065968
width	margin
right now in both ie and standards compliant browsers the total width is 120 pixels 100 pixels wide plus 10 pixels of margin on the left side

3065968
width	margin
from this point forward the total width of ie will be 120 pixes 100 pixels wide plus 10 pixels of margin on left and right

3065968
width	margin
again the total width in ie is 120 the 100 pixels of width plus 20 pixels of margin

3065968
width	margin
however in standards compliant browsers the total width of the box is now calculated to be 142 pixels 100 pixels of width 20 pixels of margin 2 pixels of border and 20 pixels of padding 10 pixels on the right side 10 pixels on the left side.

3065968
width	margin
standards compliant browsers calculate total width by adding the width margin border and padding of an element

3065972
int	chars
assuming you know what a union is if you were extracting something less repetitive from a binary value then you might want use it for clarity instead of making say two 24 bit int from 48 chars out of shifts and masks

3065998
innodb	myisam
as an exercise in futility your current solition would probably be faster and prefered if the table is myisam or you can live with the approximation of innodb

3066014
labwindows	cvi
labwindows cvi is ni s c ide with good integration with their instrument libraries and drivers

3066014
labwindows	cvi	labwindows	labview	cvi	labview
if you re willing to write c code maybe you could get by with the base version of labwindows cvi versus having to buy a higher-end labview version that has the functionality you need

3066014
labwindows	cvi	labwindows	labview	cvi	labview
labwindows cvi and labview are priced identically for the base versions so

3066057
firefox	safari
i have tried it and it works like a charm in safari and firefox but causes ie08 to bypass the jqueryvalidator and go straight to the server side validator

3066058
vsto	add-in
we have word with vsto add-in which takes 20-30 seconds on first start and 6-7 seconds on second start

3066058
vsto	add-in
going from just word to word with just the vsto add-in or word with just the vba add-in to word with vba and vsto add-in together gave a non-linear increase in cold start time

3066058
vsto	add-in
using a com shim eliminates the vsto runtime but still allows you to safely use .net in the add-in

3066062
karatsuba	strassen
in practice the schã nhageâ strassen algorithm starts to outperform older methods such as karatsuba and toomâ cook multiplication for numbers beyond 2 2 15 to 2 2 17 10 000 to 40 000 decimal digits

3066109
many-to-many	one-to-many
the only way i can think of to truly represent a many-to-many relationship in an xml or any other hierarchical structure is to use many one-to-many relationships

3066129
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine on firefox and google-chrome

3066159
getter	setter
yes i ve set properties and getter and setter which seem to work but only in the initial view controller class

3066162
filtering	grouping
if you are worried about the capturing grouping that might be zero length you can pass the matches through to filtering them out

3066167
cells	tablecell
i initially tried replacing the current tablecell with a customcell in cellforrowatindex however the animation looks a bit choppy as you can see the cells being replaced and overall the effect doesnt work to well

3066186
libsvm	liblinear
if that s the case i believe neither libsvm nor liblinear do that

3066186
libsvm	liblinear
if you re interested in a normal quadratic-programming formulation of the svm with quadratic slack penalties libsvm and liblinear should work

3066220
post	get
before method declaration works fine with soap requests but i am looking for something that would work the same way with http post get requests as well right now i get return class name as element name

3066228
valgrind	memcheck
you can best catch those kinds of errors with valgrind memcheck tool

3066244
websphere	ibm
off the top of my head ibm websphere business monitor provides this capability

3066249
firefox	safari
i noticed that for internet explorer i could be uploading 10 or more files simultaneously but firefox and safari seems to cap the number of uploads to 2

3066262
websphere	ibm
i m in charge of maintaining a jsp based application running on ibm websphere 6.1 ibm j9 jvm

3066360
innodb	myisam
this is a very good thing considering how ludicrously foreign key constraints are implemented in mysql - myisam just ignores them and innodb creates a non-optional index on every single one regardless of whether it makes sense

3066375
ssl	https
https is not another protocol it is merely http over an ssl tls-

3066375
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
if you want to perform an ajax call to a https domain hosted somewhere else other than your domain it is somewhat possible to do so but only in firefox 3.5+ safari google-chrome and i think opera there is some interesting information about how to make cross-domain ajax requests possible here - this method is not supported in ie no surprise there

3066397
google-chrome	firefox
it works great in firefox and google-chrome but when i try and use it in ie 8 it gives me an the xml page cannot be displayed error instead of allowing jquery to load the json being written by the response

3066398
perforce	cvs
i ve used subversion cvs and perforce in the past

3066425
pop-up	dialog
comodo antivirus firewall blocks all applications from calling dll s you have to click allow on the dialog that normally pop-up

3066457
nsuserdefaults	cfpreferences
in nsuserdefaults cfpreferences or is there a way to retrieve it out of the keychain along with the password

3066461
hide	show
just use css to show hide the pages

3066462
post	get
in this way the var quiere get post

3066466
hide	show
you can do a whole bunch of stuff such as hide show rows columns we are talking about table manipulation here because you mentioned a table and even with these show hide actions add delete actions where when you click a delete row or button it deletes that row not only visually but in the database all done via ajax calls to server-side code

3066566
ubuntu	linux
i am attempting to open firefox using c++ on linux ubuntu

3066576
pull	push
once in a while he could git pull upstream_master checkout proprietary and then git merge upstream_master pray for no conflicts to incorporate the new upstream commits and then push to companygit

3066591
wordpress	joomla
i can t speak to the current relative merits of the different tools as it s been a couple of years since i did a comparative evaluation of drupal joomla wordpress and 40+ others

3066596
getter	setter
however for domain objects particularly if your objects do not constitute an anemic domain model where objects are just bags of getter and setter it can be useful to have objects that for example can persist themselves to a datastore etc

3066654
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
used it in touchesbegan touchesmoved

3066682
jar	war
my plan is to create a jar file of the scala compiled artifacts and add that into the lib folder for the war file

3066693
quicksort	median-of-medians
if our selection of a pivot guarantees geometric convergence of quicksort like median-of-medians does then our overall algorithm will be o n

3066696
g++	gcc
install gcc with g++ of course on it and use that g++ dedicated environment

3066697
getter	setter
i would get 1.0 down pat before looking at properties this way you ll understand what they do first they basically just automatically make getter and setter

3066714
int	chars
the other draw back is name requires 30 chars where id is int so .dat and .idx are larger

3066718
stdout	stderr
and if you need to get the stdout or stderr you d use proc.stdout or proc.stderr

3066751
width	height
actual width and height 0 in most

3066762
post	get
here s a contrived scenario that expands on previous answers if the form requires authentication to reach and is easier if the site doesn t care if forms are submitted via post or get

3066785
prepare	execute
the execute and prepare entrypoints could modify the given statement before passing it on to the driver dll

3066785
prepare	execute
an alternative method that might be easier than writing a shim dll would be to hook just the execute and prepare functions probably just sqlexecdirect and sqlprepare

3066806
waitpid	fork
gory details in perldoc -f fork waitpid wait kill and perlipc

3066822
pem	pkcs#12
i already have it in pkcs#12 jks and pem formats

3066842
google-chrome	firefox
that only a part of the code of course the think is firefox and google-chrome display the code above like this

3066906
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works great in ie8 but it won t work in safari firefox or google-chrome

3066942
width	height
i ve got an image where i firstly set its inline style to control the width and height then use direct html attributes width height to try modifying that but failed.

3066950
nexus	artifactory
both sonatype nexus and jfrog artifactory support artifact routing using wildcards or regexes

3066959
google-chrome	firefox
modern browsers firefox google-chrome etc. automatically detect these and apply the css rules onto them as error detection but internet explorer fails to apply css rules because theyre not html tags

3067041
range	max	range	min	min	max
do this by subtracting the center average of the min and max of the range

3067056
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
many browser vendors each use different codecs safari ms use h.264 firefox opera use ogg theora

3067059
hash	salt
only a salt and hash version of passwords should be stored

3067067
google-chrome	firefox
should work on all major browsers or at least firefox and google-chrome

3067101
postgresql	mysql
you may want to try something like the following tested in mysql but i guess it should be easy to port to postgresql

3067175
rss	feed
i am writing an extension for safari5 and i am trying to intercept the fact that the user is clicking on an rss icon and loading a feed ..

3067205
put	get
i had been assigned to develop a system on where we would get a xml from multiple sources millions of xml and put them in some database like and judging from the xml i would receive there wont be any concrete structure even if they are from the same source

3067212
superclass	subclassing
quick answer you can t instantiate an nsmanagedobject subclassing without a context so using an nsmanagedobject as a superclass for something that s not gonna be saved since it s just viewed from the net is probably not a great idea

3067212
superclass	subclassing
therefore product superclass of favoriteproduct has to be a subclassing of nsmanagedobject context too

3067214
nsoperation	nsnotification
-when the nsoperation is finished writing the file it fires a nsnotification defaultcenter the responder should then performselectoronmainthread a method that does the actual updating of the view

3067219
bazaar	svn
you can just disable uninstall bzr-svn plugin if you don t need to work with svn servers from bazaar

3067219
bazaar	svn
it will create bazaar branch in your directory and after that bazaar and tortoisebzr won t try to open svn working copy

3067219
bazaar	svn
so you can add all required files in your svn copy under bazaar version control then commit them

3067235
int	chars
i guess converting int to chars doesn t really work

3067255
openfire	ejabberd
an alternative to comet bayeux that has proven to be working is the combination of an xmpp server such ejabberd or openfire and strophejs developed by jack moffitt his website is

3067275
put	get
if you put a on your page at exactly the position of the element with a lower z-index so that it is completely covered by the latter you might be lucky when the user agent shows it as long as it doesn t get any header sent and doesn t give control of the assigned surface to the pdf reader

3067300
portrait	landscape
i have created a splitviewbased application .when i run the application in portrait mode it doesn t show the splitview when i change the orientation into landscape it shows the splitview.in portrait mode also there is a toolbar button name root list when i click the button it shows popover view to split view

3067319
jndi	jta
it does not ignore j ee elements it support the likes of jndi jta jpa etc

3067386
centos	linux
even on the same platform i ve tried windows xp 7 and centos linux some work some don t.

3067389
folder	directory
my guess is that apache has directory browsing enabled and passenger is routing this request to the public folder which in turn is going to apache direct

3067395
post	get
are they get or post variables

3067412
octal	decimal
2132 in octal equals 1114 in decimal

3067417
hash	md5
it is md5 hash of the current request and your secret key

3067423
post	get
so your use case of saved data but can t retrieve it immediately translates to a 302 redirect for the initial post followed by a 500 for the subsequent get

3067436
hide	show
i have this show hide menu

3067522
src	attr
best guess use a little .filter with a regexp and then the .last element in the set grab its src using attr src

3067579
hide	show
i think that the easier way of doing this is to use the detailtextlabel to show the text and handle the show and hide of the text edit fields in the row selection code

3067588
hide	show
then you will show one and hide the other

3067588
hide	show
when the user executes some action which requires you to change the view then simply hide the displaying panel and unhide show the other one

3067588
hide	show
you can also dynamically load user controls into a panel much like an iframe but i find it easier to have the content in the form and hide show as needed

3067696
google-chrome	firefox
i want to display the same in other browsers like firefox google-chrome etc

3067792
button	checkbox
i want to develop an android application but i dont want to use the default controls button checkbox radio button etc.

3067810
gmail	hotmail
providing user names should not be a security issue think of all the email sites hotmail gmail yahoo where the email address is the username

3067812
mouse	keyboard
i still need to be able to make mouse and keyboard inputs in the active app

3067818
free	malloc
define mymalloc ... and myfree ... in which along with calling malloc free you update a ordered list of pairs address -- the result of malloc blocksize -- the amt of memory requested

3067830
observer-pattern	command-pattern
if you look at the washing system from this perspective you may want to make use of command-pattern inside the controller to model the washing program and of observer-pattern for notifying the subsystems like the door switch listens to the controller for a signal to lock the door

3067862
udp	tcp
javascript ecmascript cannot mess with native browser functionalitys which uses c c++ mostly along with os apis which access tcp udp sockets

3067894
hide	show
prefer hide show than remove create

3067906
implements	extends
by implements the above on your entities you can extends them with a partial class

3067921
codeblocks	codelite
we sort of settled on it but later found codelite and liked it better than codeblocks

3067933
versioning	upgrade
if you found it did something specific with your current compiler you could try and handle that but it might do different things in debug and release and different again when you upgrade the compiler versioning

3067940
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
yes the server must have either a clientaccesspolicy.xml file or a crossdomain.xml file

3067968
fflush	gets
however this never gets executed in pipe mode since i guess standard input has not been fflush

3067974
super	implements
after hours of research online i wasn t able to find a super good option so i m implements this hack

3067977
onclick	onsubmit
another problem is you bind your submit event to onclick but the natural submit for form is onsubmit

3067985
jobs	cron
i m trying to get some cron jobs going through dreamost using their panel

3067996
width	height
as i said in ckeditor-ckfinder default attributes width and height to uploaded images the output_html.html sample shows how to use attributes and not styles for the dimensions

3068007
firefox	safari
all declarations for .nsub first-child are being ignored in both firefox 3.6 and safari 4

3068015
jobs	cron
editing cron jobs manually is a pain in the ass and rails has some nice utilities to avoid it

3068015
jobs	cron
if you want these cron jobs to be automatically updated every time you deploy to dreamhost just put it in as part of your capistrano deploy.rb

3068019
disk	ram
velocity seems quite heavyweight and overkill the files totally take 467 kb of disk space haven t measured the ram it takes so far because i didn t manage to make it run see below

3068080
igraph	networkx
you might consider using igraph or some other graph library like networkx to do the job instead

3068084
yourkit	jprofiler	yourkit	hprof	hprof	jprofiler
some profiling tools that you can use for that are yourkit jprofiler and hprof this one is a command line tool

3068121
post	get
even if you re not and if you re defying convention and updating from the show action you re trying to navigate to a post action with a get request

3068122
srp	principles
i was confused how this approach combines with srp single responsibilty principles from oop world

3068132
ncover	nant
previously we used nunit 2.4.3.0 and ncover 1.5.8.0 within our nant scripts but nunit 2.4.3.0 doesn t like .net 4.0 projects

3068132
versioning	upgrade
so we upgrade to a newer versioning of the nunit framework within the test project itself but then found that ncover 1.5.8.0 doesn t support this versioning of nunit

3068132
ncover	partcover
in terms of the coverage side of things for reporting into cruisecontrol.net we have found that partcover is a good candidate for substituting-out ncover as the newer version of ncover is quite dear and partcover is free but this is a few steps down the line yet as we can t get the test runners to work first

3068180
rss	feed
rss feed are correctly saved and retrieved from feed table but when saving to the articles table logcat is saying that it cannot save extracted text to it s column

3068203
int	chars
the problem is that console.read returns an int not a chars

3068203
int	chars
however int can be converted to chars simply by casting it

3068250
getter	setter
i used to employ validating getter and setter and that was a horrible idea

3068270
versioning	upgrade
i ve upgrade php on my local dev system to versioning 5.3.0 and there is some problem when i use constants in application.ini - following manual i have

3068317

extern int read_data const chars

3068384
pull	push
i m running a mixed environment and keep a central bare repository where i pull and push most of my stuff

3068420
floor	math.h
the log10 abs and floor functions are provided by math.h

3068428
wordpress	joomla
i know wordpress joomla drupal etc most of php_mysql stack can auto detect update in software itself or and plugin and either ask for user permission to update or auto update it

3068458
glfw	sdl	glut	sdl	glut	glfw
make him download one of the frameworks sdl qt glfw glut

3068486
plink	prompt
the best i ve achieved is running plink command line version of putty as a subshell but i m still getting spurious characters and duplicated prompt like this

3068496
portrait	landscape
this table will only print in landscape and all other pages will print in portrait mode only

3068506
int	chars
however if you don t need the extra range and simply never go below 0 then it doesn t really matter and you can save a chars by using an int

this will send stdout and stderr to dev null

3069012
stateless	stateful
first you probably need to distinguish between stateless and stateful ejbs

3069012
stateless	stateful
that said if you need to perform something before a method is called i suggest you use an interceptor using interceptor works for stateless and stateful ejbs

3069015
coalesce	isnull
you can use isnull or better coalesce to return a value instead of a null

3069128
multiplying	addition	multiplying	add
in addition to the speed issue mentioned by mark byers i ve used unchecked when computing hash codes for objects - the typical method for creating a hash code from multiple items for example object members is to iteratively multiplying your working hash code by some factor then add the hash code for the new item and repeat

it s possible that it s inherited from a base-class so make sure you check if string is part of an inherited hierarchy

3069245
cos	sin
all angle based math i did gave wrong answers because the way sin cos are implemented in c++

3069283
hide	show
it only show the div when you click but won t hide it when you click again

hide	show
all the rest of the actions work perfectly as in the div hide when anything but the image that show it is clicked

3069322
post	get
use this sql to get the most recent published post in cat_id the id for the category

3069322

3069506
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome gives abc.jpg where as ie7 ie8 gives c xyz abc.jpg

3069529
cos	sin
and you can find this line without any sin cos calls

3069529
cos	sin
now about the math how do you find out the winding-order of three points without calling sin cos or even worse atan

3069539
google-chrome	firefox
it cannot be shared among different browser makes ie firefox google-chrome etc

3069573
sqoop	hadoop
if hadoop only copies data from postgresql and no updates are done on the hadoop site try using sqoop - simple database into hadoop import tool

3069612
accessor	properties
as a side note you probably want to make your name properties copy so it doesn t change under your feet and use in createsatus to use the properties accessor

3069656
sorting	filtering
sorting it filtering it adding up columns

3069673
octal	decimal
10 octal is 8 decimal

3069720
internationalization	translation
this is not specific to error messages but in terms of qt if you are think about internationalization and possibly having to translation all your user facing text the linguist manual programmers section is a must read

3069774
ant	maven
i don t think you can set a property from ant that will be visible from maven

3069798
gif	png
that byte could then be sent to the browser using a response.binarywrite and a content-type of image type - jpg png gif

3069812
int	chars
if your variable stores a constant value such as static final int num_gears 6 the convention changes slightly capitalizing every letter and separating subsequent words with the underscore chars

3069866
sortedmap	sortedset	equals	compareto
as far as i know things such as sortedmap or sortedset use compareto rather than equals on types for checking equality contains containskey

3069873
children	parent
i believe this is because my data has children with multiple parent nodes

3069886
sortedmap	sortedset
so there is no way to put objects that are not comparable in a sortedmap or sortedset

3069901
public	protected
i thought i understood that to be because of the ability of the use of the modifiers private public internal protected

3069904
sortedmap	sortedset
no using sortedmap or sortedset on equatable but not comparable types is a horrible idea

3069904
comparator	comparable
if they re not comparable intrisically or through a comparator they should not be used in a sortedset

3069905
sortedmap	sortedset
there is no point of using sortedmap and sortedset if you don t need it to be sorted

3069917
ddms	adb
ddms uses adbd to request the information so root is not required as adb has the permissions needed to request the data from dev graphics fb0

3069959

fields can either be public or private or protected in case of props you can make them read-only publicly but writable privately

3069987
getter	setter
although it s accepted practice to not put large amounts of code in getter and setter you can t just assume that since it s a property it will behave quickly

3070016
put	get
put image into something like paint and get it s coordinates not the coordinates on the web page obviosuly so it will still work anywhere on the page

3070027
getter	setter
one of the nice things about properties is that the getter and the setter can have different levels of access

3070059
serializable	deserialization
the documentation for the storable class which is used by apache session file uses storable deparse and storable eval but also goes on to suggest a method for serializable of code references and deserialization in a safe compartment

3070072
comparator	comparable
the javadocs would tend to suggest this all keys inserted into a sorted map must implement the comparable interface or be accepted by the specified comparator

3070080
treemap	treeset
then use a treeset or treemap which you construct with a custom comparator

3070103
post	get
a header redirect would pass along get variables if using but lose post ones

3070117
accessor	properties
there are other ways to achieve this goal but using properties and varying accessor visibility is a good one to consider if you re doing interface-based development or if you expose libraries to others etc

3070147
sortedmap	sortedset
if you must use sortedset sortedmap then provide a comparator like ptomli mentions in his answer

3070182
min	max
if your table is simply too large for your column row data perhaps performing whatever meaningful operation aggregation you re after avg sum min max etc would be better than simply saving off the counts individually

you just put it in your url add it to your routes before the controller and then you get it passed to your methods just like any other paramter

3070192

to have getter and setter for a field annotate it with beanproperty

3070286
getter	setter
the compiler will generate the java-style getter and setter for you

3070307
mp4	h.264
i use this technique for reformatting h.264 videos inside an flv container into an mp4 container which drastically improves lip sync in some cases

when width of the img changes height also changes

3070330
wtl	atl
my code is c++ wtl atl directshow and various other libraries

try exporting the rtp file stream into a dump file in wireshark right-click an rtp packet â follow udp stream â save as and then send the file via gst-launch to be demuxed

3070384
serializable	deserialization
but this also seems inconvenient because it means that i have to worry about serializable and deserialization

3070433
client-side	server-side
i am implementing jquery client-side validation and would like to pull in my error messages from the server both to support internationalisation and to make sure that validation gracefully degrades if javascript is not available in that the error messages pushed back into the view from the server-side validation are identical to those displayed dynamically by the jquery validation

3070436
inherited	subclassing
a random note if you are using single table inherited sti and forget to remove the initialize method from your subclassing definitions you will get a similar nil object when you didn t expect it exception

3070482
dlsym	dlopen
i think it can be achieved using dlopen and dlsym but i am not sure about it.please correct me if i am wrong

3070487
lisp	scheme
even in scheme which is a definitive lisp the prevailing style favours passing functions over writing macros

3070500
ravendb	couchdb
ravendb mongodb and couchdb jump to mind as possible solutions

3070504
src	attr
img.svg2png attr src ...

i know about - array list stack queue linked list hashtable tree and its different forms like b-tree trie etc

3070520
rss	feed
trying to create a simple rss2 feed that i could later pass on to feedburner but can t get rss feed to display images at all

3070550
dlsym	dlopen
late aka dynamic binding doesn t have anything to do with dynamically loaded modules which is what dlopen and dlsym are about per se

3070572
inherited	properties
oddly because c# only uses region s to block out inherited properties it seems that i can t explicitly specify the implementing interface of sku in c# like i can in vb.net

3070579
put	get
if i get the answer i d put it in the extension and publish it

3070596
folder	directory
additionally since there is no default.aspx or similar default document in the folder you re accessing iis defaults to attempting to list the directory s contents

3070604
jlist	jlabel
in your case the jlist is actually using a jlabel to display each item so you just need the list model to return the string values in the list as html and it should all work

3070607
rss	feed
i can imagine these sites publish a lot of their content also in rss feed which you can use to keep your indexes up to date faster than you would by continuously crawling them

3070654
width	height
it scrolling performance for the larger images.here whole display size is set as the height and width of the view

3070655
post	get
i found this post python regex vs php regex but i actually did not get if python s regex syntax matches php s regex syntax

3070671
getter	setter
2 - we re adding the field batiments to the complextype which is defined via a getter and setter in the class as

3070705
pull	push
if this is a situation you encounter regularly a good idea would be to keep bare repos on your small laptop and push pull from that regularly using the ssh protocol

3070731
vmware	virtualbox
i do some test on vmware and virtualbox and published them on my site www.ilsistemista.net

3070743

installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
due to various issues with persuading the various msis to upgrade properly the installation process is now governed by a wizard-style program that detects what is currently installed and handles upgrade by storing the user s current settings uninstalling the existing software and installing the new versioning s

3070820
google-chrome	firefox
i can open the same document via https in firefox and in google-chrome

3070855
setinterval	settimeout
you can use settimeout and setinterval in javascript to time ajax calls

3070861
pull	push
rollback exists and has it s odd name because it grew out of mercurial s commit push pull transaction system

3070872
post	get
post more of that code to get more help

3070885
stringbuilder	bufferedreader
the bufferedreader string and stringbuilder methods should suffice

3070921
jar	war
in addition getresourceasstream is typically used to access a file within a jar or war you cannot write there

3070987
getter	setter
you would have to use a getter setter

3071013
cvs	svn
every other feature should work pretty much the same way as svn or cvs does today

3071017
activemq	rabbitmq
activemq is buggy and many systems removed it in favour of rabbitmq or sun openmq

3071045
sorting	grouping
because when we have a grouping like 3 5 7 6 1 without sorting how can we find the median

3071056
pull	push
see git encrypt decrypt remote repository files while push pull

3071062
ibatis	mybatis
but if you don t want to risk you should consider using old good proven java orms hibernate jpa ibatis that was recently renamed to mybatis etc

3071120
post	get
when using the type library importer see alex k s post you might even get a couple of likely non-visual components to work with

3071131
folder	directory
these are stored in the project s directory under the dependencies folder

3071160
sapi	tapi
i m currently using a .net tapi wrapper and the sapi 5.3 interop assembly and the steps i m taking to speak over the phone are

3071211
folder	directory
i have a file upload page which dynamically creates a directory folder for the target location of the file to be uploaded to

3071217
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly in google-chrome and firefox but the second one never works in ie 7 or 8 no matter what i do

3071234
filepath	unc
you should not have to call mappath for a unc filepath

3071248
post	put
it appears they disabled the ability to put the image you send in your post

3071261
dlsym	dlopen
frerich raabe the basic late binding mechanism can be implemented as your said but you can use a combination of dlopen dlclose dlsym and pointers to function to get something like

3071326
jquery	scriptaculous
unfortunately the project is heavily tied to the prototype api and scriptaculous so the option of using jquery or any other framework is unavailable

3071354
post	get
to get an application token look at the excellent description from the post from dynamoman on may 7 2010 about the fourth post down

3071416
pull	push
now you can push to this and pull from it but can t work directly over there

3071419
maven	pom.xml
there has been some issues with ordering of execution mng-3719 mng-2258 but it should be fine with maven 2.2.1 and plugins should be executed in the same order as they are listed in the pom.xml when bound to the same phase

3071429
freebsd	linux
basically non-blocking event loop utilizes device that allows for waiting for multiple events simultaneously select poll on unix waitformultipleevents on windows epoll on linux kqueue on freebsd etc

3071445
udp	tcp
initally encountered some firewall issues but after disabling my workstation s windows firewall and having tcp port 135 and udp 4500 500 opened up by the it group i got a little further

3071448
google-chrome	firefox
when i have 5 ide s open sql server 2008 notepad++ oxygenxml editor and google-chrome ie firefox all open in my vm then my main machine has outlook onenote and a few other programs running it turns to crap

3071449
post	get
when i post the form i see that all of the selected values get posted but all are bound to the same name foo

3071449
post	get
so i seemingly cannot get each of the posted values i am using django python server-side to handle the post

3071455
getter	setter
the advantage being that you could control the scope of the field to only be accesible in the property code so you don t have to worry about anything else in your class playing with the state without using the getter setter

3071462
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works on google-chrome and firefox but in safari and ie it only works if i set the cookie permissions in the browser to the lowest possible which is impractical for average users

3071470
width	height
to work around this problem before setting windowstate to maximized set width and height to zeros first

3071526
put	get	post	put	post	get
the reason that rest seems to work well is that it is a natural fit for the client-server nature of the web with its separation of safe and idempotent get requests idempotent put requests and post for requests that are neither safe nor idempotent

3071526
put	get	post	put	post	get
an example of this is that a web crawler will know only to request resources using get because it is guaranteed not to affect the resource whereas put and post requests have different rules

3071538
free	malloc
when i replace new delete with malloc free there is no crash

3071582
installation	upgrade
i just upgrade one of my many blogs to wordpress 3.0 and i was glad to see that i now should be able to run all my blogs from a central installation

3071584
free	malloc
reasoning if you were able to trivially replace new with malloc you re probably allocating an array of primitive types rather than an object and naively using delete in place of free on the assumption that object allocation and array allocation are the same in c++

3071595
min	max
you can set the form s max min size properties so the full usercontrol row always shows have to do to prevent horiz

3071648
pascal	delphi
have a look to delphi pascal object and some exemples

3071667
pull	push
i am able to clone and pull updates but when i try to push i get

3071908
google-chrome	firefox
it seems like in ie a mousemove event is always fired right at the beginning in firefox never and in google-chrome strange enough if the script is loaded from an online location but not if it s loaded from my local disk

3072030
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
that works in firefox google-chrome safari and obviously not in ie7

3072097
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
found the answer the loaded ajax page had tags wrapping the script tag removed the tags presto works in ie firefox safari google-chrome and opera

3072123
inherited	properties
rather than suffer a headache over it i d probably be inclined to just have icartitem offer its own sku properties and not inherited from iskuitem at all

3072137
getter	setter
if you use synthesize in your implementation then what you re implementing there are public sets of getter and setter

3072153
slug	permalinks
it gives you the flexibility to use persited permalinks slug also strip diacritics convert to full ascii etc

3072201
melt	reshape
use melt from the reshape package to get from this format to the one laid out above

3072211
swt	swing
but in practice it all depends on swt and swing implementations on each platform

3072226
cvs	svn
for that you should use a vcs git svn or cvs as stated on other answers

3072246
maven	pom.xml
it is also a dependency manager which means when you realize the server piece of your project needs apache commons-logging 1.0.4 but the client conflicts with anything past 0.7.9 you can just add a couple lines to the respective pom.xml files and maven handles all of that downloading installing and keeping track of the different versions of those dependencies

3072260
scheme	racket
racket formerly plt scheme has a statically typed dialect which is designed to work nicely with scheme idioms -- including macros

3072283
initializer	class-method
for regular methods you can of course call base class-method with base.somemethod ... but there s no initializer style available

3072310
post	put
when you post a form the values that are posted are put into modelstate

3072310
post	get
i would personally look into that and maybe implement the prg post redirect get pattern

3072341
google-chrome	safari
however my script works fine using safari and google-chrome and plays the tracks in sequence

3072342
wxpython	pyqt
personally i would just write a python script with pyserial and something like pyqt or wxpython gui libraries to filter the data to different windows

3072350
children	parent
i want to extract the parent children as well as page name

3072350
children	parent
all said i need an efficient way to parse out the parent children as well as page name from a string

3072362
ant	maven
maven introduced convention over configuration this helps if some colleagues write bigger ant scipts than code

3072363
put	get
grab the contactid that was returned and put it into get textbox and click submit

3072368
sudo	passwd
so i run it again with sudo it asks me for my passwd i type it in hit return

3072399
integer	unsigned
i.e. you ll have to do something like example should be in the ballpark for a 128-bit unsigned integer type

3072441
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
works perfectly on google-chrome firefox and even desktop windows safari -- but not on the iphone

3072487
ssl	https
i m accustomed to nix servers and if we wanted a completely secure sign in screen we as far as i am aware are to use ssl via https

3072487
pop-up	dialog
this page is using http and what appears to be basic auth a pop-up dialog for an sql server report manager

3072508
filesystems	ntfs
this is a feature of the ntfs filesystems one that s unfortunately well hidden because explorer has no support for showing their content

3072518
inherited	properties
i don t want to manually set all those values especially if my inherited class only has a couple of extra properties

3072522
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
of course it works fine in firefox google-chrome and safari

3072548
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firebug extension for firefox yes it also supports breakpoints or the webkit inspector that s built into safari and google-chrome by default

3072548
profiling	debugging
both offer javascript debugging profiling and a lot of other useful features

3072578
.htaccess	httpd.conf
if i have the httpd.conf virtualhost section and the web site s root .htaccess configured one way apache does not read the index.php file www dot mywebsite dot com fails writes nothing to the rewrite log and places this error in the general error log file

3072578
.htaccess	httpd.conf
yet again with the same httpd.conf and .htaccess settings i can get to my login screen www dot mywebsite dot com account login succeeds and there is plenty of information in the rewrite log

3072617
keydown	keyup
you could take a look at the keydown keyup or keypress events depending on your use case and then check what character was last typed in the textarea in the handler

3072623
uilabel	uitextview
the contents in the p element the block tags are missing in your example can be passed to a uilabel or uitextview whichever is appropriate

3072645
arp	mtu
the ip arp protocols come into play when your packet is larger than the path mtu

3072672
bitwise-and	modulo
because no other class of numbers shares this property you can t create bitwise-and expressions for most modulo expressions

3072680
x86	64bit
e.g the x86 architecture has 32 bit pointers most arithmetic is performed in 32 bit registers but it also has native support for some basic 64bit operations

3072681

lots of code in getter setter in several properties of entity classes core business validations business data refresh etc.

3073474

3074846
versioning	upgrade
probably an optimizer may not implement optimized in evaluation process but this doesn t exclude that one time it could happen with a database versioning upgrade

3074849
width	height
instead of using a background to display the png blend we can use an img element and set the width and the height to 100

3074874
inherited	subclassing
if you want to use -initwithnibname bundle the cleanest way imo would be to have all view controller inherited from a common subclassing where you define the outlets they have in common

all works fine on safari firefox but not the dreaded ie which shows a white background behind the text

3074928
background-color	transparency
i also tried background-color transparency all to no avail

post	get
background is that i configured the notifier to report method not allowed exception eg this is raised when an action is accessed with get instead of post

the problem with this approach is that es5 object.create has a signature of 2 arguments first â an object to inherited from and second optional â an object representing properties or rather descriptors to add to newly created object

3075832
nsinteger	double
you might for instance be making assumptions about the size of some object that is not true for instance using a double instead of a cgfloat or a int64_t instead of an nsinteger

3075929
folder	directory
make sure you can write in your current folder current working directory

3076277
free	malloc
it seems to me it should have increased each time a malloc is called and no free

3076301
calloc	malloc
however if you change that address each time the function is entered via malloc or calloc you ve lost the reference to the blocks from the previous allocation

3076301

3076443
put	get
not get or put files from my application to another existing server

3076487
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
always check for null pointer on return from a memory allocation function call such as calloc malloc and realloc ...it will always be the onus on the programmer to manage the free ing up of pointers to return them back to the heap

3076539
width	height
second as youâ ve already observed glcopyteximage2d requires its width and height arguments to be power-of-two as well

qtextedit	qframe	qscrollarea	qframe	qscrollarea	qtextedit
it turns out that since the qtextedit is inside a qframe that is the main widget in a qscrollarea the qscrollarea has a constraint that it will not resize the internal widget unless the widgetresizable property is true

3076881
qscrollarea	qtextedit
so the moral of the story is that the qtextedit code was correct in overriding sizehint but the qscrollarea was ignoring the value returned from the main frame s sizehint

3076888
isnull	nullif	coalesce	isnull	coalesce	nullif
this means is null is quicker query for query but it could add coalesce nullif isnull complexity

jar	war
i looked in my ear file and it has both the war and jar

3077280

start with a system hash say grab the macs on any nics sorted and the cpu-id info plus some other stuff concatenate it all together and take an md5 of the result you really don t want to be handling personally identifiable information if you don t have to append the cd s serial number and refuse to boot unless some registry key or some datafile has a valid signature for the blob

3081260
onresume	onpause
i think what you should probably do is have your activity listen for the device orientation and use onpause onresume to handle the registering for orientation changes

3081282
public	protected
this all said a destructor should usually be public and virtual or protected unless a class is not meant to be a base class

3081312
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
works on google-chrome safari opera and firefox

3081340
qtableview	qstandarditemmodel
i use qtableview + qstandarditemmodel to show some data data stored in some other data structure and this table view is sortable

3081383
public	protected
there are different issues with what you propose the first of which is already dealt in other answers you only need virtual destructors if you intend to delete through a pointer to a base a general recommendation is to provide either a public virtual destructor or a protected non-virtual destructor as that would inhibit deletion through the base class

3081393
put	get
my usual method of code reading stepping through it with the debugger didn t work because this is a gui program and as soon as you get to the main loop it doesn t stop until there s a breakpoint and where to put the breakpoints is basically what i m trying to find out

3081405
realloc	malloc
if there s a chance you may have really really long lines and you have to process line by line you could malloc a resonable buffer and use realloc to double it s size each time you get close to filling it

3081411
struts	wicket
the main thing that drives my choice between wicket and some other framework struts 2 tends to be the other one is the statefullness of the web app

3081418
children	parent
2 when parent is back from client save it and all its children in the db in a new session

3081462
filesystems	ntfs
some filesystems offer their own metadata as ntfs and later do but this particular metadata is coming from the file itself and not from the filesystems

3081462
mp3	flac
to modify the metadata in the files in question you probably can use the mutagen library assuming these are mp3 aac flac vorbis etc

3081478
fink	macports
my experience in supporting users of mod_wsgi is however that macports and fink are an absolute pita

3081479
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome konqueror and rhino it seems to create an array with a single element undefined

3081479

3081487
ssl	https
http https ssl

3081502
ubuntu	linux
i have a new ubuntu linux server 64bit 10.04 lts

3081517
spaces	delimiter
i am assuming maybe a delimiter - like spaces character

3081535
range	percentile
to get 65th percentile you ll want at least 20 buckets in that range but be generous and make it 80

3081569
folder	directory
you can record to either the docs folder for your app or the tmp directory

3081571
accessor	properties
you need to set start date using self.startdate in viewdidload - in this way you will call the accessor and use the retain in your properties statement

3081597
opera	firefox
this answer is a bit out there - for it to be valid html you d have to define your own dtd and in any case it doesn t work in ie or opera works in firefox

3081616
accessor	properties
the bracket notation properties accessor implicitly converts the expression between brackets into a string so

3081616
accessor	properties
the expression implicitly converts the 1 number primitive to an object this is made by the properties accessor and it lookups a properties named the properties lookup is made on the number.prototype and the object.prototype objects for example

3081625
cassini	iis
i am trying to host a wcf service using iis works fine in cassini

3081636
google-chrome	firefox
you can view it live on cssdesk this method works in a lot more than google-chrome but breaks in firefox 3.0 and just doesn t work in a number of ie versions

3081714
ostream	istream
if you have an istream overload for a type that reads data in a particular format then if you implement an ostream overload for the same type it should output in the same format otherwise it could get quite confusing

3081731
pop-up	dialog
the dialog that pop-up should allow you to configure the type of behavior you re looking for

3081770
cvs	svn
git will be no less appropriate for a corporate environment than something like cvs or svn

3081771
ant	maven
if it s maven based simply use the ant task to copy the class to your target classes in the appropriate phase i guess compile-sources or such - something before test

3081855
folder	directory
this will return an array of all the paths to the sub directory of the music folder

3081872
hash	md5
but there s that issuse of collisions and i think salting the md5 hash maybe with the name of the table should make it more robust

3081883
g++	gcc
i believe you re trying to compile main.cpp with gcc instead of g++

3081900
width	height
you want to make sure your flash swf is set to use 100 100 and then when you want to trigger full screen mode change the html container to be placed in the top-left-most corner and have a width height of 100 of screen

3081900
toolbar	tabs
you ll still have the browser s toolbar and tabs and address bar but if you want keyboard input there aren t many options

3081902
folder	directory
if the problem isnt relating to your path i suppose it is delete your lib and scripts folder in your project directory to clear out the virtualenv settings

3081902
virtualenv	yolk
activate the virtualenv and then install yolk

3081943
inherited	properties
for instance i found myself on a project where i had to analyze a site that used oop with deep inherited 2 and one of the important base classes had a public properties called name

3081943
getter	setter
however it also had getter and setter getname setname that accessed that property for the mere purpose of getting and setting it

3081943
getter	setter
the magic methods allowed me to solve the problem by renaming the property to _name and making it private forcing all requests to the property through the getter and setter

3081943
getter	setter
this being said there s no need for getter and setter if you re just treating a property like a variable

3081943
getter	setter
in your case since there is validating sanitizing going on you should employ getter and setter and code them directly as methods rather than unnecessarily incurring the overhead from the magic methods

3081949
int	boolean
i d use id int and backupenabled boolean and use a cron script or quartz to enable disable backups

3082000
post	get
i m trying to query a wordpress database and get the post titles to sort in a correct order

3082002
int	boolean
in python you can not update an immutable type from inside a function like the boolean in your example or an int or a string or a tuple ...

3082029
postgresql	mysql
using a database application mysql postgresql sqlite is out of the question because it will require more configuration than the user needs to do i don t want the user to do any kind of configuration if he doesn t want to

3082031
button	checkbox
i noticed that my radial and checkbox button didnt seem to be working

3082073
integer	unsigned
the unsigned right shift operator is used in the all the array extra s method implementations of mozilla to ensure that the length property is a unsigned 32-bit integer

3082100
put	get
if i put that code in awakefromnib then nstableview again get initialize

3082103

post	get
if i get the time i ll edit this to post code and performance of the algorithm

3082126
free	malloc
when is it appropriate to use vla compared to malloc free

3082171
udp	tcp
it makes less sense to fragment tcp than it does to fragment udp

3082171
udp	mtu
you can send a single udp segment greater in length than the mtu

3082180
put	get
i had to put the initial in there otherwise you get use of unassigned local variable compilation errors but i think it s actually benign

3082225
udp	tcp
ie tcp s 3 way handshake im here i see you lets pass traffic just a simple connection is a little vague but i guess you can say it would encompass all kinds of connections both established connections and connectionless with protocols like udp a one way dont care if you get the data connection

3082239
portrait	landscape
see android - switching between landscape and portrait mode makes intent lose values

3082262
selecteditem	selectedindex
you don t have to update selectedindex after updating selecteditem flex will update it automatically - try tracing selectedindex after updating the selecteditem

3082302
free	malloc
it has also better scaling as there s no need of locking one problem that can arise when using malloc free

3082318
webclient	httpwebrequest
if you were creating an outbound request yourself using the httpwebrequest class you could set its .useragent property or you could add to the .headers collection if you were using a webclient class

3082335
superclass	subclassing
this allows you to have methods that only your superclass knows about and methods that subclassing can know about

3082345
moq	moles
i actually use moq and moles in the same test project

3082345
moq	moles
generally i use moq for the standard sort of aaa testing with verification and moles is the big gun for the otherwise unmockable things like extension method calls etc

3082348
haskell	scheme
i dont know haskell but in scheme fold-right will always act on the last element of a list first

3082387
min	max
edit updated you want to cache per min max too

3082407
int	chars
you can convert each chars to int and sum them up

3082409
inherited	subclassing
subclassing inherited formal

3082413
hash	md5
here is a simple implementation that uses the md5 hash of the string and uses modulus to scale it into your required range

3082419
inherited	properties
i next then thought that i should have a properties in the enrolmentapplication class that has get set properties to serialise deserialise the xml properties for me however i would either have to move the applicationform class into the data project or create another class that inherited from enrolmentapplication

3082428
for-loop	loops
i reformatted the code changed some variable names and changed the while loops to a for-loop

3082438
public	protected
because c# does not have any mechanism for providing public private protected inheritance which is what you are actually after

3082438
inherited	subclassing
imho c# enforces stronger is-a relationship via single base class inherited so it makes sense that if a car has an engine a bmw subclassing shouldn t be able to hide it

3082452
folder	directory
it will create your repository in the .git folder in the current directory

3082482
rss	feed
i m using the google ajax feed api to search for a rss feed

3082504

getter	setter
i have ofcourse a getter and setter for those two

3082513
portrait	landscape
they will be visible on both landscape and portrait mode

3082553
cpu	processors
as far as i know and i could be wrong amd does not yet have cpu threads but they have provided a way to detect them that i assume will work on future amd processors which may have cpu threads

3082556
xsl-fo	xslt
for filling in the blanks kind of documents a regular reporting engine may be a better fit or some straighforward xslt stylesheets spitting out the xsl-fo directly

3082568
nspredicate	nsmanagedobject
i am able successfully retrieve nsmanagedobject s using an nspredicate query like this

3082579
width	height
this code essentially asks for the pixel width and height for a movie file to determine if it s the dimension of an hd movie or not is the reason

3082595
mouse	joystick
and mouse or joystick moves.

3082602
plot	heatmap
note that this relies on image rather than heatmap as the latter offsets the plot making it more difficult to put text in the correct position

3082622
inherited	properties
ie doesn t understand inherited properties

3082625
move	drag
is it possible to drag or move an images which are in cells to pos 1 from pos 2 as shown below

cookie is a small piece of data stored on the client-side browser and session is a text file stored on the server-side whose name is stored in the cookie

3082675
google-chrome	firefox
i executed but only firefox and google-chrome moves the textarea 0px from top and 0px from left but in ie

3082728
free	malloc
free is called to deallocate the memory allocated by malloc function call

3082743
portrait	landscape
this would also prevent the current screen from rotating from portrait to landscape

3082772
free	malloc
others i ve developed had different pools for 16-byte chunks 64-bytes chunks 256-byte chunks and 1k chunks again using a bitmask to reduce the overhead of the accounting information and to increase the speed of malloc and free no need to coalesce adjacent free blocks particularly important in the environment we were working in

3082776
free	malloc
when malloc allocates the memory from the free list it will allocate size + sizeof struct mallocheader and return the address of data

3082819
post	get
i would add that you should prefer to send your url parameters via post instead of get otherwise you may be leaving private data all over the place in logfiles browser windows etc

3082852
postgresql	mysql
it is powerful and allows you work with many of the persistence tools that are aimed at other databases like mysql and postgresql

3082868
button	checkbox
these admins want to print these documents preferably by just ticking checkbox in the file list form and clicking a print button

3082882
post	get
you will get an array called _post options in your post with check1 and check2 as your keys

3082893
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
explorer safari opera 10.5 and google-chrome web authors face new

3082938
mouseover	mouseout
the problem i have is that the section of the first path that is overlapped by the bounding box of the second path won t fire the mouseover mouseout or click events

3082938
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
on google-chrome safari and opera i don t have this problem

3082938
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
now try the same thing in google-chrome safari opera and you will see that it works as expected

3082966
punctuation	words
says i want zero or more non words characters which is satisfied by the punctuation and space characters and finally

3082968
move	drag
when map move part of path that was out of visible area becomes invisible until user drag map with finger

3082991
mouseover	mouseout
mouseover and mouseout are now implemented in v3 polyline

3083006
free	malloc
both these options managed to reduce the overhead of the accounting information and to increase the speed of malloc and free no need to coalesce adjacent blocks when freeing particularly important in the environment we were working in

3083011
memcpy	strcpy	strlen	strcpy
the function strcpy is considered unsafe but your memcpy .. src strlen src is quite unsafe too

3083034
portrait	landscape
as you ve noticed that things workfine when webview is initialized in portrait and then you turn it to landscape

3083034
portrait	landscape
now as the contents started loading when the frame size of your webview were according to portrait say 320 460 so converting your webview to landscape will automatically adjust your web view if you have this line in your code

3083047
folder	directory
then i go iis version 7.5 create a virtual directory to my published folder then convert it to web application

3083054
uiview	subviews
i have a lot of uiview added as a subviews to this scrollview

3083094
width	height
if you have your stage resize mode to noscale then you expand your flash area just by placing something off of screen though obviously it wont be displayed this can then be calculated by using the height and width properties of the main instance and then passing it to a javascript command via externalinterface which can then update the size of your flash in the html view

3083136
int	double
double int short long

3083167
cpython	ironpython
because there are some bugs that ironpython load cpython code

3083175
implements	extends
i indeed build against the level 8 targetsdkversion with level 3 minsdkversion and try to use a wrapper class with reflection to overcome the problem that the application will not run if you implements a class that extends an nonexisting class

3083222
opera	firefox
while some browsers intentionally keep the page state even when you navigate away from it notably opera and firefox a memory leak means memory that the program doesn t use anymore but forgot to release

3083241
pop-up	dialog
maybe you could have a form saying something like waiting for x or something like that that has no close buttons etc and that you pop-up when needed as a application modal dialog that way you avoid the issue with all windows of the app being disabled while at the same time giving feedback to the user of why he can t do anything

3083289
mef	prism
for the client side silverlight i can use mef prism but i m not sure what would be a good approach to tackle this problem on the server

3083297
ostringstream	std
instead of using char buffers and sprintf consider using std string and std ostringstream

3083318
postgresql	mysql
to summarize i am trying to balance the pros and cons of learning using .net and c# in particular which looks like a beautiful language but if i do i want to deploy on apache linux with either mysql or postgresql backend - as opposed to iis windows sqlserver

3083382
nvda	voiceover
examples of screen readers are nvda www.nvda-project.org for windows orca for the gnome desktop on unix platforms and voiceover included by default in macosx

3083382
nvda	voiceover
now if you wish to see how this works nvda and orca are opensource projects and voiceover is included in macosx 10.4 i think and higher so you can try one of these at no cost unlike some of the commercial offerings which can be very expensive

3083405
folder	directory
the dialog box shows the correct directory and according to my web host the security on the folder is correct

3083449
subtract	add
otherwise you can use sqlcedatareader to retrieve all the data you need from the database for example any records from the 12th and 15th cache them in some list or something if needed for easier processing process the data as needed subtract etc then just add the data in the list to your grid

3083542
decoder	encoder
i m looking for either open-source or commercially available audio and videl encoder decoder for android for an application i want to write for android

3083542
amr	aac
for audio i want to be able to both encode-decode the amr ad-pcm aac formats and for video h.263 h.264 mpeg4 formats

3083542

but for rest of the codecs both audio video that i ve listed decoder is there but not encoder if i got it right

3083691
post	get
get post parameters with apache2 request param

3083695
preferenceactivity	preferencescreen
but it seems that preferenceactivity requests itself to have preferencescreen as a root element of preference hierarchy

3083717
post	get
afaik sharepoint should also support http get post for reading writing data

3083738
wxpython	pyqt
i would look at pyqt and wxpython first

3083748
inherited	properties
every control in wpf inherited properties from its parent

3083758
put	get
my test code the call to gst_element_factory_make is written in a songbird adon but i get the same results if i put my code in a separate executable

3083774
implements	extends
so you can provide some implementation while you leave the choice whether extends your abstract class or implements the interface

3083774
implements	extends
since you should prefer composition over inheritance its easier to make your own class with a private instance of your class x which implements interface y and implements y with your wrapper too than extends a abstract class

3083887
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
vedic mathematics is incredibly beautiful and uses smart algorithms to do addition subtraction multiplication etc

3083888
put	get
to put an instance into the session you usually use a query to get existing objects or save to persist a new instance

3083909
daemons	systemd
don gave you most of the details above but here s my two cents from doing really nitty-gritty stateful programs like systemd daemons in haskell

3083934
jsr168	jsr286
much of jsr286 was done to address the problems in jsr168 with regards to file uploading and portlet communication

3083934
jsr168	jsr286
i would recommend dropping any jsr168 support in favour of jsr286 if you are able to

3083953
public	protected
they are defined by using one of the keywords public protected or private followed by a normal variable declaration

3084094
hide	show
on the other hand say you have some content that you wish to index but for one reason or another you do not wish to show it i know this is not recommended and is not very nice to the end user anyway but there are valid use cases you can load this content normally and then hide or even replace it using javascript

3084174
hash	salt
when they are registering send them a hash of some of their data with a fixed salt

3084266
tunnel	vpn
the better mouse trap here if not for security concerns is to use vpn so the client can tunnel into the local network

3084286
int	double
int datatypes come without double quotes enums depend on their content so if you inserted 1 and 0 in example delete the quotes around 1 if otherwise keep them

3084339
int	chars
you have a customerid chars and an employeeid int

3084352
width	height
i need to make a grid whose width and height is the same as the screen

3084378
converter	multibinding
you can bind a property to multiple bindings using a multibinding although you will need to use a converter implementing imultivalueconverter in order to use them

3084393
getter	setter
there s much more to the javabeans spec than getter and setter

3084400
width	height
i want to bind the canvas.leftproperty canvas.topproperty width and height of the linearrow to the two usercontrols that this linearrow connects so that those properties change depending on the positions of the two connected usercontrols

3084418
boost	stl
while retrieving the end iterator from a vector is likely a fast implementation with a recent stl library and compiler i have worked on past projects where caching the end iterator gave us a significant speed boost

3084445
folder	directory
i also have a folder called data_somenumberhere in the same directory

3084445
folder	directory
one way to do it is get all folder names in that directory and loop through them and find out

3084505
draggable	droppable
on top of those droppable i have two draggable elements which are also resizable

3084505
width	height
each droppable is 25px in height and 200px in width

3084511
mouse	keyboard
listen to keyboard and mouse events to react on user input

3084520
button	checkbox
when the user hits the submit button the post will contain the values of the checked checkbox

3084556
hide	show
still in my opinion a much more convenient way to perform a similar task would be to create an application consisting of a semitransparent edit box that could be show and hide simply with a hotkey

3084677
spaces	delimiter
as i see it you can just use the existing spaces as delimiter yielding the following expression

3084694
children	parent
if you have a parent with a layout_height fill_parent with a layout_weight 0 and the parent has a sibling with the same setting layout_weight 1 to one of the children does not affect the parent

3084760
integer	unsigned
it turns out that it is a clever way of ensuring that a variable is a unsigned 32-bit integer

3084797
return-value-optimization	nrvo
it s called return-value-optimization there s also one for named comment thanks values nrvo and is explicitly allowed by the standard

3084798
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
in this instance google-chrome opera and safari would return the same thing as .tostring

3084826
mouseover	mouseout
if you really want to use just a textfield you can assign an anchor tag to its htmltext or listen to mouseover and mouseout events and show a custom hand cursor after hiding the default mouse pointer using mouse.hide

3084827
bottle	flask
besides the ones you mentioned there is also bottle which is similar to flask but more minimalistic

3084828
button	checkbox
add a clear button checkbox not recommended or non of the above choice

3084880
profiling	instrumentation
you also should profiling your app in instrumentation to see what else might be taking up significant portions of your time

3084894
put	get
you should be able to put the url you are calling in your browser to get a better idea of what is going on

3084924
try-catch	exception-handling
i can use try-catch blocks here but they will catch exception-handling that occur during the event binding procedure not during the event handling

3084931
try-catch	exception-handling
i can use try-catch blocks here but they will caught exception-handling that occured during the event binding procedure not during the event handling

3084944
google-chrome	safari
the problem i am coming across is that it seems to work perfectly fine in safari and google-chrome but does not seem to want to work in internet explorer 6 or 7

3084961
prepare	execute
they allow the query to be prepare which means that if you have to execute that query multiple times the sql engine will not have to check that the syntax is correct

3084991
avr	microcontroller
it s basically a microcontroller usb interface wrapped in a nice box like an arduino avr + usb-serial converter but closed source with a lot of drivers and functions for various languages including labview

3085030
.htaccess	httpd.conf
3. changed the following line in the httpd.conf file in apache to support .htaccess files

3085068
subtract	add
you might need to add subtract time from the timestamp above

3085078
google-chrome	firefox
for firefox and google-chrome you have the canvas element available although i don t believe 3d contexts are implemented if that matters

3085172
google-chrome	firefox
i ve got the code below that extracts the row number and column number from the id of the cell on mouseover and it works just fine in firefox and google-chrome but does not work in internet explorer

3085200
pentaho	datastage
i have used datastage and pentaho kettle in the past for things like this

3085202
subtract	add
for example for a bank account if you are transferring money from one account to another you will 1st subtract the amount from account and then add it to other or vice versa

3085310
width	height
note a uilabel will have a x y origin position and a height and a width

3085310
uiview	subviews
maybe there is a method to know where are located subviews from a uiview

3085341
notepad++	gedit	kate	gedit
use any ide qtcreator is my personal preference or text editor notepad++ for windows stuff like gedit and kate on linux you want and design you app so that it compiles like this is the asterisk aka wildcard g++ will process every .cpp file

3085462
serializable	deserialization
you have to use serializable deserialization to do what you want

3085485
min	max
i m also surprised that query1 runs at all as i would expect you would be required to have an aggregate function such as min max around the type field

3085518
bash	subshell
this bash script concatenates the names for jar files to a classpath variable cp in the while loop the value is correct but is lost in the subshell as descibed in this related question bash variable scope

3085530
google-chrome	firefox
its working fine on firefox however on google-chrome it display as white box

3088183
post	get
if you need to actually redirect the user to your classic asp page with the values posted you might have more difficulty all of the standard methods of redirecting via asp.net only do get requests but my understanding is that you will need a post request for the values to go into the request.form collection on the classic asp page

3088200
onfocus	onblur
two things the events should be all lower case onfocus onblur and this doesn t point to the object that triggered the event in ie

3088676
getter	setter
otherwise create your own setter and getter or update to a newer version of mootools

3088701
datamapper	activerecord
i then did a little more digging and re-proposed ruby using the jruby interpreter using either activerecord or datamapper for orm which was much better received as rails seems to fit in well with the re-shifting of our development to web-based front-ends that we are attempting to move to with our old cludgy code and of course because the ability to interact with java if the need arises is a great capability

3088731

when i post it back i can easily reconstruct the taglist object by iterating through my tagliststring - but it doesn t get updated

3090461
distance	polygons
z-fighting can be mitigated but you can t really eliminate it completely so eventually you could either apply a texture with the letters you want to the surface or you can try to manually adjust the values of the 2d overlay position trying to increase it s distance from the other polygons progressively by small bits till it is small enough that it looks like if it s there and big enough to make the z values be different after they are truncated eliminating the doubt for the render and consequently eliminating the z-fighting

integer	unsigned
when treated as unsigned it becomes the largest possible integer so the comparison is true

3090535
mousemove	mousedown
a mousedown and mousemove combo also commonly goes by the name drag so here s an example of creating a drag event that you can bind to elements

3090535
mouseout	mousedown	mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseout
one of the advantages to using this is that you only bind the mousemove mouseout and mousedown handlers once each element no matter how many times that element is bound to the drag event

3090587
inherited	subclassing
so if some one makes a huge class of his own with several methods besides the ones he inherited from the interface for some addition functionality and those are of no use to you its better to use a reference to a subclassing in this case the interface and assign the concrete class object to it

width	height
if block means avoid user inputs while something is going on you can just display a div as overlay which has 100 width height

3090723
mouse	keyboard
the whole point of wpf s architecture is that you never will need to toggle a button in the first place conceptually all keyboard and mouse actions in wpf should serve to toggle a bound property in your model or view model

3090764
inotifypropertychanged	icommand
there are still very valid reasons to abandon icommand and inotifypropertychanged in favor of just calling a method on your viewmodel from the code-behind

3090804

3091478
google-chrome	firefox
the script works fine in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie7 8

3091489

3091953
width	height
note a slight error in your code was to re-get the height on each iteration of width

3092016

3092025
width	height
a deckpanel adds height 100 and width 100 to the elements

3092026

3092041
getter	setter
a table api tapi is where there is no access to the underlying tables and there are getter setter to obtain information

3092045
int	double
you re passing a double into something that expects an int

3092045
int	double
i can t be 100 sure because i haven t seen apple s code but i d assume that passing a double to numberwithint will return nil because a double is not an int

3092067
spaces	delimiter
this assumes that the delimiter between values is a spaces

3092067
csv	tsv
you re out of luck with this approach if delimiters change throughout the file - in this case they are not valid csv tsv files anymore

it basically proposes additional http methods in addition to standard get put post like propfind proppatch etc

3092322
vb.net	vb6
it s probably not too important but i should point out that there s a distinct difference between ms access the developer s tool to let you write code build forms and build reports and that of the database engine that access developers vb6 vb.net and in your case java can use to read an access database file

3092385
children	parent
the way flex layouting works is by letting each component lay out its children to a size specified by the parent

3092385

it should calculate how much space width height the component would take if it can has as much space as it wants no limits think scrollbars and put it into the measuredwidth and measuredheight properties

3092385
children	parent
based on this information the component will tell its direct children where they should be relative to their parent and how big they should be - child.move x y and child.setactualsize w h

pop-up	dialog
when the calculation is started in a form this form could pop-up a dialog to ask the user for input

3092475
inherited	subclassing
these pure virtual functions can be implemented using a template since the differences between subclassing aren t large - so my idea was to use multiple inherited to mix-in the appropriately templated helper-class that provides the implementation

3092483
g++	gcc
i m using g++ and gcc in linux

3092499
actionscript	mxml
btw should you plan to create custom components in actionscript instead of mxml you ll face the opposite problem properties are set before you had a chance to actually create your children so you may need to buffer them if they actually should influence some childs properties

3093490
touchesbegan	touchesended
i d like to handle touches horizontal slide in particular in a uiviewcontroller subclass i did but the problem is the controller s view contains a uiscrollview which covers the whole screen so touchesbegan and touchesended events are never called in my controller

3093490
inherited	subclassing
make my uiviewcontroller also inherited from uiscrollview and handle touches as needed and remove the current scroll view or use a uiscrollview subclassing in place of my current scroll view which will call a delegate method for the cases i need

3093490
touchesbegan	touchesended
the goal would be to get newviewcontroller s scrollview to call newviewcontroller s touchesbegan and touchesended methods

3093490
touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesmoved	touchesended
perfectly horizontal slide no scrollbar appears touchesbegan touchesmoved and touchesended are called

3093490
touchesbegan	touchescancelled	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesmoved	touchescancelled
any touch that doesn t cause a scroll touch without moving or horizontal move followed by a slightly vertical slide touchesbegan touchesmoved and touchescancelled are called

3093490
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
dr what seems to be the easiest way to me if you can t use uigesturerecognizer is to subclass uiscrollview set its delaycontenttouches property to false and override touches functions touchesshouldbegin touchesshouldcancel as well as touchesbegan touchesmoved ... according to your needs

3093519
equals	compareto
the usual way to implement compareto or equals is to compare only some values that you store in your type

hide	show
one possibility would be to hide all data columns to show them later you have to memorize them somewhere and show one column for the message

3093803
next	except
this will replace the enter with next for all edittexts except the last one and done for the last one

3093951

3094106
int	chars
it has escape chars before on non printable int values

3094118
division	modulo
the only advantages of unsigned types i can think of are that division and modulo implementations may be slightly faster and you can do tests like rather than

3094158
min	max
firstordefault min max -- use one of these functions to select the appropriate z-index out of the set

3094181
ctime	posix
on posix systems you have the time function to return the number of seconds since a defined date and ctime and related functions to break it down into years months etc

3094820
terminate	timeout
for example if you have only a 2-way ssl connector configured in your tomcat it will start fine with the scripts in tomcat_home bin but if you try to start it with the eclipse server view it won t be able to open a connection to the http port and will terminate when it hits the timeout

3095114
folder	directory
this also assumes a user will never rename your app without also renaming the folder in the templates directory which may not be a safe assumption to make and in that case just hard-code the name of the folder in the templates directory

getter	setter
programming a new property tagsastext to have a getter setter as string

3095170
postgresql	mysql

what you get from gcc is just warnings put there by someone who made a rather clueless decision to interfere with the functionality of the universal zero initializer

3095174
inline	inlining
regarding pragma inline an implementation is free to follow or to ignore the recommendation expressed by the pragma . i d expect the inlining of nested subprograms to be implementation dependent

3095250
hash	md5
my typical approach to ajax login is to send the username and an md5 or sha1 hash password to a method on the server which will then take care of all of the login details

and it seems to show up for a second and then hide

3095409
versioning	upgrade
you can now upgrade to silverlight versioning 3.0 or later versioning and do the following

3095425
super	self
super is self but when used in a message expression it means look for an implementation starting with the superclass s method table.

3095432
stdout	stderr
i don t have an idea as to where you are going wrong but you can redirect stderr and stdout to a file in your crontab entry which might give you a hint

3095436
post	get
reason i ask in spite of my best efforts to heed all of the advice from google and so i still can t get utf-8 characters to post to the server correctly

3095438
metaclass	subclassing
getting subclassing and classes and metaclass may give you some insight on the internals of this

3095452
opera	firefox
the code works as expected in firefox and opera meaning it alerts with the text value of the title node from the xml document

3095480
width	height
it will also need a width and a height and the content div will need to be position relative or absolute

3095481
daemon	cron
the cron daemon tries to start your application but since it doesn t set up the environment variables it will fail

3095523

int	chars
otherwise the string s chars are converted into bytes according to the platform s default chars encoding and these bytes are written in exactly the manner of the write int method

3095564

if all you need is a circle though you could just cheat and create a layer whose corner radius is half the width and height assuming perfect square circle

3095567
touchesbegan	touchesended
to obtain the time value create an starttime instance of nsdate in touchesbegan withevents and in touchesended withevents calculate elapsedtimeinterval using

3095591
jstl	taglib
it has been succeeded by taglib like jstl and expression language el in combination with a servlet as controller

3095618
maven	pom.xml
in addition if you use maven for the java project you can set pom.xml true in the buildconfig.groovy file and create a dependency on the original jar

3095620
min	max
rvalue references continue to evolve so its reference implementation of min and max probably isn t exactly right anymore but it should at least be a pretty decent starting point

3095624
stdout	stderr
establish new open descriptors for stdin stdout and stderr

3095624
stdout	stderr
if you have a logfile for example you might wish to open it as stdout or stderr and open dev null as stdin

stdout	stderr
alternatively you could open dev console as stderr and or stdout and dev null as stdin or any other combination that makes sense for your particular daemon

3095627
nsis	uninstaller
also at uninstaller i do from the nsis script

yet even on the same machine my mac let s say the input has a different height in firefox 3.6 than it does in google-chrome or safari

3095772
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
now my first reaction is ugh i don t want to support firefox. but there are currently more firefox users than safari and google-chrome users combined so that s not an option

3095772
width	height
i m just talking about having the same width height and text placement

3095805
integer	unsigned
in c++ if you have an integer for which negative values make no sense you choose an unsigned integer

3095817

put up this to show and hide on any ajax control

3095838
portrait	landscape
i m having the same problem but only if i open the view in landscape when it was designed in the .xib in portrait

g++	gcc
to get more meaningful information make sure that you ve compiled your program with debug information by including -g on the gcc g++ command line

3095947
int	chars	int	boolean	int	double
at some point i presume this matrix should actually break down to a structured group of int or double or chars or reverse iterators of pointers to boolean or something

3095959
inherited	properties
as gumbo said it doesn t matter where you put it if you don t reset the font and eric meyer s reset inherited font properties so it s ok to declare it also before the reset but if you want to follow some guidelines and write it based on some elementary architecture logic if you set some properties to an object then reset it destruct those properties are supposed to be long gone

3096027
folder	dir
in eclipse file - import - existing project into workspce- select root dir - browse and show the svn checkout folder

3096126
equals	gethashcode
equals and gethashcode would be gone

3096148

google-chrome	firefox
it is working for me just fine in both firefox 3.6.3 and google-chrome 5.0.375.70

3096257
versioning	upgrade
4 upgrade your flash player if that solves it then you can require a higher versioning

3096296
children	parent
adding mptt onto the category model on top of that - via level tree_id left and right fields which will be added automatically by django-mptt - will make it easier to get all parent or children in one go

3096313
post	get
or better yet a way of getting back a collection of the post get values as a list hash a-list

3096317
jar	war

3096340
mdpi	hdpi
there are three sizes ldpi mdpi and hdpi

3096340

my issue is not minimum height but rather max height

3096451
hide	show
i would like my transitions with the show hide plus the masonry rearrange to be smoother overall

3096451
hide	show
additionally i would like a pointer cursor with the show hide but i can t seem to get that to work

3096473
folder	directory
so maybe you could just loop through all the subdirs in the assembly folder and see if any of the sub directory contains the public key

3096473
folder	directory
just remember that any assemblies can be under any of multiple of the direct sub directory to the assembly folder so probably safest to loop through all of them

3096522
children	parent
i have a list of parent objects that contain children

3096522
children	parent
both parent and children have a checked boolean property

3096593

you would need to specify a wildcard matching expression such as this one to select the first character following a sentence delimiter and spaces

3096630
ienumerable	ilist
implements ilist which implements ienumerable

3096630
ienumerable	ilist
ilist provides remove and ienumerable provides the extension method

3096646
range	infinity
i have tried to do it manually and this works to some extent with usual numbers but it fails for very big or very small numbers no range checking and for special cases nan infinity etc.

3096653
ienumerable	iqueryable
no they don t if they re correctly called on the iqueryable rather than the ienumerable they are compiled as expressions and will later be translated to sql

3096653
ienumerable	iqueryable
if the first parameter of the extension method is ienumerable rather than iqueryable you ll run into a database query

3096666
punctuation	words
the select statement includes a reserved words or argument name that is misspelled or missing or the punctuation is incorrect

3096685

you will need to extends zend_view and implements something like a fallback script directory before throwing an exception when trying to load a viewscript

3096728
udp	tcp
ipx is a packet-oriented not stream-oriented unreliable not guaranteed delivery protocol like udp instead of like tcp

3096758
profiling	debugging
from what i can tell visual c++ express doesn t generate a debugging file that is used by profiling programs

3096764
coalesce	isnull
you can probably solve this by identifying which it is and using coalesce or isnull

3096764
coalesce	isnull
coalesce is the standard ansi way isnull gives slightly better performance although the difference is probably insignificant in most cases

3096794
spaces	delimiter
-d use spaces as the delimiter

3096795
children	parent
the filter will use a bool property on the parent class to determine if the parent or its children are checked

3096806
cos	sin
given the unit circle arc 1 0 - cos a sin a where 0 a pi 2 will it result

3096806

in a good approximation of this arc to find the bezier curve s control points p1 p2 by solving the equations imposed by the requirements b 1 3 cos a 3 sin a 3

3096806
cos	sin
and b 2 3 cos 2a 3 sin 2a 3

cos	sin
p0 and p3 of course are the start and end points of the curve 1 0 and cos a sin a

3096818
listadapter	simplecursoradapter
from what i can tell it is pulling in the info but it fails when i try to create the listadapter from the new simplecursoradapter

3096864
ddms	adb
it really helps if you would use adb logcat ddms or the ddms perspective in eclipse to look at the stack trace associated with a crash

3096901
int	double
i realize it s trivial to do this with int just where size is predetermined to be the number of digits in the number but that obviously won t work for floats double because you can t mod one floats

3096925
nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue
the nsurlconnection is already asynchronous so there is no need to add it to an nsoperationqueue

3096951
intersect	contains
you can create two sets s1 and s2 contains all words from first and second paragraph respectively and intersect them s1.retainall s2

3096965
post	get
i just tested it with both http post and get and the referer header was sent by the client google chrome both times

cassini	iis
also at the moment i m just testing this in cassini vs2010 rather than iis but i ll be aiming it at iis 7.x

3097031
google-chrome	firefox
i ended up using firefox or google-chrome instead of internet explorer and that worked fine

3097111
opera	firefox
i m not concerned if it works with ie but needs to work on firefox and webkit and if possible opera

3097136
children	parent
you can put them in a parent container like a table or div and have the two children be at

i would really like to use python since i already have a lot of project related functionality completed using numpy scipy matplotlib but if there is a robust toolbox out there in another language i am open to using that as well

3097465
innodb	myisam
for example a prefix can be up to 1000 bytes long for myisam tables and 767 bytes for innodb tables

3097499
min	max
i can t see how that would be any better than your original solution with min and max though.

3097503
folder	directory
i ve personally seen crystal reports and a html to pdf conversion tool fail under medium trust - fileiopermission is required to the temp folder outside of your applications virtual directory

parsley	cairngorm
in cairngorm they use a servicelocator singleton in an ioc framework eg parsley you can create an object which can get injected into your view

3097769
for-loop	loops
logically one would think that the foreach loops in c# would evaluate in the same order as an incrementing for-loop

3097862
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
that still uses float right to layout the form for firefox google-chrome safari

3097899

3098219
filesystems	fat
flock is not supported on antiquated filesystems like fat and its derivates and will therefore always return false under this sic environments this is especially true for windows 98 users

3098296

it currently supports linux osx windows solaris and freebsd and provides ram cpu battery and file system information

3098301
post	get
if you re updating after every post back and only need a single record you could still use a datareader but set up your sql statement to get a single row storing the appropriate information needed in your sql statement or better yet stored procedure to get that single record back within query strings or session variables

3098322
rss	feed
i want to create an rss feed for my website and while doing research on this i have question that i can t find the answer

a better approach may be to pass a variable via get or post to your page generating the rss and grab the data that pertains to the variable passed

3098611
versioning	upgrade
i just upgrade core-plot to the latest versioning in an application that was already running successful plots

if you re having trouble parsing that is a double-quote protected by single-quotes to keep it from being evaluated until eval gets it is the result of plistbuddy protected by double-quotes and then is another protected double-quote

3099247
google-chrome	firefox
this works in firefox google-chrome but not in internet explorer 7 or ie8

3099306
getter	setter
all the properties attached to your native javascript object will be available as qooxdoo properties which have to be accessed with the commonly used getter and setter

3099321
getter	setter
in ruby post_id is the name of the getter and is the name of the setter

3099324
bonjour	jmdns
besides the bonjour library you may want to try jmdns which is a pure java open sourced module

3099334
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m writing a basic app which involves changing the html in divs referenced by name and it s working fine in google-chrome firefox safari etc

canvas.clearrect x y width height

3099428
debian	linux
i have deployed the webdav server on debian linux and give appropriate permission

3099491
g++	gcc
the alternative to creating symlinks is to explicitly use ccache gcc as the c compiler and ccache g++ as the c++ compiler

3099502
crossover	mutation
to apply genetic algorithms it is essential that you define the mutation and crossover operators such that a single application of mutation or crossover results in a small change in the overall performance while a many applications of mutation and crossover results in a large change in the overall performance of your algorithm

3099509
hide	show
effectively hide the uitabbar so camera button show up on bottom

3099608
satellite	altitude
however i faced numerous difficulties a major one is how to convert two line elements tle information to longitude latitude and altitude to display the satellite and satellite path on the map

3099619
inherited	properties
one way may be to create a class that inherited textbox and in that class create your own dependency properties that delegates to stringformat when set

3099619
inherited	properties
so instead of using textbox in your xaml you will use the inherited textbox and set your own dependency properties in the binding

3099637
inherited	properties
it may be important to use the hasownproperty method to determine whether the object has the specified properties as a direct properties and not inherited from the object s prototype chain

3099659
comparator	icomparer
you would need to implement an icomparer as opposed to creating a class that implements comparator

3099659
comparator	icomparer
the difference is that an icomparer has the necessary knowledge to compare two objects whereas comparator is implemented by a class that knows how to compare itself against something else

3099660
integer	unsigned
you want a type that is an unsigned integer that is exactly 64 bits wide

3099669
integer	unsigned
in most cases i know of though unsigned long is an unsigned 32 bit type while uint64 which is an implementation type not even mentioned in the standard is a 64 bit unsigned integer in vs

3099676
crossover	mutation
the best improvement in solving the multiknapsack via the use of genetic algorithms would be to improve your encoding of the mutation and crossover operators which can make orders of magnitude of difference in the resulting performance and blow out of the water any tweaks to the fundamental genetic algorithm

3099676
crossover	mutation
there is a lot you can do to make your mutation and crossover operators tailored to multiknapsack

3099676
crossover	mutation
it is highly likely that an efficient search space encoding or an accurate heuristic evaluation function of the multiknapsack problem can translate into highly effective mutation and crossover operators

3099691
stdout	stderr
if this is a linux system you could append to your command in order to redirect stderr to stdout

3099751
jar	manifest.mf
i you have a main class in that jar that you want to run the best approach is to put a meta-inf manifest.mf file in the jar and launch your class using java -jar mypackage.jar

3099821
serializable	deserialization	stateless	stateful
you should use stateless whenever possible they are faster and consume less memory because they don t require serializable and deserialization and stateful only when needed

3099821
stateless	stateful
so it s perfectly ok to have 8 stateless and 2 stateful beans

3099823
stateless	stateful
you question is quite vague but it seems like you basically ask for advice whether it s good to use either stateless or stateful session beans

3099907
jrails	ujs
i wouldn t recommend using jrails at this point because it s fairly outdated and as the episode mentions it kind of defeats the purpose of switching to jquery as the rails 2 helpers generate ujs

3099909
barbecue	zxing
i think barbecue is an open-source easy java library so it is best.also zxing pronounced â œzebra crossingâ is an open-source multi-format 1d 2d barcode image processing library implemented in java.see this link

3099965
width	height
width 100 exists but not height

3099973
post	get
probably also interesting for you to read variables from external sources which describes how to deal with data sent via post or get or cookies

3099978
post	get
then in your php using the following code by using request you can get the data from either get or post parameters

3099983
equals	gethashcode
which isn t dependent on the gethashcode equals implementations it looks at the reference itself

3100000
keydown	keyup
when the alt key is down letters come in as three pairs of events keydown keyup and textinput each with their associated preview versions

3100000
keydown	keyup
the keydown and keyup events have their key property set to key.system rather than the actual key that was pressed and the systemkey set to the actual key pressed

3100057
ienumerable	icollection
you need to check icollection ienumerable and icloneable interfaces

3100066
put	get
if there is more than one way to get to a page you should pick a main url for each page that contains the actual content and put those urls in the site map

3100362
getter	setter
2 - have two sets of getter and setter a pair for string and a pair for date

3100412
cpu	processors
even a cpu bound task might run faster multi-threaded if properly designed to take advantage of cache memory and pipelineing done by the processors

3100429
inline	inlining
i know the compiler does not have to inline anything if it doesn t want to so i assumed it placed f in the object file instead of inlining it in case of both main.c and file.c thus multiple definition error

3100429
inline	inlining
it seems like gcc assumed f would be inline so it didn t add it to the object file but later because there was no -o2 it decided to generate calls to these functions instead of inlining and that s where the linker error came from

3100447
versioning	upgrade
since upgrade xcode to versioning 3.2.3 with iphone sdk 4 my code doesn t work anymore

3100452
servicecontract	servicebehavior
in case of wcf it wants to say that although it is allowed to mark classes with servicecontract attribute better to have it on separate interface and implement that interface in concrete class marked with servicebehavior attribute

3100466
versioning	upgrade
however since our last upgrade a few weeks ago to the latest versioning 1.5.0.6237 our build reports are failing to display on the ccnet website

3100466
versioning	upgrade
as you can see there is a publisher and the config file hasn t changed since we upgrade to the latest cruisecontrol versioning

3100541
hide	show
i have implemented the popover view to the barbuttonitem it works and show the popover but the arrow which is permittedarrowdirections uipopoverarrowdirectiondown - in this the arrow will show in the down direction.but it hide the bottom bar can any one help me to over come this problem of hiding the barbutton

3101010
udp	tcp
it never passes tcp or udp packets to raw

3101011
width	height

3101053
folder	directory
also try running the script using an administrator account or changing the permissions of the generator folder to allow the user running the script to write to the directory if you still have problems

3101063
sqlcommandbuilder	sqldataadapter
in practice i d change your class to instead not have the sqlconnection or sqldataadapter or sqlcommandbuilder as a member on the class if you must then you should implement the idisposable pattern but instead create new instances wrapped in using statements on the class methods that need to use them

3101111
folder	directory
now folder src contains some other folder with javascript code that is minified during build process and placed in lib directory

3101150

maven	pom.xml
you can use the maven build helper plugin and its build-helper add-source goal to add more source directories to the pom.xml

3101269
uiview	subviews
the structure of my implementation looks like this i have a subclass of uiscrollview with a uiview added as subviews

3101292
width	height
however what i would do is make the a tag display as block and set the width and height to fill the li that way you can use a hover and change the whole bg which makes it look like the li is changing

3101314
pop-up	dialog
take a look at the jquery ui dialog it comes in many flavours and you can put whatever you want in it if you absolutely have to you can even use it as an iframe pop-up

3101314
pop-up	dialog
the dialog works by showing and hiding a div which is positioned on top over all other elements there is little chance a pop-up blocker will cause any problems but it does require javascript to be turned on

3101324
alarmmanager	timertask
and if every x time means you have a busy loop or are using timertask or something please consider whether alarmmanager is possibly a better solution

3101341

temp sqr cos radians - sqr sin radians

3101407
cos	sin
height newheight cos radians - newwidth sin radians temp

3101407
cos	sin
width newwidth cos radians - newheight sin radians temp

3101407
cos	sin
i m sure it involves sin cos or both somewhere but brain freeze prevents me from building the formula

3101407
width	height
eta in this case i increase the width but i need a general solution for the width height or both changing

3101407
width	height
i change the width and or height of the bounds

3101434
int	boolean
a boolean expression always returns an int value 0 or 1 in mysql so you can use sum to count up the 1 s

3101666
dateadd	datepart
you can also do it in a more convoluted but probably slightly faster way using dateadd datepart

3101698
firefox	safari
all of the internal web pages at the place i work were designed and built specifically for ie 6 but now they want me to research what it would take to move to firefox and safari and other major browsers.

3101700
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout with a delay of 0ms would achieve that effect although a looping settimeout or setinterval would cause another infinite loop to be created so at least some delay is necessary as i pointed out above

3101704
hide	show
well on slow browsers the show hide method might cause the box to flicker though the computer have to be really slow

3101743
cpu	processors
i understand that a scatted read for a classical cpu can be quite slow as each access will cause a cache miss and thus a processors wait

3101777
stdout	stderr
the problem is that after mounting a filesystem i have no access to stdin stdout stderr from my fuse script

3101834
folder	directory
go to the folder properties in iis manager - directory security tab - authentication and access control

int	chars
a code point is one unicode chars symbol represented as an int

3101849
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if you are using a relatively recent version of firefox google-chrome or safari you can use a new feature called workers to run your loop

3101940
nant	cruisecontrol
we use nant and cruisecontrol but the available options are as plentiful as opinions

3101957
postgresql	mysql
rather use a db-managed autogenerated pk mysql bigint unsigned auto_increment oracle postgresql serial sqlserver identity and give the email field an unique key

3101995
for-loop	loops
thanks folks for the help but i cannot introduce new function neither i can replace the while loops with for-loop i would be very thankfull if you can help me in re-editing the given while loop.

pop-up	dialog
however the call to msiopenproduct pop-up the windows installer is preparing the installation... dialog

3102119
post	get
please post a link when you get done

3102141
ncover	nant
nunit 2.5.5 is now out and this supports projects build using .net framework v4.0 but you have to use an additional parameter namely framework 4.0.30319 which looks something like this when used in nant through ncover

3102141
ncover	nant
my nant script calls out to ncover 1.5.8 and that calls nunit 2.5.5 which tests my unit test assembly .dll that was built using .net 4.0

why don t you use c_uint for the enum parameter and then use a mapping like this enums are usually unsigned integer values

3102301
google-chrome	firefox
using base64 encoding # it works pretty well with firefox google-chrome but not in ie7

3102331
qabstractitemmodel	qabstracttablemodel
firstly i think you should try inheriting qabstracttablemodel instead of qabstractitemmodel

3102403
svg	vml
you could use something like raphaã l to abstract the vml or svg into a single js script but that would add a dependency on javascript

3102498
pop-up	dialog
but when i debug in mono i see the mono console window pop-up stay there without displaying any messages for a while and then i get an error dialog saying failed to start xsp

3102504
rpm	yum
you probably don t want the typical rpm package breaking all of the automated software updating tools like yum up2date etc

3102510
getter	setter
and then testcase class exposes this in the usual way with a getter setter #history and #history

3102548
pygtk	pygobject
if you want timed updates look at the functions timeout_add and timeout_add_seconds - depending on your version of pygtk pygobject these will be in the glib or gobject modules

3102608
calloc	malloc
use calloc which initializes memory to zero rather than malloc which doesn t

3102619

this is how it looks if you start in landscape and then change orientation to portrait

3102619
portrait	landscape
and then if you start in portrait and switch to landscape

3102635
width	height
i need to define canvas width and height in centimeters so basically i have such code snippet

3102635
width	height
according to microsoft it is possible to use qualifieddoubles with width height property

3102666
int	boolean	int	double
i am writing an interpreter and tried to use solution from how-to-set-up-implicit-conversion-to-allow-arithmetic-between-numeric-types for the same problem i need to be able to add boolean + boolean int + boolean boolean + int int + double double + double etc

3102679
stdout	stderr
by default the android system sends stdout and stderr system.out and system.err output to dev null

3102679
stdout	stderr
in this case the system writes the messages to the log using the log tags stdout and stderr both with priority i

3102703
post	get
our servers are down but when i get a chance i ll post a link to this code if anyone wants to play with it

3102724
put	get
i also put this in an animation to get the page curl

3102743
division	multiplication
that means you can use long long int for scratch variables when doing long multiplication long division etc

3102755
wordpress	joomla
moodle can integrate well with google sites apps joomla drupal and wordpress sso web services...

3102776
children	parent
that is you can t have a pk or fk on the parent table and have it automatically apply to all the children as well

3102884
int	double
for instance if you need to be able to have a list of vertex objects with different types double int etc. and access them polymorphically

3102902
getschematable	executereader
edit 2 found out why it didn t work - you can use getschematable to get table information but you have to set commandbehavior to keyinfo you do that in the executereader call

3102981
innodb	myisam
we change mysql internal db engine for the table mdl_user from myisam to innodb after we reached 12000 users now we have 16000 it gave a huge positive performance impact on mdl_user related queries

3103007
unsigned	short
i have a which is a string representation of the short i want such as 15 and need to output this as unsigned short unitid to a binary file

3103035
int	chars
that cast will give you a truncated int version of the pointer assuming temp is also a chars

3103035
unsigned	short
take a look at the function atoi it may be what you need unitid unsigned short atoi temp

3103035
unsigned	short
note that this assumes that a temp is pointing to a string of digits and b the digits represent a number that can fit into an unsigned short

3103049
unsigned	short
if you cast a to an unsigned short you ll be taking the value of the pointer which has nothing to do with the contents chopping off everything that doesn t fit into a short and then throwing away the rest

3103130
move	drag	pop-up	dialog
common application modes include drag and drop operations move size operations anytime a dialog pop-up that needs input before the application can continue

packets	multicast
i was surprised to learn that android supports multicast packets

3103159
folder	directory
i would like to set a directory in my home folder

3103195
unsigned	short
it s also somewhat strange what you are doing -- 2209032000 is the number of seconds in 70 years and the result of multiplying a short by 2e32 will overflow the size of unsigned int

3103231
post	get
you need to use post redirect get prg pattern

3103235
post	get
i noticed from your original post that you are using the datepicker plugin for jquery to get the date in the first place

3103259
public	protected
also what you don t have in smalltalk is access modifier private protected public

i have read that when you override equals on an class object you need to override gethashcode

3103309
kerberos	ntlm
if you really want to have windows authentication your client requires ntlm or kerberos authentication support

3103323
bmp	png	tiff	png	tiff	bmp
bmp png or tiff formats accept binary images as input arrays

3103323
tiff	png
for png images you can use png library and for tiff i can t remember but you can search or choose the other options

3103326
equals	gethashcode
in your case you should override equals and gethashcode like this

3103333
hide	show
i m passing an array to a function i want to be able to show or hide columns in a table depending on what s passed

3103333
hide	show
i can handle the show hide bit

3103336
equals	gethashcode
your gethashcode and equals methods should look like this

3103336
equals	gethashcode
the rule is that gethashcode must use exactly the fields used in determining equality for the equals method

3103366
hide	show
which basically show and hide a div with a class of leftcolumn

3103378
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested the following in ie6 7 8 google-chrome and firefox

3103381
vbscript	jscript
asp pages are usually written in vbscript but can be written in any language supported by the windows scripting host - jscript and vbscript are supported natively with third-party libraries offering support for perlscript and other dynamic languages

it s as if the queue is not processed as fifo fifo but first in last out filo

3103581
range	max
average range of results number is 0-400 but i always want max 20 results

3103592
int	chars
under the really rare circumstances that you need to do this dealing with a foreign floating point format such as data in vax g-format being manipulated on a pc you normally do it by putting the floating point data into an int of the same size or else into an array of chars again of the right size

3103599
internationalization	translation
this allows for a strongly typed key but it also allows for easy internationalization of your application as you can get the resource file translation to a new language and it will be automatically applied for users of that culture

3103660
post	put
instead of letting the observer post window messages to its subscribers i let the observer put data into synchronized subscriber buffers

3103683

getter	setter
in the case of c# properties are implemented via separate getter and setter methods which can be declared virtual and override

3104191
children	parent
qname syntax like this would work if your children had a non-empty namespace artist for instance but unfortunately it looks like the current source code treats an empty namespace as no namespace so all of objectify s lookup goodness will helpfully replace the empty namespace with the parent namespace and you re out of luck

3106658
children	parent
but the children retain their independence though they can be found from the parent

3106658
children	parent
what i mean is that if the children have attributes keys values and or text those constructs cannot be directly accessed from the parent instead you have to determine identify the children and from the children access the data or metadata that is needed

3106658
children	parent
because there were only 664 items in my tree_list i made the very bad assumption that all of the elements within a parent were subsumed in the parent so i kept trying to access the entity period and instant by referencing just those elements not their children

if i declare a readonly properties in the class rather than the protocol overriding a readwrite properties i get the message warning attribute readonly of properties longitude restricts attribute readwrite of properties inherited from _ipevent

this enabled me to work around the problem by creating a separate appdomain set up to use only ssl3 making my data collection object marshalbyrefobject both webclient and webrequest are marshal-by-ref but better to reduce the number of cross-appdomain calls and creating it there

3107755
client-side	server-side
the best way most reliable and clean to accomplish this is to use a server-side script which does the work and a client-side ajax script which will poll another server-side script which will return the status

fflush	gets
not sure but it sounds like you are not flushing the output to a socket it probably gets fflush by force when it closes when the application closes

3108126
inherited	properties
at best at this point i can say is inherited is useful when the derived class has some fairly unique properties - like encyclopedie has properties explaining which type of encyclopedie it actually is and those properties do not in any way belong to a novel

3108166
put	get
and i don t seem to get why it would put new columns last even if the table is a new one and i have deleted every previous one from that location

3108331
integer	unsigned
i have been wondering why there are no unsigned integer types in java

width	height
set the width and height of that via css and then set width and height of the object element to 100 so it follows the parent wrapper

3108501
inline	inlining
the reason i prefer this is that there are times when even the best optimizing compilers cannot inline code if you put it in the cpp file like if the math class was being exported no inlining across dll boundaries

3108501
inline	inlining
the second reason i prefer this explicit style over inlining directly in the class definition is because i work with a lot of lazy coders who often inline things just because it saves time to write instead of actually inlining after a profiling session which is generally the only time you should consider inlining unless you are a superb compiler assembly genius

memcpy	realloc	memcpy	malloc	realloc	malloc	free	memcpy	free	realloc	free	malloc
a realloc can occur significantly faster than a malloc memcpy and free

3108761

a class like std vector could certainly use it even if the default implementation is to malloc the newly sized block and free the old one

3108788
hide	show

goto	break
you can break or goto in c# but what you cannot do is not state which you want because that s a potential source of hard-to-spot bugs

3108980

maven-antrun-plugin	pom.xml
my thoughts were to add maven-antrun-plugin to the reporting section of the pom.xml but i cannot have an node under plugin in the reporting section

3111641
ordinals	difference
the difference between and is that the former is implemented by a class to say i can compare myself with another instance of the same type. it doesn t have to be the same type but it usually is. this is appropriate if there s a natural comparison - for example the comparison chosen by string is ordinals equality - it s got to be exactly the same sequence of char values

however there is a warning emitted by the compiler whenever you compare a signed integer with an unsigned one.

3112031
put	get

width	height
to load the image the image needs to have a height width on the page

3112044
width	height
i think most people commonly insert the image into dom setting a height width making sure display is block

3112081
backgrounding	multitasking
if you need to get back onto wifi after doing the initial data transfer you could make some clever use of the ios 4 multitasking and local-notification apis when your application enters the backgrounding it could start a background-task handler using -beginbackgroundtaskwithexpirationhandler in your app delegate s -applicationdidenterbackground to wait for the wifi connection to become unavailable do its thing with the cell network then create a uilocalnotification to tell the user it s okay to turn wifi back on again

3112689
abc	isinstance
unfortunately there is no abstract class in 2.6 s standard library to summarize the concept of this number is integral but you can make one such abc by checking whether the class has a special method __index__ don t use __int__ which is also supplied by such definitely non-integral classes as float and str -- __index__ was introduced specifically to assert instances of this class can be made into integers with no loss of important information and use isinstance on that interface abstract base class rather than the specific implementation int which is way too restrictive

3112689
abc	isinstance
you could also make an abc summarizing the concept of having m h and s attributes might be useful to accept attribute synonyms so as to tolerate a datetime.time or maybe timedelta instance for example -- not sure whether you re representing an instant or a lapse of time with your mytime class the name suggests the former but the existence of addition suggests the latter again to avoid the very restrictive implications of isinstance with a concrete implementation cass

free	realloc
otherwise if the argument does not match a pointer earlier returned by a memory management function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to free or realloc the behavior is undefined

3117638
free	malloc
short of keeping a record of all malloc and free calls to ensure you don t double-free a block i can t see this as being workable

3117638
free	malloc
no i think the current malloc and free are just fine provided you use them properly

3117646
free	malloc
as you note malloc and free usually do some form of bookkeeping often in the few bytes preceding the allocation

3117646
free	malloc
the heap the code for malloc an free management has at this point already lost track of and or overwritten the bookkeeping data because the memory has gone back to the heap

3118052
children	parent
you could then query this table by a single parent and get all of its implied children descendants

3118054
viewmodel	caliburn
i solved a similar scenario leveraging the viewmodel lifecycle i created an isessionaware interface with a setsession method to be implemented by repositories then i initialized the repositories through isessionaware in the oninitialize method of the viewmodel which is enforced by caliburn when the viewmodel is managed by a screenconductor

3118066
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene

this example uses the get method but this is only because google doesn t accept post - but the principple should get you working and then you can change to a post assuming that a post is appropriate in your case

3118356
goto	break
it seemed like the perfect place for a goto statement because a single break would only exit the switch statement especially considering that i was designing for assembly but java has no gotos

3118369
put	get
obviously get and put are not only options you can add many other api calls to the io data type like operating on files or concurrency

it takes four distinct queries joined with a union using the table structure you describe

3118754
accessor	properties
then i want to serialize these data types to xml to send them over the wire for example from an asp.net application to javascript but the serialization framework only serializes public properties with both get and set accessor

3118754
accessor	properties
it s easier to just use the underlying properties for that but since the language and api require me to have a set accessor i ll throw a notimplementedexception i wasn t aware of notsupportedexception until i read this thread but either one works so that if some programmer down the road does try to set fullname he ll encounter the exception during testing and realize his mistake

or you can add eventhandlers for the mouseenter and mouseleave and change the cursor

3118930
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
don t store plaintext passwords store a hash instead like md5 sha-1 etc and at that point there s no harm in generating a salt for each password a random string that you append to the user s password before hashing it and store that salt with the password hash because you ll need it later--this prevents dictionary hash attacks ie rainbow tables

3118931
children	parent
how you have it modeled now you have to use recursion to get from children notes to parent or from parent down through children

3118979
post	get
then when a page with one or more post is viewed search through all the post to find all the sequences query the database to get all of the images locations and then output the post with the sequences replaced with the appropriate anchor tags

3119020

the 4th item is especially important because even on linux kde and xcf users will install gnome-related libs but it isn t nice to force them to use the gnome libraries when a platform independent option is available

3119030
vb6	vba
however if you have freedom in how you style your code you might choose the reddick vba naming convention vba is the same codebase as vb6

3119030
vb6	vba
granted a lot of its style will feel obsolete in the .net environment but it does seem to be heavily used a lot in vb6 and vba examples

post	get
i am also using jquery to get query string parameters and add them to the data i post to the url

3119454
hide	show
as an alternative to the accepted answer there s rarely a reason to this .is checked in an if statement you can use the dom .checked property directly and .toggle bool instead of show hide like this

3119474
comparator	icomparer
create a comparator for your custom type which implements the icomparer interface

3119490
distance	altitude
one cause of bad distance is if one end of your pair has an altitude and the other does not the not gets classed as zero - so if you are 200m above the sea level at the time you have just travelled 200m without moving

3119578
solaris	aix
it builds fine on linux solaris x86 and windows but this is the first time we ve tried to build on aix

3119649
put	get
i achieved this by setting the uiwebview subviews to not clip to bounds then i could put a toolbar on top of it and get the desired effect

3119654
int	chars
you might consider a function such as the following which counts the number of whitespace chars in the given string giving a positive int is any are found true zero if none are found false and -1 on error

3119697
int	chars	int	double
i have a vm and a model and i want to ensure a user does not enter alpha chars s into multiple textbox s bound to double or int

3119737
cpu	affinity
we are not setting the cpu affinity here i suspect that might help but ideally i would like all the cpu hw threads to handle the network traffic

3119744
rss	feed
google will accept an rss feed as a site map if that s all you have but points out that these usually only contain the most recent links - the value in having a sitemap is that it should cover everything on the site not just the latest items which are probably the most discoverable

3119813
cassini	iis
i noticed that if i use the filename property in iis it gives me a path + filename however if i run in cassini it only gives me the filename no matter what directory i use

3119862
put	get
finally a general tip with these kinds of ui objects and weird xaml object graphs once you ve got the basics working best to put it in a resourcedictionary and use something like resources name as storyboard to get it back later

3119902
chown	chmod
for example php has chmod and chown which could be used to simply deactivate a website

3119908
ssl	https
if you have a connector listening on port 443 it should have ssl enabled because that is the https port and browsers will send an ssl clienthello message as soon as they connect mdash

move	drag
if one were to then drag one s finger down the selection of the row cancels and the table view begins to move with the drag

3120114
move	drag
tap down on the first row drag onto the second and you ll see the selection move across rows while the table itself remains static

3120126
vsto	add-in
i have a form which spawns from an excel add-in written with vsto

3120177
int	chars	int	double
so since your textbox input doesn t convert well to int double with alpha chars an exception is thrown and will be continually thrown until you correct the value of the dependency property here the textbox s text property - the property setter of the underlying dataobject is never reached now

3120195
hash	salt
you generally don t want to store the password at all -- you store a hash of the salt password

3120275
hash	salt
1a don t store the user s password only a salt hash of it

3120280
width	height
i think it s a project-specific decision what to allow but i would generally tolerate and in some cases encourage business terms entity names in the local language but not technical terms not largeur hauteur instead of width height

3120290
postgresql	mysql
it supports mysql postgresql microsoft sql server h2 derby hsqldb and sqlite and can be easily extended to others

3120293
google-chrome	firefox
i was able to use jquery to load the external xml file parse it and build some html dynamically on page load without any problems in firefox and google-chrome

every instance of the class can look inside that dictionary to find metainformation about each dependencyproperty - the properties s name its type any callbacks that have to be called when it s get and set how it participates in properties inherited and so on

3120477
getter	setter
the setvalue and getvalue methods that you implement in the setter and getter of the clr property are basically lazy evaluation on steroids

3120477
accessor	properties
in python all class properties - all objects in fact - are stored in dictionaries and so you can get to their value either through properties accessor or just by looking them up

3120495

i need a concurrent fifo queue that contains only unique values

3120509
gesturedetector	motionevent
the gesturedetector analyzes a motionevent and invokes the appropriate callback on the listener based on the type of movement it found

3120511
int	chars
i have a dictionary of int to chars decimal ascii chars associated with that int

3120533
int	double
if you can t change the type then it may become necessary to store the field as it s result in a double say and then cast to unsigned int before use

3120552
min	max
take a look at max or min to get the highest or lowest value in a group or possibly just order by and a limit clause

3120663
dictionary	map
in my code i will loop through an array if strings and use the dictionary to look up which column it should map to

3120680

3120684
google-chrome	firefox
i am having trouble getting the following code to work in firefox 3.6.4 however it works perfect in google-chrome 5.0.375.70 and ie 8.0.7600.16385

3120684
pop-up	dialog
as a matter of fact it not only does not work in firefox but it pop-up the dialog box then you must end the firefox process in order to continue working

3120739
width	height
i know with a jpeg or whatever i could have it stored as a 50 by 50 icon then actually display it as a rather pixelated 100 by 100 thumbnail or 10 by 10 by manually setting the height and width in the image_src tag

3120739
width	height
however svg files seem to be used with object embed tags and changing the height or width of those just results in more space being allocated for the picture

3120785
width	height
erase width and height attributes

3120838
put	get	post	put	post	get
from digging around and seeing what the get post put and delete actions actually do in actiondispatch i think all you need to do is match

3120842
qstring	qfiledialog
basically i just used qfiledialog to select my file i wanted to open and created a qstring which was the entire command line i needed to use to get my application to run properly which i opened via qprocess

if it s an arbitrary function that returns a number there are only 4 standard types of numbers in python small int c long at least 32 bits long int unlimited precision floats c double and complex numbers

3120943
maven	pom.xml
the best way to start creating a web project in idea is to use either a maven project any project with valid pom.xml and by your folder structure i guess thats what you are trying to do or create a project and add a web module a module with web facet

3120949
folder	directory
since at least in windows you can t have both a file and a directory with the same name it seems like there should be a function that accepts a string and returns either folder file or nothing

3120956
apache	lighttpd
i m considering moving from apache to lighttpd for an internal web application written with python

3121001
put	get

it seems fine and resets the values in safari and firefox just not in google-chrome mac osx

3121045
junit	testng	junit	jbehave	testng	jbehave
the reason is that i am seeing consistent difference in behavior when trying to run a testng test that extends a junit test base this is a workaround to run jbehave tests in testng described here

3121064

3121332
strcpy	strncpy
i don t want to be a c-police but please use safer strncpy instead of strcpy

getter	setter
in your example value # examplebean.date examplebean is your bean which you should have configured in your faces-config and date is the attribute for which you will have a corresponding setter and getter - accessing the java class properties at run time is the biggest advantage of expression language

first try moving the positioning statements referring to x and y above the width and height statements

3121829
width	height
if it doesn t try referring to the stage s width and height when assigning instead of the container movieclip s

3121834
put	get
you can also code up your code so the routine that does the real work is called with stream handles or some other mechanism to get and put the data and have a test build feed the data through files that it opens instead of stdin and stdout

3121930
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the link tags show up across all browsers but the script tags only show up in safari and google-chrome they do no show up in firefox or ie

3121947

3122135
maven	m2e
i installed eclipse helios with the m2e maven plugin

3122143
subobject	instances
note that if reinterpret_cast had been used instead both assignments would be overwritting the abc subobject of the abcdef instances

3122158
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
edit latest versions of google-chrome safari firefox and opera already support this

3122202
hash	md5
if you are generating a url that the client will then send just add an expiration timestamp and do an md5 hash signature on the entire url adding the result as a final query paramter

3122215
mouse	keyboard
successively the monitor shall detect mouse and keyboard events always system-wide and also it has to emulate mouse and keyboard events

3122260
onfocus	onblur
notice the onfocus and onblur events on the input boxes

3122260
onfocus	onblur
if you re open to using the jquery library you can easily get away from the onfocus and onblur events inside the input tags by just adding and removing the focus class

3122267
backgrounding	multitasking
when ios 4.0 multitasking puts my app into the backgrounding i save the data but don t close the database

3122287
put	get
put an exit at the end of your script append the file to the end of the script and use tail -c 80 to get at the contents

3122324
mouseover	mouseleave
another way to do it would be to take the variable out of the mouseover so that it can be shared with the mouseleave

3122414
x86	mips
in x86 instructions must be preceeded by a lock prefix in mips the rmw cycle must be surrounded by an ll sc construct .

3122432
junit	testng
junit testng i think nunit and xunit

3122438
junit	testng
unit testing framework junit testng

3122440

3122548
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it appears that most major browsers - google-chrome safari firefox and opera enumerate object properties in insertion order

3122555
post	get
while you can scrape html and send post requests it can get quite messy fast

3122555
post	put
if you look at the site there is a how to use it page with sending data with post or put requests

3122587
vpn	lan
so something changed not sure what but i can now ping back and forth when the push line is uncommented but i still can t get out local lan that the vpn server is connected to

3122595
put	get	udp	tcp
you should get rid of the udp heartbeat attempt and put in a real tcp heartbeat

3122609
int	boolean
c originally didn t have a bool type until the 1999 standard so it used int to represent boolean values

3122610
google-chrome	firefox
other browsers i verified google-chrome 5 and firefox 3 place the reassigned property at the end of the iteration order

3122621
width	height
next write a function w y s which is to calculate recursively the number of walls of width x height y and top row s

3122627
pascal	delphi
there already is a 64-bit delphi object pascal

3122641
webrat	cucumber
try cucumber + webrat + selenium

3122643
onresume	onpause
then in the onresume onpause i handle registering and unregistering the receiver

3122668
packets	multicast
so this means you need to explicitly send a multicast packets on every up interface that supports multicast or provide the user with a means of specifying a particular interface

3122698
tabs	tabpanel
and add tabs via a wrapper on tabpanel

3122752
bash	zsh
if the directory name you try to cd to isn t in the current directory the other entries in your cd path will also be looked at and it s also tab complete aware at least in bash and zsh

3122752
bash	zsh
switching to zsh rather than bash and using the excellent directory stacks abilities

3122820
put	get
do not use regex - get a proper parser where you can put in a syntax file

3122857
pop-up	dialog
you can pop-up the dialog with an image and any other text that you might want

3122894
stdout	stderr
i do it like that so that stderr from gcc is fed to stdout and i my perl script processes stdout

3122963
stdout	stderr
the monitorhandle delegate works like redirection except you have the option of using a separate filter for each of stdout and stderr

3122988
width	height
you could generate the tag which embeds the swf file via javascript and print the width and height programmatically based on the size of the containing window

3122988
width	height
the method for retrieving the window width height will probably vary per browser but i m sure you can find a reliable cross-browser way to do it somewhere online

3122988
width	height
if you need to dynamically resize whenever the window is resized then you can attach a handler to the window.onresize event which retrieves the necessary object and embed dom elements and change their width and height properties

3123051
ldf	dbcc
you can shrink the tempdb mdf ldf files using the shrinkfile shrinkdatabase dbcc commands

3123069
vsto	add-in
the only ways around this are to create an add-in vsto vba etc. to sink the document_open event on client machines and run some code to update all fields or create an interop app on the server that opens the doc renders it with some code and then saves it back before sending it on further

3123074
prepare	execute
you now need to create a prepare statement from that string and execute the result

3123091
width	height
but what i read was that you could set the main application to be 100 for bott height and width

3123094
filesystems	ntfs
though the php documentation only looks about ntfs filesystems

3123124
hide	show
when passing over div1 you show div2 and hide it only after the user get inside it and then exit

3123171
button	checkbox
another reason i would recommend forms to you is that the downloadable code has an error in the checkbox code and doesnt have radio button code there are very simple fixes in the comments on the page i listed but it would be a good challenge for yourself to try and fix the error and add a radio button class

3123184
hide	show
i m using jquery toggle to show hide a div on different links

3123184
hide	show
it show hide them fine however if you click on one of the other links before closing the first link toggle the first div is still show

3123196
minimum	max	min	max
in this equation the min and max are the minimum intensity value and the minimum intensity value in the current image

3123242
hash	salt
hash and possibly salt your passwords before storing them in your database if you ll have user accounts

3123256
vxworks	rtos
you can also choose to use rtos like vxworks or embedded linux that do a whole lot more but are either expensive or huge or both

3123263
ready	each
the html string you re using is cached as a document fragment re-used for future insertions so the second will have that entire string styles and all ready to clone immediately rather than setting styles each time so in a loop it s much faster

3123263
google-chrome	firefox
here s a quick test demo that works in google-chrome or firefox firebug just open your console to see the results the page will lag while it opens...running the tests

3123273
stateless	stateful
using sessions in php is not really a means to encrypt potentially sensitive information like credit cards but to allow programmers to have a way to have stateful information in a stateless protocol http

3123293
min	max
first pass find the max and min level of the image

3123293
min	max
second pass use the max and min values to do the contrast stretching

3123294
put	get
then if possible deal with the chunk you ve receieved and go back and get the next chunk or if it s not possible to process in chunks politely put out an error message and stop

3123334
firefox	safari
my osx.6 firefox safari show only two weights

3123387
datediff	difference
if you are just interested in some part of the difference between the two dates then you should use datediff instead.

3123389
accessor	ivar	accessor	properties
a properties declaration simply creates accessor methods for an ivar

3123389
accessor	properties
so properties don t really have names only the accessor methods do

3123389
getter	setter
you can change the names of the methods using the getter and setter decorators like this

3123389
accessor	ivar	accessor	properties
now as i said a properties declaration simply creates accessor methods for an ivar

3123389
accessor	properties
so you use properties when you want accessor methods

3123394
division	modulo
you should be consistent if the intent of the operations is arithmetical use modulo and division if it s just for raw bit manipulation use shift and mask

3123402
accessor	ivar
such a correspondence is expected if you re going to synthesize the accessor methods but there are quite legitimate reasons for creating the methods manually and making them do something other than just getting setting a matching ivar

3123402
accessor	properties
for simple synthesized properties it is common to use the accessor either explicitly using or using the dot notation as self.xxx except within dealloc and possibly init depending on who you ask

3123402
accessor	properties
but if you ve gone to the trouble of making them properties you probably want whatever functionality is encapsulated in the accessor methods to be called most of the time

3123407
nsurl	nsstring
make sure that url is of nsurl type and not nsstring

3123408
getter	setter
by using the properties from outside of your class you can for example do some lazy loading and it becomes a lot easier to make any potential api changes by providing deprecation warnings in the getter setter

3123412
hide	show
i am using java swing to create a jdialog and i am trying to create a show hide details button to show hide a report at the bottom of this jdialog

3123418
listview	gridview
with a wpf or other kind of visual app you could have a nice grid listview with the view set to a gridview bound to the collection of simulated clients with columns for things like status duration errors - if you made them dependencyproperties you would see the results update in realtime

3123438
x86	64bit	128bit	64bit
but some sse instructions under x86 support 64bit and 128bit atomic load store of course you must first ensure memory aligment

3123443
put	get
arthur s answer shows that you can t really put both forms on one page because any given controller will only supply one form object you ll never get both active at once

3123482
ada	pascal
i ll just point out that pascal is semantically though not so much syntactically very similar to c so there are options like object pascal modula 2 ada and oberon out there where you will be re-using most of the non-trivial part of what you already know the trivial part being the spelling

3123496
folder	directory
when it comes rather than printing the itself it prints the folder inside the directory + works fine

3123514
inherited	properties
will change the font family in the whole document since css uses cascading styles nested tags inherited certain style properties from their parents â in this case the font

3123515
realloc	strcpy
the call to realloc allocates enough space for the string - so it doesn t actually crash but when you strcpy the string to propdata- northtexture you may be overwriting anything following northtexture in propdata - propdata- southtexture propdata- westtexture etc

3123558
put	get
if you now add the style this will put a border on the body div form and input elements and both the text and the input element will get the font size

3123617
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade my xcode from 3.1.2 to xcode versioning 3.2.3 and upgrade my device to 4.0 os

3123621
rss	feed
i am making an iphone application which has a list of rss feed and i want to show a blue bubble on the left with the number of unread articles one bubble per feed just like in mail app as shown here

3123684
gtk	fltk
no mainstream gui toolkit win32 mfc cocoa gtk kde fox fltk does it

3123699
inline	inlining
let s assume for a second that the compiler indeed inline my overloads then it is predetermined at compile time which code will run and i save the call to a function by inlining + a complicated switch case scenario in reality there will be 5+ overloads for + operator but am still able to write easily read code using basic arithmetic operators

3123792
int	chars
assuming some typical sizes for the int and the chars and lack of padding bytes at the end if you write this

3123809
maven	pom.xml
sbt is compatible with maven and ivy so you may generate the project file layout with maven archetypes and switch to sbt later - it will recognize repositories and dependencies specified in the pom.xml

3123847
width	height
a non-block element can t have height width specified like that and with no content inside it ll have nothing to give it size - instead you want inline-block like this

3123849
hide	show
easiest would be to give the id of the section div elements as radio button value and then loop through all radio buttons and show hide the element based on the button s checked state

3123857
primes	palindrome
for example my utils module for pe consists of functions for computing primes splitting numbers to digits checking for palindrome and so on

3123868
datediff	difference
for a web query you don t have datediff function but as the others point out a simple difference between the two values will give you the number of days

3123906
ready	each
split each line once when it initially enters the system pass that array or more likely a reference to the array around while doing your processing and then do a single join to turn it into a string when you re ready for it to leave the system

3123918
mouseover	mouseout
i have a problem with my mouseover and mouseout functions

3123918
mouseover	mouseout	hide	show
when i mouseover a link it show a hidden and when i mouseout of the div it hide the div

3123989
int	chars
an int can be converted to a chars and a int can also be converted to a long

3123991
unsigned	short
notice that this is only true on platforms where int can store all values of unsigned short

3123995
public	protected
given classes it is possible to make their methods private public default or protected

3124024
pull	push
pull from a after there are updates push it to b

3124024
pull	push
pull from a merge it with my local files then push it to b merging with the repo on b

3124029
inherited	properties
and inherited of these properties from ancestors

3124040
public	protected
given classes it is possible to make their methods private public default or protected

3124059
min	max
int type min and max is not validating for me it is giving a negative number when i try to give the correct greater than 4 numbers

3124112
wav	aiff
fortunately there seems to be a ruby binding for the audiofile library so you may be able to send your output into that in order to generate a proper aiff wav file

3124152
implements	extends
declare an event handler class and specify that the class either implements an actionlistener interface or extends a class that implements an actionlistener interface

3124173
google-chrome	firefox
project in action can be seen here only supports google-chrome and firefox so far check out fps at bottom left try spreading out the objects i get 14 fps at startup benned celestial

3124216
implements	extends
since a class can extends other classes and implements interfaces you should check for the most derived or specific one first if you want to distinguish between say sprite and movieclip

3124227
getter	setter
just keep it short and simple aka kiss principle write setter and getter

3124237
srp	principles
the single responsibility principles srp is quite common on the java world

3124269
versioning	upgrade
upgrade your versioning or switch to a better alternative

3124305
debian	linux
install a linux distribution that includes a postfix or qmail package such as debian

3124315
free	malloc
one benefit is that it may help fight memory fragmentation or malloc free overhead when you have a huge number of tiny data objects especially in threaded environments

3124344
erlang	ocaml
approximately on par with ocaml erlang and go

3124365
client-side	server-side
no solution using just system.drawing on the server-side will allow you to have client-side interactivity potentially if you use maps or ajax in conjunction you could but at that point it might make more sense to use a rich framework that is unless you are an expert in javascript

3124410
google-chrome	firefox
still everything looks fine for google-chrome firefox and ie8

3124423
profiling	debugging
i ve tried running ngen update debugging profiling but it didn t change a thing

3124458
svg	vml
in order to facilitate cross browser support raphael uses both vml and svg

3124459
jar	war
ejbs should be packaged into a jar so called ejb-jar and then assembled into an ear that wraps ejb-jar s war s and rar s

3124537
hide	show
im trying to show hide a div using jquery when a link gets clicked

3124623
many-to-many	one-to-many
when you create the foreign key relation between the table book and the table lying between book and author the one that breaks the many-to-many relationship in two one-to-many relationship try to specify the cascade action at insert and update specification

3124624
vim	emacs
but then reverted to vim where i found ways to do all the things that i was happy doing in emacs

3124726
hide	show
also consider using the hover method if you want to show hide the stuff when mouse enter leaves them

3124761
fadein	hide	fadein	fadeout	hide	fadeout	hide	show	slideup	slidedown
keep in mind though you should use display none instead of visibility hidden so that you can more easily control it s visibility with functions like hide show fadein fadeout slidedown slideup

3124773
hide	show
in this case you will have to use silverlight.js to check for the version of silverlight installed and if it is below v4 show the user your custom message show hide your div

3124775
client-side	server-side
i was wondering if there s a way to use php or any other server-side or even client-side if possible language to obtain certain pieces of information from a different website not a local file like the include nav.php

3124778
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
objectoutputstream objectinputstream

3124796
arraylist	treeset
if your application is such that a list will work then an arraylist or linkedlist will be more efficient than either a hashset or treeset

3124855
nhibernate	automapper
whenever i let the fluent nhibernate s automapper hit these guys it makes the child class have a non-nullable foreign key

3124869
width	height
the button is not given a height or width

3124869
width	height
give the button a percentage width or height and it should resize appropriately as the screen changes

3124891
salt	md5	whirlpool	md5	whirlpool	salt
i would not use md5 for hashing passwords consider using something else like sha1 or whirlpool and maybe salt the passwords as well

3124904
children	parent
each child essentially has knowledge of the parent but the parent has no knowledge of the children and the children have no knowledge of each other

3124944
client-side	server-side
there s a significant distinction between php and javascript the former is a server-side scripting language the latter a client-side scripting language

3124979
eigenvalue	diagonal
then take an eigenvalue decomposition of the 3x3 r q dq tick means transpose giving you an orthogonal q and diagonal scaling d

3125011
int	double
i ve been a java developer for 10 years...when it comes to managing numerical data for the most part i ve stuck with int and used double when i need some decimal precision

3125011
int	chars
originally i defined this attribute using an int but now i ve decided to use chars

3125030
ienumerable	icollection
i don t want to expose modification behaviour to them and i don t want them to treat my variable as an icollection in case i later change the way i generate that ienumerable

3125032
google-chrome	firefox
my advice is to use firebug for firefox and devtools for webkit browsers since only firebug lite works on google-chrome and it lacks many features the normal firebug has and the devtools are built into google-chrome

3125061
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i can t think of specifics at the moment but sometimes i ll try debugging something in safari or google-chrome and it seems like such a pita that i launch firefox and get whatever done quickly

3125066
jquery	livevalidation
here is complete js snippet with livevalidation placed inside document.ready jquery function that will execute when dom is ready

3125075
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
use an nscalendar instance to convert your start nsdate instance into an nsdatecomponents instance add 1 day to the nsdatecomponents and use the nscalendar to convert that back to an nsdate instance

3125079
int	chars
while this is perfectly acceptable its typically how i do it unless there are more than one chars in a row alignment issues will force the next variable to waste 1-3 bytes anyway which could otherwise have been used for free by an int

3125115
put	get
if line items can only be part of one appointment then i can actually just put a list of line items in each appointment when i get appointments i d already be getting line items

3125123
implements	extends
i am trying to create an application with the only purpose to implements a applescript dictionary and extends applescript

3125146
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	modulo	multiplication	modulo	addition	multiplication	addition	modulo	division	addition	division	subtraction	division	modulo	division	multiplication
however i didn t think you could take nibbles from a byte using modulo and subtraction and division nor reassemble them with simple multiplication and addition

3125147
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox you have to cancel the ondragover event for the ondrag event to fire

3125156
put	get
the contents of different .cpp files don t get put together until the linker runs

3125184
cos	sin
if you precompute and store sin and cos of lat lon and use haversine you will get the exact same performance improvements

3125185
subtraction	addition
addition and subtraction can be used to combine the values

3125201
16-bit	64bit	x86	64bit
note however that gcc does not support 16-bit x86 and that if both 32-bit and 64bit x86 compilers are installed as an exception you can use -m32 or -m64 to select the desired target format

3125214
pascal	delphi
the switch from 16 to 32 bit was easier because there was less legacy delphi 2 was 32 bit and the object pascal language was a lot simpeler than it is now.

3125218
vim	emacs
if you need only the feature to jump of to the definition of a specific function or class then vim and many other editors like emacs epsilon and joe can read the jump location from the ctags file

3125218
vim	gedit	vim	emacs	emacs	gedit
for programmable editors like vim emacs epsilon eclipse and gedit you can write your own plugin for your custom language but it may quickly become time-consuming and a maintenance nightmare because new versions of editors tend to change the plugin interface

3125253
width	height
note prior to iphone os 3.0 uiview instances may have a maximum height and width of 1024 x 1024

3125255
mockups	balsamiq
i would give them mockups done with balsamiq mock or some other tool

3125306
g++	gcc
many compilers support it including ms gcc g++ and intel

3125334
post	get
feel free to post more code particularly how anotherview is assigned and you may get a more specific answer

3125351
client-side	server-side
it will automatically generate all the javascript code you need to the server-side validation to work on the client-side

3125367
int	chars
int types but no chars reals subranged or enumerated types

3125398
post	get
this is because post and get are querydict objects which has some implications request.post members will return always one object

3125417
getter	setter
if in some case that s not true you can add a getter setter that actually acts upon the proxied object com.foo.graphics.a

3125458
perl	tcl
it s possible that you re seeing the consequences of the fact that both perl and tcl are independently trying to work around the bugs misfeatures in the system implementation of environment variables

3125458
perl	tcl
i d quite expect perl to work around this and i know that tcl does too but it does mean that only one language should set environment variables and that almost certainly needs to be perl in this case on the basis of evidence you ve presented

3125458
perl	tcl
- otherwise we re talking about having a different build of tcl so that it asks the perl side of things to do the memory management or doing some magic to disconnect the tcl side from the real environment

3125540
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in my experience this works in ie 6 up google-chrome firefox and safari

3125567
portrait	landscape
which means that if the first picture is a landscape and the second one a portrait the second one will be display as landscape with the same dimension as the first one

3125577
stdout	stderr
will return a tuple of strings one for stdout and another one for stderr output

3125605
listview	gridview
listview and gridview seems to be popular for this usage

3125611
listview	gridview
windows presentation foundation wpf provides a gridview view mode that partitions the listview data item content into columns

3125611
listview	gridview
the gridview class and its supporting classes provide the infrastructure to display data items that are specified for a listview control in a series of columns

3125615
hash	md5
while concurring with the previous suggestions of md5 or sha1 hash for generating the unique codes you may also want to care about making sure that those codes could not easily be reverse-engineered

3125615
hash	salt
if this could be problem then include a random salt string with the username string before creating the hash

3125620
equals	tostring
tostring is a method so you need it to be tostring and equality comparisons are performed with two equals signs not one

3125628
listview	gridview
so in other words it s not a choice of listview or gridview

3125628
listview	gridview
if you want to display tabular data in a listview you would create a listview and set its view to a gridview which defines the column layout.

3125631
stdout	stderr
the remote stdout and stderr are piped back to you

3125632
wordpress	joomla
examine how this is achieved in existing established applications such as wordpress drupal or joomla

3125680
portrait	landscape
this code works fine on the iphone simulator with version 4 of the os but when i try to run it on the iphone 4 simulator or the ipad simulator the views are completely off i can only see the about a quarter of the map in portrait and none of the table and in landscape i can see only the table

3125713
hide	show
i am using jquery to show and hide a div by adding removing a class to it

3125725
firefox	safari
works with firefox and safari

3125753
inherited	subclassing
when you inherited from an abstract-class you either need to provide implementations for all abstract methods or else you must declare the subclassing also as abstract

3125768
portrait	landscape
for example if the device is portrait load pview if landscape load lview

3125869
google-chrome	safari
the reason the video played in google-chrome but not safari is because the agent that makes the 2nd request in safari quicktime 7.6.6 qtver 7.6.6

3125878
rational-numbers	floating-point
gmp is a free library for arbitrary precision arithmetic operating on signed integers rational-numbers and floating-point numbers

3125903
googletest	cppunit
do yourself a favor and go straight to googletest which makes cppunit and boost unit_test look clunky and repetitive

3125946
mp3	wav
i want to know if it is faster to load and play a small wav than a small mp3 file on android media player

3125949
prepare	execute
the function prepare puts the pieces together for the query and the function execute binds the params and returns the array

3126049
min	max
it is often used to find a better approximation for the max or min value of a set of discrete data points

3126049
min	max
trim again computes the quadratic y a+b x+c x 2 and then finds a max min of this quadratic xm ym

3126049
min	max
there is then some logic to force the returned xm ym min or max values to lie within certain bounds

3126049
min	max
so x3 x1 and the condition says that if the quadratics max min value is outside the interval x1 x3 then set xm ym to x1 y1 as before

3126049
min	max
if not then if y1 is above the min max value in y then again set xm ym to x1 y1

3126050
postgresql	mysql
query insert id the last generated row id as a scalar autoincrement in mysql sequence in postgresql etc

3126079
disk	ram
well the b+ trees i can keep them in ram but the hash table i must be able to maintain it in the hard disk

3126130
implements	extends
they all extends a service class where the singleton behaviour is implements looking something like this

3126179
chown	sudo
sudo chown mysql mysql tmp mysqld.sock

3126182
voip	sip
i don t think there are many sophisticated attacks out there yet so implementing anything beyond dos flooding detection might be a waste of time because creating voip sessions with sip and recording and analyzing multimedia streams is more complicated than just to listen for scans on a specific port

3126197
integer	unsigned
the length of the data is an unsigned integer not an object so you have to use an appropriate format specifier

3126213
cpu	processors
a processors or cpu is the physical chip that is plugged into the system

3126225
hex	binary
you can use unhex function to convert a hexstring with hex pairs to binary and hex to do the other way round

3126253
mouse	keyboard
each mouse click mouse movement keyboard press etc

3126262
hash	md5
md5 isn t encryption - it s a one-way hash

3126288
vbscript	jscript
if i can use vb.net or c# and interpret vbscript or jscript in it i m happy with that

3126299
folder	directory
directory i was using for the new folder

3126308
hash	md5
you can t recover the original password from the md5 hash

3126327
public	protected
it is safe but you should consider providing either a public virtual destructor in zero or a non-virtual protected destructor depending on whether you want to be able to delete objects derived from zero through the base pointer

3126339
gif	png
my designer produces psds for the layout and supplies jpg gif png images for the graphical elements

3126368
int	chars
i need to work with the input given by the user how can i get the int and chars input from user and how to store it and how to use it for manipulation in c#

3126374
post	get
i m assuming it s the primary key. i d expect to get nothing unless there were some orphaned post in the post table

3126377
sorting	grouping
what is important is the client want the reports to be displayed in a kind of datagrid with sorting and grouping capability and he wants to increase the 1000 row limitation

3126377
sorting	grouping
he just wanted to increase the current 1000 limit with a sorting and grouping capability

3126377
sorting	grouping
the dotnet version is so poor in performance that i have to use paging but with the silverligh xamlgrid one i have good success in displaying as many as 15k record in less than 3min with all grouping and sorting capability

3126394
put	get
uiwindow doesn t cope well if you try to put views from two view controllers into it only the last one will get the appropriate callbacks and they won t know about each other

3126397
draggable	droppable
i have a problem where the element calls .show when the draggable triggers drag does not let me drop into the droppable

3126405
inline	inlining
with the profiler you can see these more commonly executed branches and inline them selectively but never start by inlining profilers do a good job at telling you what to consider inlining but never what shouldn t be inline

3126419
voip	sip
voip with sip is becoming the de-facto standard

3126419
rtp	sip
this challenge is designed to examine and explore some of attributes of the sip and rtp protocols

3126436
width	height
i m pretty sure this means that i tried to divide a string but in the pyglet documentation it says that width and height are ints

3126448
folder	directory
i would like that xcode after compiling my libs copy them to the executable folder or better copy the libs to a system directory where they would be loaded without having to compile thus copying the libs over again

3126448
folder	directory
there is a install directory in the project s settings the default is usr local lib but i don t even have a folder called local at usr i tried to reach it through the terminal so i guess this isn t working at all.

3126460
disk	ram
we want to minimize storage on disk and ram

3126501
google-chrome	firefox
at least firefox and google-chrome ignore the trailing comma but it s a syntax error in internet explorer

3126501
google-chrome	firefox
after i fixed that your code worked fine for me in google-chrome firefox and ie

3126511
google-chrome	firefox
my website renders correctly in google-chrome but it shows a 16px gap between divs in firefox

3126544
min	max
now i if i have a series of pageviews of a time period but i want to display a time period even if there are no pageviews flotilla seems to render a graphic that only encapsulates the time of the first and last pageview not the min max i want

3126546
scrypt	md5
sadly they do not publish scrypt timings. your md5 is millions of times worse than either of these ready replacements

3126557
integer	unsigned
i just write a procedure to decompose an unsigned integer to prime numbers

3126561
photoshop	fireworks
i have also downloaded several tools like color scheme designer and i even know how to use photoshop fireworks i have read some books about design

3126563
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
as noted above the filesystem on mac os is case-insensitive unless you specifically set up your filesystem to be case-sensitive

3126579
versioning	upgrade
worst case you can always just stick with whatever versioning of the compiler interpreter you currently have you re never forced to upgrade in that respect

3126580
rss	feed
i have two websites that declare an rss feed like so

3126599
google-chrome	firefox
what you ve posted here renders similarly in google-chrome and firefox

3126640
onreadystatechange	onload
with that in mind assuming you must load the yui files asynchronously you should use an onload onreadystatechange handler as noted by digitalfresh

3126659
multiplying	multiplication
seeing as rows in a with the same column entries multiplying to the same result in ab over vector b you can cache the result and use it instead of calculating it again itâ s always good to avoid 100m 100m multiplication if you can

3126694
salt	md5
note the method that deepali suggested will not work because newest joomla versions 1.5.x are using the md5 salt form which means that the password is saved in the database in the form of

3126698
opera	firefox
this is my web page which doesn t work in ie8 but works in firefox 3.6.4 and opera 9.63 -

3126706
postorder	inorder
you might find it helpful to study breadth-first search and depth-first search with tree structures as well as pre-order inorder and postorder tree traversal

3126747
uiview	subviews
my app is actually an ipad app with a main uiviewcontroller and three subviews uiview s

3126806
versioning	upgrade
our c++ application hosts sun s jvm and i need to upgrade it to the newest versioning on windows

3126902
cos	sin
you can create 4 new columns being sin and cos of lat and lon

3126902
cos	sin
since and other appearances of sin and cos like can be calculated in the program before running the query the big distance expression reduces to something of the form that can be handled by sqlite3

3126948
fileoutputstream	objectoutputstream
this is done with a fileoutputstream objectoutputstream combo as described below

3126992
profiling	benchmarking
the result after a week of researching os-specific methods to detect stack range alignment requirements and doing a lot of testing and profiling was an allocator that could allocate memory in 4 clock cycles according to our tick counter benchmarking as opposed to about 400 cycles for malloc operator new our test involved thread contention so malloc is likely to be a bit faster than this in single-threaded cases perhaps a couple of hundred cycles

3126992
free	malloc
max_align is easy enough to use but if you re after speed for memory allocations and assuming you ve already profiled your code and found hotspots in malloc free operator new delete with major contributors being in code you have control over writing your own allocator can really make the difference

3127006
datediff	difference
instead of casting your datetimes into floats to calculate time difference i suggest using sqlserver s datediff function with the minute or second argument as appropriate

3127034
google-chrome	firefox
i understand why pdf and gif will attempt to open in a browser but the dxf files will using firefox and google-chrome try to open inside the browser window too - unsuccesfully but attempting

3127072
tiff	png
so if the jpg format does not allow to do this any other compressed format like tiff or png would do

3127074
post	get
i am trying to make a query to get the post title link and images of the post

3127074
post	get
now what i really want is to get only the last thumbnail inserted in the post not all of them

3127085
queue	fifo
works like a standard fifo queue

3127106
google-chrome	firefox
i m not sure if it works in any browser works on firefox google-chrome ie8 doesn t work on ie7-

3127126
udp	tcp
udp will for sure give you the best performance because it is connection-less you save the expensive connect call from tcp and the tcp flag management during transmissions

3127132
coalesce	isnull
if you wanted to display a username or their email address if they don t have a username you could use coalesce or isnull for example select isnull username email_address - which gives the value of username unless it is null in which case it gives the value of email_address

3127135
udp	tcp
imho the main difference between tcp and udp is tcp makes sure that packages arrives the destination and udp does not

3127135
udp	tcp
because of that udp is a bit faster than tcp

3127141
ubuntu	debian
it s all from the latest debian packages ubuntu 9.0.4 64 bit

3127146
google-chrome	safari
i should note for the record that google-chrome and some other lesser-known browsers also use webkit but safari for the desktop is more likely to reproduce the results of safari for ios since they re both maintained by apple

3127182
qtextedit	qitemdelegate
what i ve tried is to subclass qitemdelegate and just return the instance of qtextedit i already have like this

3127189
post	get
i ll post an example below to get you in the mood -

3127216
implements	modifiers
i used a few tricks in the get and set methods to allow dynamic property modifiers i m sure you could do the same kind of thing to implements your signals and parent child relations etc

3127225
pull	push
i have a similar usage scenario svn over https password using git for a local repository and push pull to the svn server however i haven t encountered this issue you are mentioning

3127238
int	boolean
how do i convert java.util.map string object to scala.collection.immutable.map string any so that all values in the original map int boolean etc. are converted to the right value to work well in scala

3127254
inherited	subclassing
so all subclassing of command have singleton classes that inherited from command s singleton class

3127264
debian	linux
i use linux kubuntu and downloaded the numpy package as a debian package

3127277
ubuntu	linux
you can use wine and run visual studio s on ubuntu the best option before a total conversion is to dual boot between windows and linux

3127282
ubuntu	linux
i would advice you to keep windows until your work on these projects will be finished dual-boot install ubuntu on another partition and boot it when you don t need to work on your projects or install windows in a virtual machine inside linux f.e

3127282
vmware	virtualbox
using vmware or virtualbox

3127290
post	get
so instead of get or post use delete messages inbox 1234

3127296
httpresponse	request
instead have a render_inbox request method that returns an httpresponse and call the method at the end of each of your views

3127309
put	get
however let s put aside exactness and instead consider a simplified model that might help get you into the right ballpark

3127309
width	height
for example if you count the number of hard line breaks in the text you can treat those as separate since they add height without adding width

3127311
jruby	rubinius
should be easy to build on rubinius clearing methods caches would be the main issue no clue about jruby

3127314
ssms	sqlcmd
in ssms and sqlcmd you have a go separator which is a client-side tool for separating batches

3127318
post	get
with the author parameter you get only post from this author

3127347
textview	imageview
this helps to avoid the overhead of calling findviewbyid for rendering each component inside complex item layouts with multiple components like the textview and imageview in this case

3127373
centos	linux
i tried running this on os x and centos linux

3127375
versioning	upgrade
you re going to have to maintain your own versioning of drupal s htaccess file and deal with this work around every time you upgrade

3127386
dictionary	map
i know i can create a normal array vector and then use an object dictionary to map the keys to the index in the current array

3127401
submit	submission
but radiochoice doesn t naturally submit the form and something likely needs to be done client-side to make an actual form submission occur

3127403
skip-lists	tree
we re left with 2 data structures binary indexed tree ironically the very name fenwick used to describe his structure and ranked skip-lists

3127445
put	get
a debug build will force the compiler to put all variables on the stack and keep them around for their entire scope so you get the expected debug view

3127459
post	get
index.php can examine the requested url segments and potentially whether the request was made via get or post and use this information to dynamically invoke a certain script without the location of that script having to match the directory structure implied by the request uri

3127485
maven	m2e
i working with eclipse helios m2e maven plugin and glassfish plugin

3127495
post	get
nearly every implementation of xmlhttprequest out there chrome internet explorer msxml has a bug where it performs a get instead of a post after following the redirect

3127518
mockito	easymock
the switch from easymock to mockito was very straightforward and i managed to make the tests down compatible test cases behave the same

3127568
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
an aggregate-functions avg count sum min max grouping stdev stdevp var and varp

3127582
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
write a menu program that ask a user for a number indicating the four basic math equations addition subtraction multiplication division

3127635
error-handling	exception-handling
the beauty of exception-handling if you do it correctly again see raii is that it avoids the need to litter error-handling code throughout your system

3127637
jar	war
i m using m2eclipse 0.10.0 and i don t use any special workaround it just works for at least 3 projects in my workspace of type jar ejb and war

3127713
width	height
the plugin editor currently requires the user to provide the video s width and height in order for my code to push out the relevant dimensions to the flowplayer

3127713
width	height
ideally i d prefer it if the user simply had to provide the flv location and let the new plugin automatically provide the width height to the flowplayer

3127733
typedef	struct
you can use struct s and enum s without writing struct or enum before every declaration or using typedef

3127737
int	chars
you re going to want to look for the last space before the 0 then you re going to want to call a function to convert the remaining chars to an int

3127758
put	get
if you want all customers do a get to example.com customer if you want to edit a customer you ll probably want to put to example.com customer your customer id

3127758
post	put
have a look at put vs post in rest for the difference between post and put edit and create

3127768
getter	setter
you re obviously getting a collision because the ipcontainer class has two dynamic method definitions one generates just a setter and the other a setter and a getter

3127768
getter	setter
after all in a readonly property in the protocol you ve defined a getter method but in the class you ve also defined a setter method

3127768
accessor	properties
with a dynamic properties the complier has to generate a message to the runtime explaining what accessor to generate on the fly

3127769
post	get
if you happen to have the images in a single directory not really advisable but that s for another post you could run scandir against the directory and then array_rand to get a random image zero database overhead but be careful about having a single directory overloaded with files and be careful to skip . and .. when pulling the random entry

3127784
min	rank
i m looking for the best solution to store the ettings for a website like the limit of posts for users limit of users online rank min

3127794
multiplying	multiplication
if you multiplying them like you would on a normal multiplication you ll have

3127818
post	get
i would like to move this logic to its own logincontroller but that would require remembering where the original request was to and saving all post and get data then doing a redirect to get to the logincontroller

3127849
put	get
when first requested you can put it in the cache object so afterwards you can get them from there for fast retrieval

3127858
cassini	iis
i can t install iis on the designer s machines cassini doesn t support classic asp and we need live save preview

3127871
boost	stl
one of the big reasons for that is the stl the standard template library and boost

3127881
disk	ram
then using a jpeg library that works directly on that array which is independent of the size of ram installed on the machine you should be able to feed the array into the library and have it save the contents out to disk

3127914
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
also it s hard coded into all uiviewcontroller - they always have a reference to the uinavigationcontroller that contains them

3128022
folder	directory
this is a clean installation with the old .eclipse configuration directory and eclipse workspace folder blown away

3128061
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this is only happening on firefox google-chrome and safari look ok

3128073
ubuntu	debian
debian has it so all derived distros ubuntu et

3128158
width	height
ie does not recognise the full width and height

3128205
pop-up	dialog
when a uac dialog pop-up it shows a different pop-up for digitally signed software than non-signed software

3128209
put	get
you can then put an interface onto the new class and get into an ioc framework easier

3128214
terminate	timeout
afaik if a transaction has not terminate committed or rolled back before the timeout value elapses the transaction system will automatically roll it back

3128229
submit	submission
the submit button works only for validating the javascript in the question.js file but it doesnt do the basic function which is submission the form itself

3128284
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in ie and firefox with the code i am using but the selectedtext variable is empty in google-chrome and safari

3128400
width	margin
one common cause of not fitting is a 100 width item when the body margin is not zero

3128410
post	put
you don t want to put a limit on your nested select because it will only find 1 row - not one row for each post like you intend

3128420
cos	sin
i m pretty sure i could pre-calculate 90 degrees of the sin i cos i and then just flip and repeat rather than what i m doing in this code and that that would speed it up

3128446
put	get
if i follow the suggestion and i put the file.open in a using statement i get this

3128481
post	get
you can use the nsurlconnection which is also asynchronous for post get requests

3128528
lxml	elementtree
the nearest is probably elementtree which is part of the python standard library or an extended version lxml

3128530
int	chars
int strstr5 const chars cs const chars ct

3128546
mockito	easymock
i m more familiar with easymock than mockito so i had to do a little digging

3128546
mockito	easymock
the core differentiators for mockito are based on those areas of easymock that the mockito team thought were limitations or sub-optimal practices

3128620
boyer-moore	rabin-karp
try looking at boyer-moore as already suggested by greg hewgill rabin-karp and kmp algorithms

3128657
apache	lighttpd
coming to the web server i have made great experiences using lighttpd instead of the fat apache but i guess you have to evaluate that for yourself

3128657
postgresql	mysql
also take in consideration what database backend to use in shared envionments there s in most cases a bigger load on the mysql than on the postgresql servers but also evaluate what works best for you

3128666
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
this implements the inotifypropertychanged and inotifycollectionchanged interfaces which notify clients - in this case the ui - that the property and collection have changed

3128709
put	get
i download the files put them all in the right places then get to work on loading the library

folder	directory
make sure it is installed correctly - in your program files microsoft sql server directory there whould be a 100 150 folder

3128765
wordpress	joomla
i ve decided to accept a contract to convert in the client s words a joomla site into a wordpress site

3128765
post	put
instead of going through each post one-by-one and updating the links or running a sql command to remove .html from urls i ve decided to put the pressure on .htaccess with which i am somewhat comfortable

3128790
rmdir	mkdir
check the os module for other functions you seem to need like rmdir remove and mkdir

3128797
keydown	keyup
there is no way using ecmascript javascript to catch a keypress keydown or keyup event if the browsers navigationbar is focused

3128826
post	get
the ajax request you perform uses get while the serverside code seems to expect a post

3128836
trie	tree
essentially i was thinking about creating some sort of hash on the sound clip and saving the data as a trie or suffix tree of the hash but i m not sure how i could do a comparison for it then

3128855
portrait	landscape
however on the ipad navigation works as expected in landscape mode but it s not possible to drill down the table view hierarchy in portrait from inside the popover

3128855
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
update it is possible to make the data of the child views to appear in portrait by calling self.view reloaddata in viewdidappear but not viewwillappear

3128858
postgresql	mysql
apache mysql postgresql sqlite and

3128893
nstableview	nssplitview
the issue i m having is that when trying to grab the frames of two nstableview s hosted within portion b and c of my nssplitview i receive relative coordinates

3128893
width	height	nstableview	nssplitview
as you can see from the returned nsrect values i m given the correct width and height of the nstableview but what i m really after is their position relative to the parent nssplitview

3128893
nstableview	nssplitview
of course i could use a number of iboutlets and construct the correct rect value myself but what i m really looking for is an easy way to grab the frame of the nstableview relative to either the parent nssplitview or the containing window

3128896
width	height
for example the canvas width is 100 and i have two videodisplay with width 100 and height 75

3128902

nstableview	nssplitview
the reason you re getting those values is because the nstableview are not direct subviews of the nssplitview

3129140
mouse	keyboard
backlit keys are a gimmick once you know where things are you use them on a keyboard - no need to look and besides you have a healthy glow from your monitor to see the little-used keys assuming its not quicker to just use the mouse if you re taking your hands off the keyboard

i am trying to select all input fields on a form except button and checkbox

3129151

secondly if you were going to do it the way you are doing - you can open a networkstream or sslstream and read and write to that stream to handle all your communication

3129248
cdr	cons
also cons and car and cdr are primitives the implementation you see below is the demonstration in structure and implementation of computer programs that shows they aren t strictly needed as them but having them as primitives dramatically increases performance so better not re-define your cons car and cdrs

3129249
inherited	properties
you d create a configurationsectiongroup called something like tomwrightframeworkconfigurationsectiongroup which inherited from configurationsectiongroup and have it have one properties called settings which points to a another class settingsconfigurationsection which inherited from configurationsection

3129352
uiview	subviews
i need to capture a uiview and all it s subviews into a uiimage

3129365
try-catch	exception-handling
however if your destructors do something more complicated like maybe remove a lock file on disk or something where it would make a difference whether the program called destructors or not when crashing you may want to wrap your main in a try-catch block that catches everything only to exit on exception-handling anyway just to ensure that the stack always unwinds before terminating

3129383
division	modulo
it shouldn t use division or modulo

3129383
subtraction	addition
not that these are bad granted they tend to be an order of magnitude slower than addition subtraction negation etc. but they aren t needed and if they re present it probably means the implementation isn t really that efficient

3129443
move	drag
i have a wpf 4 app which i want to enable drag and drop with currently i have it working with a basic drag and drop implementation but i have found that it would be much better if instead of the mouse cursor changing over to represent the move operation i could use an image underneath my finger

3129493
column-count	height
however it seems that column-count arranges a block of text so that it is laid out with a certain number of columns while its height can grow beyond the bounds of the screen page

3129509
post	get
but apparently imagefield does not send it s data with post request as i m getting multivaluedictkeyerror at user register so i can t get it from data

i would use radio button or selects as it is quite easier but it is requested that i use checkbox

3129555

the api supports get post and put requests for querying and manipulating data

3129821
post	put
i do not want to run actual post put requests against the live dev database

3129821
post	put
however for data manipulation the api uses http headers quite extensively and also parses raw xml and json post put data

3129842
width	height
w h are width and height multiples of 16

3129854
superclass	subclassing
that said an interface is very likely going to be faster since there are less things to be done it s not necessary to copy the instance properties from the superclass to the subclassing

3129864
folder	directory
distribution file is just for when you want to build for the appstore in which case all you can do is build the .app file which is stored in the build directory of your project folder

firefox	safari
if ie works and safari and firefox doesn t that probably means ie is not conforming to standard

3130305
width	height
span for one thing cannot have width and height

3130305
width	height
some earlier ie version actually let you have width and height

3130306
width	height
by default a span element is display inline so the height and width properties do not apply to it

3130306
width	height
use a different element one which is block by default or change the display property to one that height and width apply to to get this to work

3130307
width	height
would allow you to set the height and width of the span element but it will no longer line with other text

3130340
equals	gethashcode
there s only one way to satisfy the requirements of gethashcode with an equals like this

3130425
stdout	stderr
try redirecting stderr to stdout and using to capture that

3130425
stdout	stderr
since your command redirects stdout somewhere it shouldn t interfere with stderr

3130440
postgresql	mysql
the same goes for mysql and postgresql

then when a single row of the jtable is selected i need to display some information regarding the model object corresponding to the selected row on some jlabel

3133315
google-chrome	firefox
so i have this in my ror app it works in firefox google-chrome and safari.

3133336
mouse	keyboard
which works for keyboard keys not mouse buttons

3133343
int	boolean
the first thing you will benefit from is you are not restricted to string values you can get int boolean guid and string values out of your configuration object without any work and anything else you need you can create custom type converters

3133362
post	get
if you want people to get a better idea of what is wrong you should post your code

3133379
folder	directory
find the views-view-field.tpl.php file in the views module folder and copy and paste it into your theme directory where your views-view-field--default--field-thewittyshit-value.tpl.php resides

3133405
google-chrome	firefox
firefox didn t mind ie and google-chrome were seeing the session as being expired as soon as it was set

3133406
client-side	server-side
before reading the uploaded file the server-side code must save it on the server client-side file location is mostly irrelevant at this point

3133408
put	get
i would not put them in high priority on your side until ie9 get nearer to release or late beta

3133421
put	get
what you have to remember is that the directories are only for the developers purposes once you hit compile that does not matter because all files get put into 1 root compilation

3133458
config	ini
you could also take out the middle man and have the config stored in a php array no need to parse an ini or xml or whatever if that s the case

3133468
put	get
otherwise it probably will get more difficult - maybe put some controller class in between that caches the relevant data or synchronizes access to core data

3133523
width	height
the image width and height must be specified for ie7 8 to render the image

3133573
pseudo-class	visited
this question 1 is basically a duplicate of yours and the consensus was that none of the browsers allow you to set pseudo-class like visited

3133605
submit	submission
you can check user entered value on submit event of form to be valid otherwise ignore form from submission and show alert

3133609
button	checkbox
this is what i usually do with my radio button and checkbox

3133615
firefox	safari
in ie and firefox it appears normally but in safari the menu items appear blank

3133646
post	get
i guess that this form is either using get instead of post or the input fields are not named username and password

3133706
listview	gridview
i would like to bind a to a gridview in a listview and i m not having much luck

3133739
installation	upgrade
we were quite fortunate in this respect that if there was a change to the centralised static data we needed to include it in the upgrade part of the installation instructions so by default it was stored in the scm repository checked out by the developers and installed as part of their normal workflow

3133762
mouseover	mouseout
when you handle your mouseover and mouseout events you should use the stop function to clear the animation queue

3133762
mouseleave	mouseenter
the usefulness of the .stop method is evident when we need to animate an element on mouseenter and mouseleave

3133763
mouseover	mouseout
your mouseover and mouseout events would then modify those variables that are polled and so you wouldn t have to worry about triggering hundreds of animations

3133786
try-catch	exception-handling
so you could wrap the whole thing in a function that contains a try-catch and return false if you got an exception-handling or true if you got an actual value

3133801
webclient	webrequest
for http use either the webclient or webrequest webresponse classes

3133827
post	get
some users are trying to submit forms via get when my form method is post

3133855
post	get
if the administrator is the only one allowed to post then you may be able to get away with using limit 1

3133862
cassini	iis
update just a thought to rule out iis config try running the site under cassini built-in dev server

3133881
websphere	ibm
ibm websphere mq explorer 6 does not seem to have an option for this.

3133898
post	get
some browser plug-ins toolbars have a feature which allows changing forms from get - post and vice-versa

3133900
rss	feed
content is coming via an rss feed that includes images

3133914
width	height
for the sake of simplicity you might want to consider using the x y width height values

3133944
folder	directory
my problem is that i want to make php think that the root folder is their home directory and they cannot go upper than their home directory

3134000
equals	gethashcode
edit something has to be up with my equals or gethashcode implementations somewhere since assert.areequal expected unionedcrs.distinct distinct should remove duplicates

3134003
put	get	post	put	post	get
you design your site to work as intended you put your get post restrictions on your methods for security or other reasons

3134003
post	get
if the user tries to get around your security with some advanced tools plugins such as get post switches it s not your concern

3134015
colorbox	thickbox
i have tried using colorbox and thickbox

3134065
post	get
redirect the user to a second page after the submit using the post redirect get pattern preferably in combination with one of the above

3134069
post	get
use the post redirect get pattern

3134084
vsto	add-in
clickonce is designed for desktop applications console apps xbap apps and vsto add-in

3134123
width	height
the width and height of the wall is constant but the width and height of the toy s is variable also the number of toy divs is dynamic and as the number increases toy s need to arrange as rows

3134139
onresume	onpause
or you could use sharedpreferences to store intermediate value that s read in onresume .. to restart the timer and saved in onpause ..

3134165
int	double
unboxed types are like int double etc. and the boxed types are like etc

3134183
mouse	keyboard
i m trying to capture global mouse and keyboard input

3134188
accessor	properties
i get the error accessor must declare a body because properties is not marked as abstract or extern

3134204
solaris	aix
for example if you options are windows linux osx aix solaris and you type in then the options that would show up are windows and linux

3134205
hide	show
i am able to hide the correct when clicking show more however i am lost as to choosing the correct expanded paragraph and then implementing the opposite for collapsing

3134315
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
for example you can loops through an associative arrays using a for-loop which you can t do with a hashtable

3134320
post	get
i was wondering if i am allowed to have one python file with several request handler classes each of which has get and post methods

3134328
quicksort	heapsort
for example using linear search instead of binary search using wrong sort algorithms for example quicksort heapsort are faster than bubble sort on unsorted data but insertion sort can be faster than quicksort on partially sorted data

3134365
allocator	stl
learn what memory allocator strategies are for each stl container

3134370
post	get
has get and post methods

3134370
put	get	post	put	post	get
this doesn t mean the yaml file lets you call any method whatsoever of course rather it hands control to a .py file whose main is responsible for all that follows and with the webapp mini-framework that comes with app engine it will always be get or post method or put delete ... etc if you also support those -- few do unless they re being especially restful

3134430
boost	allocator
we can mitigate the issue by making vector store shared_ptr but now we pay for two additional heap allocator per expensiveelement inserted one for the reference counter in boost shared_ptr and one for expensiveelement along with the overhead of a pointer indirection each time we want to access expensiveelement stored in the vector

3134430
boost	allocator
you can really get a speed boost by writing your own memory allocator though this is not a trivial thing to do and don t forget alignment if you do

3134434
post	get
and in your form post action in controller you can get the value as

3134435
width	height
the height of the .wall and the width of each .toy collapse when the toys are absolutely positioned but you can just add a few more lines to get set their width and height in the above .each loops

3134444
pop-up	dialog
unfortunately i don t enforce that the button cannot be clicked while the dialog box to browse file is opened so i get error error #2041 only one file browsing session may be performed at a time. if i click on the button while the pop-up dialog box is up

3134444
pop-up	dialog
it does not let you click on their button above select files to upload while the pop-up dialog box is showed

3134486
width	height
simply display the swf inside of the html with 100 width and 100 height

3134494
pull	push
thereafter a plain git pull git push will do what you expect

3134495
rss	feed
i have the following rss feed that i m trying to parse using touchxml for an iphone application

3134495
rss	feed
the code i m using the following method to parse the rss feed

3134512
google-chrome	firefox
that plug-in works great in firefox and google-chrome and ie8...on adsense and some other ads programs...but the problems begins on ie7...from some reason sometimes the ads loads in the containers and sometimes they not.

3134583
folder	directory
copy to output directory copies folder structure but only want to copy files

3134592
skip-lists	tree
an associative array could be implemented by a hash table most implementations will do that but it could also be implemented by some sort of tree or a skip-lists or the algorithm just iterates over all elements in the array and looks for a key that matches this would be awfully slow but it works

3134602
strstr	substr
i m trying to evaluate different substr search ala strstr algorithms and implementations and looking for some well-crafted needle and haystack strings that will catch worst-case performance and possible corner-case bugs

3134654
int	double
so particular unboxed types like int# double# really are represented just as double or int on the machine in c notation

3134672
fadein	fadeout
i have a refresh button and i want the old content to fadeout and then the new content to fadein

3134672
fadein	fadeout
so when my refresh button is clicked i launch jquery s fadeout effect and also my own portlet.content function which does an async get builds a new bit of content and passes it on and then when both are complete i remove the old content append the result of the second function which is in and fadein the new content

3134679
postgresql	mysql
if that helps i m using symfony 1.4 with mysql innodb and have also tried with postgresql with the same result

3134725
width	height
the element that wraps the actual button and shows the visual pointer cursor and background image has a width of 140px and a height of 30px

3134725
width	height
now you don t want to hardcode these values to the button again you want to set this button to 100 width and height

3134731
rtp	rtsp
streaming via rtsp or rtp in html5

3134738
put	get
i am just starting to learn hashtables and so far i know that you take the object you want to hash and put it through an hash function then use the index it returns to get the corresponding object you want

3134787
abc	subclassing
i could only come up with well you force your subclassing to implement abstract methods and prevent them from instantiating the abc

3134788
equals	gethashcode
i m working on writing a compiler and one feature of this compiler is that it automatically generates gethashcode equals object and equals this value type methods for value types

3134825
haskell	ocaml
c c++ haskell ocaml

3134853
put	get
the simplest way to get all of the matches would be to put a capturing group around the whole thing like this

3134857
post	get
this method works because although an attacker can force your browser into sending get post requests he cannot view the response and there for cannot read this token needed to forge the request

3134857
salt	md5
md5 is used to obscure how the salt is generated

3134865
post	get
it works fine when javascript is disabled and the post method is used with just php but when the get method is used along with javascript i m getting this undefined problem

3134875
profiling	instrumentation
time just times the whole operation while profiling runs it under instrumentation so it can get a detailed breakdown

3134896
folder	directory
i d create a folder called tmp in your user directory and target that location instead

3134931
post	get
if this or my previous post answers your question please click the answer icon so i get reputation points

3134951
serializable	deserialization
i am now having to choose between using serializable deserialization and raw data buffer

3135047
getter	setter
i think you could best use one representation and provide getter and setter which eventually do the conversion to the other representation

3135070
button	checkbox
on selectall button i am selecting all the checkbox from my fieldset

3135120
getter	setter
it would also be wise to access fields like parent and child through getter and setter

3135191
multiplying	multiplication
at the processor level the multiplication is just load load multiplying load multiplying .

3135221
django	web2py
i plan on using a python framework to implement the website leaning towards django or web2py so existing python module support would be a plus

3135233
terminate	timeout
however timeout and other fatal errors still terminate the script as normal

3135238
ienumerable	ilist
i would do the null checks in the constructor and take ienumerable as argument instead of ilist

3135321
children	parent
the order in which they are added to the collection guarantees i think that the children will always be processed after the parent

3135358
super	implements
that has its own overhead being a tree but if you really find that to be an efficiency problem you could implements a fast memory allocator to insert and remove elements super fast note only do this if you profile and determine this to be a bottleneck

3135382
starttls	smtps
edit if you don t need encryption just leave out starttls and stick to the e smtps standard as defined in the rfcs .

3135399
expression-blend	silverlight
i have recently installed expression-blend 4 and created a test silverlight 4 project

3135403
parallels	bootcamp
it will probably run really slow in parallels but you could also use bootcamp and then run virtualpc

3135446
hash	md5
crypto ones md5 tea sha as well - though crypto hash tend to be much slower

3135453
postgresql	mysql
it only supports postgresql mysql and oracle by default

3135456
folder	directory
the resource bundle is in a directory version1 placed in a class folder in eclipse which is at the top of my class path

3135472
outputstream	inputstream
my current solution involves having a threaded reader that reads data from an inputstream and then writes the data to outputstream objects that have been associated with the reader

3135482
addition	multiplication
now if you re interested in the theoretical question there is also a solution using addition rather than multiplication

3135505
qcombobox	qstandarditemmodel	qcombobox	qstandarditem
i am trying to put a qcombobox into a qstandarditem to be used in a qstandarditemmodel

3135508

in macos x every event every keyboard key pressed every mouse key pressed or mouse movement creates an event that travels the following path

3135521
post	get
if you implement something i would like to get the code don t forget to post back the results

3135524
crypt	salt
using characters outside of this range in the salt will cause crypt to return a zero-length string

3135524
crypt	salt
where it seems that crypt has cut the salt itself to a length of 22

3135555
post	get
and while you re at it please post some info on how to get callbacks working for a simple c command line app

3135591
integer	unsigned
unpacking it as a big-endian unsigned 32bit integer 2i looks a bit like it might be projected coordinates of some kind.

3135638
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in general only google-chrome and safari webkit-based browsers support most of html5 the other browsers including ie8 and firefox lack support for various features

3135643
crypt	salt
the phrase using characters outside of this range in the salt will cause crypt to return a zero-length string referse to outside the range of base 64 not the range of 22 characters

3135643
put	get
try putting an illegal character in the salt string and you should find that you get an empty output or if you put 22 characters in resulting in illegal empty bytes

3135664
cvs	rcs
the cvs repository will contain the rcs files generally ending in v

3135664
cvs	svn
i d seriously consider migrating the repository to something other than cvs git hg even svn

3135697
hlsl	glsl
hlsl has some differences from glsl

3135697
hlsl	glsl
there is a sourceforge project hlsl to glsl tool

3135697
hlsl	glsl
also i believe that the nvidia cg toolkit can generate hlsl or glsl

3135706
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome support a pretty hefty chunk of the proposed html5

3135736
octree	quadtree
usually bsp-trees or quadtree or octree

3135754
integer	unsigned
536739282 is well within the maximum boundary of an unsigned 4 byte integer which is upwards of 4 billion

3135756
folder	directory
if all the code isn t in the same folder or identified using references then you may want to add include directory - with vc this is typically located under project properties configuration properties c c++ general additional include directory

3135771
integer	unsigned
unsigned int your 4 byte unsigned integer allows for values from 0 to 4 294 967 295

3135780
post	get
edit the above is mostly wrong this blog post might get you started faster

3135846
width	height
in order to use the width 100 css property on an element the element s parent needs to have a defined height

3135854
int	chars
it s a common source of confusion for mysql users to see int 20 and assume it s a size limit something analogous to chars 20

3135890
map	quadtree	r-tree	quadtree
if your map is feebly filled and there are a lot of empty tiles it make sense to use some spatial indexes like quadtree or r-tree or bsp-trees

3135908
width	height
i have a div with a height of 500px and a width of 200px

3135910
uiview	calayer
i wasn t sure if you were adding a calayer or a uiview

3135911
wsimport	wsdl2java
until now i came across wsdl2java axis apache cxf and wsimport

3135912
mouseout	mouseleave
instead of mouseout here you want mouseleave so replace this

3135912
mouseout	mouseleave
the mouseleave event differs from mouseout in the way it handles event bubbling

3135914
setinterval	settimeout
btw - you can use setinterval instead of settimeout - it sets a repeating timer

3135990
.htaccess	httpd.conf
in .htaccess or preferably in httpd.conf in the directory section for home domain_tld

3136019
submit	submission
if you re actually submission the form asynchronously then just set some token toggle in as form s data-xxx attribute after the succesful form submit

3136044
unsigned	short
i have tried passing in a pointer to an unsigned short bstr and various other things and the dll crashes on the string

3136054

i got a view where i list files and i got a delete button but i got problems the delete act like a link get instead of post

3136092
inherited	properties
i have a situation with a lot of redundant c# code and it really looks like some kind of crafty trick using some properties of inherited or generics would solve this

3136114
springsource	grails
not only because it has great grails support but because springsource is the company behind the grails project

3136142
profiler	yourkit
an alternative is to use a profiler like yourkit

3136160
post	get
now my goal is to have a little button that opens up a model box with jquery this i can manage on my own with a form asking the user to input a number then that number will be sent via post or get to php_self and update a local variable with the number the user inputed then that variable will be used to update the database to increase or decrease the limit value

3136186
hash	salt
to generate hash password using blowfish you first need to generate a salt which starts with 2a followed by iteration count and 22 characters of base64 string

3136186
crypt	salt
crypt knows how long is the salt from the algorithm identifier

3136204
postgresql	mysql
if that helps i use symfony 1.4 with mysql innodb and i had tried before with the postgresql dbms with the same result

3136224
translation	localization
however our customers often send the localization files to a third party to do the translation which becomes tricky

3136243
children	parent
the aim is that checking a child would also check the parent and unchecking a parent would also uncheck all children

3136286
bitwise-or	bitwise-and
you can use bitwise-or | to set individual bits and bitwise-and to clear them

3136300
submit	submission
when you click the icon to display more contacts you employ jquery to submit a get request to that web service page it really should be get since you re retrieving data not submission new data

3136308
jlist	jtable
i know a lot of people can be wary of including yet another jar file but to be honest no matter how simple the jtable or jlist or jcombobox i always utilise the glazedlists library

3136308
sorting	filtering
the great thing with using this library is it s seriously easy to add sorting and filtering to the table

3136326
versioning	upgrade
i am trying to upgrade to a newer versioning of aspectjrt than the one that comes with eclipse

3136326
maven	pom.xml
i updated the version number in maven pom.xml

3136408
onresume	onpause
so probably keep track of the current active activity or a flag that the activity is visible in onresume onpause or onstart onstop depending on exactly what behavior you want

3136408
onresume	onpause
if you re using a service you could bind to the service in every activity in the onstart onstop or onresume onpause

3136420
getter	setter
from my understanding using attr_accessor is used to create getter and setter methods for that variable so that we can access the variable like object.variable or

3136466
solaris	minix
ran your code as y2 minix code as y1 solaris 9 v245 got this profiler data

3136485
getter	setter
attr_accessor is a ruby method that makes a getter and a setter

3136489
onresume	onpause
onresume called onpause not called visible

3136489
onresume	onpause
in your application subclass that will be updated by your activities set to the instance in onresume and null ed in onpause

3136500
getter	setter
attr_accessor is a ruby method that gives you setter and getter methods to an instance variable of the same name

3136574
gif	png

3136589
folder	directory
the virtual directory folder have iis_iusrs group added to it

3136601
int	chars
so the only possiblity for a chars code to be larger than int_max is if int is a 16 bit type or specifically less than 22 bits

3136601
int	chars
if that would be the case then you simply can not store a chars code in an int

3136601
int	chars
if int is a 32 bit type or at least 22 bits then a chars code will not overflow when cast to an int

3136621

3136645
jquery	scriptaculous
lift s javascript can sit on top of jquery and yui and could sit on top of prototype scriptaculous as well. the actual polling code includes back-off on connection failures and other graceful ways of dealing with transient connection failures

3136656
vbscript	vba
this thread is about vbscript but it is very similar to vba

3136677
rss	feed
your best bet may be to contact imdb and ask for a recently updated rss feed to be added

3136691
hide	show
i don t mind the player taking up space on the page i just want to hide it so the user can t interact with it until i m prepared to show a video the player happens to require a video to load immediately but i don t have one until the user selects one from another ui element

3136771
rss	feed
this way you also save the time of xml parsing the rss feed

3136776
uilabel	nsstring
it depends on whats in the url for you to be able to display it technically you can just convert the data to an nsstring and then hook it up to an iboutlet uilabel in a xib

3136789
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i am able to build the shared library on os x but i am not familiar with how to create a plugin bundle that firefox google-chrome safari can use

3136803
getter	setter
you can achieve that by implementing getter and setter in the delegate class

3136803
getter	setter
so the variable you to assess is set in the currentlink string by setter method and class where you want the string just use the getter method

3136806
minimum	max	min	max
we ll call min your target minimum and max your target max

3136822
addition	multiplication
if you manipulate numbers particularly with addition and multiplication you ll have noticed the usefulness of 0 and 1

post	get
try decorating your jsonresult method with the acceptverbs attribute creating a separate one method for get and another for post

3136852
qcombobox	qstandarditemmodel
you don t store a qcombobox in a qstandarditemmodel

3136864
jar	war
you can see it by the exploded folder of the old war being almost empty expect of one or more jar files in web-inf lib

dxcore	coderush
the dxcore free framework on which coderush and coderush xpress are built makes this very easy

3136879
int	double
in addition to the primitives that work with the add operator int byte double and so on user defined types could overload it and so on

3136893
qbytearray	qtextstream	qtextstream	qdatastream	qdatastream	qbytearray	qstring	qdatastream	qstring	qtextstream	qstring	qbytearray
better use qbytearray instead of qstring and qdatastream instead of qtextstream or for better error handling write directly to the socket

3136898
post	get
i have tried via post and get method and it doesn t seem to work

3136936
google-chrome	firefox
note tested on firefox 3+ ie 5.5+ google-chrome

3136987
width	text-align
btw if you don t make your anchor tags display block you re not going to get rules like width and padding and text-align etc

3136991
pop-up	dialog
the problem is that the dialog box that pop-up gives an option of e-mail or messaging the text

3136997
children	parent
that is the items with no children have their layout function called first then their parent and so on

3137037
put	get
if you don t put in your src folder the files won t get exported

3137066
width	height
i was setting the view which goes inside scroll view to flex the height and width using the autoresizing mask

3137087
touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesmoved	touchesended
is there a way to get the coordinates off all touches currently on the display at any given time without having to keep track of all of the touchesbegan touchesmoved and touchesended

3137120
width	height
the problem is that width and height are not powers of two

3137160
pull	push
having a remote repo is redundant on one machine since you can technically pull and push from

3137192
postgresql	mysql
as you can see valido f is hard coded but i will need to use mysql in the future i run this query using the execute method how can i create the correct query for each adapter mysql sqlite postgresql etc.. for creating the sql view

3137223
outputstream	inputstream
how to pass socket inputstream outputstream objects between activities

3137283
profiling	instrumentation
in .net i have access to the profiling api which i have used to instrumentation an assembly to extract information about when classes are constructed methods called etc

3137305
google-chrome	firefox
the site works perfectly fine for firefox ie and google-chrome

3137316
free	malloc
use normal malloc and free

3137339
width	height
i know the width and height i need the two divs to be but i don t know what absolute position they should be if i read correctly we need to specify absolute positioning for divs using z-index

3137363
for-loop	loops
given that your for-loop appears to be using a loops body dependent on ordering it s most likely not a candidate for parallelization

3137372
post	get
if i have a custom post type named my_type how can i get wordpress to make date-based archives for example

3137377
onclick	onkeyup
currently i have a key event function for onkeyup events in the document which enables navigation then i have tried assigning the popup close function to onclick onkeyup and onkeypress but regardless of which i try pressing enter always ends up reaching the main key event function after the popup closes

3137378
hide	show
depending on the user s choice you can hide or show the

3137442
folder	dir
having a special folder in the assets res dir

3137496
wordpress	phpbb
i have looked at phpbb wordpress and other apps to see if they specified foreign keys or not to ensure referential integrity

3137514
pop-up	dialog
if you are using the window.open type of pop-up then i would say make it a little simpler and bring it into your page as a jqueryui dialog box that pulls in your external html file are the content loading it in the div and accessible within the general page context inheriting the jquery and css as well

3137514
pop-up	dialog
where #id is the div that is hidden and will contain your dialog data and url is the external url to the html file in your pop-up

3137521
next	except
using a genexp rather than the listcomp syntactically round parentheses instead of the listcomp s square brackets it s the next that actually does most of the work advancing i and doubling it instead of lumping all work at construction time -- this takes up less temporary memory and may save time if the loop body s reasonably likely to break out early but except in such special conditions very tight memory or likely early loop termination a listcomp may typically be by a wee little bit faster

3137522
innodb	myisam
myisam years ago myisam was considered the fast storage engine and innodb was considered the storage engine you d reluctantly have to use if you couldn t do without transactions

3137522
innodb	myisam
but innodb has improved dramatically in the past few years and in most cases today innodb performs faster than myisam

3137522
innodb	myisam
when i need fulltext indexing i either maintain a myisam table as a mirror of my primary storage in innodb or else i use apache solr

3137585
getter	setter
it sounds like you want to synthesize create getter setter methods a property for a member variable

3137611
allocator	stl
use dynamic allocator or the stl

3137616
getter	setter
the synthesize line creates getter setter methods for the ivar

3137625
gif	png
gif jpeg and png are more complex - the data is compressed

3137631
gitignore	hgignore
you can add the .svn folders and the artifacts to the hgignore or the gitignore files to keep the repository clean and then when you get back you can just do an svn commit of the changes or if you want to get fancy do a staged commit back to subversion for every significant unit of work you checked into mercurial git while you were on the road

3137653
opera	firefox
adding a more compact version works in ie6 firefox opera chromium

3137658
post	get
while no longer really an issue in the later builds of php get post cookies used to have quotes automatically escaped.

3137673
getter	setter
the nice thing is you can synthesize your properties and the setter getter methods will be built for you depending on your property options of course but you can write your own instead and they will be used

3137673
getter	setter
in the case where you are providing your own setter getter you can alternatively use the dynamic propertyname line instead of synthesize to tell the compiler these are being provided by you

3137677
cgpoint	cgrect
the uiview class has a handful of methods for converting coordinates of cgpoint or cgrect from one view to another

3137697
hide	show
is there a way to have many many instances of jquery-based show hide toggle link followed by container with hidden content

3137736
getter	setter
the dot notation is just shorthand for calling the getter or setter method

3137742
lisp	smalltalk
i understand that some languages such as smalltalk and lisp are incredibly flexible but i m not looking for something that can be done fairly simple by one team but something which is an attempt to bring this to the whole language and allow it as common practice

3137746
firefox	safari	webkit	gecko
it embed either mozilla firefox gecko apple safari webkit or internet explorer

3137768
getter	setter
first accesses a.b which calls the b property s getter not its setter

3137793
hide	show
i currently have a menu within a div called mnugrp and would like to add the following functionality onto my web page that will the allow the user to either hide the menu menu off or show the menu menu on

3137828
hide	show
as for the jquery jquery isn t my native library but i believe jquery uses a similar syntax to the following to show or hide something on click

3137840
powerpc	i386
i don t care about powerpc obviously since i m on 10.6 but i want to have both i386 and x86_64 because some things need to be done in 32-bit

3137877
mouse	keyboard
the only other main difference is that most phones these days use a touch interface rather than a traditional keyboard mouse

3137972
firefox	safari
the same revision works fine on safari and firefox

3138063
ingres	postgresql	ingres	mysql	postgresql	mysql
three dark horses that perhaps bear checking out are mysql postgresql and ingres

3138063
postgresql	mysql
however a google search for mysql psm suggests that mysql 5.x and postgresql 8.2 support a form of psm close to the standard

3138136
direct3d	directx
go to the directx applet in the control panel and look under the direct3d tab

3138136
direct3d	directx
whilst in the directx control panel applet increase the debug output level for direct3d to maximum

3138139
getter	setter
if you have an atomic property and then override the getter or setter you lose the atomicity unless you implement it yourself

3138139
getter	setter
so it is generally safe to override synthesized getter and setter but there are caveats and it is very important that you understand what they are so that if when things break you know why

3138141
free	malloc
while it s possible for there to be multiple heaps in a single address space glibc is implemented in such a way that there is only one standard heap by standard heap i mean the one you access via malloc free

3138150
rss	feed
note that the qsystemtrayicon class will raise exceptions if it doesn t have an icon â â i grabbed the rss feed svg from wiki commons for my icon.svg but you can give qicon a png directly and not mess around with qtsvg

3138186
rss	feed
i have a problem for parsing a rss feed using c#

3138186
rss	feed
here s a rss feed that contains this tag

3138199
getter	setter
create getter setter in each controller class and use your -servlet.xml to inject the required beans via the tag

3138215
rss	feed
i m adding rss feed in out publish website which is related to advocate

3138217
factors	mean
by which i mean that there are so many unmentioned factors that it s impossible to unequivocally state that one will be faster than the other every time

3138250
hex	binary
to expand on moron s answer what the bailey-borwein-plouffe formula does for you is that it lets you compute binary or equivalently hex digits of pi without computing all of the digits before it

3138251
rss	feed
if you are using database driven website you can manipulate a dynamic rss feed from your db

3138251
rss	feed
assuming you are using php you can find the instruction on this link to create dynmic rss feed

3138261
children	parent
i need to be able to select 5 random children based on parent and date excluding some children records

3138295
debian	linux
he sent me his servers apt.list and package selection debian linux

3138296
filtering	grouping
if you want to search filtering sort or grouping by a certain attribute the index structures and optimizations of a dbs are appropriate

3138296
filtering	grouping
however when using a db for storing large files blobs which contain unstructured data in the sense that you are not going to search filtering sort or grouping by any part of the files then these files just blow up the database size and make it slow

3138349
folder	directory
then the mywebsite part of that url is the virtual directory and iis knows exactly how to handle that because it is mapped directly to a folder on the file system

3138398
tolower	toupper
obviously modify the length if you want to allow more characters the example below requires a tolower toupper as it uses 26

3138402
inherited	properties
naturally all of this is also possible to do by creating a mycombobox custom control inherited from combobox with an added unselectedpromptproperty as a dependency properties

3138402
hide	show
then the logic to show or hide the unselectedpromptproperty would come from the validation callback on the dp

3138403
flex	osmf
according to here it s a combination of the new fms3.5 adaptive bitrate streaming flex 4 and osmf

3138475
x86	64bit
if you are using the 64bit distribution of galileo you need a 64bit distribution of jre not a 32bit installed in c program files x86

3138486
typedef	struct
typedef struct

3138486
typedef	struct
here you are using a typedef struct without defining this and then you are using edgenode in your struct defination before defining edgenode

3138486
typedef	struct
typedef struct _edgenode

3138491
int	chars
of course this assume that contains chars otherwise it s useless to capitalise it and to escape it with mysql_real_escape_string just cast it to int

3138508
children	parent
and i think it would be preferable to set the views widths based on the parent view s width as opposed to the screen s width but i m not clear on how to do that either because at the time that i m trying to set up the widths of my children views parentview.getwidth returns 0

3138531
websphere	ibm
i try to use the ibm websphere and the ant tasks to install update an application ear on a remote server

3138533
yslow	pagespeed
all the pagespeed optimisation tools eg yslow pagespeed etc recommend reducing the number of requests to speed up page load times

3138543
icefaces	openfaces	richfaces	icefaces	richfaces	openfaces
all three of icefaces openfaces and richfaces also have ajax-enabled components but with jsf 2.0 it is now possible to add ajax to your apps without using third-party libraries

3138545
folder	directory
edit i installed cygwin and added the cygwin usr include folder in the search directory

3138550
prepare	execute
prepare the kit with having all these scripts in folders ideally categorized as procedures tables functions bootstraps and then have a batch files that could execute these scripts in the kit in a particular order using osql command line utility

3138585
mouse	keyboard
i will have no keyboard or mouse so i need to create a button link that do one thing when the user clicks on this link and that is to simualte the esc key being pressed

3138623
free	malloc
when using malloc always remember to use free after you are finished with using the struct stat

3138676
equals	gethashcode
make sure your gethashcode implementation is consistent with your equals - the enumerable.union method does appear to use both

3138698
setinterval	settimeout
to clarify the question is to halt the script execution completely for a certain amount of time not to delay the execution of some piece of code which wouild be a task for settimeout or setinterval

3138698
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout and setinterval do not halt the script execution like some people here seem top think

3138709
versioning	upgrade
you can t reference a .net 4.0 assembly from 2.0 you would need to upgrade as well or hope that the vendor continues to maintain the 2.0 versioning as well

3138721
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
you could use nscalendar and nsdatecomponents

3138751
width	height
and then after we do measurestring we can find the height of the string which can be placed withing that rectangle of specified width

3138793
google-chrome	firefox
there is a strange behavior in google-chrome firefox and internet explorer using those operaters

3138811
super	extends
yes super and extends gives inclusive lower and upper bounds respectively

3138819
hash	md5
one solution to this is to use some hash finction like md5 sha1 or even crc32 to get a raw binary value from your strings and to use this value as the primary key for your tables

3138843
calloc	malloc
using malloc or calloc you can allocate memory and your structure will be initialized

3138846
google-chrome	firefox
tested and working locally in firefox 3.6.3 and google-chrome linux - 6.0.408.1 dev

3138853
floating-point	integer
integer arithmetic in floating-point is exact so decimal representation errors can be avoided by scaling

3139048
subclass	abstract-class
i m not sure i fully understand your question - is the generic type of the subclass even when it s being expressed in the abstract-class

3139054
folder	directory
the apache use that runs your django application does not have the permission to create the folder file in your media directory

3139085
public	protected
however with moq the methods would have to be public or protected and virtual

3139090
width	height
using css or width height attributes an img element can be resized within the browser

3139100
width	height
if dock and anchor are no good then just set the width and height properties

3139100
width	height
by creating a default size object and assigning that to your control you are basically assigning width and height to 0

3139247
ant	maven
i know the highly customizable java and .net tools like pmd findbugs and checkstyle which generate xml or html statistic reports and also integrate very well with build tools ant maven hudosn - but for delphi nothing comparable has crossed my road so far

3139273
firefox	safari
the problem is occurs in common cases in mozilla firefox sometimes on ghrome and safari and never in ie

3139273
filesystems	ntfs
underlying ntfs filesystems supports

3139273
filesystems	ntfs
need to map to the ntfs filesystems

3139304
versioning	upgrade
recently i upgrade xcode to the latest versioning

3139308
strlen	strcpy
cstring is c s string.h header which defines functions like strlen strcpy etc

3139312
serializable	deserialization
what i would like to do is before serializable to tell that only the id is serializable and after on deserialization to get back the id and reconstruct the item more easily

3139371
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
after each stage is working fine in firefox i load up google-chrome safari and opera which 9 times out of 10 render just fine

3139393
post	get
please see this post programmatically add bundle products in magento using the sku id of simple items to get a starting point of how to proceed

3139395
width	height
event metadata is called after file s meta information is loaded thus width and height

3139429
jdom	dom4j
conversion from xml to dom is done by a xml parser common helper libraries are jdom or dom4j

3139429
jdom	dom4j
jdom and dom4j both contain such a writer

3139430
getter	setter
one trick i ve found useful is to create a package with stateful variables in the package body and simple setter and getter functions

3139432
min	max
otherwise your options is to store data differently and maintain a list of min max numbers associated with a table

3139446
maven	pom.xml
remove this and let the maven pom.xml file reference to the preferred version

3139659
keydown	keyup
take a look through the code for addeventlistener keypress some_method true or keyup or keydown and it will be the some_method that s handling the event

3139739
int	double
you might expect numeric conversions between say int and double but you d have to code these yourself .net doesn t treat them as typecasts

3139754
jruby	rubinius
you should try an alternative ruby implementation like jruby or rubinius

3139771
range	max
i can never remember which is the best temp table mechanism for sql server sorry - it may be better to go with a table variable and may need to add indexes + keys either way. you can then select max totalallocated from that for a given date range

3139829
put	get
hello i am having table view and in that table view i have put text field on each cell now how to get the data from the cell data is in the textfield

3139842
jobs	cron
i need to stop the overlapping of cron jobs for example if a cron job is scheduled at morning 2 o clock for db backup and other cron job is scheduled at morning 7 o clock for db backup again.so i need to stop the 7 o clock scheduled cron job if the db backup for 2 o clock is not completed

3139889
put	get
one way to get around it would be to put your select inside it s own sub and then you can exit it with exit sub exit function

3139952
pull	push
it is doable with a central repo with access push pull managed by gitolite

3140027
put	get
i fully understand the reasoning behind this and i put in the numeric_limits check to see if i could get the compiler to shut up about it it worked for msvc

3140054
hide	show
i am trying to hide one of the vboxes based on a certain condition but the tabbar still show the corressponding tab for the hidden vbox

3140084
installation	downgrade
i tried to downgrade ios to 4.0 8a274b however wen installation is complete it says os expired error msg and just shows connecting itunes icon

3140157
squash	branch
in git i would create another branch and squash all changesets outside of the index then i would add the specific files to the index and commit

3140269
rtsp	sdp
turns out that sdp data is only transmitted when using rtsp

3140269
rtp	sdp
when streaming rtp i had to provide the sdp file myself

3140269
rtsp	sdp
use wireshark to record the sdp file transmitted over rtsp

3140272
pop-up	dialog
every time i access the website it pop-up a dialog asking for user name and password

3140321
freebsd	linux
incidentally .communicate at least in python s 2.5 and 2.6 standard libraries will only handle about 64k of remote data on linux and freebsd

3140332
public	protected
there s no such thing as public private and protected once your code is compiled so it cannot affect performance

3140335
width	height
i think you can use a normal 2 dimensional array to represent the whole board inner board with the border and you can know the type of each cell if it in the inner board or in the border using its position the border cells have x value 0 or width -1 and y value 0 or height -1

3140353
xmltype	clob
incidentally if you are storing xml text it might be worthwhile using the xmltype datatype for the column instead of clob

3140369
mockito	easymock
easymock so you can get the idea easymock didn t have nicemock before mockito came along

3140378
accessor	properties
as regards your public void setsomethingforthecell ... instead i would provide an accessor properties for the cell elements

3140396
email	dkim
i have a script that is sending email via smtp and i m trying to get it to sign email with a dkim signature using cpan s mail dkim signer

3140477
width	height
as spliff already mentioned the problem is because the default w3c box model is content-box which results in borders being outside of the width and height

3140477
width	height
but you want those to be within the 100 width and height you specified

3140477
width	height
the only workaround for this is to use css expressions within a conditional comment to explicitly set the width and height of the wrapper to the viewport s sizes minus the width of the border

3140501
punctuation	words
words selection provides correct interpretation of punctuation marks within and following words

3140501

3140685
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
d oh adding it in viewdidappear or better viewwillappear did the trick

3140695
realloc	malloc
so realloc would be defeated by the malloc method but to say how much you should do tests and i think there s a bias on how the system is when the memory requests are done

3140695
realloc	malloc
depending on how many times you expect the realloc malloc have to be performed it could be an useful idea or an unuseful one

3140707
serializable	deserialization
you can use remoting for communication but if you are concerned with performance then you can use sockets and google s protobuf for message contraction and serializable deserialization

3140724
getter	setter
try reorganized your code to use getter and setter your internal structure is a mess and it will only get messier with time

3140750
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
however it occurs to me that you could use an associative arrays and reduce the nested for loops to a single for-loop

3140770
innodb	myisam
i mean the existing table uses myisam and the new one uses innodb

3140897
restrict	shared
i would reccomend shared ssh method you set up separate user account for repository management add developer s ssh public keys you should restrict them to be used only with mercurial with specific repositories and then use ssh hguser server path to repository as an url

3140897
pull	push
btw by default mercurial doesn t run any hooks if a user used to do push pull is not in trusted list

3140948
put	get
i d like to get something via ajax and put it into

3140975
pellet	protege
a couple of hours later i used protege s pellet plugin to create and export an inferred model

3140986
equals	gethashcode
btw note that when you override equals you should also override and implement gethashcode

3141013
onmouseover	onclick
since in your code you are using loadit this in onclick event you don t need to use document.getelementbyid because element is already referenced with this keyword also you may want to use the onmouseover event instead of click event if you want to something to happen when element is hovered like

websphere	ibm
ibm websphere application server 7 logging level details

3141095
ceil	sqrt
if these precomputations are inconclusive then i can t think of anything other than everyone else s solution a ceil sqrt a 2 b

3141095
ceil	sqrt
it is faster in principle to compute ceil sqrt a than sqrt a because the floating point arithmetic can be simplified to integer arithmetic and because you don t need as many newton s method steps to nail down high precision that you re just going to throw away

3141095
ceil	sqrt
if for whatever reason you don t have that microcode to help you then it might be worth it to hand-code ceil sqrt a

3141121
m2e	pom.xml
m2e can do that for you by deriving the settings from the pom.xml

3141123
iboutlet	ibaction
both iboutlet and ibaction are used by only interface builder to find outlets and actions

3141190
hash	salt
since your passwords should be salt and hash before they are persisted that s definately out of the scope of what a user should be doing

3141190
hash	salt
then you could have a module separate of the user for authenticating the password using the same salt and hash method

i don t want the iis or cassini web server as a requirement on the client side

3141284
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome leads over firefox in my tests but it can still take 5-8 seconds for the browser to render 300 records

3141284
google-chrome	firefox
one thing i have noticed is that both firefox and google-chrome do not render anything until they loop over all items in the json array even though i explicitly insert the newly created elements into dom after every loop as soon as i have the html

3141292
pull	push
i know that i can do this via sql cache dependency but i want to use a push rather than a pull kind of notification

3141297
integer	unsigned
so likely the most natural thing is to avoid strange casting and permit a cpu like comparison which in this case lead to 0xffffffff -1 on 32 bit compared to 0xffffffff 0 on 32bit which are the same and more in genereal one can be considered as maxuint the maximum unsigned integer that can be hold and the other as -1

3141384
terminate	timeout
this script terminate only thanks to the timeout 1 line without it it simply hangs and will terminate only by user interaction c

3141426
sentencecase	uppercase
i m looking for a function to convert a string of text that is in uppercase to sentencecase

3141442
terminate	timeout
can t terminate any way except timeout or eof

3141467
toupper	uppercase
i would start by first converting the entire string to lower case and then as a first approximation you could use regex to find all sequences like and use toupper to convert the captured group to uppercase

3141479
button	checkbox
when a user clicks a specific button i want a customized prompt box to appear containing several fields a textfield a password field and a checkbox field

dictionary	map
that still leaves the switch itself of course - and this can be replaced by a static map in a dictionary say from portfoliosheetmapping to a func taking a holding and returning the sort key

3141489
hide	show
i want to make sure alt-tab hide show the popup win-d hide popup switching between windows in the same application should do nothing restoring maximizing from taskbar should show popup

some good ones are ogre3d irrlicht and openscenegraph

3141611
namedtuple	dictionary
on the other hand if soup.findall returns one of a certain set of data types dictionary or list of dictionary namedtuple or list of namedtuple then you ll actually be better off because you won t have to do any conversion in the first place

3141622
jsf	seam
we re developing a java web app that utilizes jsf richfaces through seam for its ui

3141664
children	parent
the way i understand the problem is you want all rows in t1 the parent that have no children

3141706
implements	extends
my bean impelements serializable because serializabledatamodel which i extends implements serializable

3141719
post	get
a slew of errors flew up from the timed post s in ajax because they were getting unexpected responses and the get s were coming back instantaneously cached but nothing else appeared in firebug as if ajaxerror were never being called

3141738
stdout	stderr
i d like to have the stdout of a command replicated to stderr as well under bash

3141800
post	put
lastly i m not sure what s involved in this so i don t know what tags to put for this post

3141811
put	get
the reason i set the max buffer is if your producer is much faster than the consumer you may end up consuming a lot of memory as more and more objects get put in to the collection

3141866
listadapter	viewswitcher
the closest thing besides listview listadapter naturally that i can think of offhand is viewswitcher and viewswitcher.viewfactory but there s really nothing magical there it s an interface that you can call to get a view

3141920
put	get	post	put	post	get
from my personal point of view i d want to have a larger-than-average controller containing each of the 4 actions get post put delete and a bit of logic in each action rather than one action ruled by zend_rest_server

3141932
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
however i want to make my extension cross-browser compatible and the way to interact with localstorage is different across the browsers google-chrome firefox safari

3141941
children	parent
now if addto and removefrom is always properly used i can get a parent s children via parent.children

3141941
children	parent
then i have to use child.findallbyparent parent to get all children

3141998
super	implements
while this is a pretty crude approach it is super easy to implements pretty fault tolerant and you can easily split the .queue files between a set of servers and have them work in parallel

3142012
dictionary	map
so i would like to map to game slot because in the dictionary it has value 0

3142013
touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesmoved	touchesended
the way i ve done it in the past is to keep a list of coordinates add to that in touchesbegan update those based on the the closest touch in proximity to the points in that list in touchesmoved and remove based on the nearest proximity in touchesended and cancelled

3142033
facebook	fbconnect
i can use fbconnect and have them authenticate with facebook for every session whenever they want to post data

3142046
width	height
the tilecont div is repeated and tiled along the entire page and the table inside occupies the entire width and height of that div

3142065
vb6	vba
the vb6 and vba editing environment forces you to build class files and keep each class in a separate file which are distinct from modules

3142065
vb6	vba
the vb6 vba paradigm envisions classes as a way to encapsulate an object s functionality and properties

3142065
vb6	vba
in this sense vb6 vba s objects exist just like any other basic oop environment and their use and design should be encouraged where appropriate

3142065
vb6	vba
however the lack of several key oop features cause vb6 vba to fall short in being able to thoroughly implement a complete oop design pattern

3142080
sproutcore	qooxdoo
being a newbie i am intrigued by frameworks like qooxdoo and sproutcore but don t understand exactly how they work

3142096
equals	gethashcode
this would also make the implementation cleaner as actual comparision logic now stays in gethashcode and equals which you may have already overloaded

3142096
equals	gethashcode
don t forget to overload gethashcode and equals methods on your object

3142109
gmail	hotmail
import address book from gmail hotmail yahoo using c# and asp.net

3142199
allocator	stl
it should be more optimal as most modern oss thanks to c++ s stl are already well optimized for flood of small memory allocator

3142199
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
keep in mind the multi-threading too malloc realloc free generally are already optimized and mt-ready

3142203
getter	setter
by definition - a java bean is exactly that a serializable pojo plain old java object with a no-argument constructor and private fields with getter setter

3142231
textview	imageview
the background of the linearlayout covers the content imageview and textview

3142322
pop-up	dialog
most of the time this works fine but occasionally some sort of error will occurr bad signal etc. and despite calling the function with internet_autodial_force_unattended windows still appears to pop-up dialog when it fails to connect

3142332
sqldmo	smo
here s a pure ado.net solution if you are having difficulty installing smo sqldmo on the target machine it s a pain in the behind best avoided if you can

3142365
free	malloc
this avoids the use of malloc and free issue

3142373
oncreate	recreate
then you use oncreate bundle to get everything out of that persisted bundle and recreate your state

3142382
screens	tablet
my development environment uses dual-17 monitors which are far bigger than the tablet screens size of 10.4 1024x768

3142424
getter	setter
some problems with your setter 1 don t call the getter self.currentevent when releasing the ivar 2 always retain the new obj before releasing the old obj in case it is the same obj ie

3142432
stdout	stderr
most o s use them for stdout stderr etc and while there are usual assignments eg stdout is usually 5 i think and stderr 6 these are not defined in the fortran standard and compiler-writers are free to use unit numbers as they see fit

3142438
screens	tablet
set one of your screens to the tablet resolution

3142494
post	get
a post probably shouldn t return anything other than a possible redirect to a get that returns the resource just posted

3142494
put	get	post	put	post	get
post put delete are actions not queries you don t get data with them other than what they may include to point you at some new resource via response headers

3142557
manual	rcs
perforce manual says that if you want to automatically expand rcs keywords in file contents you have to specify some type for them +k or +ko

3142607
codeigniter	kohana
codeigniter s got a slew of modules but all i can find for kohana codeigniter s fork is

3142646
children	parent
by clearing floats i mean make a parent element enclose all floating children contained within

3142679
post	get
edit when i get around to finishing up code for this project i ll post the layout i ve done here for everyone s future reference

3142685
pull	push
1 pull from a after there are updates push it to b

3142685
pull	push
2 pull from a merge it with my local files then push it to b merging with the repo on b

3142699
children	parent
an alternative to adding a clearing tag is to set an overflow style on the parent element of the floats that will make it contin it s children

3142699
children	parent
you can for example use overflow hidden but without specifying a size that way the parent will be sized by it s children

3142703
hide	show
i only want to show the control groups for the modules that are actually connected and hide the rest

3142713
prepare	execute
unless db2 is some sort of weird alien sql database or if it s driver does some crazy things then the database server will never see your prepare statement until you actually execute it

3142726
mouseleave	mouseenter
you can use the jquery hover function to hook up handlers for the mouseenter and mouseleave events of the images which jquery will happily simulate on browsers that don t support them

3142726
mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout
mouseenter and mouseleave ie innovations that still aren t supported natively by many browsers but which jquery provides if missing are a lot less difficult to work with for this sort of thing than mouseover and mouseout since mouseover and mouseout bubble

3142786
children	parent
in your second example the cascading is set to all on the children side and none on the parent side

3142786
children	parent
if you delete the parent all the children will automatically be deleted

3142786
children	parent
and when you save the parent all the children will be updated

3142786
children	parent
how are you most likely going to access the data if you expect to need to retrieve a set of children for a parent having a parent.getchildren method is pretty convenient

3142814
titlebar	window
i wanted to have a completely different style of window minimize the content area and showing only the titlebar no system buttons etc so i created a wpf application for this

3142867
integer	unsigned
i have a unsigned 32-bit integer lets use the value 28

3142874
getter	setter
even more oop-like with setter getter

3142885
persistent	transient
this way the session thinks that the skill contained in p.skills is persistent and not transient

3142909
button	checkbox
useful in radio button and checkbox especially

3142946
base-class	subclassing
if given the possible problems you still want to take this route then making the lockable object protected rather than private will allow you to include subclassing operations inside the same base-class lock

3142962
hide	show
now i can easily set a generic ajax indicator to show and hide when the jquery is making an async call using

3142962
hide	show
and i can set some functions to show and hide the same indicator by passing values into the constructor of the ajax.actionlink constructor and setting onbegin and oncomplete but this means that i have to do this everytime i add a new ajax.actionlink to the site

3143041
grizzly	netty
grizzly and netty

3143178
pecl	pear
the call replaces the previous path with whatever you re passing as an argument so if any of your code loads other libraries ie pear pecl modules they ll no longer be accessible as you ve trashed the include path

3143194
openfire	ejabberd
you can use smack to connect to the server of your choice that supports pubsub openfire ejabberd ... so your application that creates the events is the publisher and the clients are all subscribers

3143236
bash	zsh
here s an example of process substitution which will work in zsh and bash

3143241
hide	show
so i would just use the standard jsf way to hide show components

3143268
hide	show
i would like to show hide a set of columns o a button click

3143268
hide	show
iterate through table s thead th and change class to show hide the th and td

3143268
hide	show
show hide say 20 columns takes about 5 10 seconds on maybe 80 120 rows of data

3143313
hide	show
to implement i would add logic into your global ajax options to show hide the dialog as needed

3143361
sproutcore	qooxdoo
frameworks like qooxdoo and sproutcore are designed to facilitate the creation of rias

3143368
accessor	properties
edit a slight mis-understanding of the question...i took properties to mean normal accessor functions

3143375
getter	setter
unless you add reflection to the mix being able to identify at runtime what properties exist on an object properties are nothing more than syntactic sugar for getter and setter

3143375
getter	setter
might as well just use getter and setter in that case

3143378
hide	show
very similar to yours except i used jquery toggle show hide

3143378
hide	show
it seems to show hide column of 400 rows under 1second.

3143390
pop-up	dialog
also if your pop-up is extremely complex you could also create a whole new activity but give it the themedialog theme - that way it will still look like a dialog on top of your previous activity and you can give it an additional style to dim or blur the background

3143410
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that the report is compressed to about 100px by 100px in firefox and probably other browsers such as safari and google-chrome

3143424
post	get
usually when i get post data it s send from a html form and the parameters has names from then i can receive and print this data with php

3143440
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png
png bmp gif jpeg all give me the same result

3143485
squash	merge
it ll do fine squash but then when it tries to recreate the merge the conflicts will happen again

3143490
hide	show
consider removing the table from dom tree via .remove do the bulk show hide operation and insert it back in

3143527
post	get
when i post it to production the redirect doesn t happen and i get the iis 404 error

3143537
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
you are getting the benefits of ienumerable inotifypropertychanged and inotifycollectionchanged

3143551
dictionary	map
a table in lua is just an untyped map like javascript objects or python dictionary

3143571
implements	extends
public class secondactivity extends activity implements viewfactory

3143579
ubuntu	linux
i have a request to install a linux server preferably ubuntu 64bit server

3143581
post	get
you get that exception since your local post office is trying to find the queue nsqueue and it obviously doesn t know about that

3143613
int	chars	int	double
all cpu expect that the built in data types like int float chars double are stored in the memory at their natural boundary at address of their length.so structure padding is done to faster access of data from memory

3143641
integer	unsigned
i have jquery.ajax creating a request to a url cms2 docman dir id id is a numeric unsigned integer

3143646
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
all is ok in firefox opera safari google-chrome and ie8 but in ie7 when i m over the div ul don t display

3143659
bindparam	bindvalue	prepare	bindvalue	prepare	bindparam
if you prepare a statement and use bindparam or bindvalue to supply variables you do not need to escape the variables

3143661
put	get
if i put an element just to test i get the yellow border between the purple blocks not around them

3143662
post	get
not entirely - you ll have problems using the back button on pages that are submitted using post but not get

3143698
google-chrome	firefox
i am running an ajax call in my mootools script this works fine in firefox but in google-chrome i am getting a uncaught syntaxerror unexpected token error i cannot determine why

3143715
post	get
if i understand correctly you are trying to do an http post or get to www.hello2.com logout.jsp while processing http request to your web application s logout.jsp

3143720
google-chrome	firefox
the majority of the time is spent re-rendering and time spent within the javascript function gives me on average 200-300 ms on google-chrome and 0 ms on firefox

3143747
move	drag
i initiate the startdrag event but here it will not drag the entire move clip for some reason it only drag the different pieces inside the clip

3143748
getter	setter
i agree with others - just use getter and setter

3143786
min	max
if you don t care at all about which record you get back from table 2 when a matching sub doesn t exist you could combine two different queries one that matches the sub and one that just takes the min or max division with a union

3143836
cat	tee
the problem here is that tee will get stuck trying to write things to cat which wants to finish with wcout first

3143836
cat	tee
there s simply too much data for the pipe from tee to cat

3143882
bazaar	git
if you want the history to be shared between git and bazaar consider using a third-party bi-directional bridge between git and bazaar

3143886
jms	jta
j2ee contains multiple sub specs such as servlets ejb jta jms and a whole host of other alphabet soup technologies

3143900
min	max
if you change min to max top will be insted of bottom on the second row

3143978
google-chrome	firefox
i know ie has some very strange bugs depending on the version - ie rotated images display good in firefox and google-chrome but unrotated in ie gave up on it

3143978
fadein	hide	hide	show
besides that you could try to use show slow and hide slow without the fadein and -out

3144000
hide	show
on clicking the show or hide button we iterate over the titles array calling toggleheadvisibility

3144000
hide	show
in that function we get the index of the first element with the given title and then show or hide the nth-child x nodes

3144013
post	get
user the post redirect get model

3144034
addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication
that last equation can be computed relatively quickly although the second part of it is a bit tricky to get right because division doesn t distribute over mod the same way addition and multiplication do

3144051
mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout
if you would use mouseenter mouseleave instead of mouseover mouseout

3144099
sorting	filtering
read the section from the swing tutorial on how to use tables in particular the part on sorting and filtering for an example

3144107
sys.path	distribute
remember that when you distribute your project to other users they typically install it in such a manner that the python code files will be automatically detected by python s importer packages are usually installed in the site-packages directory so if you mess with sys.path in your code that may be unnecessary and might even have adverse effects when that code runs on another computer

3144123
folder	directory
if the user selects a directory it scans the whole folder for mp3 files and returns them

3144152
subclass	accessor
i ve tried to overwrite the accessor for -selectedbackgroundview in a custom uitableviewcell subclass

3144187
rel	attr
i changed the code to have the width put into the image as rel width and used attr rel and its all good now

3144228
firefox	safari
this works in safari but not on firefox or any windows browsers

3144230
post	get
to get the data i need passed along with the file i am adding post params to swfupload

3144246
jax-ws	jax-rs
for client to server communications you could use a jax-ws soap web services or jax-rs restful services implementation

3144246
jax-ws	jax-rs
all of these are based on various standards that make up javaee servlet 2.5 jax-ws 2.0 jax-rs 1.1 and jpa 2.0

3144252
put	get
i try to create bigger table and put the three drop down lists in one column and put in another column to get the side by side layout but it does not work

3144260
screens	tablet
then set your form to maximize itself on the tablet pc or if screens size is 1280x1024 - the anchor property has its limitations as to what size increase looks reasonable

3144292
portrait	landscape
i have been searching for over a few hours now to find out how to implement the rotation from portrait to landscape for my uitableview inside my uiviewcontroller

3144318
hash	md5
md5 and the sha family are hash functions which are the more appropriate ones to use

3144318
hash	salt
for best results the standard is to salt and hash a password to store it - google these terms in tandem and you ll find numerous references

3144320
post	get
i wan t to write a script to get the source of a website which requires a post login

3144327
hash	md5
md5 message-digest algorithm 5 is a cryptographic hash function while advanced encryption standard aes is a symmetric-key encryption algorithm so they are used for different purposes

3144327
hash	md5
a hash like md5 or sha is used to verify passwords because it s hard to invert that is to obtain the password from the hash-string

3144342
getter	setter
of course my backing bean has a setter getter for branchtype and i can see that branchtype is indeed being set when the select is changed

3144351
post	get
get post for list

3144351
post	get
get post new to

qpainter	qimage
the fault points at libqtgui.so so something in qpainter or qimage

3144366
post	get
starting with shell programming curl can do a post to get you the source of a web page

3144382
pylons	turbogears	django	turbogears
compare the very active django tag on stack overflow with that of pylons or turbogears though and i d argue getting started is simply easier with django irrespective of anything to do with code

3144382
rvm	bundler
think about using ruby without gem bundler or rvm and you ll be in the right direction

3144394
google-chrome	firefox
while in the deployed iis google-chrome and firefox work just fine

3144402
instances	transient
i do not want to save the transient instances

3144408
ironruby	ironpython
while this could end up being more trouble than it is worth it is probably possible to leverage the java or .net platform and still run your django application in jython or ironpython with some minor adjustments i m sure and also be able to leverage ruby s haml gem via jruby or ironruby

3144417
pthreads	fork
mingw programs are therefore real windows programs with no concept of unix-style paths or pthreads niceties such as a fork call

3144427
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv .

3144442
width	height
you can also check for the boundary rectangle size since youtube plays at certain height x width windows

3144476
ssl	https
i would like to make some selected pages as ssl https

3144503
vim	gedit	vim	emacs	emacs	gedit
if you edit files manually with vim emacs or gedit instead edit the files with perl sed and awk or just crush the files by curl ing the modified version from a local webserver or copied from scp

3144564
put	get
the closest way i can think of to fake it would be to put the terminal in silent mode so that input characters are not echoed and unbuffered mode so that you get each character typed as it s typed without waiting for the end of the line then read each input character one by one

3144580
hide	show
depending on how different your layouts are you might be able to come up with a single layout and then show or hide elements of it in getview depending on the row

3144598
ubuntu	linux
os linux ubuntu 10.04 64bit server edition

3144617
int	double
int to double is a widening conversion

3144619
prepare	execute
on other platforms argv is prepare by execute before your program is even loaded

3144650
put	get
put this in a script tag after your markup is loaded right before the close of the body tag and you ll get a similar effect to the jquery example

3144669
width	height
for example if the operation is to perform some validation you may have a nullvalidationstrategy which does nothing and a paranoidvalidationstrategy which makes sure every mcguffin is the correct height width and specific shade of blue

3144679
inherited	properties
set this class as the datacontext of the window bind the content of mylabel to labelcontent and the command properties of mybutton to changecontentcommand the user control will inherited the data context

3144681
listview	gridview
and you need to tell him that his default view is gridview built in view type of listview

3144684
cfstring	nsstring
a look in debugger says that the problem is the nsstring debugger says variable is not cfstring

3144691
put	get	post	put	post	get
instead of putting the sensitive information in the url via get use the post method and put them in the body

3144723
autocomplete	autosuggest
for setting the key value pair in the autosuggest dropdown u can use the autocomplete function with a server page which can load data

3144760
salt	md5
all 8-character passwords encrypted with md5 or sha1 even when properly salt can be cracked by this dude in a single day

3144779
setinterval	settimeout
no but you can have your own settimeout setinterval for animation in your function

3144809
google-chrome	firefox
update for some reason that belongs to another tag changing the javascript method encodeuricomponent to encodeuri makes everything work as intended at least in firefox and google-chrome

3144821
google-chrome	firefox
again i get back an object from the server fine but it either prompts me to download firefox or simply shows the object in a new tab in the browser google-chrome

3144852
post	get
i have been reading this post to help me get going on my caching and am running into a problem

3144861
actionscript	mxml
another way around this is to extend textinput using actionscript rather than mxml

3144877
salt	md5
hashing with sha md5 or any other algorithm solves the problem of key protection because you don t need to keep any secret value other than salt but salt is significantly less sensitive than encryption key

3144899
post	get
for some reason whenever i do an async request using yui and specify it to be a get or post and the request is https the actual request comes through with the options request method

3144906
profiling	benchmarking
the best way would be to run some benchmarking tests to test individual functions or profiling to test an entire application program

3144918
equals	compareto
it s not clear to me what you want but i ll mention that the date class also has a compareto method which can be used to determine with one call if two date objects are equals or if they aren t equals which occurs sooner

3145008
addition	multiplication
the c++ version already has a lot of optimizations like pre-caching and pre-calculating the values of each color and storing the pre-calculated values in trees reducing distances between data in memory doing operations with bit operators rather than addition and multiplication when applicable but still the performance was not satisfying

3145030
int	chars
i want to convert an int into its chars equivalent based on the alphabet

3145082
mouse	keyboard
there are cases when one needs to start a process based on some events not involving activity of the mouse of keyboard from hardware or time-based

3145102
width	height
with only a minor change to make that run defining width and height it works for me

3145214
vsto	add-in
i have written an add-in and it is just like the com add-in since it is not a vsto application

3145214
onenote	ms-office
ms-office onenote 2007

3145240
post	get
your method is get which won t give you what you re after if you re looking for the values in the post collection which does

3145240
post	get
for a good discussion of get vs post take a look here

3145244
perl	tcl
of course they kind of suck at that compared to bash or perl python tcl

3145253
folder	directory
you could easily spend hours doing the above task if you had a deep root directory that is one containing thousands of folder

3145296
put	get
here s a sample script i put together that should get you what you want

int	double
my problem now arises because i am no longer limited to just double anything coming out of the sql database is fair game int varchar etc... and that i am no longer calling just 2 columns of data it can be however many the user specifies

3145330
google-chrome	firefox
the way google-chrome and firefox display textareas is a fair bit different

3145363
typeerror	attributeerror
then doing pretty much anything will cause attributeerror or typeerror

3145372
explode	implode
simplest way is to explode split the string shift the top and pop the last then implode what s left with you re separator and concatenate the three

3145378
objectdatasource	formview
working with .net 2.0 i have a formview with fields bound to an objectdatasource ods

3145387
getter	setter
if your getter is performing any logic so that it is returning something other than what hibernate sent to the setter then it will be marked dirty

3145427
codeigniter	yii
it s kind of like the codeigniter gets out of your way when it needs to and yii gets in your way and if you don t do it its way it breaks

3145427
codeigniter	yii
codeigniter gets out of your way but does it too much yii helps a lot but is butting in too much at times and it forces you to sift through its documentation so that you discover these functions without which you are not able to accomplish a task that would take four time less in codeigniter or in a non framework app

3145446
codeigniter	kohana
you could try kohana especially coming from codeigniter

3145449
public	protected
field must be declarated as public protected in the parent class or declarated in the descedent class and in yours dostuff method you must write not the

3145452
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
i assume that has something to do with the way wsdl.exe and svcutil.exe work behind the scenes but regardless i m stuck on trying to figure out how to correctly get visual studio to recognize that this property should be a datetime

3145559
int	boolean
so for a large sparse list i d use a sorted int array instead of a lightly populated boolean array

3145575
getter	setter
i overheard two of my colleagues arguing about whether or not to create a new data model class which only contains one string field and a setter and a getter for it

3145582
inherited	properties
create inherited attached properties for ismouseleftbuttondown and for the other buttons too

3145582
inherited	properties
from there these properties are inherited down through the logical and visual tree

3145594
getter	setter
even if the getter and setter are trivial now a type makes sense if there is a real chance they could do something later

3145630
int	chars
that s why you re getting the warning you re trying to use a chars int as a pointer

3145639
button	checkbox
any change made to a model object except a data refresh from the database is considered editing whether it be done with a button checkbox etc

3145639
inherited	properties
whenever this properties changed if it is non-null and not the current view model set an inherited locked properties causing the view to lock

3145640
int	chars
and int has 4 or 8 bytes depending on the platform and each chars in a string is one byte or more depending on encoding

3145708
client-side	server-side
i have client-side and server-side validation so i want the same error message shown by both

3145717
getter	setter
add a class declaration a getter a setter now call those from everywhere that touches it and you ve added size to your code without an actual non-hypothetical purpose

3145763
versioning	upgrade
the code is currently written in asp.net 1.1 style no master pages but i can upgrade to any versioning of .net

3145768
outputstream	inputstream
when i use binary transfer mode which is not supposed to do anything but shuffle bytes from an inputstream into an outputstream the result is that the newlines 0x0a are converted to carriage return + newline pairs 0x0d0a

3145768
hex	binary
here s the hex after binary transfer

3145772
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
assuming your window subclassing don t override defaultstylekey you can simply add it to your window style since textelement.fontfamilyproperty is an inherited properties

3145818
post	put
note that the request s inputstream property does contain the expected data and obviously i can build my own key value collection using that however i would have expected put to work the same way as a post

3145824
filtering	grouping
furthermore you can filtering the buffer list by many criteria again use c-h m to see its help page and then generate a grouping definition from the current filtering and save your custom filtering and grouping for future usage

3145824
filtering	grouping
g web development ret create a named grouping from the active filtering

3145824
filtering	grouping
this way you can have a single emacs instance running and create filtering and grouping for different types of task and easily switch between them

3145831
postgresql	mysql
this would be everything from plain text files on the local filesystem to embedded systems like sqlite any standard sql server mysql postgresql oracle sql server whatever to various nosql databases mongo couch redis whatever

3145835
submit	submission
i just went to submit my first app involving iads and in the beginning of the app submission process there is a new button to enable iads

3145867
hash	salt
5 so obviously i can hash the passwords with a one way salt hash

3145867
hash	salt
substr hash sha256 salt

3145879
wordpress	joomla
update i am proficient in html css joomla wordpress

3145912
hash	salt
passwords with a one way salt hash

3145912
hash	salt
passwords must always use a salt hash and sha-256 is a great algorithm

3145912
hash	salt
the salt should be a cryptographic nonce as in a very random value that is only used 1 per hash

3145978
min	max
i ve tried using getsize and then setting the min and max height of the window using setsizehints but for some reason it always allows the window to be resized just a little and it looks rather tacky

3145978
min	max
the only other alternative i have come up with is to hard-code the min and max height but i don t think that would be such a good idea.

3145983
getter	setter
a new data model class which only contains one string field and a setter and a getter for it

3146018
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
this was done so that as the data was selected and moved about the application ui updates would be refreshed using inotifypropertychanged and inotifycollectionchanged

3146022
screens	tablet
c as for screens size i m doing this with android tablet in mind

3146089
hide	show
i plan on making it hide and show with jquery so it really shouldn t break the flow of any text inside i just want it to appear on top of everything else

3146110
arp	tcp
one-shot uploads would be too skewed by arp dns lookups socket buffering tcp slow start etc

3146124
width	height
its default is manual but if you set it to one of the other values width height or widthandheight you may see a better presentation

3146139
mouseleave	mouseenter
edit as noted by nick craver .hover is a convenient alternative to mouseenter and mouseleave since it accepts two functions representing both events

3146146
profiling	debugging
the biggest problem that i m having is that in the targets properties i go to build select debugging or distribution and when i want to select the profiling for code signing for the target xcode doesn t show me anything

3146146
profiling	debugging
just shows me my iphone developer name for debugging and distribution but it doesn t show me the installed profiling

3146164
pop-up	dialog
note the third example which positions the pop-up dialog to be aligned with an element on the page

3146195
put	get
once i get the array i create a new array with capacity n+1 and copy all the elements to the new array and put the new element as the last element of the array

3146197
children	parent
you could obtain a similar effect in 2.6 and later with a class decorator but then all classes needing the functionality both parent and children ones would have to be explicitly decorated -- here they just need to have the same metaclass which may be less intrusive thanks to the module-global __metaclass__ setting idiom and the fact that metaclasses differently from class-decorations also get inherited

3146235
width	height
the circle might require width and height to match that s an invariant the class wants to maintain yet anyone can simply get a base pointer ellipse pointing to a circle object and violate that rule

3146268
mp3	flac
edit one of the reasons that i started with ffmpeg is that it can handle many file types notably mp3 aac flac

3146281
hide	show
simply use to hide them when rendering and jquery show hide will work with your server-side generated hidden elements

3146283
hide	show
the show and hide methods operate on the css display property

3146285
folder	directory
the tool takes a file path finds the revision of parent url a few levels up then exports a bunch of files and folder at that revision into a new directory

3146329
post	get
not sure how to get the post request to work

3146335
getter	setter
there s no other way to do it besides this for automatic properties since the fields for the automatic props are declared at compile time and replaced within getter setter

3146347
maven	pom.xml
so every time i add a dependency to a library using maven in my pom.xml it doesn t get deployed until i go to module settings and then click on fix

3146355
hash	salt
if each client has a key like a simple password that the server knows the key can be used as salt with a hash function to sign requests responses

3146358
children	parent
you could then have helper methods on the parent to query for children through the parentalrelationship object

3146383
hide	show
it helps organize things better than using one view with a whole bunch of subviews that you hide show and will also improve loading times and general performance

3146383
getter	setter
make sure you synthesize whichever objects you create in the app delegate s .h file in the app delegate s .m file so the getter and setter are created so you can access them

3146390
google-chrome	firefox
everything works fine in google-chrome and firefox but in ie8 the numbers show up in the middle of my rows right next to the last div tag that doesn t have a float left

3146396
post	get
i currently check every get and post variable with isset and throw exceptions when isset returns false

3146407
width	height
the child div was then set to some arbitrary width and a height equal to the height in px of the scrollpane s content

3146494
width	font-size
the last step is to use a piece of javascript to detect the width of the viewport and set the font-size of the body accordingly

3146557
put	get
so new users won t get the .mypackagerc files unless you put it in etc skel also which is overdoing it in my opinion

3146610
nsxmlparser	nsurl
and according to nsxmlparser documentation initwithcontentsofurl accepts any fully qualified url with scheme supported by nsurl and file is supported scheme

3146618
google-chrome	firefox
when the above code is viewed by a browser the user was prompted to download a json file the javascript was not executed on modern versions of google-chrome firefox and internet explorer

3146628
int	chars
now as you see i just wanted to display the int value like an ascii chars such as int a but something like will be displayed as

3146629
bmp	png	bmp	tga	png	tga
to that end it is good if you still have all your asset s source hopefully still having your max or maya model files and tga bmp png texture source files

3146677
width	height
since grid is a dynamic layout it will be stretch to the window s width height

3146677
width	height
to restrict you window size you need to mention height width properties to the window

3146695
postgresql	mysql
in both mysql and postgresql you can write

3146703
calloc	malloc
casting the results of malloc calloc etc

3146740
versioning	upgrade
i believe this is the only solution if your o s such as redhat 5.8 upgrade you to a firefox versioning that uses xulrunner-2 but does not provide webkitgtk

3146756
ssl	https
ssl https

3146777
google-chrome	firefox
to test that you re doing it correctly i d probably use firebug on firefox or dev tools on google-chrome

3146804
post	put
i want to put facebook twitter flickr into my iphone app so that users can easily login in and post message from my app easily

3146804
put	get
put the question here is to get some clues or existing works for this purpose

3146824
post	get
also try setting the post type to get

3146837
queue	fifo
if so then a simple fifo queue for each servive will surely do the job

3146858
curb	libcurl
i am trying to install the curb gem which is libcurl bindings for ruby and of course i need to have a working lib libcurl installation with development stuff installed on my computer

3146868

here s a snip that successfully reads off to eclipse logcat the height and width of the .png on the sd card

3146900
ccscene	cclayer
i ve made 2 empty ccscene 1 2 and added cclayer 1 2 onto their respective scene

3146900
retaincount	dealloc
can anyone probably tell me what i ve done wrong or is it just my misunderstanding that retaincount needs to be 0 before dealloc is called

3146914
width	height
for different results specify a sizetocontent parameter on the window as paxdiablo pointed out or explicitly set the size of your window with the minheight maxheight height minwidth maxwidth and or width properties

3146975
ubuntu	linux
i am using gnu linux ubuntu + gnome

3146991
google-chrome	firefox
this seems to work for me google-chrome firefox 3.6

3147031
ubuntu	linux
friends who ve used it on various linux builds admittedly mostly ubuntu also seems to have the same gui as i do - at least from what i can discern from looking over their shoulders p

3147034
spannable	charsequence
it s important to know the difference between a string and a charsequence and spannable - strings do not have html support and if you grab a string from the resources through context.getstring it will automatically strip out all html code

3147035
folder	directory
select installation folder directory

3147060
width	height
make the tag display block and give it a width and height so that the button fully consists of the element

3147067
.htaccess	httpd.conf
php_ini_perdir the following settings can be set in php.ini .htaccess or httpd.conf

3147067
post	get
this sets the maximum time in seconds a script is allowed to parse input data like post get and file uploads

3147067
.htaccess	httpd.conf
php_ini_all the following settings can be set in php.ini .htaccess httpd.conf or with ini_set

3147075
folder	directory
an alternative that is probably more applicable if you ve got multiple settings as you have suggested create a file in the after ftplugin directory of your vim configuration folder see below called txt.vim and it will be sourced whenever you open a .txt file

3147079
pull	push
however that approach is a pull from sql not a push from excel if you want to do that you d have to code some vba to do it for you

3147081
int	double
nothing bad will happen when you cast an int to a double

3147081
int	double
casting an int to double is a widening primitive conversion

3147113
width	height
assuming you have no css rules attached to a.link that would impart width height in the absence of content simply setting display none

3147162
maven	pom.xml
hi actually i am trying to create maven project in netbeans but when i am going to build it fails and give message as error building pom.xml may not be this project s pom.xml so i need help on it..

3147165
int	chars
a java letter is a chars for which the method character.isjavaidentifierstart int returns true

3147166

every subclassing of baseentity will inherited equals and hashcode behaviour form baseentity

3147175
button	checkbox
also upon clicking the remove button how can i set the checkbox of the respective row on the right to its previous state checked

3147193
versioning	upgrade
note i upgrade whenever gem to 0.5.0 versioning to be able to use job_type

3147220
qtcore	qtgui
i added library frameworks qtcore and qtgui to the c++ path and symbols tab on the preferences dialog but for some reason although it can find the class names it refuses to autocomplete the class methods and member attributes

3147225
downcasting	upcasting
static_cast is the rest of it - value conversions int - float etc upcasting of object pointers references and unchecked downcasting

3147241
amend	undo
it says you can amend the commit with git commit --amend but we actually want to do a reset to the commit before head and undo it entirely

3147278
post	get
my situation is that i d like a java servlet or a listener to run at regular intervals on an apache tomcat server to make http get post requests to the google chart api and store the resulting images in the file system or application database

3147314
nsscanner	nsstring
i ve looked through nsstring nsstream nsscanner nsfilemanager nshandle but still have no idea how to do it

3147381
stateless	stateful
you also seem to be mixing principles of stateful and stateless functional design which is bound to get you into trouble

3147438
inline	inlining
as an aside check this out for what optimisations that gcc actually has including a great many containing the text inline or inlining

3147452
put	get
you may need to put a in the div to get around some browser bugs

3147479
loops	if-statement
the code is just a statement similar to a method call and thus occurs in the natural execution stream at the point you placed it be it inside a loops if-statement or similar

3147490
ati	nvidia
my understanding is that right now gl is not well-supported by all the main companies nvidia ati intel which is a big issue

3147512
maven	pom.xml
it does seem to make sense since the for the parent maven project is pom.xml

3147517
hide	show
i could show the properties div by binding an event with the abc div but i want to hide the properties div when the div abc loses its focus

3147519
try-catch	exception-handling
i d put some messageboxes or logging in your app or put in a try-catch around the start routine and have it show the exception-handling and prompt the user for input in order to continue

3147553
width	height
it still interacts with it width height js but as for rendering .

3147569
width	height
fillrectangle brush 0 0 1 1 draws a single dot at 0 0 which is somehow understandable it s a rectangle with width and height one after all

3147569
width	height
the same behaviour is shown for other width height combinations drawrectangle always extends one pixel more to the left and the bottom which is a little annoying when using the clientrectangle property to draw a frame around a control

3147581
nsmutablestring	nsstring
granted for an nsstring -copy is probably implemented as doing a retain and returning self but if you pass it an nsmutablestring a genuine copy will occur

3147611
post	get
if you intercept the submit event of your form maybe by intercepting the click event on the formâ s submit button then you certainly can get or post with anything including content of an element

3147648
inherited	properties
i think the copy method should be inherited by derived classes d1 d2 and their responsibility to copy their own properties to from other types

3147661
min	max
some of these textboxes need to have their min max properties set dynamically when the values of other fields are changed

3147745
public	protected
there ll be no functional difference between the constructor being public or being protected but making it protected gives a clearer indication of the intended use

3147804
google-chrome	safari
however at the time of writing safari 4 and google-chrome 5 are still vulnerable to this

3147820
switching	screens
in particular this means that when a full screens app is up and running it is covering the dwm composed image and the user needs to switching to a dwm-managed window for the dwm to start drawing on top of the full-screen app

3147842
hide	show
i m using the focusin focusout events to either show or hide the text

3147842
hide	show
but if one clicks in an area of the input box where there is no text it does show hide correctly

3147859
ati	nvidia
ati and nvidia do provide very good implementations so it s not that much of a problem

3147877
width	text-align
you can use text-align right instead of float right with your current widths inner div with more than the outer div width

3147883
onclick	onsubmit
regardless you can save yourself the trouble altogether by simply adopting a stronger strategy implement the validation as an onsubmit action on the form rather than an onclick action for the button

3147939
portrait	landscape
i have a case where a portrait only mode view needs to be pushed into a navigation controller which has a landscape mode view as its current view

3147951
public	protected
in an abstract class there s no difference between a public or protected constructor

3147970
getter	setter
as for the backing bean the paginatedjoblist is just a list of jobs onjobselectionchange changes job the backing bean thinks is selected so that the detail div s contain the correct data when rerendered and joblistselection is just a getter setter for a simpleselection

3147986
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
you need to show the uiviewcontroller or uinavigationcontroller code both the .h and .m where you are setting up the uisearchdisplaycontroller

3147997
put	get
i need such type of function where i just put method name i get the complete information of that function

3148035
width	height
if the line images are really easy to detect say you can find the line from ten yards away just scale the image from width height to 1 height and find the y-coordinate of the darkest pixel

3148080
inherited	properties
you could make your models all inherited a new model that has a properties function defined to get set the right variable

3148168
memcached	apc
for some benchmarks see cache performance comparison file memcached query cache apc

3148192
super	abstract
of course i could provide sum a a in class be and check if b is an instanceof b before calling either sum b or super but i thought that instanceof was to be avoided for efficiency reasons if it is inefficient it may be even less efficient as my abstract implementation

3148197
google-chrome	safari
if you are using keypress then that simply won t get called for the tab key in ie safari or google-chrome

3148235
restrict	shared
if you are on a shared host they can restrict you not to reach other than your content so absolute paths can cause troubles

3148270
centos	linux
we are running an asp.net web site v3.5 of the framework on 2 windows 2008 web servers and use forms authentication.they are load balanced using a separate server running apache 2.2 on linux centos 5

3148295
a-star	dijkstra
it is very likely that they use either a a-star or dijkstra s algorithm

3148331
mouse	keyboard
synergy+ for example can generate fake keyboard and mouse events on connected pcs and the consequence of the faked input is windows switching activation normally

3148386
rss	feed
i have some code that gets a wordpress rss feed and displays the news articles on my own website

3148398
implements	extends
extends class implements interface override method helpers

3148512
datamapper	activerecord
maybe i should use a datamapper pattern to further separate responsibilities but in this still quite simple scenario i thought i d get away with activerecord

3148546
google-chrome	firefox
this is running well in firefox but problem happeninig with ie and google-chrome

3148562
inherited	properties
the only possibilty is to inherited arrayobject in your own class to get this done but i think you want to set different properties at runntime.

3148602
int	chars
# now you are using a chars for numeric options which you could have avoided by defining your choice variable as int

3148653
jdom	dom4j
google is your friend fire it up to learn about dom4j and jdom

3148674
inherited	properties
i know i could just do multiple inherited for vehicles and buildings or a simply use an instance thereof as a properties of foo bar but i wonder if there s a correct way to do it this way

3148696
getter	setter
it s kinda annoying that the premier ide for zend framework generates getter and setter that are not in compliance with the zf code convention

3148696
getter	setter
when you generate getter setter they will not include the the leading underscore indicating private or protected visibility

3148700
width	height
the css width and height then incorrectly covers the padding and border

3148745
getter	setter
a simple workaround name your var labelname then generate getter and setter and finally refactor rename the var so it becomes _labelname

3148781
hide	show
with jquery i hide the second select then when the first select changes jquery looks at the selection and show the second select with only the relevant items in it

3148781
google-chrome	firefox
update i have used a slightly modified version of paolo bergantino s solution that works for sure on google-chrome and firefox yet to finish testing all browsers

3148803
post	get
for the get post to be successful the origin and the target fully qualified domain names must be exactly the same to comply with same origin security policies

3148803
firefox	safari
modern web browsers such as safari and firefox have implementations of the w3c cross origin resource sharing draft policy so you will see the options preflight communication when it fails - probably with some sort of security or network related javascript error

3148803
post	get
if the options preflight is successful the original get post can occur

3148838
rel	alt
i would feed the name and desc into the anchor as part of the anchor or it s child image perhaps using the alt tag for the name and rel tag for the description

3148928
google-chrome	firefox
this question seems to provide a solution dynamically change embedded video src in ie google-chrome works in firefox

3148941
stdout	stderr
in user space you could compile a modified glibc which logs out stdout stderr output to some file along with the process and thread id for example

3148961

client side performance take the advise from tools like yslow or pagespeed

3148995

i m trying to figure out how to read the meta-inf manifest.mf file form a java jar file in perl

3149200

there are no problem at iphone code when controller is pushed to navigation controller but on ipad viewwillappear is not called viewdidload is called however while i have a reason to perform some customization right in viewwillappear

3149213
sorting	grouping
i ve read hints here grouping rows with client side html table sorting

3149227
nhibernate	llblgenpro
even the linq implementations between linq to sql and entity framework v4 vary greatly if you then look at nhibernate s or llblgenpro s implementations you will find there are queries that are possible in sql that each doesn t support in the same way if at all or that the support with different levels of efficiency

3149260
implements	extends
implements webviewclient and extends onpagefinished as follows

3149268

that way at design time i can drag and drop the child controls to move them or resize them

3149692
octal	decimal	octal	hex	octal	binary	hex	binary

assuming that is actually what you re wanting i believe you need only to set your response to one of the vcard mime types text x-vcard or text directory

3149789
uiview	subviews	post	get
i had complete success and unity with how these uipickerview views look and behave in apple apps by animating a uiview with your uipickerview as a subviews yourself - this blog post helped me get started

3149879
min	max
you don t even have to group by price if you use an aggregate do display it min or max for example

3149890
min	max
you simply can t assure that kvo sets the properties in the proper order that being first setting the min and max limits and then the other values

3149890
min	max
if i now create such a model with the values min 0.00 max 42.00 left 14.00 right 28.00 i end up with the following setup in the custom control min 0.00 max 42.00 left 1.00 right 1.00

3149921
portrait	landscape
- a landscape view controller that is used when the first itel of the tabbar is switch from portrait to landscape

3149921

a part of this works fine i mean the switch from portrait to landscape is ok when i am in the first tab the tabbarcontroller is remove from the superview and the landscape view is added as a subview instead

3149948
mouseup	mousedown
if you create events for mousedown and mouseup you should have the two corner points you need for a rectangle

3149980
min	max
you could do max min or average i guess

3149980
min	max
i don t recommend aggregating price though especially max and min since it will likely lead to confusion down the line when people try to use the value

3150041
interpreted-language	compiled-language
for example sometimes people talk about interpreted-language or compiled-language

3150041
jython	pypy
but even if you interpret the statement this way it isn t true jython is implemented in java ironpython is implemented in c# pypy is implemented in rpython and python pynie is implemented in pge nqp and pir

3150041
ironruby	rubinius	jruby	rubinius	interpreted-language	smalltalk
oh and all of those implementations have compilers so there goes your python is an interpreted-language . similar with ruby rubinius is implemented in ruby and c++ jruby and xruby are implemented in java ironruby and ruby.net are implemented in c# hotruby is implemented in ecmascript red sun is implemented in actionscript rubygolightly is implemented in go cardinal is implemented in pge nqp and pir smallruby is implemented in smalltalk x maglev is implemented in gemstone smalltalk and ruby yari is implemented in io

and for c++ clang which is the c c++ and objective-c front-end for llvm is implemented in c++ all three front-ends are implemented in c++

3150047
gridview	sqldatasource
they ve simplified it to the point where you can drag and drop the necessary controls gridview and a sqldatasource for instance and define your datasource in a wizard for most simple table crud functionality

3150062
put	get
it s possible that the isdone flag read in the while test has been optimised out the compiler knows that it isn t going to change so it doesn t put in any code to get it from memory again - it just tests the same cpu register. you can overcome this by using the volatile modifier to tell the compiler it must re-get the value from memory

3150080
super	abstract
note also that i declared super as abstract - this is almost always good practice to follow with base classes

3150100
sorting	filtering
if set this view will use an ajax mechanism for paging table sorting and exposed filtering

3150116
pop-up	dialog
now if the problem occurs the modal assert dialog pop-up

google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
and no my solution doesn t work in ie google-chrome opera or firefox

3150187
.htaccess	httpd.conf
a .htaccess or modifying your httpd.conf with options -multiviews should do the trick

3150203
put	get
http put comes to mind but i d be making it hard on my clients by requiring a complete xml matching the http get response to modify the resource

3150219

post	get
send the base-64-encoded xml as one request parameter and the base-64-encoded signature as the other either using get or post

3150319
zlib	libpng
it s not gpl but zlib libpng licensed which seems a very free license

3150334
inherited	subclassing
if you add two subclassing for emitted and received bills and use multi table inherited then you can use one foreign key from billentry to bill

3150344
fileinputstream	filechannel
i am getting the inputstream as response from remote server which i am unable to convert to fileinputstream to get filechannel

3150348
children	parent
then if the parent changes again check the parent property of the control firing the event and loop up the parent chain in case it is in a container with in your custom control - if you don t find yourself throw a snide error message like i am a jealous control who does not like my children to be moved out of my supervision

i just need to know how to show hide that whole thing in the c# code behind...cannot seem to get the visibility of the wrapper label to go away

3150513
post	get
i made an authentication using get and post methods

3150597
inherited	subclassing
we prefer composition over inherited because when we add particularly or change functionality by subclassing we couple that new functionality to the class - so anywhere we need the new functionality we need that class

3150638
ocamllex	ocamlyacc
maybe i m just failing in a really simple thing but i m developing an intepreter written in ocaml with standard tools as ocamllex and ocamlyacc and i have this situation

3150672
post	get
update so let s say this is not being entered in the browser but being generated programmatically and being requested with a post request not a get request

3150672
submit	submission
however it is secure to submit as a post request to submission a form while passing the credentials as part of the post body since the post body is encrypted and sent after making a connection to the requested url

3150672
ssl	https
straightforward explanation of ssl and https

3150682
persistent	transient
hmm - if an attribute is marked as transient that means exactly that it s not mean to be considered part of the object s persistent state for serialization

3150683
getter	setter
the reasons i ve heard mainly crop up due to when you write your own setter getter

3150687
postgresql	mysql
you can get the sql for your specific database mysql postgresql etc. by compiling with your engine

3150689
nfa	dfa
the nfa is then transformed to a dfa to make state transitions deterministic

3150692
viewdidload	viewwillappear
in other words i set self.contentsizeforviewinpopover in - viewdidload and set popovercontroller.popovercontentsize in - viewwillappear

3150693
folder	directory
you could save them in the temp folder you can use path.gettemppath to get it or create a folder for them specifically outside of your web app virtual directory and save the files there

3150712
post	put
if it s at all possible use post over https on authentication and then set a authenticated cookie or use http digest authorization over https or even http basic auth over https - but whatever you do don t put secret sensitive data in the url

3150744
setinterval	settimeout
one way is to execute a setinterval right after you add the settimeout to the stack

3150772
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
don t forget that uitabbarcontroller is a uiviewcontroller as well

3150795
appfuse	spring

integer	unsigned
64-bit unsigned integer describe the

3150844
integer	unsigned
bytes 64-bit unsigned integer

3150851
implements	extends
it would allow you to create and inject objects into your code by a friendly name without worrying about their precise type as long as they implements a certain interface or extends a certain base class

3150873
client-side	server-side
everything is being done client-side so the performance is purely down to javascript and jquery code and nothing to do with any server-side code such as asp.net mvc

3150882
button	checkbox
consider a simple .net form with a couple of radio button and a checkbox

3150882
button	checkbox
each of the radio button has a checkedchanged handler setup that performs some action based on the state of the checkbox

3150882
button	checkbox
my problem is when i initialize on the default radiobutton to be checked from the designer properties window the checkedchanged event is fired for that radio button but the checkbox hasn t been initialized yet so i either get a null pointer exception or the wrong value is used in the handler

3150884
post	put
you can check out the full project well an older build which at time of writing has yet to see this new oo method put in the whole way through up at - just check out my latest post

3150906
subclass	accessor
the main reason why is because a subclass might override your accessor and do something different

3150906
subclass	accessor
the subclass s accessor might assume a fully initialised object that all the code in the subclass s init method has run

3150906
subclass	accessor
similarly the subclass s accessor may depend on the subclass s dealloc method not having run

3150934
width	height
in your custom skin you can draw the background however you want including an ellipse set to the width and height of the titlewindow

3150953

3150956
disk	ram
i have written a small wpf widget using c# that displays the current cpu activity ram used and disk activity as three small percentage type bars

3150956
disk	ram
the problem is that although i have discovered how to get the total available ram to calculate a used percentage from i cannot find out how to read the disk s theoretical maximum data transfer rate

3150958
inherited	properties
2. make a custom control that inherited from radgrid but instead of defaulting the casesensitive properties to false

3150987
hash	md5
since v2.5 wordpress has used phpass over md5 for storing hash passwords in the db

3150987
hash	md5
however i think you can still reset your password in mysql with a standard md5 hash

3151057
collabnet	svn
we have also installed the collabnet svn server that is working over http

3151072
children	parent
that way each parent control can call dispose on all of its children without first having to test cast each one

3151072
public	protected
any properly-written object that implements idisposable and has state data that is actually cleaned up during the dispose process should throw an objectdisposedexception if any of its public protected internal properties or methods are accessed after it has been disposed

3151073
dbf	dbase
it works correctly when the file doesn t have a space in it but i get the following error error opening dbf file error 42000 microsoft odbc dbase driver syntax error in from clause if the file path or name has a space in it

3151093
public	protected
if your account is not protected you can use the public timeline like

under linux ubuntu and i ve run into some problems

3151293
paradox	dbase
microsoft support you receive an error message when importing dbase foxpro or paradox file

3151355
inherited	properties
i think you would be better off to get rid of the inherited and either have both classes implement an interface or map the common properties as a component

3151366
serializable	deserialization
i tried to go with serializable deserialization route it worked to some degrees but the copy is not exactly the same as the original one

3151480
serializable	deserialization
serializable and deserialization will only work if all the objects referenced by the object being cloned are serializable

3151492
hide	show
note that there could be many tabs loading at the same time and not all loading tabs are visible a new tab can be background loaded without leaving the current tab so just having one shared div which i show hide on top of everything else doesn t work

3151545
jquery	scriptaculous	extjs	mootools	codeigniter	cakephp
i would take a look into the different frameworks that are exiting for php zendframework codeigniter cakephp symfony and a lot more and javascript jquery prototype + scriptaculous extjs mootools and a lot more

post	get
also if userid on the aspnet_users table isn t a uniqueidentifier you will get the error you describe in your post

3151644
width	height
the rectangle in both of the graphics methods in your question is bounded by x y in the upper left and x + width - 1 y + height - 1 in the lower right

3151644
width	height
this is a consequence of specifying width and height rather than the lower right point

3151644
width	height
when you re calculating the width and height from two points you have remember to include the origin pixel by adding 1 to the difference

3151710
google-chrome	firefox
canvas has some other issues however i d have to implement my own redraw method which i m sure will not be as efficient as svg one that takes advantage of browser-specific frameworks in google-chrome and firefox

3151783
post	get
so i guess the best way is to send by get post xml json or the protocol of your choice and on the server find out the values and execute the api

3151793
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this code works in firefox and ie6 opera google-chrome requires a web server and both files coming from same domain protocol and port

3151834
erlang	lisp
this is the position taken by erlang lisp clojure and every other functional programming language

3151845
width	height
that ll will make sure it s always the full width of it s container and the height will automatically match the right aspect ratio

3151879
fast-forward	merge
all the merging that the git pull command do will end up as what are know as fast-forward merge

3151887
automapper	structuremap
this worked for me but when i recently added automapper and structuremap to the exclusions array it also caused automapper.dll and structuremap.dll to of course also be excluded from the bin folder

3151983
put	get
remember that eq is 0 indexed so you would actually put n-1 to get the nth element above

i have written more about validating on client-side here and server-side here

3152117

svg	vml
btw your example assumes that you use only svg or vml renderers

3152155

i experienced a very similar issue i get my files from a server however and saw your post and thought it was a dead end and then just by chance started to experiment on the device ipad in this instance and it worked when i gave the baseurl as what i used to get it from the server and it worked but does not work on the simulator

3152330
pow	math.h
i am trying to make a simple call to the pow function from math.h someihing similar to

the example you gave works on firefox but not on google-chrome safari or ie

3152694
tapestry	wicket
the competitors struts2 spring mvc wicket tapestry etc..etc

3152756
verilog	vhdl
the verification guild forum deals with hardware design verification with verilog vhdl systemverilog

spaces	linefeed
spaces linefeed one or more time case insensitive and captured

3152850

int	chars
so if you send it a to an array of chars 8 bits or 1 byte each and an int is 32 bits 4 bytes long on your system then it will just take the first four chars of the chars array and convert the resulting 32 bit number into an int

3153241
udp	tcp
pps you could try using a udp socket instead of a tcp socket

3153488
keydown	keyup
then use keydown keyup instead of keypress i believe in glut its something like keyboardupfunc and keyboardfunc but cant remember now

3153488
keydown	keyup
on keydown set the appropriate variable to true on keyup set it to false

3153492

children	parent
now i need to return only first 5 parent comments and all of the children that belong to them

3153540
cpu	processors
some build processes take quite a while and the amount of time depends strongly on the speed of your cpu and how much processors time can be devoted to the build

3153549
jobs	cron
we have several different scripts written in php running on a set schedule cron that queries something we talk to local db s various different web services and application api s even scrub an email address and use that information to do things such as db updates and mail jobs

kerberos	ldap
specifically the secure sealing flags instruct the ldap provider to use only kerberos to securely negotiate auth

3153564
put	get
so if all you need is on the order of get from amqp queuea put to wmq queueb and transactionality is not important you should have a an easy time of it

3153597
pop-up	dialog
now create a ready event for jquery to initialize the pop-up modal dialog

3153597
pop-up	dialog
those should get you to the point where your detail page is showing up in a pop-up dialog window

3153597
pop-up	dialog
to pop-up the other form in additional to the detail dialog or to replace the detail dialog it should be pretty similar

3153603

i m not sure the best way to ask that but whenever i put something like ptable string i get an error

3153682
for-loop	loops
in javascript i can use a for-loop and eval to evaluate a string + i loops var and then simply call the new var.backgroundcolor somecolor

3153700
client-side	server-side
bottom line it s very likely that you need to optimize your solr instance both the client-side querying and the server-side index and performance settings

3153718
hash	md5
if the hash function is more complex and cryptographically strong md5 or sha1 then it is theoretically not possible

3153728
hash	md5
a hash like sha1 or md5 is going to be pretty strong and more or less computationally impossible to find collisions for within a reasonable time frame

3153764
multiplying	add
it can also work with non-integer weights although if you re using nextdouble from system.random you ll have to scale all of the weights to add up to 1 or multiplying the value from nextdouble with s to get it in the desired range

3153780
int	boolean
for instance the following initializes the boolean to false and the int to 0

3153780
typedef	struct
like others said you can omit the typedef in c++ and just declare the struct and you are still able to refer to the type by just saying foo

3153799
udp	tcp
the defaults it opened ugly as it is was all tcp and udp ports when operating under the private profile

3153809
int	chars
one more thing if x is say an int just writing it to a file doesn t end the file with a line end chars

3153816
serializable	deserialization

all jsp files including jspf have to inside a war not a jar

3153855
printf	strlen
my guess is that printf is always called strlen on data and i usually get lucky in that even though data isn t null terminated there is a 0 before i hit the segment and then occasionally i get unlucky and it is

3153888
printf	strlen
there s no guarantee that printf won t call strlen even if it doesn t necessarily have to in a given context

3153929
switching	screens
when i comment out my intent everything works minus the passing of data switching of screens obviously but when i run my project as is it fc s.

3153971
vbscript	jscript
the project i m playing with now is desktop status display shows the time some tasks mounted disks etc and it s built on strawberry perl and plain win32 apis mainly the win32 gui and win32 api modules so the code is easy to port to or understand any dynamic language with similar win32 api bindings or access to windows scripting host eg activeperl python jscript vbscript

3153990
move	drag
the problem i m seeing is that when the user drag across the list the whole window move a bit exposing the desktop underneath then springs back into place once the user stops dragging

strpos returns either an int greater than or equal to zero or it returns false if the needle chars is not found in the string

3154178
profiling	instrumentation
otoh on modern video hardware a few layers of overdraw in a 2d scene is usually not that big of a deal so i m still interested to know exactly how you determined this and if there might be some sort of bias in your instrumentation and profiling which could be leading you astray

3154180
post	get
run this new query in a page template to get the first post from mycategory

3154186

3154313
getter	setter
create a synchronized getter setter

3154314
int	chars
someone told me in case of int instead of chars because chars in java is just 2 bytes length which is ok with most chars symbols already in use but for certain chars symbols chinese or whatever the chars is being represented in more than 2 bytes and hence we use int instead

3154314
int	chars
the real reason that reader.read returns an int not a chars is to allow it to return -1 to signal that there are no more chars to be read

3154491
backgrounding	multitasking
i my testing when i exit by pressing the home button my app it still is running in the backgrounding thanks to the multitasking feature

this string should be able to go at the end of your url in a get request edit by this i mean you should be able to put it at the end of your address in a browser and still work

3154497
post	get
using a library takes a lot of the mystery out of building ajax applications early on but it won t help you if you re using the wrong method post instead of get and debugging can actually be more difficult because you need to dig through a lot of code to see where things are failing

3154601
equals	compareto
after doing a lot of looking around it seems like vb6 doesn t have any kind of built-in compareto or equals methods like java does

3154601
equals	compareto
bottom line if you want compareto or equals methods in your vb6 classes just put them in

3154628

since i put this in all my child activities i no longer get the exception

3154669
put	get
put that together and we get

3154795
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
appcache is awesome and accepted as the standard but the big browsers are still undecided about the database implementation with opera safari and google-chrome opting for websql sqlite and mozilla and supposedly ie backing indexdb

3154825

not entirely portable but if you know you re using mysql postgresql it should be fine

3154843

everything builds just fine in maven and ant but will only deploy when building with ant

3154850
ant	maven
then there is a difference somewhere between the ejb-jar built by ant and the one built by maven

3154865

awt	swing
keep in mind that awt swing have a dedicated thread that does gui work â handling event handlers repainting the gui etc

3155054
cout	cin
in my past assignments i ve just used cin and cout commands but now have no idea what to do

3155058
spaces	delimiter
but i think the nicest aspect is how natural depending on how much spaces you want to devote to it you can make the grammar specification read an open paren a word a comma a word a comma an open paren a delimiter list of words two closed parentheses if you find the assignment to s above not so easy to read i guess it s my fault for not choosing longer identifiers

3155073
urllib	httplib
i m writing a dead link detector and wondering which lib i should use httplib and urllib so i tried both

3155089
urllib	httplib
302 is the http status code for a redirect see for example here and httplib the lower-level library returns it faithfully while urllib is automatically following the redirect and giving you the final resulting status code 200 for everything ok

3155159
cpython	ironpython
ironpython treats all .net classes just like cpython treats built-in types they cannot be monkey patched

the first child div is not absolutely positioned so as to lend its height and width to the parent

3155424
children	parent
the above structure is just an illustration of my dilemma in reality the parent div will have many children not all of them will be divs none of their dimensions will be known

3155466

the below code works as your child control ie. textblock has a height and width that is not equal to the width and height of your scroll viewer and hence the scroll bars don t display

3155816
width	height
i have just given same height and width as the scroll viewer for the controls defined inside it it works

3155843
hide	show
i wonder if it s somehow possible to use the stop function i normally use on animate with hide or show

3155843

3156180
google-chrome	firefox
it seems that firefox and google-chrome do not deal well with having tags added to them dynamically

3156191
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
my best advice on these issues is to run the fiddler tool and trace the traffic and you should see silverlight looking for a clientaccesspolicy.xml file and also the crossdomain.xml file which is a different format and that should make it easier to determine where silverlight is looking for the file

3156206
google-chrome	firefox
i am working on an application where i get some data from the database via jquery ajax and display append it a table.this app works very well with firefox and google-chrome but when tasted with internet explorer i get the error object required code 0 the issue i really donot know what the problem is or how to go abot it .i am using ie6

3156235
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
create objectoutputstream before objectinputstream

3156235
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
if you are writing code that transmits data bidirectionally using objectinputstream and objectoutputstream be careful to construct the objectoutputstream first

3156235
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
move the creation of the objectoutputstream before that of the objectinputstream

3156248
client-side	server-side
my challenge is now to re-use this client-side dll including it s ria data access capabilities in a server-side windows service

i started this morning and with the help of the internet got as far as reading in and parsing the csv which is actually a tsv since they use tabs not commas but hey

3156313
submit	submission
similarly when the enter key is pressed while the user is editing a form the submit event is triggered on the form but then the form submission actually occurs after this

3156315
cvs	rcs
cvs is inherently file-based based on rcs so cross-file operations are not supported

google-chrome	firefox
when you run on google-chrome or firefox hover over the element the tooltip shows

3156837
google-chrome	firefox
now if you trying playing the game in both firefox and google-chrome you would clearly notice that it is significantly slower in firefox

3156866
google-chrome	firefox
firefox is slower than google-chrome in javascript

3156866
google-chrome	firefox
there is also a nes emulator out on the web somewhere using js and canvas and it runs in about 30fps on google-chrome if i remember about correctly but only about 10 in firefox

3156897
try-catch	exception-handling
would be nice if it doesn t involve writing that block within a try-catch block creating a new exception-handling type throwing it and then catching it

3156918
children	parent
what you re seeing is the effect of wpf s bubbling event model whereby events that happen in the children usually bubble up to the parent

3156954
submit	submission
when the form is submitted the plugin captures the event creates a hidden iframe on the page clones the form fields from the submission form and submit that instead

3156999

then just show and hide it on the gotfocus and lostfocus events of the input controls

3157004

i ve just upgrade my server to versioning 9.3 of plesk from parallels

3157102
post	get
allows controller to recieve get post parameters as function arguments

3157104
mouseleave	mouseenter
what this does is on mouseenter it fades in on mouseleave it fades out via .animate ...but moving the mouse from one to the other will let the fade happen for 1 frame before putting a .stop to the fade-out and fade it back in

3157145
google-chrome	firefox
so i thought that after the firefox starts i can load the page from ie or google-chrome

3157149
public	protected
only at run-time when you call a method on another class php checks whether that method is accessible public or in some cases protected

3157195
octree	quadtree
just as a linear space can be efficiently searched with a binary search and thus divided into a binary tree 2d space can be divided into a quadtree and 3d space into an octree

3157211
subtraction	addition
just one addition one subtraction and a negation

3157314
codeigniter	kohana
kohana is no longer simply a codeigniter fork and has not been for a while so sadly the code cannot be simply copied and pasted across

3157327
voltdb	acid
as the previous answer stated voltdb provides extremely high performance oltp functionality transactions and acid at scale

3157401
google-chrome	safari
a page loading profiler firebug s net tab or safari google-chrome s resources tab will also ultimately tell you if your optimizations are worth it

3157410
sorting	filtering
not to mention that you get the benefit of being about to customize the sorting and filtering the results in ways that are difficult to do inside of an exec

3157478
post	get
there are alot post here to find out how to get a http request result

3157493
width	height
i am loading a json file that contains the src width and height of a number of images

3157516

3157616
hash	md5
if the user is not technical enough to figure out how to generate an md5 hash this should be enough

3157616
hash	salt
a slightly better solution would be concatenate another hard-coded secret salt in order to generate the hash but leave this salt out of the output

3157616
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
this means that even if the user is clever enough to generate his own md5 hash he can t fake the output without knowing the secret salt as well

3157638
postorder	inorder
if you really want to go above and beyond still for academic purposes you could implement tree iterators which do pre-order inorder and postorder traversal

3157638
postorder	inorder
you could also avoid using magic numbers 0 1 2 for pre-order inorder and postorder traversal and use named constants instead

3157641
qlistwidget	qpushbutton
use two qlistwidgets populate the left one using qlistwidget additem connect the clicked signal of your qpushbutton to a slot of your choosing which could look something like this

3157685
rss	feed
while building a small rss reader for myself i discovered that the ipad reader pulse or the google reader let you search rss feed simply by entering a keyword

3157712
post	get
just attach an onsubmit event listener to your form that always returns false to prevent actual sending of your form via the usual get or post request

3157712
post	get
but remember to always create a fallback option with the usual get or post request of the form to handle your form in case javascript is not available turned off blocked etc.

3157728
hide	show
use the following functions to show and hide the frame

3157751
rss	feed
i believe they have a cronjob running that is constantly caching rss feed so when you do a search it searches their database of cached feed articles

width	height
to get both height and width you can use nsstringfromcgsize

3157858
width	height
if those are not the ones you are looking for set the frame of the view to the center of the view with 0 width height and transform it to it s final size and position

3157892
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
case-sensitive comparison is from a naive point of view that ignores canonical equivalence trivial simply compare code points but case-insensitive comparison is not well defined and extremely complex in all cases and the rules are impossible to remember

3157894
qpainter	qwidget
take a look at for an instructive example where you can also find the following quote it is possible to re-implement its qglwidget paintevent and use qpainter to draw on the device just as you would with a qwidget

3158027
versioning	upgrade
so if you want to upgrade the lib to a newer versioning later you can do so as long as system can find the same filename the path can actually be different and the same symbol names

3158027
dlsym	dlopen
dlopen simply put opens a dynamic link library just like fopen might and returns you a handle which then you pass to dlsym with the name of the symbol you want which might be a function name for example

3158236
pop-up	dialog
then i get this in a pop-up dialog

3158236
pop-up	dialog
the title of the pop-up dialog is android launch

3158275
firefox	safari
i believe firefox s has to be done recursively down the tree of elements and safari just uses the outermost element. this should be possible without manually setting the height using javascript you just may have to conditionally code it to work with all the browsers you want to support

3158363
xslt	xquery
is it xpath or xquery or xslt or xsd even

3158364
jquery	jqmodal
my jquery modal plugin of choice is jqmodal

3158370

firefox google-chrome do this the right way and lets the style tag take precedence over the injected link tag so the background stays red

3158395
post	get
i believe that oauth_auth_type_form in your constructor forces it to do a post and not a get

3158569
width	height
but instead of x and y w-x and h-y is used where w is the width and h the height of rectangle

3158569
width	height
if the width of rectangle is greater than or equal to the height then the bottom left field of the rectangle is the field with the lowest value in the rhomboid and can be calculated that sum from before for h-1

3158569
width	height
in the other case when the height is greater than the width then the field at and can be calculated using that arithmetic sum and the rhomboid can be imagined as a rectangle with x-value x and y-value y- w-x-1

3158601
put	get
when the class is put into a windows service i get the following error

i guess it isn t vital that it not show the tabbar on launch if it will hide itself after the predetermined time frame

3158794
mouseover	mouseout
also .hover takes two functions as arguments - one for mouseover and one for mouseout

3158873
xslt	xquery
how about saxon xslt xquery processor

3158936
width	height
this means that it should have minimum height since its width is fixed because the small rectangles have fixed abscissas

3158936
backtracking	greedy
i don t know if i should use backtracking or there is a faster way i can imagine that at 50 rectangles it would take some measurable time to compute the correct solution and a greedy algorithm doesn t sit well with me

3158968
for-loop	loops
here loops is just a normal for-loop

3158996
setinterval	settimeout
i d blame a large part of it on settimeout and setinterval having a 10ms minimum in browsers such as ie and firefox

3158996
google-chrome	firefox
apart from timer problems firefox is just generally slower in js execution for now at least and it feels as if skia google-chrome s graphics lib is just faster at rasterising too

3159011
memcached	apc
use apc or memcached

3159098
getter	setter
first is that you want to keep object variables private and use getter and setter to access them

3159098
getter	setter
although it is a public property in this case the use of getter and setter improve readability and help prevents unexpected behavior

3159098
getter	setter
finally if you are accessing the variables from within the object you don t need to use the getter or setter

3159098
getter	setter
note its generally considered good style to keep object variables private and use getter setter for all languages

3159098
getter	setter
you may also be interested in the question getter and setter for class in class c#

3159149
accessor	properties
now granted there s also this option implementing a properties with only a get accessor

i am new to https http using ssl

3159375
google-chrome	safari
i couldn t find any specific information on frame rates for google-chrome or safari

3159385
getter	setter
i m sure there are a number of java classes that will do the job for you but you could also roll your own simply by creating an encapsulating class with either a public field or a setter getter

3159422
iprincipal	iidentity
if it is totally a windows environment yes using iprincipal and iidentity makes sense

3159422
implements	extends	iprincipal	iidentity
the how party is tricky - just look at msdn samples you can extends the iprincipal and iidentity to implements your own authn and authz in case of non-homogeneous non-windows network

3159445
spaces	delimiter
here s an example using a spaces delimiter and doing it in python disclaimer i don t know python particularly

3159489
g++	gcc
write a sed script on your linux machine that converts gcc g++ output errors into visual studio format

3159505
int	chars
the only things which are passed by value are primitives int long chars etc.

3159505
getter	setter
object references are always passed by reference - so if your object is able to support change to its contents via getter and setter methods - it can be changed

3159508
getter	setter
properties are every bit as powerful as getter and setter but are easier to write and use

3159547
inherited	subclassing
these are all subclassing of foo however foo is not called directly itself the classes use methods inherited from foo

3159558
interwoven	autonomy
using the autonomy interwoven products desksite or filesite it is possible to drag a document out of the application onto the desktop which creates a .nrl file

3159620
ant	maven
it s not always possible to configure everything in your maven or ant ivy scripts

3159625
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
window.onfocus works perfectly for this in ie firefox and safari but not in google-chrome

3159646
serializable	deserialization
the serializable process workes fine but after deserialization the value for property isperiodic by default is true eventhough it was false for some cases

3159672
queue	fifo
the biggest disadvantage is that priority aging is harder to implement than a fifo queue and may not provide any response time improvement

3159721
accessor	properties
as your example is right now i can t see the use for objectfeed it serves as a fancy properties accessor

3159765
min	max
but where gets processed before any group by and so it doesn t have access to aggregated values that is the results of min max etc

3159796

if i try to use a command like ftp or telnet both inputstream and errorstream are blocking my program when trying to read

3159929
listview	gridview
we re hosting a wpf control that has a simple listview control with gridview

3159941
put	get
i can use window.document.write myhtml to put the html in the new container but the html contains some css and javascript includes and these do not get included by the new window

3159969
width	height
i m using a very similar function to the tutorial linked above calculateloopborders my version is pasted below to calculate how many tiles to render based on screen height and width getheight and getwidth

3159969
width	height
mcellheight and mcellwidth are the width height of the cells in pixels

3159969
width	height
mmapheight and mmapwidth are the width height of the total game world in number of tiles

3159978
put	get
you could put fewer methods on that non-generic interface if you can get away with it it depends how much type casting you wanted to do

3159997
stdout	stderr
these methods will return the stdout and redirect stderr to the program s

3160004
filtering	grouping
saying that having with a simple filtering is exactly the same as where because only has meaning if you grouping on it

3160060
stdout	stderr
and you might want to deal with stderr just like stdout

3160082
int	boolean
specifies boolean add e e e get int index etc

3160122
coalesce	isnull
typically you may want to wrap these at the database in a view or a computed column with isnull col or coalesce col or handle these after extraction from the database as the article discusses

3160149
put	get
if you take a look at the goodrelations rdfa generator for commerce you ll get a mess of nested div s that you re told to put at the bottom of your item page

3160162
hide	replacewith
i have tried some things such as .next hide replacewith etc.

3160188
int	chars
from the c point of view if we are on a system where the startup code calls the main with two arguments int and chars and expect an int return value the right prototype would be

3160210
youtube	vimeo
alternatively you could always export to whatever you want as your master and then upload to youtube and or vimeo

3160214
sequence	permutation
this implies that most permutation of a long sequence can never be generated

3160216
superclass	subclassing
it also works to see what superclass and subclassing might implement override a certain function

3160220
cagradientlayer	calayer
i finally found a real simple solution to this problem using the cagradientlayer class and the calayer drawing functionalities

3160220
uiview	cagradientlayer
ole begemann released a great uiview wrapper for cagradientlayer class named obgradientview

3160310

i am having a hard time installing libcurl ruby bindings gem curb on windows

3160471
mp3	flac
ive just started using mutagen and have succefully used it with m4a mp3 ape afs and flac

3160494
octal	decimal
in c++ a constant with a leading 0 is an octal constant not a decimal constant

3160503
octal	decimal
prepending the 070 with a 0 like you are doing tells the compiler to interpret it as octal not decimal

3160545
post	get
i looked into https post and encrypting soap messages but before i got my hands too dirty i wanted to get opinions from the crowd

3160585
rss	feed
right now the rss feed loads in fine but is a default font and size that is undesirable

3160725
qlistwidget	qabstractlistmodel	qabstractlistmodel	qlistwidgetitem
however if you need to customize the display beyond what the qlistwidget qlistwidgetitem api can provide you will need to create your own qabstractlistmodel and use a standard qlistview with it

3160736
postgresql	mysql
after obtaining the plain-texts you could store them in a database like mysql or postgresql

3160747
inherited	properties
uitableview inherited from uiscrollview and scroll view exposes a contentoffset properties documentation here

3160749
mouse	keyboard
thrown when code that is dependent on a keyboard display or mouse is called in an environment that does not support a keyboard display or mouse

3160749
mouse	keyboard
that third-party library probably won t be able to work on for example a server that doesn t have a keyboard display or mouse

3160814
int	chars
chars to int conversion in c

3160814
int	chars
i remember learning in a course a long time ago that converting from an ascii chars to an int by subtracting 0 is bad

3160846
yacc	bison
this is where you get parser generators like yacc bison antlr etc

3160890
post	put
this can be used to finely set several headers - post put delete - for you rest request as well as send a payload - your xml content

3160900
versioning	upgrade
i had a program that was working fine it was working fine on vs 2010 this is not an i upgrade to .net and this error started happening post with a program that is mostly c and some c++ my boss hates object oriented since it usually involves making calls to libraries that he is paranoid microsoft will stop supporting and would also have to be delivered to the customer if they have an older versioning which could be a problem since a lot of them are government and he also thinks that these calls cause unnecessary overhead so i have to try to avoid it as much as possible then i uncommented a block of code i will post this block a little lower as it has been modified some from the original one i uncomented to start working on it and got the error runtime check error #2 the stack around std has been corrupted where std is a c style string of wchar

3160936
spaces	delimiter
which probably won t work since it uses spaces as delimiter

3160955
folder	directory
i know there is a limit for the cache directory in the form of oh hey your device is crashing now but i haven t determined the actual number and i am not sure if the documents folder or other folder have the same restrictions

3160956
solaris	sunos	solaris	aix	sunos	aix
i have two servers ibm aix and sunos solaris

3160967
int	chars
this is a common trick taught in c classes primarily to illustrate the notion that a chars is a number and that its value is different from the corresponding int

3160971
width	height
i would like to open a new windows when a user clicks on a button so i would like to resize the browser for example let s say i get the screen size width is 1000 i want to resize it to 700px and then launch a window next to the browser that is 300px in width and 100 in height

3160974
portrait	landscape
i have an app that requires scrollbars to be enabled in one landscape orientation but not in portrait orientation

3160974
portrait	landscape
i would then define separate values of the attribute for landscape and portrait modes

3160981
multiplying	add
if you have something that generates random numbers in a range such as 0 1 it s easy to transform that to another range such as -120 120 you just have to multiplying by the size of the target range 240 in this case and add the start of the target range -120 in this case

3160995
super	implements
it s not super difficult to implements don t implements it recursively you will almost certainly run out of stack space and it will be able to look at complex situations like a u-shaped region that has a border between two points but are not actually different regions

3161016
firefox	safari
the code is fully functional when view from safari but the reload command does not appear to work when the same page is viewed in firefox

3161047
webkit	gecko
try testing the same issue in chrome to see if this is a webkit vs gecko issue or a apple vs everyone else issue

3161094
hash	md5
in order to do this the user will need to via shell integration or manually process their own md5 hash and compare it to the hash provided by the uploader

3161094
hash	md5
an md5sum hash won t assure you that the uploader who provided the checksum didn t fiddle with the file to do that you should trust the source of the md5 checksum ie

3161153
width	margin
i had hard times with ie6 and the last column too large for the whole design going under the others due whether to doubled margin float bug or a width 100 + padding margin on a child

3161157
agile	sprint
scrum and agile says that items on the current sprint backlog should be approached in priority order and one item at a time by the whole team

3161229
width	height
you can now see that the panel expands to the full width of its sizer and the height of the static text and that the rest is occupied by a blank space

3161281
background-image	background-size
the best way is to use css background-image with the new cool background-size property

3161281
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
firefox since 3.6 i think safari google-chrome and opera support it with vendor prefixes for now

3161299
post	get
with this i can then post the arabic to an afxmessagebox and it displays correctly but i can t seem to get the grids to accept the non-unicode characters and display them correctly

3161328
serializable	deserialization
ideally you could use serializable deserialization in your implementation to persist the object but that may not be an option for you if the legacy format is required

3161344
disk	ram
there is another thing that really speeds up eclipse on both windows and especially linux - putting the jvm in ram disk

3161344
disk	ram
for windows you can use the commercial ram disk driver from qsoft

3161344
disk	ram
it is important to give additional space to the ram disk that is 10 bigger than the size of the jvm

3161357
maven	pom.xml
edit as a point of reference there is the following link available pom.xml element for source file encoding showing the nuances between these properties for both maven 2.0 and 3.0

3161372
decltype	auto
since the compiler generates a local class it generates a name and therefore you can never explicitly write the type you can only deduce the type from either type deductions of template function arguments or using auto decltype

3161381
profiling	debugging
the most important thing for debugging sql queries is sql server profiling

3161404
installshield	dtf
i highly encourage the use of dtf with installshield

3161414
post	get
now i m trying to get that user_id from the session when i create a new post so that the post is connected to the user

3161423
int	double
and that s not even considering more subtle issues like endianness and floating point representation which can affect the transmission of such simple types as int and double

3161434
accessor	properties
while you can control access to a properties via its get and set accessor you cannot control access to a field

3161434
accessor	properties
if your properties accessor don t contain any additional logic you can just as well write

3161461
createfile	deviceiocontrol
before the usage of ioctl code in the function deviceiocontrol one need to open the corresponding device with respect of createfile function

3161461
createfile	deviceiocontrol
for the usage of deviceiocontrol one can use 0 as a second parameter of createfile because we will not use readfile writefile etc functions to access the device

3161468
getter	setter
edit if you wanted special logic handled independently in the getter and setter you could try the following code

3161482
getter	setter
and these getter and setter

3161500
onresume	onpause
say if onresume is called set a flag somewhere and when onpause is called reset it

3161539
inherited	subclassing
due to the way multi-table inherited works in django you ll need to access the onetoonefield that exists on the manufacturer to the subclassing instance

3161542
post	get
because we use post and not get method to get the data from the server all input parameters of the web method must be always set

3161563
pull	push
you described the two high level options available push vs pull polling

3161568
pull	push
you have push and pull design patterns

3161568
pull	push
a notifyallobservers is a push ordinary attribute access is a pull

3161586
rss	feed
i am using an rss feed as a data source

3161640
hide	show
the idea is then that i would use a simple overlapping div script to show hide each of these sections within the same footprint

3161672
ant	emma
i have an ant build file where i compile the java source code of the application and of the tests instrument the application classes run junit tests and generate junit and emma code coverage reports

3161698
pull	push
you have pull and push notification

3161729
bluetooth	usb
to save your battery life things that help would be to shut off the screen turn off wifi and bluetooth and don t keep programs running that keep your hard drive running and also unplug any usb or pcmcia devices that you are not running

3161739
put	get
finally you shouldn t put get in the name of the getter

3161749
hash	salt
you can also send a salt hash of the password

3161864
serializable	deserialization
serializable deserialization between javascript and .net types is done for you automatically by the .net javascriptserializer

3161886
rdf	owl
rdf id and relative urls are expanded into full absolute urls such as by using the base url of the owl file

3161887
ati	nvidia
another possibility would be nvidia scenix though given the source compatibility with intel and or amd ati graphics hardware may be questionable

3161899
put	get
now the audioplayerdidfinishplaying callback will still occur because we have told ios that we are doing a task that needs to continue even if we get put in the background

3161913
config	ini
in the .net world the ini file format has been widely replaced by xml which is the new de-facto standard for config files app.config files for which the .net framework provides support through the static system.configuration.configurationmanager class

3161962
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
inherited it seems that the super works in the subclassing when calling the superclass constructor and that

3161962
superclass	subclassing
the superclass variables don t bind to the subclassing object

3162006
post	get
2 simple post get using urlconnection over http

3162066
getter	setter
mark the backing field as obsolete so that the compiler generates a warning when you try to access it and then suppress those warnings within the property getter setter

3162094
hash	md5
i could not find any built-in property telling me this information the content s md5 current hash value

3162104
post	get
in addition to what you asked you will get the date of the lastest post in the category as i think you ll need it if it is a good forum

3162114
filtering	grouping
from there you can sort filtering grouping query the contents of that library

3162143
bitblt	gdi
alternatively if you prefer to work with vcl rather than windows gdi you can replace the two bitblt lines with

ajax paging works in google-chrome ie opera mobile firefox safari

3162183
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
scrolling grid doesn t render properly in ie8 safari google-chrome or mobile opera not even a scroll bar on the last one - support issue raised i think they ve fixed it already

3162183
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
grid rendering looks exactly the same in all browsers ie8 google-chrome firefox safari and opera mobile

3162183
opera	google-chrome
ajax activity image doesn t work in ie8 google-chrome or opera mobile but the grid still works regardless

3162207
sorting	filtering
as toby noted in the other answer in general you don t need to worry about performance when sorting such a small number of rows assuming you will always be filtering by designid .

3162267
int	chars
you should pass them either as unsigned chars or as a wider int type

3162308
nexus	artifactory
while it may not be the ideal solution you are looking for i found that the best case for this kind of thing is to install cntlm and a local repository proxy within the firewall such as sonatype nexus jfrog s artifactory or apache archiva

3162308
nexus	artifactory
i ve used artifactory and nexus and they are both pretty comparable

3162419
postgresql	mysql
if you re also considering approaches without mysql then you might want to look at postgresql which is another free and open-source database

3162419
postgresql	mysql
postgresql supports recursive queries in the form of recursive common table expressions which make querying heirarchical data easier than in mysql and also give better performance

3162473
caliburn	prism
you may find caliburn or prism useful for .net

3162494
put	get	post	put	post	get
2 for example using get on a form which requires data to be presented via post or using put on a read-only resource

3162534
realloc	malloc
if ptr is a null pointer the realloc function behaves like the malloc function for the specified size

3162534
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
otherwise if ptr does not match a pointer earlier returned by the calloc malloc or realloc function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to the free or realloc function the behavior is undefined

3162553
eurekalog	madexcept
madexcept because either that or eurekalog tell you what actually went wrong

3162598
easymock	powermockito
not sure how to with pure easymock but consider using the powermockito extensions to easymock

3162604
fileoutputstream	filechannel
i don t see any reason why filechannel could be any faster than fileoutputstream in this case

3162627
postgresql	mysql
for an alternative coming from php you could try postgis on postgresql but i ve always favoured mysql for ease of use native support and all round speed

3162630
width	height
try putting these two lines in the constructor of the class that you want to use the stage width height

3162644
google-chrome	firefox
to get console working you will either need firebug extension for firefox or simply bring up developer console in google-chrome

3162650
awt	swing
this because awt and swing on top has its own thread that manages everything of a gui

3162663
gridview	radgrid
i am migrating gridview to radgrid

3162677
many-to-many	one-to-many
a little bit of data de-normalization changing that many-to-many to a one-to-many and duplicating the rolename and roleweight values would solve the issue

3162693
getter	setter
using a class interface that simply doesn t allow any operation that is able to modify what is inside your class just getter and no setter

3162712
addslashes	htmlspecialchars
htmlspecialchars with ent_quotes or perhaps a combination of htmlspecialchars with ent_noquotes and addslashes if you don t want your quotes to turn into html entities

3162723
puts	gets
so instead of embedding logic and operations inside the restrictions of mysql consider banging out code to do what you want and relying on mysql only for the lowest-level gets puts

3162745
queue	fifo
i guess my question lies in whether to create separate queue for each service and any common technology service broker that is well suited to the throttling if not i ll end up creating my own throttling queueing system which is why i was looking for common design patterns producer consumer or something since it s not fifo due to the above example

3162745
queue	fifo
so far it looks like a fifo queue for each service with it s own throttling looks like the way to move forward

3162769
udp	tcp
many of the core concepts like tcp udp berkley sockets etc have been around way before c# came about and cross the boundries of programmer and admin which just happens to be one of my favorite things to do

3162832
haskell	ocaml
note that this requires more powerful type inference than either f# or haskell currently have ocaml can infer sum types

3162834
uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
this would work well with a uiviewcontroller or uiwindow which you can get through i think because these would have the most similar responder chains and would make the current firstresponder loose its firstresponder status dismissing the keyboard but also wouldn t bring up the keyboard as it would not be a uitextfield

3162879
uniq	grep
grep file name input.txt | sort | uniq

3162889
getter	setter
getter and setter

3162900
try-catch	exception-handling
the c standard library isn t aware of c++ exception-handling handling so try-catch won t work

3162911
google-chrome	firefox
i tried deleting all my caches firefox ie google-chrome twig but nothing works

3162915
abc	subclassing
rather subclassing the abstract base class collections.mapping or mutablemapping if you want to also be able to modify an instance after creation implement the indispensable special methods for the purpose and you ll get other dict -like methods for free from the abc

3162928
lsp	principles
remember liskov substitution principles lsp sub-types must be substitutable for their base types

3162928
srp	principles
i d also keep single responsibility principles srp in mind as well

3162930
opera	safari
safari 3+ opera 8+ and use word

3162943
pull	push
then when you go to push or pull to the project check the little autoload putty key thing

3162994
bitconverter	binaryreader
when reading or writing values larger than a byte reading an int from a binaryreader or using bitconverter you do have to account for endianness

3163050
folder	directory
you can set the copy to output directory property to copy always so that it is automatically copied to the output folder when you build

3163102
min	max
take notice of the variables min in max which have a rather small precision of + - 0.0001

3163109
google-chrome	firefox
in my experience google-chrome firefox ie in terms of js engine speed

3163131
outputstream	inputstream
i know that i can override the multipartentity and make the writeto outputstream out method write to a filteroutputstream class that i created to wrap the default inputstream

3163142
put	get
but from what i gather some things that could get put into content might become entities that would make it no longer be valid

3163151
getter	setter
i know you can grab similar xml attributes from the converted objects using getter setter like view.gettext .

3163157
inotifypropertychanged	icommand	inotifycollectionchanged	icommand	inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
the main interfaces that wpf uses to connect to the viewmodel is inotifypropertychanged inotifycollectionchanged and icommand

3163189
margin	height
this was driving me nuts - i was wondering where my elements were getting an extra 16px of margin height - until i realised it was coming from the computed style

3163243
uncaughtexceptionhandler	runnable
for example threadpoolexecutor.execute runnable will trigger the uncaughtexceptionhandler

3163250
min	max
and yes you can give it min and max parameter value limits

3163302
ceil	floor
the value you need should be either floor i or ceil i

3163364
gcov	lcov
if it is not possible via gcov perhaps it is possible via lcov but i was not able to figure it out

3163382
int	chars
adding 4 to this value increments it by making it point to the second int of the array assuming 32 bit 4 byte int and one byte chars on a little endian platform

3163387
int	chars
that chars will be promoted to an int passed to printf and printed out

3163418
jboss	glassfish
hello i am using jsf 2.0 hibernate and spring in my project and now i need to implement jbpm jboss and totally i am new to jbpm and using glassfish server so how can i add this stuff.

3163486
stdout	stderr
system.out is standard output stdout and system.err is error output stderr

3163495
teamcity	psake
i have this code to load a config file and read all the values and it works fine when running the application but of course fails on teamcity because the appdomain s base directory is where the build script psake is started

3163533
nstextview	nstextstorage
you can initialize an nsattributedstring using rtf data and the nstextstorage owned by the nstextview derives from nsmutableattributedstring

3163538
cpython	pypy
for python there is a pypy project which it includes jit making possible the code to run faster than in cpython in many cases

3163556
gmail	hotmail
after the user selects send to file is sent to their gmail yahoo hotmail whichever

3163595
submit	submission
the usual way to handle this is to show the prompt but cancel the form submission and then submit the form programmatically if the user says yes.

3163595
submit	submission
set up a submit handler on the form so that it cancels the submission if it s told to

3163616
implements	extends
the purpose of anonymous inner classes is to extends another class or implements another interface ad-hoc

3163616
implements	extends
for that reason anonymous inner classes can simulate the job of lambda expressions to some extends for example by implements the runnable interface

3163617
int	chars
you would likely want to encode the string as hex or int for the normal representation or you will see garbage chars instead

3163620
hide	show
i would suggest to just hide and show that .

3163643
daemons	systemd
because of some specific behaviour in dream daemons i can t use a process.close call since dd intercepts that and simply minimizes itself to the systemd tray

3163658
hide	show
first one is the main group and the second is the subgroup what i want to do is hide the main group and just show the subgroups in my data grid

3163674
cassini	iis
i came across this interesting problem with an asp.net mvc website there is an action method to process uploaded files and it works fine with cassini webserver but when i tried with iis in my hosting machine the upload fails after spending lot of time i noticed that it is because of the url rewite rules inside set to change the incoming urls to lowercase and add a trailing slash at the end

3163681
postgresql	mysql
if i asked about most popular free relational database i d expect to get mysql or postgresql or perhaps sqlite

3163685
objectdatasource	formview
i m using objectdatasource to bind formview

3163712
comparator	icomparer
as jon said you need to define your custom comparator implementing icomparer

3163714
int	chars
the reason it is not working is that get returns an int but you are using the input as a chars

3163716
screens	tablet
this would also be easy to have so that there is an option for tablet computers so that it uses a control or similar to allow direct drawing on the screens

3163800
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i tested on 5 different browsers ie8 google-chrome firefox opera safari with the same outcome for each

3163881
opencv	emgucv
i am doing coding in c# emgucv opencv wrapper

3163979
rss	feed
i m trying to work out how to move data parsed from an rss feed into a uitableview into an entirely new view for example a uimapkit but not having much luck

3163979
rss	feed
it s created in a currentdogstableview class - which downloads the data from an rss feed using an rssdownload class

3164008
superclass	subclassing
the easiest way maybe not the nicest though would be to subclassing the propertyplaceholdeconfigurer load the commons configuration there and then pass it to the superclass

3164026
put	get
get your linq result and put it in loop compare every char with in list of char

3164034
boost	stl
also no boost or external libraries - pure c++ stl i really neeed only an algorithm

3164037
inherited	subclassing
you could either turn task into a subclassing also then have each inherited from something common using your names from above wherever possible

3164037
superclass	subclassing
or you move the shared functionality out to its own module then include that and avoid superclass subclassing altogether i would opt for this one

3164056
intersect	contains
the result is a manifold object which contains a collection of points where the shape boundaries intersect

3164072
persistent	transient
to load the data i m using a multipartfile transient atribute and in its setter i m setting the information i want to persistent byte filename size

3164072
getter	setter
the entity i m persisting looks like this one i ve ommitted the rest of getter setter

3164171
hide	show
my problem is if the email is invalid the alert pops up but then when that is closed it continues to run the hide and show functions

3164171
hide	show
i need it to only run the hide show functions if the email is valid

3164234
stdout	stderr
the caller creates two pipes and passes the writing ends of both pipes to the createprocess as the stdout stderr handles to use for the child process

3164234
stdout	stderr
since it doesn t seem to be able to use one synchronization call which waits for the process to exit or data on either stdout or stderr to be available the waitformultipleobjects function doesn t work on pipes the caller has two threads running which both perform blocking readfile calls on the reading ends of the stdout stderr pipes

3164234
stdout	stderr
here s the exact code of the read thread procedure which is used for stdout stderr i didn t write this code myself i assume some colleague did

3164234
daemons	launchd
now the problem i hit is this b.exe might depending on user input launchd external processes which live longer than b.exe itself daemons processes basically

3164234
stdout	stderr
what happens in that case is that the writing ends of the stdout stderr pipes are inherited to that daemon process so the pipe is never broken

3164234
stdout	stderr
clearing the inheritable flag on stdout stderr inside b.exe doesn t seem to have any effect it would have surprised me if it did

3164320
rar	zip
actually i am having 10 files with boxes if i select more than one check box that files should get zip rar and i am able to save that in some path

3164338
subclass	abstract-class
we can use a abstract-class constructor to execute code that is relevant for every subclass

3164343
subclass	abstract-class
you can t force a particular signature of constructor in your subclass - but you can force it to go through a constructor in your abstract-class taking two integers

3164369
implements	modifiers
when overriding clone you should change the modifiers to public and implements cloneable

3164434
opera	firefox
works cross-browser opera chromium midori firefox ie6 and ie8 with less code gets the job done

3164448
ssl	https
the logs in websphere appplication server are thrashing a lot with redundnant details on ssl certificates used for each message sent over https

3164507
opera	firefox
for example let say user has login to my website on firefox if the user login again to another browser like opera on the same computer or different computer the session on firefox will be destroyed

3164542
put	get
6.i did nt want to put these 16 led windows in resource editor but wanted to create them at run time.for creation of these 16 windows the co-ordinates of the mother window idc_leds are required.i tried the creation process in the cled_arr constructor.but probably at this instant the window of the class is not available so i get exception.so i wanted to do it using some message handler using the creation the window message of this class cled_arr.but the only message available for this class is bn_clicked

3164545
post	get
so building on my previous post xmlstarlet seems to get the job done like so

3164585
crossover	mutation
if you have a fixed topology then both crossover and mutation are quite easy assuming you only evolve the weights of the network

3164651
width	height
i cannot distinguish the different between auto and when setting width height for a grid column

3164704
folder	dir
i implemented the cache file control saving and getting files from cache dir but now i need to enforce cache folder max size control because cache folder should be limited in max size

3164757
portrait	landscape
as my application working fine in portrait mode but if i change it to landscape mode my design look weird can any one help is it any common mechanism to design for portrait as well as for landscape mode and which event get fire when we change actual device from portrait to landscape mode

mathtype can copy and paste equations into mathml markup you choose whether ctrl+c copies mathml or tex

3164809
multiton	singleton
there is a pattern called a multiton which deals with this as an extension of singleton

3164817
opera	google-chrome
in 4.0 it is a lot better but still not quite as good as in google-chrome or opera

3164817
google-chrome	firefox
also firefox 4 has hardware accelerated canvas that is marginally faster than ie9 and a lot faster than google-chrome

3164817
google-chrome	firefox
in fact canvas in firefox 3.6 is already at least as fast as in google-chrome but many tests don t show it since the javascript is slower

3164821
openfire	ejabberd
i was looking at following server technologies like openfire tigase ejabberd and rabbitmq

3164847
ubuntu	linux
i see there are many version of autoconf and automake available in my ubuntu linux

3164848
fadein	hide	fadein	fadeout	hide	fadeout	hide	show
i have a simple animation based on jquery fadein and fadeout - it just show some elements and hide others sequentially when a visitor loads main page of the site

3164862
preferenceactivity	preferencescreen
my preferenceactivity contains a nested preferencescreen in another preferencescreen and i m applying a theme to my prefenceactivity that changes the background color

3164868
setinterval	clearinterval
this is stopping the interval previously set via setinterval from running anymore killing the current loop via clearinterval and clearing the timerid variable so the startrotation function restarts the loop when it s ready to on mouseleave

3164868
setinterval	settimeout
one change i would make never pass a string into setinterval or settimeout this runs an eval internally

3164894
portrait	landscape
you may like to consider having a portrait orientation nib and a landscape orientation nib if you are building your interface with interface builder

3164919
firefox	safari
...in terms of browser support queryselector and queryselectorall is supported in firefox 3.1+ ie8+ only in ie8 standards mode and safari 3.1+

3164934
post	get
set the open method post get url true .

3164966
width	height
to show that rectangular area correctly browser would need width and height data

3164975
maven	pom.xml
even my poms all has single company s internal repository specified maven goes to internet repositories taken from libs pom.xml files to fetch dependencies

3165002
width	height
generally you should provide the height and width tags so that the browser can reserve the needes space for the image

3165002
width	height
so you should stick with always adding height and width attributes

3165015
firefox	safari
tested in firefox and safari

3165042
getter	setter
also i see the equals and hashcode methods missing from your embedded pk as well as the getter setter

3165055
imap	nntp
these functions enable you to operate with the imap protocol as well as the nntp pop3 and local mailbox access methods

3165063
post	get
i also think the assigning the global work size to the nearest multiple and being careful about bounds should work i ll post a comment when i get around to trying it

3165125
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
i ve a huge panel with dropdownlistfor and checkbox

3165125
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
to manage them i have to implement the clicklistener interface so that on expanding the dropdownlistfor or clicking on the checkbox some actions are executed

3165125
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
so it should be modal and it is except for dropdownlistfor and checkbox because clicking on them calls to the onclick widget sender method which knows nothing about the modality of the dialog box so it could expand the dropdownlistfor or tick the checkbox

3165141
getter	setter
you could however enforce your own type checking rules using getter and setter functions in your object

3165156
google-chrome	firefox
this works great in ie 8 and firefox but not in google-chrome

3165172
udp	tcp
when i pass a 0 value as the protocol parameter tcp and udp work as expected

3165191
postgresql	mysql
occasionally i pair it in python or connect it to mysql or postgresql databases which also works well

3165216
gridview	sqldatasource
gridview to the sqldatasource is connected

3165229
viewdidload	didreceivememorywarning
however when i receive a memory warning didreceivememorywarning is called on the view controller although the app seems to handle it gracefully viewdidload gets called for the view to get set up again without any extraneous views etc - app doesn t crash and the uiimagepickercontroller lets me take a photo the uiimagepickercontroller s view in this case the camera doesn t get dismissed

3165305
updatepanel	scriptmanager
as i am using updatepanel and there is already a scriptmanager in master page so i am using scriptmanagerproxy in updatepanel

3165338
submit	submission
if the client has js enabled then you can hookup some jquery to hijack the form submission by attaching an event to the submit button click event or form submit event and send the data using ajax

3165404
feedback	review
for the purposes of code review feedback i would suggest that it was bad practice because it implements an unexpected test even if we ignore the uncertainty of whether it will always behave the same when the types match

3165440
put	get
suppose my 100 threads are executing the same method work concurrently then if i put the following code help me get what i seek

3165470

how can i get the height and width of the browswer

3165633
width	height
but i need to handle some controls like media element height and width when the user restore the browser or let say resize the browser by clicking on the edge and resizing it

3165633
width	height
so again the buttom line is i want the the height and width of the broswer not the current system resolution

3165635
super	abstract
having a constructor in the abstract class allows you to call super foo

3165646
button	checkbox
i assume that there is exactly one form element that can be either a textarea input field select form a set of radio button or a single checkbox you will have to update my code if you need more checkbox

3165665
put	get
of course this answer just shows how ridicolous stuffs can get if we put too much rescrictions

3165672
std	ostream
if you don t need this level of flexibility and want to keep all this in a single class you could make the m_out variable a pointer to std ostream and add an extra flag to keep track of whether you need to delete it on cleanup

3165696
pull	push
i ve checked in some changes to my local repository that i want to push but when i do a git pull i get

gif	png
static files are files included in your gae project like html and png jpg gif files

3165800
memcached	apc
i use apc memcached to some extent but i also thought why have it hit the server at all so i devised this

3165836
clang	llvm
the standard version of gcc has no support for blocks so you ll either have to port apple s changes to the linux gcc or use clang llvm

3165864
std	ostream
the classes in c++ inherit from std ostream

3165908
haskell	ocaml
go is much more c++ like and low level oriented than c# and c# has only a few functional features while scala allows you to write typical functional code more verbose than ocaml or haskell but similar

3165985
profiler	visualvm
a simple and free tool is to use sun profiler supplied with java visualvm

3165998

3166065
put	get
anytime there are schema changes they get put back into the scripts so that they don t get lost

3166102
integer	unsigned
on the assumption that you are using 32 bit unsigned integers the 48th fibonacci number will cause an integer overflow

3166107
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in my testing google-chrome ie8 safari don t slow down as the size goes up the way firefox does

3166122

versioning	upgrade
each endpoint having its own copy of the assembly reinforces the autonomy of the endpoints and will make it much easier if you ever need to upgrade to a new versioning of nservicebus since you would be able to test each endpoint individually and not just put a new assembly in the gac add a binding redirect and hope everything continues to run fine

3166210
16-bit	64bit
64bit versions of windows are unable to run 16-bit applications this is because a 64bit cpu running in 64bit mode does not support running 16-bit instructions

3166211
versioning	upgrade
to do so you ll have to either recreate your db from scratch which granted linq to sql does not do very well or use something like wizardby to versioning and upgrade your db schema

3167177
put	get
i think its more an issue of what you do with it since curl can be used to do a lot of things that may toe the line as far as legality such as bots some things done with curl are best not put into applications that are distributed sold to 3rd parties but if you re just doing stuff thats plainly allowed such as connecting to an api i don t see why it would be an issue and i don t think apple would get involved either way other than disapproving your app if they thought you stepped over the lines but they wouldn t be directly affected by it so its unlikely they would do anything more than that

3167202
public	protected
remember that abstract methods must be implemented by the subclasses but you can also provide your own code within the class itself via normal private public protected etc

3167227
subclass	abstract-class
an abstract-class is for when you want to partially implement certain functionality but delegate important parts to a subclass

3167228
inline	inlining
methods that contain exception-handling blocks are not inline though methods that throw exceptions are still candidates for inlining

3167228
getter	setter
since the c# compiler creates separate getter and setter methods from the property declaration they would obvious be treated independently of one another

3167228
accessor	properties
based on the rules above i would say most of the time properties accessor are inlined

3167238
put	get
i have had to put in a fix where an iframe needs to get a packet of json back to a parent.document

stdout	fflush
as for 2 i believe python fflush to stdout after every new line

3167562

hash	md5
i m taking the output of an md5 hash and would like to xor every four bytes together so that i can get a 32 bit int out of it

3168090
hash	md5
if i need a int would i be better off with a different hash function or should i just take the first 4 bytes of the md5 because xor ing them all wouldn t help any

3168106
ant	maven
i ve only done a little bit of android development with vim but i d very much suggest getting your head around ant which the sdk uses to build projects from the command line and perhaps maven if you re daring

in essence ie in its infinite wisdom decided to be different from the rest of the browser world and include any padding and or border to the width or height in this case specified in the css

3168246
portrait	landscape
if you re just changing the layout you should really think about putting your portrait layouts in res layout and your landscape layouts in res layout-land with the same names and android will select the correct layout automatically

3168262
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
instead it must construct the object streams in the same way that your client does by using new objectinputstream and new objectoutputstream

3168289
content-disposition	content-type
set content-type to application vnd.ms-excel and response header for content-disposition

3168298
integer	unsigned
the z represents an integer of length same as size_t and the priu32 macro defined in the c99 header inttypes.h represents an unsigned 32-bit integer

3168300
hash	md5
to address the off topic part i d suggest just lopping off the first 32 bits of the md5 hash

3168300
hash	md5
like other cryptographic hash md5 is supposed to appear as random as possible so xor ing other bytes won t really make a difference imo

3168307
viewdidload	viewwillappear
or instead of using viewdidload use viewwillappear animated.

3168316
ffmpeg	libavformat
here is a tutorial on using libavformat and libavcodec both part of ffmpeg to get video stream info

you might be able to use a cashapelayer as a mask for a cagradientlayer by setting it to the cagradientlayer s mask property

3168435
ienumerable	ienumerator
it s because the c# compiler does not generate code to box stuff to ienumerable or ienumerator in a foreach loop if it can avoid it

3168452
pyquery	lxml
there is another complementary module that relies on lxml called pyquery that might be just what you re looking for

pthreads	fcntl
this works great in pthreads using fcntl locking

3168504
pthreads	fcntl
when i do it in that order in pthreads i lose the write lock by taking the read lock because fcntl replaces the existing lock instead of adding locks as windows does

3168509
hash	salt
the 2nd vulenrablity is much more important it is cwe-760 use of a one-way hash with a predictable salt

3168509
hash	salt
a password hash cannot be broken until the salt is retrieved

3168509
hash	salt
a salt must be a secret ideally this secret is stored separately from the password hash

3168509
hash	salt
if the salt is stored in the database along side the password hash then sql injeciton can be used to obtain both values and then a simple dictionary attack can be used to break the hash

3168509
hash	salt
to improve the secuirty provided by a salt it should be stored separately from the password hash such that both must be compromised before the any hash can be broken

3168517
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works correctly in firefox but not in google-chrome or safari

3168530
postgresql	mysql
the expertise available in our company is sql server and oracle so using mysql or postgresql would be considered a last resort

3168559

3168679
spaces	delimiter	punctuation	words
yes you can use punctuation white spaces international characters and sql reserved words if you use delimiter identifiers

3168683
accessor	properties
in c# 3.0 and later auto-implemented properties make property-declaration more concise when no additional logic is required in the properties accessor

3168719
integer	fractions
if you really want to round to the first 4 fractions digits you can also use integer arithmetic by first multiplying the first number so its digits are shifted the right amount f places to the left

3168807
google-chrome	safari
see google.com revamped here google-chrome and safari only

3168833

3169077
int	double
i m having trouble multiplying an int with a double

3169143
dictionary	map
as an aside you should use a map dictionary when it s the best data structure choice not just because it s easy and fast although programmer time is expensive proper structure choice will help create a better overall design

3169159
portrait	landscape
i have a textfield in a table view cell when i try to edit the textfield the keyboard appears and when i rotate the device from landscape to portrait this is what i get

g++	gcc
edit i found that these errors can be caused by accidentaly using gcc instead of g++

3169242
width	height
set the contentsize property of your uiscrollview properly basically the width height of the content that can be displayed in the scroll view without scrolling set the pagingenabled property of the scroll view to yes and then add your view that you want to scroll as a subview of the uiscrollview

3169249
awt	swing

now i wanted to be able to support both landscape and portrait mode in the game

3169415
portrait	landscape
i hope this helps someone i know i had a very tough time with it especially the keyboard going from landscape to portrait

3169431
children	parent

3169438
google-chrome	firefox
however i tested with google-chrome and firefox and it did not

3169471
post	get
it is also recommended that actions modifying the model should not be done on a get request meaning that you should call your delete url using post or delete

3169510
rss	feed
the source of an rss feed is xml

3169527
pop-up	dialog
however if you re talking about pop-up as in modal dialog or small information windows in an application those are usually fine

3169533
accessor	properties
if you want to write them from outside you need to declare them as readwrite properties and either synthesize or manually implement the corresponding setxxx accessor method

3169603
int	chars
again i don t know the difference between the i l or i l format chars but since they all represent 32-bit int then their binary representation should be the same for all values between 0 and 2147483647 inclusive

3169627
inherited	properties
but wouldn t it just be easier to set the inherited properties via the constructor in the inherited class

3169638
firefox	safari
will trigger an onbeforeunload event on ie but not on safari or firefox

3169639
post	get
so you would include httpservletrequest request in method parameters for both methods ie get and post and retrieve the object via request.getattribute binding

3169666
ubuntu	linux
i m on linux ubuntu 9.10

3169697

therefor i changed my implementation to generate a random int with 60 bits so longer than 42 chars instead

3169705
thin	webrick
make sure you run thin on your localhost - there are certain instances where code will work in webrick but not in thin

3169707
google-chrome	safari
inspector in safari google-chrome shows the existence and proper id of the element

3169712

depending on how you define the properties but usually any instance of the class will have that properties s accessor available to other classes

3169761
x86	64bit
try setting the platform target to x64 to make sure your app is running 64bit and not as a x86 app

3169766
flac	ogg	mp3	wav	mp3	flac	mp3	ogg	wav	flac	wav	ogg
i don t have direct experience with the vast majority of these tools and library but at least from the list it seems that many claim to support at least mp3 and ogg fewer explicitly mention wav or flac

3169772
portrait	landscape
when you rotate to landscape mode the table cells look like they are still set up for portrait mode

3169772

width	height
width and h is the height

3169888
flac	ogg
i m interested in writing a decoder for flac audio and possibly ogg audio as these seem to be some of the most widely used open source audio formats

3169917
flac	ogg
i suspect the computational demands of flac decoding are probably considerably less than ogg and if dsp gets you excited taking the time to figure all this stuff out is 100 worth it even if the flash route possibly leads to disappointment

3169918
put	get
at any rate you ll have to put some work to get it working and i don t mean this to discourage you but i m not sure actionscript is fast enough for real time audio decoding

3169926
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
then i m wrapping this view controller in a uinavigationcontroller which has a toolbar property and according to the docs i m supposed to use the settoolbaritems method of uiviewcontroller to add items to the toolbar then presenting it in a popover

3169932
postgresql	mysql
it supports all the oses that you ve mentioned and has also database connectors for postgresql but also for mysql sqlite etc

3169983
getter	setter
whenever you replace that delegate with a new one your synthesized setter and getter will handle the release retain for you every time you set it like so

3169983
getter	setter
you can do very powerful things in your own setter and getter synthesize is for those that happen over and over like retained properties etc

3170039
datalist	repeater
the image is in a datalist repeater which has been binded to a folder containing images files

3170046

3170062
single-quotes	backslash
since you re using single-quotes you shouldn t need to escape your backslash

3170100
getter	setter
yes use getter and setter which provide field-like semantics but allow you to execute custom logic when assignment is used

3170112
margin	height
eg float-problems height and margin problems etc

3170118
getter	setter
when you declare property and then synthesize you are instructing the compiler to create the instructions and corresponding symbols for getter and setter for you

3170118
getter	setter
prior to objective-c 2.0 all of the getter and setter methods had to be coded by the developer for every attribute which for most cases was copy paste code

3170150
datediff	difference
write your own datediff -equivalent for each rdbms and abstract away the difference

3170183
turkish	polish
the supported codepages are dos usa dos multilingual windows ansi standard macintosh ee ms-dos nordic ms-dos russian ms-dos icelandic ms-dos kamenicky czech ms-dos mazovia polish ms-dos greek ms-dos 437g turkish ms-dos russian macintosh eastern european macintosh greek macintosh windows ee russian windows turkish windows greek windows

3170186
nsstring	nsobject
you will probably end up using the nsstring and nsobject categories when doing your parsing

3170192
hash	md5
until now i ve been considering asking for a valid md5 hash for every api call but i realized that it wouldn t be a difficult task to hijack such a system

3170265
post	get
additionally firebug is reporting an aborted post request to test_multiple but a successful get request to test_multiple

3170316
daemon	cron	jobs	cron
so when i execute them through cron jobs will they run through the cli interface or some other daemon if thats the right word to use

3170336
ienumerable	iqueryable
ienumerable or iqueryable

3170358
post	get
the aborted post is probably because the xhr request did not get a chance to finish before the server received the normal http get request and starting sending output

3170396
versioning	upgrade
you should probably upgrade to the latest versioning of the sdk versioning 4.0

3170404
gridview	radgrid
to a gridview exactly a telerik s one radgrid

3170487
folder	directory
you can make your own folder and put files into them without cakephp caring where they are as long as they are in the overall correct directory controller if its a controller so if you have a bunch of controllers that say are for doing an action that you think of as updating user profile information then you just create a folder for this and put all those in there and you can do the same for components that relate to this within the component directory .

3170520
set	bag
a set doesn t have an inherent order and cannot contain duplicates it s a bag in which elements are not ordered

3170538
int	chars
you can convert a chars to a hex string by first converting it to an int and then using the x format specifier like this

3170542
integer	unsigned
using enums for representing bit patterns masks and flags is not always a good idea because enums generally promote to signed integer type while for bit-based operation unsigned types are almost always preferable

3170545
superclass	subclassing
we re writing a superclass and we want to make sure its subclassing implement a given method

3170545
subclass	abstract-class
objective-c doesn t have abstract-class and it lacks a mechanism to force a subclass to implement a given method

3170548
folder	directory
copy changed files and svn folder of their parent directory to the wokplace location working folder and commit

3170567
folder	directory
if you want to search your entire directory structure rather than just the folder you are currently in then add xyz.txt

3170620
int	chars
ex your chars hello world and you attempt to cast it into a int

3170656
system.io.compression	sharpziplib
with .net s system.io.compression classes you can apply similar compression as used in zip files deflate gzip to any stream you like but if you want to work with actual zip format files you ll need a third party library like this one sharpziplib

3170716
children	parent
parent li is active and all the children too even when the current is parent li

3170736
mouseover	mouseout
there are some gotchas with mouseover mouseout on elements too the events bubble and you may get them twice unless you do some filtering

3170765
inherited	properties
very often i face the same problem with flex when i create a skin for spark component or create new spark component based on another spark component i have inherited properties that i don t need

3170774
width	margin
when you have specified a width on the object that you have applied margin 0 auto to the object will sit centrally within it s parent container

3170790
folder	directory
files to be changed during application run profiles settings etc. should be stored application data directory in users folder

3170842
spaces	linefeed
linefeed characters within a block element must be converted into a spaces

3170874
post	get
thing is - the php script starts running once the webserver receives the post or get message from the client

3170916
public	protected
instead a better way would be to make the method protected and create a dummy class in your test assembly by inheriting from the class under test and then creating a public method which calls the protected method

3170925
hash	salt
i store the password in the db hash salt and use pdo to prevent against injection

3170961
hide	show
you could initially hide your details links and only show it on mouse hover by hooking an event handler to hover event

3170961
hide	show
that way you can explicitly show hide the anchor based on the corresponding event

3170968
versioning	upgrade
in addition we needed to be able to prove that the upgrade scripts would work no matter which versioning of the application was being upgrade we had no control of the deployment environment or upgrade schedules so it was possible that a given site might need to upgrade from 1.1 to 1.3 skipping 1.2

3170968
versioning	upgrade
my regression test for the database would involve restoring a database dump running the installer to upgrade the database and the dumping the result and splitting the dump into fragments and then comparing the fragments against the committed versioning

3170968
installation	upgrade
if there were any differences then that pointed to problems in the upgrade or installation fragments

3170968
installation	upgrade
during development the developers would run the installation tool to initialize really upgrade their development databases then make their changes

3170968
pull	push
the same scripts could be used bidirectionally so that they could be used to pull data to test from live or push site changes from test to live

3170978
uniq	grep
shell grep tr grep sort uniq sort head perl

3170982
mouse	keyboard
this will cause any calls that attempt to communicate with a screen keyboard mouse etc to fail but also means that you won t need an x server on unix or access to the console on windows

3171045
mouse	keyboard
what i would like to do is make an on-screen keyboard to be used with the mouse -- but in a t9 phone-keypad style to hopefully minimize the number of clicks and amount of moving the mouse around missing targets

3171061
client-side	server-side
i would have suggested but this doesn t help with your code finding out if javascript is supported perhaps with an additional form only outputted in there but this would complicate your client-side and server-side logic

3171066
stdout	stderr
it sends stdout to a pipe and makes stderr goto the same place

3171066
stdout	stderr
combining stdout and stderr like this is generally acceptable for interactive use since they were probably going to the same tty device anyway but it may not be a good idea for use in automated contexts e.g scripts

3171068
extjs	gxt
there is a similar question to this for extjs but not for gxt

3171083
children	parent
or does the parent view controller have to tell it s children when changes are occurring

3171091
pop-up	dialog
with the moss page being rendered in standard mode we use jquery for the modal dialog pop-up

3171143

3171232
portrait	landscape
i have an application in which all viewcontrollers are portrait only 9typical tabbar navigation app but i would like to play a move in fullscreen landscape mode

3171241
int	double
no i am not looking for the answer an int and a double

3171246
int	chars
variations of the bar lengths of one chars compared to other solutions is due to powershell using rounding instead of truncation when converting floating-point numbers into int

3171269
width	height
then change the skin styles width height and padding of image containers according to your image dimensions

3171269
width	height
for example if your images are of size 100x100 then change the image container s width and height as 100px and 100px and add some padding like 10px so that only one image will appear at a time

3171280
post	get
i wanted to post it as a comment but i can figure out how to get the code correct there

3171337
post	get
apparently i can only post one link until i get more reputation so the link below contains the three links i referenced above

3171346
int	double
fundamental types built-in value types such as int and double and

3171392
rsa	aes
the first will will be symmetric aes and will encrypt the license data and the second will be a asymmetric rsa an will encrypt the symmetric key

3171446
salt	md5
same as #1 but rolling your own really elaborate key-generation system run the machine sid or a hardware id through md5 using a randomly-generated salt and then using the result to encrypt the login credentials

3171448
width	height
and it could be set to width height 100

3171455
width	height
dont give height and width attribute to the tag like

3171462
opera	firefox
it works in ie and firefox not opera but opera does not support onbeforeunload in general afaik

3171472
rsa	aes
if your rsa modulus is 1024 bits there is no need for aes key larger than 128 bits

3171488

3171518
dbml	edmx
take a look at my tools - huagati dbml edmx tools

3171519
postgresql	mysql

3171550
hide	show
your toolbar idea sounds good i would hide then show the toolbar when a user moves the mouse like most video players running in full screen

3171567
g++	gcc
note on windows with mingw you ll find the libstdc++ headers in lib gcc mingw32 4.4.0 include c++ bits of your mingw installation replacing 4.4.0 with g++ -dumpversion

3171573
width	height
one way is to refactor for example instead of passing in 4 primitive variables top left width and height just pass in one compound variable rectangle

3171605
ostream	ostringstream	ostream	istream	stringstream	fstream	istream	ostringstream
you should overload the operator for ostream then you can use it naturally for an instance of any class which derives from that - ofstream fstream inherits from iostream which inherits from both istream and ostream ostringstream and stringstream inherits iostream too

3171615
std	ostream
it would make more sense to overload for std ostream

3171646
google-chrome	safari
it may not be the best way to do this but if you can find a js file responsible for dev tools for my google-chrome installation the file is devtools.js for safari 5 - injectedscript.js open it in a text editor look for the function injectedscript._describe

3171653
src	attr
lastly i assume attr src was a typo in your code but if it wasn t then you need to brush up on your javascript so that you know the difference between a variable and a string literal

3171684
getter	setter
it is not uncommon in the flex framework to find code that excludes a property and then overrides the getter and setter to do nothing

3171702
width	height
if you simply want to scale the rectangle around the center of the rectangle then you need to increase the width and height of the rectangle and subtract half the increase from the location

3171725
width	height
i would like to implement a uiscrollview which should hold an image which is the same width as the screen but a lot larger in height

3171750
disk	ram
just think how different an operating system must treat a ram disk compared to a firewire drive compared again to a windows network share

3171806
wxpython	pyqt
for your gui if using python you probably want to use pyqt or wxpython

3171806
mouse	keyboard
the virtual keyboard window will probably have to steal focus to receive mouse events but it will then need to know to which window to send the keystrokes

3171821
automake	autotools
using autotools like automake autoconf etc

3171824
super	self
for the record it s super type self

3171872
super	self
simply remember that the self is optional - super type gives access to unbound superclass methods - and optional arguments always come last

3171889
actionscript	mxml
i suggest creating your xmllist in actionscript not mxml

3171907
folder	directory
along with the css file i ve put them all in a new folder in the themes directory

3171918

3172139
shadowing	named
you re unlikely to be bitten in any given case by the iffy practice of shadowing built-ins named with your own but eventually it will happen as you happen to need the normal meaning of the shadowed named during some later ordinary maintenance operation and you may be in for a confusing debugging situation then

3172139
min	max
file object list dict set min max .

3174161
mouseover	mouseup
1 identify using mouseover mouseup etc

3174212
serializable	deserialization
obviously you can rename the output file afterwards. it s possible that by looking at the serializable format yourself you could avoid some of the processing required by repeated deserialization serializable but i d go for the simple route to start with

3174248
accessor	properties
you can have objective-c properties that are primitive types using either properties or normal accessor

first of all you are not following the beans naming conventions for the getter setter and the fields naming

3174547
abstract-class	superclass	superclass	subclassing
apparently the source of the problem is that abstract-class can t free up methods in their superclass from the need for the abstract-class s subclassing to include the override modifier

3174550
iboutlet	ibaction
i have coded basic functionality where a keyboard pops up on the textview and when you enter text and hit done i am able to capture the text using iboutlet ibaction etc. in a method which shows an alert with the text entered

3174573
width	height
then obtains the height and width of the renderbuffer which was set when calling renderbufferstorage fromdrawable on the context

3174581
implements	extends
you can just extends class1base implements iclass1 with another class

3174612
opera	google-chrome
for example google-chrome and opera would save your file as .htm probably

3174645
post	get
i am beginner in php and i read in manual that is a associative array consisting of cookies get and post arrays

3174653
post	get
the variables in _request are provided to the script via the get post and cookie input mechanisms and therefore could be modified by the remote user and cannot be trusted

3174663
post	get
this directive describes the order in which php registers get post and cookie variables into the _request array

3174668
post	get
except from get post and cookie values php can also associate environment e and server s variables

3174673
post	get
so if you use the same key on post get and cookie there will only be one value in the array and so you can t get the other values out of the _request array

3174694
super	self
the expected behavior would be self.qa attribute vote_down_count is incremented by one but if any exception occurs in the super self save method the transaction rollbacks that means the self.qa.vote_down_count + 1 is not committed in the database

3174694
super	self
the actual behavior is self.qa.vote_down_count + 1 is committed to database even if an integrityerror exception raises from super self save

3174699
rss	feed
i want to have a simple extension that shows the number of new items in a rss feed since the extension was clicked

3174699
rss	feed
it would poll every 2-3 mins for example and if the rss feed is updated it should display a count of how many new items there are

3174705
width	height
without those settings i was getting default column width and default row height of -1

3174733
getter	setter
you should also really fix the naming conventions of the variables and getter setter

3174739
getter	setter
i assume you have all the setter getter in the beans if not add them

3174751
setinterval	settimeout
this works fine but some of these dynamically loaded pages have events hooked to them for settimeout setinterval events etc

3174765
width	height
i ve been using gridlayout but the problem is that it makes all cells of the same width and height which is fine when all components have the same size but when i for example have a textfield and a bordered panel with multiple fields either the textfield gets stretched out or the panel is squeezed

3174789
setinterval	settimeout
use setinterval instead of settimeout

3174817
children	parent
handle wm_setcursor the parent window usually gets the chance to set the cursor for its children if the child window has special handling you would have to subclass it and handle wm_setcursor there

3174866
nsdatecomponents	nsdateformatter
for those finding this question who want to use nsdateformatter to parse 24-hour time and are hitting this bug using nsdatecomponents to parse dates and times which have a known format sidesteps this issue

3174915
rss	feed
i ve had these rss feed running for some time and have just now run into an issue on one of them

3174943
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
the next token represents the salt used for the hash and the last token represents the md5 hash

3174943
hash	md5
this hash is a variation from md5 algorithm

3174950
udp	tcp
after a possible solutions in the internet i found a nice asynchronous tcp and udp socket library here

3174953
versioning	upgrade
i m pretty sure you will need to test the upgrade process using the old versioning installed with a developers profile

3174962
x86	64bit
i ve tried copying both the x86 and the 64bit version of the system.data.sqlite.dll to the output dir as well as referencing them and setting them to copy local but to no avail

3174962
x86	64bit
the vs solution has been set to compile to any x86 64bit but i m still getting the exception

3174994
getter	setter
additionally several smaller features were introduced partial types static classes properties with different access modifiers for getter and setter namespace aliases pragma directives and fixed-sized buffers

3175013
google-chrome	firefox
but it fails if the lines are swapped around neither firefox nor google-chrome appear to attempt loading style.less unless they are ordered correctly

3175028
versioning	upgrade
and it s not possible at the moment to upgrade to a newer versioning of sqlalchemy

3175069
implements	modifiers
taconite implements all the regular jquery dom modifiers in markup and a few extra of its own

3175162
cvs	svn
what you will gain by using version control cvs svn git or anything else is recoverability - you will be able to go back to a version before any breaking change

3175179
qfiledialog	qfileinfo
it uses qfileinfo on the string that was entered in a qfiledialog

3175217
submit	submission
since anybody can submit an implementation of any problem a particularly poor submission has little effect on overall results

3175256
post	get
both get and post requests can be easily exploited for doing a brute force attack

3175261
filtering	grouping	sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping
while this would result in two separate taxonomy fields on the node entry form it fits the semantic difference and would give more flexibility for filtering sorting and grouping the nodes down the road

3175280
boxlayout	miglayout
miglayout has a lot of appeal but boxlayout is an alternative

3175310
public	protected
however the above still applies to both kinds both can easily point to public protected or private members of the class

3175320
umask	chmod
if you must have direct access to the umask either do it via jni and the chmod syscall or spawn a new process with exec chmod

3175379
google-chrome	safari
i d highly recommend using firefox+firebug or safari google-chrome and the developer s toolbar

3175458
maven	pom.xml
maven pom.xml of ear project

3175460
vbscript	jscript
i m trying to do it in vbscript jscript to avoid re-encoding

3175473
gif	png
if you don t need the rest of pil and just want image dimensions of png jpeg and gif then this small function bsd license does the job nicely

3175512
outputstream	inputstream	stdout	stderr
the process object returned from runtime.exec string has methods for getting the inputstream for both stderr and stdout and the outputstream for stdin

3175512
awt	swing
it s used by the swing awt gui too so no problems there

3175534
put	get
put in practice you can get all media items marked in footer like so

3175551
post	get
if you know how to get main module into focus in ghci please post a comment

3175588
width	height
width height src and class

3175588
width	height
remove width and height from

3175631
folder	directory
if you really want to use an app_code folder it might be better to mark the build action of any of the files as content to ensure they are copied to the output directory when publishing your site

3175652
width	height
for example if the original image width is 200 and the image height is 400 it will be scaled to w 50px h 100px thumbnail

3175656
pascal	delphi	division	multiplication
i ve started programming as a kid somewhere between 10 or 13 years ago with programmable calculator moved to basic then onto non-x86 assembly reimlementing multiplication and division and writing self-modifying mouse driver was fun pascal delphi now i m using c++ almost exclusively

3175656
maya	3dsmax
as far as i know this language is not really widely used as a result there probably is less libraries it can interface with as it was with delphi programming - you can do directx programming in delphi if you really want but you can t write 3dsmax maya plugin with it well it is probably theoretically possible but it certainly won t be easy

3175657
post	get
you ll have to develop an api between the two a very simple one will work using post get as you first thought is a right way to go here

3175658
maven	pom.xml
practically spoken i d create a maven artifact for this driver just a basic pom.xml file and place it on the build servers maven repository or the nexus if you use it for the projects

3175697
public	protected
â¹ all public protected internal private protected internal

3175709
width	height
plus a ton more code namespaces etc that is unnecessary to this situation but the problem i have is that i need to somehow alter that width and height from 256px to arbitrary size using javascript

3175716
haskell	scheme
my mind was blown when i noticed what i was thinking - i would never have missed it if i didn t know what it was and i wouldn t known what it was if i didn t take a look at scheme haskell ruby

3175743
super	self
super a self looks in self.__class__.__mro__ for the next class after a

3175743
super	self
so super a self returns a super object which behaves like b as far as attribute lookup is concerned

3175743
super	self
super a self .check thus calls b.check

3175785
range	minimum
so that k bits are encoded in n bits. in this range first a random code is likely to have very good minimum distance

3175785
range	minimum
concerning upper bounds for the minimum hamming distance in the range n â k you should start with the hamming bound also known as the volume bound or the sphere packing bound

3175823
oncreate	onstart	onresume	onpause
in the view where the name and email are entered i looked to see if onstart oncreate onpause onresume .

3175834
jtextfield	jtextpane
neither jtextpane nor jtextfield isn t able to present formatted text i.e text having more than one format

3175834
jtextpane	jeditorpane
for text-editor-like capabilities like you d find in wordpad or html the component to use is the jeditorpane or its descendant jtextpane

3175863
awt	swing
minimum size in awt and swing is usually pointless

3175873
portrait	landscape
if i load the subview in portrait mode then rotate the iphone it rotates to landscape no problem

3175904
free	malloc
the memory for the struct instance foo2 will be allocated on the stack - there s no need to allocate memory for this yourself - if you do allocate using malloc be sure to free off the memory at a later date

3175913
int	double
it doesn t matter if what s stored there is an int or a double or a struct or anything

3175961
google-chrome	firefox
with google-chrome and firefox the only issue that i had was the var alert being the same name as the alert call

3175966
min	max
the error reported is progressbar1.value should be between max and min

3175975
pascal	delphi
extpascal is an object pascal delphi

3176004
implements	extends
let s say that in the framework i have a shape interface and the users are free to implements and extends adding new functions the shape interface to create their own figures square and circle

3176011
width	height
the problem with this is that a clutter ignores the new size and only draws into the old width height and b the rgba vs argb32 thing kind of causes a colour meltdown

3176042
int	double
this includes all .net basic primitive types like int double string datetime and any classes built from those

3176049
apache	nginx
btw nginx or apache

3176090
width	height
basically when in portrait mode i want the complete width to be used and video height to be used

3176090
portrait	landscape
i have noticed that this setting works well on mytouch for both portrait and landscape

3176090
portrait	landscape
and this works on droid for both portrait and landscape

3176093
tcpclient	networkstream
as far as i m aware the tcpclient makes the connection and i can then use the networkstream instance to read and write to that connection

3176188
int	double
the storage is as a double with the int part indicating the day since 12 30 1899 and the decimal part the time portion within the day

3176217
width	height
if the sub-images do fit in the larger image you should be able to avoid scaling by choosing your width and height such that they are the same as that of the subimage of course in this case you are better of using g.drawimage image img int x int y imageobserver observer

3176264
xsd.exe	svcutil.exe
i tried using both svcutil.exe and xsd.exe to create the classes and they both give the main elements caseno activity etc. but neither seems to handle the xs any of datafields .

3176277
rss	feed
i ve got a simple little chrome extension that displays links to some rss feed items

3176287
yelp	twitter
so i m looking how to make a similar button group for an application on the iphone that looks like the buttons in the yelp about me page or twitter for mobile application on the profile pages

3176358
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it seems that using line-height can push it down through trial and error with different values but the result isn t consistent across browsers i can get them flush in safari and google-chrome but then firefox looks different

3176384
teamcity	nant
i am using msdeploy to transfer my changes via a nant script in teamcity that i make to a site and it is great

3176394
button	checkbox
for example was it submitted via a list menu radio button text field textarea or checkbox

3176425
post	get
get or post

3176439
post	get
as far as i know urllib and urllib2 only support get and post requests

3176442
put	get
even worse when i try to put this same code into an xpcom component because that s where i actually need it after i try sending a message via telnet i get

3176457
actionscript	mxml
you won t get mxml code hinting for them but you ll have no problems using addeventlistener in actionscript

3176461
codeigniter	yii
i ve used both codeigniter and yii on my own projects if that makes any difference

3176461
codeigniter	yii
when i needed to add a few new features to the old codeigniter sites it was faster to rewrite the entire sites on yii than to code up the extra features in codeigniter

3176483
put	get
the best way would be to write a wrapper around localstorage much like what jquery does to dom nodes and use that wrapper to get and put items in local storage

3176507
submit	submission
using your example of numbers dashes and letters as being acceptable subdomains you could do something similar to the following probably run when the submit button on the form is clicked and if the match fails then cancel the submission

3176517
unix	bsd
on unix based systems linux bsd os x etc. you can set sendmail_path to something like

3176573
put	get
that will probably help you get the big picture for your application right and show you more easily how to put together the pieces like do x when this value changes and put the value for that in a text field than trying to learn only the pieces you think you need as you think you need them

3176574
width	height
one thing you can do is measure the height and width of the fonts in system.drawing.text and create a sort of pre-renderer in code to figure out if the text will cause the table to flow off-screen

3176574
width	margin
there would be a bit to keep track of like at what width will the fonts wrap and create a new line and then space between the lines and the margin of the cells

3176577
portrait	landscape
i ve managed to default the application s orientation to landscape however in the ipad simulator when i do command- arrow the application rotates to portrait

3176635
min	max
i suppose that it was left out because you already have min and max so you can accomplish it using them

3176646
min	max
i like guffa s answer but i am surprised that no one has yet posted a solution using min max

3176663
post	get	urllib	httplib
i ve been using httplib and urllib urllib2 to connect to the website and post my login details and things like that but i really don t know how to get that value from the page

3176728
width	height
2 store the absolute position top left and the width and height of each item in an array generate a position randomly

3176738
debian	linux
it prints the same output on mac os x and on linux debian testing

3176759
min	max
this might lead to subtle bugs later which are difficult to debug especially when min max values are determined at run time

3176774
hide	show
i derive from the grid an add an icommand called hideshowcolumncommand that takes as its parameter a datagridcolumn the one i want to hide or show and hide the column if it is visible and show it if it is not

3176808
nstextfield	nsslider
ok so i have an nstextfield and an nsslider

3176808
nstextfield	nsslider
in interface builder i got the float value from the nsslider to go into the nstextfield

3176811
for-loop	loops
you can loops over them in a for-loop and use or you use another foreach loops

3176821
put	get
and once i get past that basic step i need to figure out how to do it programmatically so i can put the aircraft s position in a location relative to the station based on an input parameter

3176864
activemq	rabbitmq
compare this to queue software such as rabbitmq and activemq with persistent queues

3176940
int	chars
it has one drawback but i believe it s ok with the question as it compute an int divider to make line shorter than 80 chars the longest line is shorter than 80 chars not exactly 80 chars

3176957
free	malloc
in this example i ve used malloc and free to do all the allocating you could use new std nothrow and delete just as easily

3176960
uwsgi	cherokee
i got cherokee + uwsgi + django running on lucid

3176975
mouseleave	mouseenter
one way is to handle the mouseenter and mouseleave events with triggers and use them to scale the image up

3177063
implements	extends
since you already have an http server implements you may want to read up on webdav and see if you can extends cocoahttpserver to support it

3177122
folder	directory
i have a folder in the webroot at which i m password protecting with the directory password protection feature in cpanel which i guess uses some form of htacccess

3177155

wordpress	joomla
a few of them are drupal joomla wordpress

3177227
children	parent
parent contains a list of children

3177242
mouseup	mousedown
if you need to do something periodically while the mouse is down have mousedown create a repeating timer and have mouseup tear it down

3177268
qtextcursor	qtextdocument
i have done the creation pdf files using qtextdocument qtextcursor and qprinter

3177273
mouseup	mousedown
if you just want to know whether the mouse is down or not set a bool variable in mousedown and mouseup

3177278
put	get
i like to put together a cheat sheet of libraries and select methods examples for the students so they get a sense of the python universe and how much is available

3177347
put	get
the idea being you can copy an image then copy text and they both get put in the clipboard so you can then go to an image program hit paste and it will paste the image then go to a text program hit paste and it will paste the text

3177491
folder	directory
my recommendation as css image url s are relative to the css file itself is to have an images folder in the same directory as the css file itself

3177526
addclass	removeclass
but aside from hiding showing elements you generally want to just change the class es of an element using addclass removeclass toggleclass as others have mentioned

3177538
getter	setter
here s a very good article on the recently standardized property getter setter highlighting some previous non-standard incarnations

3177538
getter	setter
summary there s no standard catch-all getter setter yet but object.defineproperty is the future

3177547

3177582
hide	show
i have used a javascript to show div by onclick but when i click outside div i want to hide the div

3177590
post	get
but assuming that you want to get post probably the actual code should look like

3177609
cos	sin
i used to write this code for motion control but the when i run it the graphs are not correct because they should be something linke sin or cos graph

3177664
getter	setter
for example let s assume you have some getter setter functions and they re used by many interfaces and functionality they provide is cannot be named with a -able postfix

3177691
google-chrome	firefox
i have been testing this code for the last two days it works in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

3177705
versioning	upgrade
the copy module is unfortunately not written to be customized so the alternative ares either copy-paste-edit or a subtle sigh monkey-patch hinging on double-sigh the private module variable _deepcopy_dispatch which means your patched versioning might not survive a python versioning upgrade say from 2.6 to 2.7 hypothetically

3177716
gif	png
all image formats like jpg png and gif also

3177730
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade the sdk versioning to 4.0

3177737
sorting	filtering
it s quite capable of sorting paging dynamically updating data ajax filtering .

3177751
uiview	subviews
setting the frame for uiview with clipping subviews true

3177780
portrait	landscape
in fact while moving from portrait to landscape i removed the tabbarcontroller from window subview and add the landscapeviewcontroller instead

3177780
portrait	landscape
instead i add the landscapeviewcontroller as subview of the tabbarcontroller and remove it when going from landscape to portrait

3177930
afp	smb
the server would have to be afp smb or webdav as these are the protocols that finder can mount - i couldn t find any such servers

3178021
typhoeus	feedzirra
if you want fast fetching and parsing go for feedzirra if you are dealing with feeds or typhoeus for fetching just the html content

3178025
maven	m2e
if you re using m2e don t use the maven eclipse plugin eclipse eclipse import your project as an existing maven projects

3178037
doc	odf
maybe you can use this and write to a file in odf format qt does not know how to output doc docx etc but you can use com activeqt or some other library to write in those or other formats you need

3178053
min	max
better to wrap usergroupid also in a max min or other aggregate function

3178061
put	get
if you put a trailing comma after the print statement you ll get what you need

3178076
disk	ram
in fact the exception code might not end up in ram at all and stay on disk

3178087
bazaar	svn
after that bazaar svn can use this password

3178163
int	double
regardless of what f returns the static type is b so the compiler will lookup in b class and find b foo double int

3178230
min	max
you are able to use mylist.max and mylist.min to get max and min values

3178231
google-chrome	firefox
when i run the script as is firefox presents me with a blank page and google-chrome and ie give me a missing picture box

3178246
tinyint	boolean
but if you just need a simple boolean use tinyint 1

3178253
client-side	server-side
i m relatively new to soap and using the same classes for my data on the server-side and the client-side seems to be a good idea please correct me if my approach is missing something

3178276
gdal	ogr
you may want the gdal ogr libs to do this with python and after you ve installed those it s easier to just use the ogr2ogr utility as explained at

3178309
int	boolean
i m building an hierarchy of objects that wrap primitive types e.g int boolean floats etc as well as container types like vectors maps and sets

3178339

g++	gcc
on a related note what is the difference between gcc and g++

3178367
rsa	aes
an rsa private key that encrypts my aes key

3178374
g++	gcc
use g++ instead of gcc

3178376
g++	gcc
and to answer your other question that is the difference between gcc and g++

3178386
g++	gcc
and the c++ compiler driver is called g++ if you use the gcc driver you will have linker problems as the standard c++ libraries will not be linked by default

3178391
ceil	math.h
you use the standard ceil and ceilf functions available i math.h

3178406
int	double
if your data is in int in the first place then you ll either have to find a clever trick or convert your int to double first

3178419
pull	push
so before you push your code to the parent repository you first pull the latest changes merge on your side and try to push

3178430
pull	push
whenever i would bring one branch to a stable state say - finish a refactoring i would pull from the server merge that branch into the pulled changes then push it back to the server and let anyone know that if they made any changes to the affected files they should pull first from the server

3178462
width	height
the solution i came up with was to use gettextbounds to work out the width of the text and ascent descent from fontmetricsint to work out the height

3178493
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu

3178541
pascal	delphi
if you want to keep your delphi pascal object background and have a web like ria you also have a look to morfik link text

3178544
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the code below works fine in firefox google-chrome safari but it works incorrect in ie7 opera

3178649
post	get
i mean get post related to user_id 4 like an example query using user_id attribute

3178670
superclass	subclassing
after all the persistence provider knows which subclassing there are of that mapped superclass so makes little sense to not allow the user such a facility

3178741
jboss	glassfish
i m currently trying to port my java ee 5 application from jboss 6 m2 to glassfish 3.0.1

a parent can have multiple children

3179019
inject	interceptor
the interceptor is working when i m marking the attribute of inject

3179062

you can also re-work this a bit not sure of your overall intentions for example you can hide all of them then show the value your selected instead of an if for each option making your code much shorter

3179100
pdfbox	itext
as far as i know there are two most popular libraries like itext and apache s pdfbox

3179111
spaces	delimiter
i assume spaces is a delimiter for words so the following code should find the first 2000 words in a string or break out if there are fewer words

3179155
children	parent
any item can be parent of another item and can have multiple children

3179171
children	parent
you could define a parent job and use it to launch all the children job maven jobs with a dependency tree

3179176
mouseleave	mouseenter
work_tumb is where you want to implement the mouseenter mouseleave event

3179212
hide	show
i m programming my own webchromeclient class overriding onprogresschanged method because i want to show the page when it finishes loading and then to hide the splash screen

3179242
greenhopper	sprint
when using greenhopper with jira it is clear that greenhopper is using the fixed in version field in the jira issues to represent which scrum sprint the issue is being worked on

3179242
greenhopper	sprint
and making three different sprint in greenhopper would really dilute the value of greenhopper

3179246
post	get
you can use the post method instead of get to hide all the variables and values

3179251

3179454
ssl	https
so when the other sites are accessed with https then they are redirected to the ssl site which is incorrect

3179457
range	minimum
after that use numerical methods to find minimum and maximum of the function - this should give you the resulting range

3179457
min	max
edit only in the case that your final expression is not continuous the above would not work and you would have to divide into continuous sections for each you would have to find min and max

3179478
client-side	server-side
edit if possible i search for a client-side solution in java or javascript rather than a server-side one

3179508
width	height
there you will find width which defaults to 8.5 and height which defaults to 11

3179565
tolower	toupper
the easiest way to do this is when they register change both un and pw to either toupper or tolower and then when you are authenticating do the same to whatever they enter

3179569
coldfusion	railo
we re using windows 2008 and we are thinking of switching application servers from adobe coldfusion 9 to railo 3.1

so how can i know whether i data that i have received is a nsstring object converted into nsdata or it s uiimage data converted into nsdata

3179934
post	get
you will get this error when you re trying to obtain a non-cached post request from the browser history

3179934
post	get
to fix this problem you need to either turn the cache on or to replace post by get

3179934
post	get
the enduser will then only get a warning dialog that the post data will be resent to the server which in case of fully non-idempotent requests like placing an order or deleting an item is really not desirable

3179934
post	get
replacing post by get is then a better solution

3179934
post	get
replacing post by get isn t easy in jsf prior to version 2.0

3179975
put	get
1+ log10 of num calculates the number of digits a number is we floor it to remove any decimal values put it as the exponent so for a 1 digit number we get 10 0 1 or a 8 digit number we get 10 8

3179981
vlookup	countif
this may sound a bit complicated but especially in large tables vlookup countif s etc can be very time consuming

3180044
ssl	https
in both scenarios data with https is encrypted from both the server to the client and client to the server using a session key once the ssl handshake has been completed

3180067
children	parent
children always inherit attributes from the parent

3180077
width	height
i store x and y in the object directly because it is used by several components but width and height are only known to the rendering component which holds the object s bitmap

3180077
width	height
so an object has a width and a height which are 0 or -1 by default but a rendering component can set them to the correct values in its update loop

3180087
inherited	subclassing
one tell-tale sign of inherited being used improperly is when you have a lot of base functions which are not applicable to your subclassing

jstl	taglib
the use of scriptlets those things in jsp is indeed highly discouraged since the birth of taglib like jstl and el expression language those things over a decade ago

3180202
jsf	wicket
or just adopt a mvc framework like jsf spring mvc wicket etc so that you end up with just a jsp facelets page and a javabean class without the need for a custom servlet

3180202
jstl	taglib
if you want to invoke some java code to control the flow inside a jsp page then you need to grab an existing flow control taglib like jstl core

3180202
jstl	taglib
there s a standard functions taglib in jstl but you can also easily create functions yourself

3180215
int	double

3180292
free	malloc
if the library isn t too badly optimized specifically function inlining you could disassemble it and locate the malloc and free functions

3180311
width	height
you need to specify the units for your width and height

3180317
width	height
the definition of height and width should be in pixels em s or percentages e.g

3180329
width	height
you haven t specified the units of measure for the height and width attributes in your css

3180389
hash	md5
md5 hash of a 0cc175b9c0f1b6a831c399e269772661

3180538
filtering	grouping
the db records will be queried sorted filtering grouping summaried and possibly updated by the end users

3180565
interpreted-language	compiled-language
java seeks to find a compromise between a purely compiled-language with no portability and a purely interpreted-language that is significantly slower

3180565
interpreted-language	compiled-language
by operating this way java gets some of the benefits of compiled-language while also getting some of the benefits of interpreted-language

3180604
entity-relationship-model	datamodel	entity-relationship	diagram
i have had good results by using an entity-relationship entity-relationship-model and diagram for data analysis and an rdm relational datamodel model and diagram to reflect database design

3180604
entity-relationship	diagram
the entity-relationship diagram is useful for communicating the requirements discovered so far back to the clients and making sure they are complete and correct

3180604
entity-relationship	diagram
entity-relationship diagram are easy to understand even if the client has no background in database theory

3180604
entity-relationship	diagram
its easy to derive an rdm model from an entity-relationship model although you have to throw in some design decisions that are intentionally omitted from the entity-relationship diagram

3180615
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
if you re not looking to protect with with authentication via django you can serve it up with your http server nginx lighttpd apache etc - this reduces server impact

in my particular case i am trying to bind the property of a dependencyobject that lives in an observablecollection that is a property of a frameworkelement

3180637
int	double
it must be able to take int and double and be able to handle small ranges under 1 and large ranges over 10000 etc

3180652
innodb	myisam
all this works perfect when i had my database use myisam but when i changed over to innodb i now have to account for my foreign key or the mysql_queries won t successfully execute

3180666
accessor	properties
i have used properties and synthesize to declare and define its accessor methods

3180672
ienumerable	ilist
ienumerable is less specific than an ilist that is ilist has functions that ienumerable does not

3180680
sequence	permutation
the function permutation takes a generic sequence e as well as a generic comparison function and lazily yields immutable permutation lexicographically

3180683
post	get
hope that helps please post more information so we can get the details worked out

3180696
ilist	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection
an ilist has the methods for changing the items like add maybe you want to select between icollection and ienumerable

3180696
ienumerable	icollection
the icollection extends ienumerable and has the count property available that can be useful

3180825
int	double
getvalue should be used for retrieving int double bool and string values which works great in c# by using convert.changetype ...

3180826
expression-blend	silverlight
so if you decide to write a silverlight application you will have to use xaml files and use expression-blend to design your ui

3180842
post	put
from the other post on here i was able to put together a regex

3180874
google-chrome	firefox
i have just set up jplayer and it is working on google-chrome but not on ie or firefox

3180982
superclass	subclassing
use a one to zero or one relationship as you note in database schema design language the tables are called class - subclassing or superclass

3181010
google-chrome	firefox
note tested in firefox and google-chrome only

3181040
try-catch	exception-handling
early today i discovered function try-catch blocks from here in fact and then went on a bit of a research spree - apparently they re main use is it catch exception-handling throw in by a constructor initialiser list

3181072
inherited	subclassing
one table representing objects in the entire inherited hierarchy with all the columns you d need for the entire hierarchy plus a type column to tell you which subclassing a particular object is

3181072
inherited	subclassing
one table for each class in your inherited hierarchy â you now have an animal table and subclassing have foreign keys that point to the common set of data in animal

3181093
feof	fread
you should not use feof to loop on - instead use the return value of fread - loop until it returns zero

3181114
versioning	upgrade
i d strongly urge you to upgrade your weblogic as soon as possible especially if you re still using the versioning of jdk that it was certified for

3181137
ddms	adb
please use the android.util.log class and send your debugging output to logcat available via adb logcat ddms or the ddms perspective in eclipse

3181145
icns	ico
i want to add an icon icns ico to a file within my iphone app and i m not quite sure where to start looking

3181165
dictionary	map
i suppose you could find out how the csidl map to paths using something like shgetknownfolderpath build a reverse dictionary of them then check whether the beginning of the path you want to store matches any of the keys in the dictionary and then remove the beginning and store the csidl that matched

3181203
for-loop	arrays
iterate through an arrays with a regular for-loop not a for...in otherwise it enumerates through the arrays s properties since its still an object and has other properties in addition to the elements inside

3181224
post	put
looks like you might be able to test the raw xml put and post data without too much trouble

3181224
post	put
if a post or put request has an xml content-type then the input is taken and passed to an instance of cake s xml object which is assigned to the data property of the controller

3181261
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
see here - substitute the uitabbarcontroller for a uinavigationcontroller

3181278
superclass	subclassing
also if the class has a superclass you could alter the behavior of program startup by changing a superclass since superclass constructors must be called before subclassing perhaps unintentionally

3181312
portrait	landscape
in this case there is 1 view that is best suited to landscape view and 1 view that is best suited to portrait view

3181312
portrait	landscape
from a user perspective you wouldn t need to be switching back and forth much you tend to use the landscape view to change location if you need to and then work mainly in the portrait view - so i don t think it would be frustrating and dropping the tabs seems to make more sense to me

3181321
rss	feed
i m sharing models and some utility code that fetches data from rss feed and evernote

3181370
post	get
run a server side script in php perl .net or anything that takes inputs like from to subject body from get post arguments and send the mail

3181374
getter	setter	equals	tostring	tostring	getter
a bit decent ide eclipse netbeans etc can just autogenerate equals hashcode and also tostring getter and setter for you

3181428
listview	gridview
it is not possible with the toolkit datagrid or gridview for a listview no

3181429
memcached	apc
i suggest either memcached or apc for that purpose

3181430
rss	feed
twitter feed from twitter through rss feed on that person s twitter

3181446
rss	feed
take a look at the actual twitter api not just rss feed

3181486
union	distinct
note that union already does a distinct so there s no need to do it again the count and force another sort

3181488
put	get
it seems only if i put the class taskpool2 in a separate assembly i get the compile error

3181583
openssl	crypto++
i want to be able to base64 decode data and since boost.asio links to openssl i want to use it s functions to do so and not add an extra dependency eg crypto++

3181591
bitconverter	binaryreader
you can use bitconverter to convert integers into bytes - or just use binarywriter for writing and binaryreader for reading

3181671
folder	directory
this project would simply be a pom file at the root directory of your project the same level as all the sub-modules folder which references the sub-projects and has the shade plugin configuration

3181692
rss	feed
i ve written a simple extension for safari that captures clicks on the rss button in the address bar calls to the feed protocol and redirects to google reader instead of safari s feed reader

3181694
int	double
decimal is an int scaled by a power of 10 while the float and double types are scaled by powers of 2

3181696
memcached	apc
look into apc if you re using a single server or memcached if you have multiple servers

3181699
children	parent
if so i suggest to pass the interface orientation messages from the parent to the children viewcontrollers as you suggested

3181701
mouseleave	mouseenter
create your own component derived from the tcustompanel or tpanel since delphi 6 doesn t have the mouseenter and mouseleave events on by default you can add them yourself

3181701
mouseleave	mouseenter
afterwards it is all about handling the mouseenter and mouseleave events

3181760
children	parent
i need to set up a ui to add items children to a list parent from the list create edit form

3181806
integer	fractions
another is to use a fractions type which stores an integer numerator and denominator

3181807
feedback	review
if this is an api that s going to be used by many then perhaps opening it up to some review might give you valuable feedback since they presumably know the api domain quite well

3181886
scrollable	panels
i am not looking into the screen capture because the panels is within the scrollable control devx controls so at times it may not be fully visible and i need its visual representation whether visible or not

3181888
children	parent
i do fine getting the program to calculate fitness values select parent produce children then mutate the children

3181890
width	height
so i created a rectanglestyle that uses bindings to set the width height x translation and y translation for a rectangle

3181890
width	height
the width and height bindings are working fine but i m getting the following error for the translatetransform bindings

3181926
subtract	add
note you can t just add subtract hours due to daylight savings

3181928
mouse	keyboard
while it s certainly possible to implement controls using the keyboard i m also wondering if it s possible to make relative mouse movement work in html5

3181936
put	get
but when i take the exact same code and pull it from my previous work and put it into visual studio 2010 express i get a connection error

3181977
iboutlet	ibaction
i am able to enter text to the textview and capture the value through an iboutlet and ibaction

3182084
punctuation	words
if you surround the words with them it will match only that words whether it s followed by or prefixed with a punctuation character or whitespace

3182139
folder	directory
what seems easiest is to just have a directory on my site in which there is a folder for every user

3182179
google-chrome	safari
regardless best what you can do as quick test is to try a different webbrowser msie8 google-chrome or safari and play surf the website

3182191
post	put
the visual studio project upgrade wizard takes care of most things but it did lose a few pre post build steps which we had to manually put back in place

3182274
short	base
it will certainly be easier in the short run but as you said will become a nightmare very quickly trying to maintain almost-identical code base

3182325
awt	swing
have a look at the awt swing event model in java for example

3182371
post	get
this post from the visual studio blog may also get you started with dealing with the in memory code file

3182486
int	chars
it s theoretically possible that an has a smaller sizeof than a for example if int has stricter alignment requirements than chars this could be a reasonable thing to do

3182505
iboutlet	ibaction
you then connect the ibaction to the button in interface builder and your iboutlet to your textfield

3182510
put	get
i think we are just trying to figure out why you need to put the php session id in your get request

3182510
put	get
there s no need to put it in your get request

3182532
equals	gethashcode
depending on your error class you may also need to override equals and gethashcode to use value semantics

3182542
googletest	gmock
i d like to have the files compiled into the test application i m using gmock + googletest

3182618
post	put
it s simple enough to manage post delete and put requests since these won t differ at all from a traditional approach

3182618
post	put
post delete and put are semantically incorrect for this sort of task

3182618
put	get
yet another alternative is just to prepare all the relevant data for each get query like you would in a regular non-ajax page and put it all together leaving figuring out what s significant new to the client possibly through a last-modified item in each json array

3182635
apache	lighttpd
finding out the list of files that the server is delivering to one specific client or all clients simultaneously would depend on both the web or ftp server software apache iis lighttpd etc. and the os linux windows mac os x server etc.

3182653
public	protected
now if you read the naming conventions in the msdn for c# you will notice that it states that properties are always preferred over public and protected fields

3182653
public	protected
i have even been told by some people that you should never use public or protected fields

3182669
public	protected
properties i can think of two reasons for prefering properties in the public interface protected is also public in the sense that someone else than just your class can see it

3182669
getter	setter
if the getter setter is the usual one line piece of code that simply reads sets the value of a field then the jit should be able to inline the call so there is no performance overhad

3182669
public	protected
in fact this allows you to make for example set protected and get public very easily so this can be even more elegant than using fields

3182671
public	protected
public and or protected fields are bad because they can be manipulated from outside the declaring class without validation

3182673
hide	show
also one little trick i figured out is whenever you do these show hide style popover menus oftentimes you don t really get to much opportunity to clean up after all the dismissals

3182722
switching	screens
it will be very bad ui if you block the screens and don t switching to next image until it is fetched

3182724
equals	gethashcode
i ve read that in order to get caching and push performance when using an interceptor selector when using castle dynamic proxy that i need to override gettype gethashcode and equals

3182728
post	get
i can t post images inline till i get 10 points - sorry for link

3182749
uidatepicker	uipickerview
uidatepicker doesn t inherit from uipickerview so they don t have api

3182749
uidatepicker	uipickerview
however the documentation does state that uidatepicker manages a custom picker-view object as a subview which means you could traverse a uidatepicker s subviews until you found a uipickerview

3182809
cvs	svn
this question would apply to any version control system mercurial subversion svn cvs etc

3182839
hide	show
i want to create a view menuitem with a checkable menuitem for each of my dockablecontents that will show hide each item

3182840
opera	firefox
and although the element is removed the styles are still applied to the current page in both opera and firefox

3182877
ant	maven
we use gradle and chose it over maven and ant

3182877
ant	maven
ant gave us total flexibility and ivy gives better dependency management than maven but there isn t great support for multi-project builds

3182877
ant	maven
with gradle you can have the flexibility of ant and build by convention of maven

3182877
gradle	ivy
finally gradle uses ivy so it has excellent dependency management

3182897
hide	show
swing does not auto-dispose the frames windows in case you want to reuse them show hide multiple times

3182913
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
this has always worked perfectly until i wrote and called a c# dll that in turn called an openfiledialog and a savefiledialog

3182930
emacs	aquamacs
i m a newbie with emacs so be explicit i use aquamacs on mac os x 10.6 if that makes any difference

3182940
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
if not then i think the best you can do is to start up your own thread in which you can control the apartment it runs in via coinitializeex null coinit_apartmentthreaded and then call openfiledialog savefiledialog from there

3182943
put	get
if i can get hibernate to put them into some kind of non-entity value object that d be great

3182963

try using the mousedown and mouseup events

3182979
mouseup	mousedown
you need to handle the mousedown and mouseup events

3182999
for-loop	arrays
you could do this with a for-loop and an arrays acting as a stack

3183042
ciimage	nsimage
colormapimage needs to be a ciimage and not an nsimage iirc

3183086
pull	push
every copy is created equal and they can push and pull using that terminology changes from each other on an ad-hoc basis

3183098
pull	push
you need not set up a server at all you can push pull changes through ssh or even email patches to each other this can be done directly from the vcs but is sort of a hassle

3183140
postgresql	mysql
i have used mongodb redis more than key-value pair supports list set and sorted set tokyo tyrant memcached and mysql postgresql

3183140
jobs	cron
if you use nosql take occasional backup or schedule cron jobs for db backup

3183152
min	max
i know the names of all fields their types int string date etc and maybe also min max

3183194
packets	multicast
send the udp packets to the multicast address for the group in use

3183194
packets	multicast
further info i have is that i may need to bind to several interfaces and tell the socket using setsockopt that it should also receive multicast packets

3183476
maven	m2e
i ask this question because i am experimenting with maven and was a bit surprised to find that even when using the m2e plugin it s not really feasible to turn off eclipse s java builder and delegate the whole build process to maven while working on the project

3183481
put	get
if i understand this correctly you could simply put all this information in two tables user and friends because as far as i know it is a lot more efficient to get larger chunks of data with few queries than smaller chunks of data with many queries

3183492

3183759
maven	pom.xml
you can extend maven through the pom.xml and inject some additional mechanisms if you want to

3183759
maven	pom.xml
if you get a little more complex it s often most effective to start using multi-module pom.xml and maven setups to get functional tests integrated and running with the rest of the code

3183847
portrait	landscape
i am developing a universal app in which each view displays a different image depending on whether the device is in portrait or landscape orientation

3183847

3183868
hash	salt

free	malloc
other than that don t forget that when you call malloc you get raw memory - no constructor is invoked - and when you call free no destructor is invoked

3184155
qobject	qpointer
if the receiver needs to store it only a qpointer would help but then myclass needs to derive from qobject which looks wrong from the context

3186304
google-chrome	safari
while i suppose there is something blindingly obvious wrong here to a fresh pair of eyes i am deeply confused why submission with or without validation makes a duplicate post to the server in google-chrome and safari

3186336
put	get
that is it looks like we cannot have a thread waiting in the put method as well as the get method because for that to be true then the following would have to be true

3186640
realloc	calloc
at the moment it s possible that there is some space after stringarray into which you are storing the wordlength-arraylength extra pointers when you calloc them and realloc doesn t move stringarray

3186640
calloc	malloc
it s quite probable that 0xb49010 is one of the pointers you calloc d and you re overwritten the memory where malloc keeps its block size

invokelater	invokeandwait
or replace invokelater with invokeandwait

3187112
folder	directory
the location will be a new folder in the jobs directory

3187130
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome and ie 8 i see that the page is loaded twice when 1 2 or 3 is clicked on

3187164
telerik	radwindow
maybe the radwindow by telerik will suite you

3187168
width	height
for 1920x1080 the aspect ratio becomes 1.77 meaning that any image displayed at a specific pixel width and height will be a different size in inches due to the scaling effect of the aspect ratio

3187269
serializable	deserialization
so before saving to db all data collected during the process are kept in memory as model s properties using serializable deserialization

3187276
int	chars
main has two parameters int argc and chars argv which you can use to access to the command line parameters

3187276
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv ..

3187337
draggable	droppable
i have a list of tasks that are all draggable and droppable

3187337
move	drag
when i start dragging one task the other tasks don t light up as expected except when the mouse is not actually above the draggable helper this is possible because i have specified axis y so that i can move the cursor left and right of the helper without breaking the drag session

3187378
children	parent
i need a solution for this how to intercept iset.add method so i don t need to do children.parent parent but jus parent.children.add children

3187416
children	parent
the save command saves any changes since the last save whether it be creation modification or deletion of parent children or a mix

3187416
children	parent
delete deletes whatever is currently selected â one or more parent one or more children or even selected text within an attribute text box contents

3187416
children	parent
you donâ t want them thinking theyâ re deleting a child when they are in fact deleting the parent along with all its children

3187416
children	parent
look at file managers such as windows explorer where the folders are the parent and the files are the children for other ideas for distinguishing active from selected

3187417
actionscript	mxml
the invalidate commitproperties model used by mxml components is very useful in my experience and i d like to be able to make use of it in domain model objects in my actionscript applications

3187466
actionscript	mxml
everytime i feel the need to use an interface i always wind up making an actionscript and not an mxml file because i don t know if how you can

3187496
virtualenv	yolk
when i use yolk from within a virtualenv i get the following

3187506
post	get
like danben says you need to post the error to get meaningful help

3187517
free	malloc
it s invalid to access the malloc d memory after you free it therefore it s invalid to try to print

3187524
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
the solution below was tested on ie 8.0.6 firefox 3.6.6 opera 10.53 and safari 4 on an ms windows xp machine

3187528
free	malloc
when you are done with stringiwanttokeep you free it as though it was originally malloc d

3187532
clang	llvm
phoronix did some benchmarks about this but it is about a snapshot version of clang llvm from a few months back

3187566
actionscript	mxml
for the sake of completeness an mxml component can implement an interface just like an actionscript component ca

3187569
daemons	launchd
i cannot assume that the user building the application has installed the mongodb dameon as a service and therefore need to launchd the daemons prior to the execution of the related unit tests

3187569
daemons	launchd	folder	directory
my first thought was to store the binaries in the resources folder of the test directory src test resources and launchd the daemons using runtime.exec

3187579
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
if you supply this software to customers or even remote sites within your organization and the installation and upgrading happens in the field then it s reasonable that each new versioning of your software should upgrade the database by itself

3187628
actionscript	mxml
you are correct there is no way to implement a true interface using mxml edit i stand corrected you can use the implements keyword as described in the other answers. another approach to consider is to use a code behind actionscript file for each of your 4 mxml files

3187646
inherited	properties
first thing let s understand how static properties are inherited

3187646
superclass	subclassing
inherit_static_prop is called for each one of the superclass static properties so that can be copied to the subclassing

3187646
superclass	subclassing
the implementation of inherit_static_prop ensures that the static properties of the subclassing will be php references whether or not the zval of the parent is shared in particular if the superclass has a reference the child will share the zval if it doesn t the zval will be copied and new zval will be made a reference

3187646
superclass	subclassing
this is because the property will not be copied to the subclassing from the superclass if it s redeclared see the condition in inherit_static_prop

3187667
min	max
the thing is it is incredibly slow as it uses a while loop to figure out the min max based on approximated error

3187667
cos	sin
the curve is always in the shape of one segment of a sin cos curve but not always the same curve and will always be less that one period

3187701
min	max
i m unsure currently how many points are needed to precisely calculate what a would be which would give the min and max of the curve

3187720
decoder	encoder
here small example for using base64 encoder decoder

3187720
decoder	encoder
using base64 encoder decoder in appache commons is better

3187729
fseek	ftell
ftell and fseek are only going to work as byte offsets if you open the file in binary mode rb instead of r

3187729
fseek	ftell
otherwise you can only fseek to things that have previously be returned by ftell

3187734
cos	sin
edit if you know that the curve will always be shaped like a portion of sin cos curve then if you know the smallest period that might be represented you can do some optimizations by using binary search algorithm to look for the inflection points where the slope change in y to the left and to the right are of different signs

3187818
hash	md5
additionally you could create a one time hash using md5 or better sha256 that is generated by the php script and stored in a database in relation to the file

3187901
post	get
i am stuck with my rails application where i use jquery to post get ajax requests and i have this following error found by using firebug

3187909
rss	feed
xml rss parser is a lightweight liberal parser of rss feed

3187912
explode	implode
1. explode on php side implode js routine in your page

3187919
packets	multicast
and i can t even capture my multicast packets

3187929
mechanize	hpricot
there are certain gems he just can t use properly or at all json gitjour mechanize hpricot which means there are features to which he can t contribute

3187969
uisearchbar	uisegmentedcontrol
usually uisearchbar covers left half of uitoolbar so that only uisegmentedcontrol is visible.

3188058
multiplying	transpose
my idea is to arrange the array in 3x5 matrix and multiplying by its transpose which is 5x3

3188058
multiplying	transpose
and multiplying by its transpose i am not sure how to do that and the result will be 3x3 matrix that corresponded to docno by docno

3188059
apk	dex
i tried passing the apk file and also the dex file inside the apx but proguard doesn t accept them as an input

3188060
freebsd	linux
for example on linux and freebsd it is possible to compile a kernel which doesn t support multicast

3188114
moq	moles
i have used moq before and i have read that some people use both moles and insert other mocking framework in tandem but i was thinking it would be more convenient to stick with just one

3188130
draggable	droppable
what i want to do is trigger the drop event handler on the droppable without actually dragging and dropping the draggable

3188166
mouseover	mouseout
i m wondering how i can make a flash start playing a video on mouseover and stop playing on mouseout

3188205
sharepoint	splist
the reason is that spweb.getlist is getting one splist object from sharepoint

3188251
postgresql	mysql
wide database support oracle ms sql firebird mysql postgresql sysbase

3188263
ada	pascal
my own guess is that it s mostly because the languages that have included coroutines concurrent pascal concurrent c which actually supported the c++ of the time and ada tasks are sort of similar as well have never become particularly popular

3188333
google-chrome	firefox
with all this code it works perfectly fine in firefox and google-chrome but in ie it doesn t do anything

3188391
textarea	textbox
the multi-line textbox renders as an html textarea element and the value of a textarea respects line breaks

3188423
put	get
i can make a uiview do some of these things and animate the with a block but i get confused about where to put the pieces of code

3188442
pop-up	dialog
when they hit the button in excel it should be the same as hitting another button in my winforms app which pop-up a dialog box

3188504
java.util.date	simpledateformat
simpledateformat can convert strings to java.util.date objects

3188507
width	height
doing that you should be able to get some sort of height width offset value from the contents and adjust the size of the iframe appropriately

3188558
innodb	myisam
another way is to switch from myisam to innodb

3188563
webrat	cucumber
but for tests i have found several episodes some using rails unit test classes others use cucumber rspec zentest autotests webrat selenium etc

3188584
qabstractitemview	qabstractitemmodel
one would be to start with an authoritative model subclassed from qabstractitemmodel link it to a subclass of qabstractitemview and from there generate and update qgraphicsitems in the scene

3188584
qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsitem
the other way i can think to do it is to treat the qgraphicsscene as the authoritative data source storing the data object in each qgraphicsitem s .data property

3188584
qgraphicsscene	qabstractitemmodel
so which approach would you choose qabstractitemmodel authoritative - qabstractitemview- qgraphicsscene or alternatively qgraphicsscene authoritative - qabstractitemmodel- other views

3188591
glut	sdl
if you want to stay away from objective-c cocoa and glut you can try sdl which is a cross platform gaming library windows 2d graphics sound input etc.

3188605
redhat	fedora
redhat fedora centos

3188615
jar	war
afaik there is no way to set file permissions within a war jar this is however possible when using the maven assembly plugin to create a binary distribution archive of your project but this is another story

3188716
memcpy	malloc	free	memcpy	free	malloc
looking at the dependencies it is requiring some basic functions like memcpy free malloc though i thought those were standard c runtime functions

3188725
fast-forward	merge
and a merge from master to saved_feature won t be trivial either certainly not a fast-forward one

3188790
entity-relationship	diagram
i have a small preference of continuing to use a database such as mysql because i spent some time designing the entity-relationship diagram and schema but if i have to store in a flat file i can do that too

3188825
serializable	deserialization
from this i would use the xml serializable and deserialization to read and write the file except that this isn t going to a file i need to encrypt it and store it in the registry

3188842
websphere	ibm
for operations i use use the linear log rotation ibm websphere mq supportpac

3188848
min	max
min max std max std min std partition std min_element std max_element

3188893
queue	fifo
to solve the problem of pushing up lots of updates i d suggest creating a queue fifo that you add your updates to

3188912
disk	ram
i have a wpf monitor widget that displays cpu ram and disk performance as small percentage bars

3188934
range	max	range	min	min	max
if max and min are independent variables the extra subtraction for max-min will waste time but if that expression can be precomputed at compile time or if it can be computed once at run-time to test many numbers against the same range the above expression may be computed efficiently even in the case where the value is within range if a large fraction of values will be below the valid range it may be faster to use because it will exit early if value is less than min

3188943
google-chrome	firefox
i would use firefox or google-chrome but the application i am testing is only compatible with ie

3188946
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
if you have control of the client you can use pretty much any other browser firefox safari google-chrome opera ... or wait for ie9

3189003
google-chrome	firefox
atleast firefox ie google-chrome would be good

3189026
google-chrome	safari
though he mentions on his compatibility that safari and google-chrome do not expose this functionality in their api

3189054
jsf	seam
from lightweight java web application development leveraging ejb3 jsf pojo and seam

3189054
jar	war
ear ejb3 jar and war files are not

3189067
ubuntu	linux
reformat a harddisk and install ubuntu boot from a flash disk run as a vm through virtual box or the like there are many ways to run linux in your situation and it will be an easier development solution for you

3189116
mef	prism	mef	caliburn	caliburn	prism
i have read quite a few posts on so and around the web of the benefits and features of various wpf frameworks caliburn prism and module frameworks mef unity and combining them

3189159
google-chrome	firefox
finally to try debugging your problem use a tool like firebug for google-chrome firefox to ensure you re submitting post data as expected

3189180
uiview	calayer
the best solution i could come up with so far was to overlay the calayer on top of the uiview and capture the current view state using

3189205
prerequisites	uninstaller
well wouldn t you know management has got it in their head that everything including prerequisites but not .net that s installed by the application must now be uninstaller by the uninstaller

3189212
regasm	gacutil
to set up the dll to be used on my developer machine i use regasm and gacutil like so

3189212
regasm	gacutil
note this script is intended only for my developer machine where regasm and gacutil are both readily available

3189283
integer	unsigned
for example i have this one 64-bit unsigned integer as follows

3189297
vsto	add-in
i am using vsto for my outlook add-in

3189311
folder	directory
there is an info.xml file under every var packs many folder info.xml where are different directory but with the directory s info in info.xml

3189341
hide	show
when one of those links is clicked i d like to hide the div with the link that was clicked and show another div

3189353
emacs	aquamacs
however i m not sure how or if hi-lock-mode and font-lock mode work together - it might be that this won t work for a highlighted source file and i don t have a copy of emacs on this machine in order to determine the whether this works and i don t use aquamacs at all but this should at least give you something to try

3189377
int	boolean
you also have a method int.tryparse which populates a supplied by-reference argument with the int value and returns a boolean status code

3189413
post	get
ayende has a good post about get vs

3189418
versioning	upgrade
the great news is that if you have expression studio 3 then studio 4 is a free upgrade but whether or not blend is included will depend on what versioning you had previously

3189421
i2c	spi
it packs a 1 ghz cpu i2c spi for extra peripherals pwm for servos a d for your accelerometer and sharp ir rangefingers usb host signals for your cheapo webcams and a mini-pci slot to fit your wlan card into

3189463
hide	show
create the two visual states you want and use something like width 0 to hide the listbox or grid that you don t want to show in the given state

3189478
google-chrome	firefox
you can use addeventlistener in firefox google-chrome etc

3189479
rss	feed
if the site offers an rss feed you should try that

3189479
rss	feed
if the site does not offer an rss feed or if the rss feed doesn t include the information you re looking for then you have to scrape and compare

3189548
google-chrome	firefox
the code works on firefox google-chrome ie6 and ie7

3189556
width	height
make sure that that border is not coming from the image itself background of the image set the accurate width and height also try setting the padding to 0 like slaks said

3189578
x86	64bit
initially we added the dependency from the location in program files xxx but ran into build problems on 64bit machines where that same dependency was in the program files x86 xxx folder even though vs is smart enough to handle this problem when picking up references

3189580
versioning	upgrade
once we upgrade to the latest versioning of jquery i started getting javascript errors as follows

3189581
subscript	superscript
set superscript and subscript in formatted text in wpf

3189634
hide	show
it was ignoring my calls to show hide

3189634
hide	show
i saw a few things where ie6 sucks with show hide so i tried adding hide show classes to no avail as well

3189681
3-tier	n-tier
i m fairly new to the whole n-tier architecture thing and i had some questions about using mvvm with a 3-tier application

3189721
submit	submission
ok not sure how much this will help but try removing the submit input and submission the form via javascript

3189750
ienumerable	ienumerator
ienumerable.getenumerator can call the same underlying code as ienumerable it s just not as strongly typed returns object instead of a strongly typed ienumerator

3189819
ienumerable	ienumerator
however if you want to the ienumerable getenumerator method is the one that will return an ienumerator object to a client calling foreach this ienumerator object is the object that keeps track of which element in the collection is the next one one to be returned when the foreach iterates

3189834
innodb	myisam
during the analysis the table is locked with a read lock for myisam bdb and innodb

3189836
width	height
i have to set the attributes width and height for a canvas element depending on the available screen resolution

3189861
icomparer	iequalitycomparer	ienumerable	iequalitycomparer	ienumerable	icomparer
i happened to have seen some code where this guy passed a lambda expression to a arraylist.sort icomparer here or a ienumerable.sequenceequal ienumerable list iequalitycomparer here where an icomparer or an iequalitycomparer was expected

3189865
post	put
put s and post s can use an xml payload to better represent the underlying data structure and prevent long confusing query strings

3189886
hide	show
i have a datagrid in which i would like to show the details when a row is clicked and hide it when the user clicks again

3189895
maven	cargo
try the maven cargo plugin

3189898
maven	cobertura
unfortunately the logic called has a not compatible license and i have to fork a separate process as it is done for cobertura maven plugin

3189913
fgets	fgetc
actually i find many reading functions fgetc fgets etc.

3189919
cout	ofstream
alternately cout has type ostream and logfile has type ofstream

3189929
tapestry	struts	tapestry	wicket	struts	wicket	jsf	tapestry	jsf	wicket
wicket tapestry struts jsf spring mvc all are verbose and useless

3189950
src	attr
link attr src urlfornewimage

3189969
lxml	elementtree
if lxml is not available you can alternatively use the elementtree api in the standard library

3189974
qgraphicsscene	qabstractitemmodel
qabstractitemmodel authoritative - qabstractitemview- qgraphicsscene

3189974
qgraphicsscene	qabstractitemview	qgraphicsscene	qhash	qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsitem	qabstractitemview	qgraphicsitem	qhash	qabstractitemview
my best advice would be to store a qhash of qpersistantmodelindex to qgraphicsitem and a qgraphicsscene in the qabstractitemview you create

3189978
bcel	cglib
if you want to create a class and write it back to disk bcel and cglib is good

3189979
put	get
so i looked in the client classes to sort out if i could get the request url and put all the parts needed for request signing in myself

3189986
division	addition
the problem is when people just learn this and start overloading addition for database records or division for strings - to have their own meaning

3190000
pop-up	dialog
that is when the code-completion dialog pop-up eclipse crashes when i try to

3190010
put	get
i ve put the test app up on github but just can t get the client-side storage working

3190042
public	protected
also the event should be marked as protected public

3190080
opera	firefox
both opera and firefox offer a possibility to add a site to bookmarks that will be opened in the sidebar and that is a huge difference

3190080
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome also don t expose any api for this task

3190089
gridview	repeater	listview	gridview
not sure if you re tied to the repeater at this point but a gridview or listview could be worth looking into

3190133
listadapter	listactivity
you can always use getcontext on the view to get a reference to the containing activity which you can cast to a listactivity assuming you re using that and call the usual methods to get the data at that position in the listadapter

3190139
google-chrome	firefox
i advise non-techies to stay away from it and to use firefox or google-chrome

3190141
subnet	packets
what sql enumeration does it broadcasts an udp packets port 1434 on the entire lan segment subnet mask

3190161
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
uinavigationcontroller not popping uinavigationbar items

3190173
x86	64bit
32 bit instruction set of x86 can be used for 64bit arithmetic see extended precision multiplication

3190175
subtract	add
they use the carry bit for add and subtract

3190175
subtraction	addition	subtraction	add	subtract	addition	subtract	add
the assembler ops for add with carry and subtract with carry or borrow can be used for arbitrary bit length extended precision addition and subtraction

3190175
16-bit	64bit	multiplying	add
for multiplying if you only have a 32-bit result from multiplying you can break it into 16-bit value pairs and multiplying and then shift and add with carry to get a full 64bit result from 32-bit multiplying

3190175
16-bit	64bit
fwiw the intel 32-bit asm mul instruction can put a 64bit result in edx eax so you can actually do multiplies in 32-bit chunks with 64bit values to add rather than 16-bit chunks with 32-bit values to shift and add

3190194
octal	decimal
that s because a leading 0 means that the constant is octal base 8 instead of decimal base 10

3190203
hash	md5
i have a legacy schema that contains tables with composite keys where some of the keys are of type binary 16 -- its a md5 hash of the other columns

3190208
width	height
files in the test1_files 1 folder should have maximum total width or height of 2 pixels

3190210
cucumber	autotest
i m using cucumber rails3 rspec2 and autotest

3190226
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
i am wondering if it is possible to compile a list of deleted files on a windows filesystems fat or ntfs

3190239
pop-up	dialog
if you create the same dialog as a modal pop-up dialog then you should get the behaviour you have described

3190371
google-chrome	safari
it works fine in google-chrome for osx windows and interestingly enough safari 3

3190396
superclass	subclassing
in which case yes you can define a clean method on the subclassing that cleans fields defined on the superclass

3190429
typedef	struct
for struct and unions the second form maybe combined with the typedef in one declaration is needed for recursive types

3190507
maven	cargo
both the tomcat maven plugin and the maven2 cargo plugin support remote tomcat deployments assuming the manager application is available

3190511
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this is working for me under google-chrome safari firefox opera and ie 6-8

3190541
google-chrome	firefox
this runs fast on firefox and google-chrome but the find method takes a long time to execute in ie8 and ie7

3190592
public	protected
...call up from c++ to java when wrapping c++ virtual methods. the ...call up... leads me to believe you re calling protected or public members of an inherited interface and ...when wrapping c++ virtual methods leads me to conclude you can only do so when you re overriding an inherited interface

3190630
implements	extends
this forces aspectj to use cglib for doing aspects instead of dynamic proxies - cglib doesn t lose the annotation since it extends the class whereas dynamic proxies just expose the implements interface

3190654
min	max
the standard sql group by clause must include all columns specified in the select clause that are not wrapped in aggregate functions like count max min etc to be specified in the group by clause

3190662
openssl	crypto++
although not nearly as easy to use as crypto++ openssl has support for pkcs#7 based standards

3190679
folder	dir
.ssh folder appeared in current working dir and rsync stopped annoying with rsa fingerprints

3190681
typedef	struct
for example one could have a header file define a type userconsole using typedef struct _userconsole userconsole

3190684
superclass	subclassing
in this case nsarray is the public superclass and there are private subclassing that are the actual array implementations

3190684
many-to-many	one-to-many
as to answer your question i ve found that when i have this sort of set up where i need to maintain one-to-one one-to-many or many-to-many relationships automatically there s nothing that beats using coredata

3190697
realloc	malloc
you should use realloc instead of malloc when reallocating

3190701
button	checkbox
the main window contains a notebook with three tabs each tab having a random ui element a button a calendar and a checkbox

3190720
min	max
7 6 4 00 pm another idea i thought about was comparing all the points before a min max point

3190720
min	max
for example if i moved the mouse downards then upwards my starting point would be the current max point while the point where i start moving the mouse back upwards would be my min point

3190743
inherited	properties
using in getuser means that the object model is overwritten whereas it would be nicer to keep the model as a prototype and have getuser inherited the properties

3190835
getter	setter
we therefore need to update the value the report getter returns every time the setter is called which leads to your original code

3190860
children	parent
one use for this is to populate only children not parent relations

3190871
stretchblt	bitblt
also the canvas.copyrect procedure employes stretchblt which i would expect to produce the same result as bitblt when no stretching is applied.

3190942
folder	directory
update you can read more about the folder available for your app in iphone application programming guide a few important application directory

3190942
folder	directory
the standard way of getting the locations of these folder is described in iphone application programming guide getting paths to application directory

3195395
width	height
from what i can see the mx image component after you set the image source maintains a height and width of 0

3195455
hide	show
i want to pass this function a true or a false and have the elements listed show true or hide false on this input

3195479
hide	fadeout
afaik the execution flow will prevent hide execution before fadeout ends

3195482
hide	show
if you dont want to use show and hide as arguments but true and false you would have to change it a little bit

3195545
getter	setter
getter and setter would be a waste

3195561
hash	md5
i think it will solve the extra empty spaces problems and then generate md5 hash or compare them or some other way you like

3195570
equals	gethashcode
the problem why you are using a dictionary is cause you want to explicitly tell what the key is the regnum property of your car but you could also use a if your car object would correctly implement equals and gethashcode but this is a little more complex than you might think

3195578
hide	show
you just have to show #header_hover before fading in normally and hide #header after fading out using a callback

3195585
post	get
we have more issues but we ll post back after we get these more serious errors fixed

3195633
ontouchevent	ondraw
i have override the ontouchevent and among others the ondraw

3195648
folder	directory
but that behaves weirdly - if i edit several project files i begin to get what looks like i might be approaching a correct solution but still isn t good enough - i get a directory structure that contains folder like myproj1 and myproj2 yet myproj2 seems to of had all the output from myproj1 dumped into it myproj1 works as i d hope it to

3195648
folder	directory
on top of this the drop folder still has everything else dumped in one big drop the directory contain duplicates of this drop

3195653
filtering	grouping
filtering based on grouping membership

3195682
modifiers	sealed
but there s no guarantee that a sealed class will never be unsealed -- that the developer might rearrange its implementation to make it more amenable to inheritance and then remove the sealed modifiers from the class definition or just flat-out remove the sealed keyword for no reason at all

3195699
folder	directory
the cgi script will be inside cgi-bin directory and the php function will be outside this folder

3195726
struts	wicket
for example for orm you may choose to use hibernate over jpa or toplink for front end you may choose wicket over struts or springmvc and so forth

3195732
google-chrome	firefox
this works for listboxes in google-chrome and firefox but doesn t work for ie8

3195737
unix	solaris
this is currently on solaris i don t have gnu coreutils stat command and i want it to be portable and efficient and only using standard unix tools that are always available

3195804
put	get
if you need to do anything more complex than put file or get file take a look at edtftpj free

3195814
public	protected
mi effectively merges the public and protected namespace among the inherited classes which can cause some ambiguity and complexity you don t need

3195815
google-chrome	firefox
tested in both google-chrome and firefox

3195849
hide	show
okay so i have a log in button on the top of my site that when clicked calles some jquery to show hide a log in box

3195878
x86	64bit
x86 allows easier debugging - edit and continue is not supported when running in 64bit mode

3195878
x86	64bit
you can never anticipate when in the future you will add a reference to an assembly that requires x86 and forget to test properly on 64bit yielding embarrassing runtime errors on 64bit deployments

3195891
libevent	epoll
create some sort of event loop using select epoll or event framework like libevent libev and get a callback whenever a user hits a key

3195917
button	checkbox
i m attaching this function to other controls checkbox and button and it s working fine

3195934
int	double
but since it s a value type only copies are passed around same as with int double datetime etc

3195938
groovy	gsp
were you to use groovy and gsp you could use groovyws which relies upon cxf under the hood and allows litteraly no-brainer call to web-services which is by the way possible in most of the cases thanks to support for scripting languages of jvm

3195941
opera	google-chrome
both google-chrome and opera are the only two major browsers to choose to have non-stable sorts but others include netscape 8 9 kazehakaze iceape and a few others

3195941
lodash	underscore.js
or use a library that supports stable sort such as underscore.js lodash

3195955
google-chrome	firefox
so for a website i ve been trying to get a specific layout to work across the ie browsers firefox + google-chrome are a plus if they work but usually they do

3195955
width	height
what i forgot to add is that certain parts of this design should be fixed width height

3195955
width	height
the top part should be 60px height right and left side should be 200px width

3195964
x86	64bit
before i did that all my librarys where x86 and i got an exception if i wanted to use them in a 64bit project

3195972
iprincipal	iidentity
to get this i listen to postauthenticaterequest event then read from the db all the user data i need to be stored in httpcontext.current.user and in thread.currentprincipal then i instantiate custom iprincipal and iidentity objects and assign them to the above locations

3196018
put	get
i did not put an os or bb version because i cannot get it to work on 5-6 different devices with different versions

3196032
range	max
the generalization is that if a value appears m times in first1 last1 and n times in first2 last2 where m or n may be zero then it appears max m n times in the output range

3196034
soappy	suds
i ve used suds successfully for a project where i had tried and failed to use soappy

3196040
google-chrome	firefox
works in different browsers ie firefox google-chrome

3196075
min	max
you can still reset the min and max properties

3196075
min	max
setting min higher than the max or vice-versa will cause a 380 error

3196129
onresume	onpause
for a better user experience applications must unmute a muted stream in onpause and mute is again in onresume if appropriate

3196137
put	get	post	put	post	get
it is suitable performing basic http requests and interacting with rest-based services get post put delete

3196168
mxmlc	compc
so i am using the compc and mxmlc command line sdk tools

3196171
onclick	onsubmit	submit	submission
if you need to execute some javascript in a form it is safer practice to use the onsubmit of the form and return false to stop submission rather than executing script in the onclick of the submit button

3196181
rss	feed
eventually everyone got accustomed to running a svn update whenever a commit is made we have a post-commit hook that updates an rss feed with new commits or at a minimum every hour or so

3196186
wordpress	joomla
not only can you use webmatrix to edit and maintain traditional aspx pages a la forms or mvc but you can use webmatrix to edit php files work with mysql databases and manage php-based open-source apps wordpress joomla etc.

3196193
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this css selector works fine in firefox google-chrome and safari but ie 6 does not support the nth-of-type selector

3196198
goto	break
you do not need to specifically use a break statement just one that changes the flow of control so a goto or a return should work

3196215
hide	show
and as a final result i need to hide everything and show just one div s inner text

3196262
goto	break
a while true loop should be fine if you have a break at the end of it and continue wherever there was previously a goto

3196282
teamcity	nant
i recently setup a ci environment using teamcity + subversion + nant msbuild

3196298
free	malloc
think of it exactly the same way you think of malloc free vs new delete in c++

3196302
postgresql	mysql
but this requires a database that supports the functionality - mysql doesn t postgresql only started in v8.4.

3196328
hash	salt
i decided to hash salt a couple of more fields in each row

3196329
folder	directory
if you re using app_data i assume that folder already exists in your deployment directory

3196348
width	height
but trying to set for say leg width n or height returns

3196348
width	height
being the argument a nsstring leg width n or height

3196401
ant	maven	ant	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml
alternatively i m pretty sure there are ant tasks that can do this too think creative use of the jar task and there are pom.xml plugins available to run ant tasks from maven

3196405
jboss	glassfish
i m new to glassfish and our company has recently migrated an old system from jboss 2-something to glassfish v3

3196421
google-chrome	firefox
the image displays in ie and google-chrome but not in firefox

3196449
width	height
so for the entry leg width n or height the key to be used is

3196488
mouseout	mouseup	mouseout	mousedown	mouseover	mouseup	mouseover	mousedown	mouseover	mousemove	mouseover	mouseout	keyup	mouseup	keyup	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	keydown	mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseout	mouseup	mousedown	keydown	keyup	keydown	mouseup	keydown	mousedown
in jquery 1.3.x only the following javascript events in addition to custom events could be bound with .live click dblclick keydown keypress keyup mousedown mousemove mouseout mouseover and mouseup

3196488
mouseleave	mouseenter
as of jquery 1.4.1 the hover event can be specified mapping to mouseenter mouseleave

3196527
filtering	grouping
this filtering labc after grouping

3196530
ilist	iqueryable

jquery	simplemodal
i am using jquery 1.4.2 and simplemodal version 1.3.5

3196564
put	get
when i put them straight into html they get interpreted as ï ½

3196599
domcontentloaded	onreadystatechange
onreadystatechange domcontentloaded

3196616
free	malloc
the substrings stored in for i other than 0 1 and 5 were allocated inside the substr function with malloc so you can and should deallocate them with free

3196616
free	malloc
similarly each temp_struct element was allocated with malloc and so can and should be deallocated with free

3196651
free	malloc
yes given that your substr is allocating the memory for the substring with malloc it s reasonable necessary really to free that memory when you re done with it

3196664
free	malloc
so if you want to have your code set up this way such that prod can point to either dynamic memory that you got from malloc or to a constant string literal you need to also keep track of which one it is and only free the dynamic memory

3196665
client-side	server-side
unlike the jquery options the telerik grid supports both server-side and client-side rendering delivering a solution that is more accessible indexer-friendly and still as fast and performant as javascript grids

3196665
filtering	grouping	sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping
includes support for binding directly to web services and for ui features like paging sorting filtering grouping and soon hierarchy

3196679
put	get
i m assuming request.data is where i put variables but it seems to be going through as a get request

3196687
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png	tiff	png	tiff	bmp
you need lossless format like bmp tiff with lossless compression png gif etc

3196701

3196710
maven	pom.xml

3196721
listview	gridview
any solution you come up with for this problem will basically be reinventing the listview and gridview widgets

3196727
webclient	webrequest
i have tested with many enconders and using webrequest and webclient too but doesn t work too

3196750
post	get
i am looking to have appended to all images and media that get applied to a post via the upload tool in wordpress _thumb to the src of the media object

3196756
getter	setter
or you could move to using getter and setter this is another very common pattern where you can hide the validation inside the setter thus ensuring that each property always holds valid data or null or default value

3196781
superclass	subclassing
then added subclassing to the fragment used the same package name as the superclass from the host plug-in but that probably isn t necessary

3196804
implements	extends
either implements its interface or extends it if it s a class

3196805
width	height

lxml	libxml2
the script below using lxml reports success when using libxml2 2.6 but the second schema validation fails on 2.7

3196921
redhat	fedora
the package i installed is mingw32-nsis and for fedora redhat centos you can do yum install nsis

3196933
hash	salt
adding a salt to your hash does not make a pre-computed attack impossible only more difficult

3196933
hash	salt
an attacker can create an account and then pull his salt hash out of the database using sql injection

3196933
hash	salt
if the salt is stored in the database then he can pull the salt and the hash using sql injection and break the hash of an unknown password with john

3197026
put	get
however when i try to put cpshapes in an array i get an error telling me it s an incompatible pointer type

3197032
cpu	processors
modern processors include the memory controller on the cpu instead using the traditional northbridge and fsb see hypertransport and quickpath

3197138
pop-up	dialog
and then i realized - the reason is damn eula pop-up dialog that ms put in every single pstool and it was impossible to click the button to confirm dialog under local system account

3197146
firefox	safari
the selection works on firefox 3.6 and ie 8 but not safari 5 have not tried any others

3197158
swt	swing
like eugener i prefer swing to swt but both are rich well-maintained frameworks that will serve the purpose

3197167
feof	fread
the way to test for eof is to check the return value of fread and then use feof

3197176
int	boolean
the boolean data type is a special case of an int data type

3197275
gedit	nano
at that point the learning curve is worth it where earlier it really wasn t and i used nano for command line editing and gedit for gui editing

3197292
g++	gcc
true enough but even the following will not produce warnings errors with g++ gcc 4.1.1 20070105 red hat 4.1.1-51 and the following flags -w -wall -wextra -werror -wshadow -ansi -pedantic

3197307
button	checkbox
i find much easier to set some controls select dropdown boxes checkbox or radio button outside of the jqgrid for example on top of the grid

3197335
post	get
currently i have a service with post and get http methods inside a couple of aidl files for two way communication a servicemanager which deals with starting stopping binding etc to the service and i m dynamically creating a handler with specific code for the callbacks as needed

this is available as a command line option both to rar and gzip compressors

3197383
postgresql	mysql
i am new to postgresql mainly used mysql before and sqlserver for clients pressure

3197427
nswindow	nsanimation
one way is that i could make the nswindow actually be basesize + 20 and maybe use nsanimation to animate the view

3197437
width	height
on site1.com iframe has fixed width and height and i cannot extend further

3197437
width	height
but the problem is iframe page has some popups are bigger than iframe s own width and height

3197481
youtube	vimeo
for providing html5-alternatives to youtube vimeo embeds

3197481
youtube	vimeo
please note that having the attribute is crucial and that it is missing in the embedding code that youtube vimeo etc

3197500
switching	screens
for example in the server which is running red hat switching between two screens in the web version 10g uses 15 cpu per client

3197500
switching	screens
this is crazy and must be an error somewhere because we have other applications running in 10g which was made for web but never existed in 6i but switching normally between a screens is something like 0.5-2 cpu use not 15 or even 20 like this is giving us

3197521
stdout	stderr
redirect stderr as well as stdout

3197528
int	boolean
as for the null example in c c++ you mentioned in another comment it has to be said that neither c nor c++ have a boolean type afair c++ usually has a typecast for bool that resolves to an int but thats another matter and they also have no null-references only null 0 -pointers

3197565
stdout	stderr
on a unix system you can redirect stderr and stdout to dev null as part of the command itself

3197580

3197601
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested in both firefox and google-chrome with the same results

3197662
put	get	post	put	post	get
just look at the url the form is supposed to submit to and the method it employs post or get and then send a request to that url using the same method and put the field you want as parameters

3197672
notsupportedexception	argumentnullexception
for example the argumentnullexception can be prevented by making sure the arguments you pass are not null and the notsupportedexception can be prevented by making sure the type you request is supported

3197679
for-loop	arrays
for now its just the test eventually i want to use for-loop to create the list and pull data from an arrays

3197695
width	height
if you use the same formulas to measure distance but have the person stand near a corner of the room so that the distances to the walls floor and ceiling are all different you should be able to calculate all three measurements length width and height with one sonar pulse

3197698
put	get
those name values are the values i want...name1 name2 name3 and i want to get them individually to put in their own textbox.

3197718

setup an event handler in jquery for mouseenter and mouseleave

3197747
mouseleave	mouseenter	hide	show
during mouseenter show the zoom icon and hide it when mouseleave fires

3197747
width	height
then once the quadrant is known you set the absolute position and change the height width of the image

3197747
width	height
the css3 transition property slows down the height width change so you get a nice zoom feature

3197806
portrait	landscape
this sort of gives the picture a landscape look to them and i need to re-size the pictures to a 169 x 225 portrait picture

hide	show
as per the scenario in your question when a form is submitted and evaluated server side it is possible to show or hide parts of the rendered html

3198086

put	get
for example if the book you are using is using enumeration vector or hashtable put it in the trash and get a newer book

3198202
lodash	underscore.js
note previously this answer recommended underscore.js but lodash has done a better job of getting bugs fixed and addressing issues with consistency

3198204
post	get
sorry can t post more than one link yet but add the usual bits to get to the testapi site on codeplex

3198538
int	double
i already have a function double int that gives me the int part and a predicate int that tells me if it is even

3198542
getter	setter
when your code point to a field and you change it to point to a property of the same name the c# itself doesn t change but the resulting il does - it generates a method call to the getter or setter as appropriate

3198560
put	get
if i put the following section in i can get to the login screen but will always be sent back to it even after i login and can never see any other pages

3198584

3198702
int	chars
the function needs to be able to handle different kinds of types of variables like chars int and longs

3198740
width	height
if you do know the size of front somehow then you can pretty safely assume up front that width height 4 550 mb is not going to work in a 32-bit program

3198741
mouseover	mouseout
in this case even though .homelink .poptext is returning a collection of objects each one is individually associated with a mouseover and mouseout handler by hover

3198743

width	height
test the width or height of the splitter to see if your treeview is hidden

3199059
gridview	detailsview
disclaimer i ve used this on a gridview not a detailsview but the concept is the same

3199085
integer	unsigned	integer	radix
in your example 32 bit unsigned integer keys which strongly cluster are assigned sequentially you can use radix based approach

3199090
for-loop	loops
you just break out of for-loop -- not while loops

3199092
for-loop	loops
you break out of the for-loop only so you never leave the while loops and restart iterating over the proxylist over and over again

3199094
for-loop	loops
break is breaking the innermost loops which is the for-loop in your case

keep in mind that my solution will work if the web site is using post or get but some sites use javascript

3199137
getter	setter
i would have an array or vector in one of files with a getter and setter

3199143
put	get
however its breaking a rule because a get request to this same resource will not return the equivalent of what the client just put but would rather return all people objects since there would be no filters on the query

3199143
post	put
while i hesitated to use post because it seems to be the least-common-denominator catch-all for restful operations and more can be said about this operation specifically that it is idempotent put cannot be used because its requirements are too narrow

3199143
put	get
in addition to the accepted answer darrel miller had an excellent suggestion if the operation absolutely had to be a put and that was to append a uuid onto the end of the resource path so an equivalent get request will return the equivalent resource

3199166
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
i would need to understand the basics of addition subtraction multiplication division and remainder

3199166
integer	radix
i know that a fixed point can be made by separating a 4 byte integer by a signal flag a radix and a mantissa

3199176

3199526
children	parent
i have a page where i am trying to add children to a parent object

3199545
width	height
if you don t set width and height then the window will get a default size from the os

3199555
post	get
note when automatically redirecting a post request after receiving a 301 status code some existing http 1.0 user agents will erroneously change it into a get request

3199577
hash	salt
i have a field hashedx that is a hash salt value and the salt is saved in the same row in the mysql database as is common practice

3199577
hash	salt
so typically i would take my input hash salt it and compare it to the values of hashedx

3199577
hash	salt
i could go through the database rows one by one try that salt on my input then check if the input as hash salt with this salt matches hashedx of that same row

3199654
min	max
the group by clause is where you define grouping but sql standard is that if you specify columns in the select clause without being wrapped in aggregate functions ie count max min etc then those columns need to be specified in the group by

3199691
width	height
it seems like it s always one step behind the first load it can t tell what the width height is of the file being loaded then on a subsequent load of the same file it s positioned perfectly

3199711
squash	merge
if you want to push a number of local commits as a single commit you can squash those commits with git merge or git rebase -i interactive

3199719
hash	md5
mysql supports md5 and sha1 hash algorithms as builtin functions

3199720
width	height
after zooming twice the canvas only uses a fraction of the available canvas height width even though i m adjusting for the zoom level

3199720
width	height
if i were to multiply the height width by 2 when drawing the grid for the last time it ll draw out the entire canvas size but i can t figure out why that would be required

3199724
post	get
i rather wish they d bring back a way to define get post at least together

3199727
addition	multiplication
so far i ve got addition and multiplication done using any-length arrays of bytes so each byte is like a base-256 digit

3199735
terminate	timeout
i m thinking that the best solution if possible is a timeout on the getline but in the event that it s not possible or a good option i m open to any option which will allow the thread to terminate neatly

3199781
put	get
n.b if you are worried about the screen jerk when the dialog resizes then you could put the ajax response into a div that is positioned off screen then get the dimensions then nicely animate the resize of the dialog whilst fading in the new content

3199786
min	max
i m not sure if i remember this right but i seem to recall that mixing manual min max settings with bound value or vice-versa can cause this

3199827
post	put
use ajax to post the data to your php file echo the html for the new dropdown back to the javascript and then use jquery to put in the new contents

3199870
inherited	properties
dtob is inherited from dtoa and thus should include all the properties from dtoa

3199874
irc	torrent
i plan on only offering site wide licenses so i just need to detect the evil little bit torrent irc people

3199880
gwt	cssresource
i have already tried replacing interface style extends cssresource with interface style extends defines hoping that inheriting from the defines stylesheet would give me access to the constants in the child style stylesheet but then the gwt compiler complains with errors like

put	get
note that you will actually have to put the uiwebview in an uiscrollview in order to get the scrolling support

3200024
google-chrome	firefox
this works for firefox and google-chrome but i m just presented with a blank screen in internet explorer

3200027

it s working on firefox and google-chrome but on internet explorer it only works in some ways

3200065
pop-up	dialog
shows a pop-up blocked dialog in ie8

3200065
google-chrome	firefox
on firefox and google-chrome the parent frame is modified from no hash to #xdm-success to #handshake-complete

3200066
bufferedreader	bufferedwriter
if you use bufferedreader and bufferedwriter there is no advantage to reading and processing 100 lines at a time

3200136
stdout	stderr
and yes the screen output is a stream or file handle but that s generally only because stdout cout and stderr cerr are connected to your screen by default

3200149
stdout	stderr
but there are actually two streams that write to the screen by default stdout cout is for normal output and stderr cerr is for error messages

3200155
post	get
you get the post from the database etc

3200162
fflush	gets
when your program s output is being redirected such as to a file or to the input of another program like in this case then it only gets fflush periodically when the output buffer usually 4â 64 kb or so fills up

3200162
stdout	fflush
to fflush stdout just call fflush 3

3200162
fflush	gets
note that when the output is going to a terminal if you just ran your program normally then by default it is line-buffered every time you print a newline the output gets fflush

3200172
post	put
the fundamental difference between the post and put requests is reflected in the different meaning of the request-uri

3200172
post	put
just be cause put is required to be idempotent and post is not does not mean that post cannot be idempotent

3200177
pull	push
remote-master -- clone pull -- local-never-modified-clone -- clone pull -- local-modified-clones -- push -- remote-master

3200186

moreover in firefox and google-chrome setting list-style-type to none in conjunction appears to be ignored

3200305
width	height
if the square is rectangle width height

3200307
min	max
even better if the max and min dimension of the smaller rectangles can be controlled by a parameter

3200314
inherited	properties
card has a few integer properties on top of the inherited uiview ones and deck has an nsmutablearray for holding some cards

3200370
range	max	range	min	min	max
when i get a point gps coordinate and a range calculate the max and min lat and long values to query for and then sort based on a distance function within these to order

3200431
width	height
don t do this for cells which have already been traversed and the merged structure should have a width and height so that expanding a 2x1-cell grid will expand to 2x2 or 3x1 to ensure you constantly keep a 4-sided rectangle shape for the merged node

3200431
width	height	min	max
if you want a fancier approach you can approach this like a kd-tree and build it top-down but you d need to be merging whole sub-trees as you re splitting based on random conditions and the min max width height parameter

3200470
pop-up	dialog
but what i would like to do is call this form from vba and instead of having the input dialog pop-up go ahead and tell the form what id is so the dialog never pop-up and the form opens just as if id where replaced by a value in the query

3200487
put	get	post	put	post	get
post indicates a generic action other than get put and delete the generic hashtable actions

3200489
portrait	landscape
in portrait all works fine in landscape it s fscked

3200557
width	height
also i need that every li conatins some fixed width and height and the image centered and alignet to top

3200570
getter	setter
each class would support delete and save and have getter and setter for specific aspects of the resource

3200598
post	put
in my case my model is always built from scratch so this was necessary to trick rails into treating it as an existing object and thus doing a put rather than a post

3200607
put	get
i also like to use setuptools automatic script creation so that my console scripts get put wherever they should be usr bin for example and are named appropriately automatically

3200627
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to upload files and i have it working in firefox google-chrome webkit but safari 5 doesn t have filereader

3200633
min	max
this will give you the point s of min max

3200638
innodb	myisam
in order to create a foreign key between two tables with mysql both tables need to be innodb tables with the default myisam table type you can define a foreign key but they do not actually do anything

3200661
hex	binary
in binary it s 0b 11111111 11111111 10000000 00000000 or 0xffffffff80000000 in hex

3200675
getter	setter
hiding the field behind a property getter setter allows you to perform additional actions like triggering when the value changes updating other internal state or changing the implementation entirely so it s just a wrapping call to a child object

3200680
for-loop	loops
the for-loop could perhaps be written better too in terms of begin and end or dernier instead of loops variable i

3200689
abc	isinstance
the fact that checking with isinstance the membership in a concrete type is not so good while checking the membership in an abc is more often useful lies in a principle that the gang of 4 expressed clearly and intensely in the first part of their wonderful book design patterns in a mostly c++ context but it really applies much more widely than that

3200689
abc	subclassing	abc	isinstance
with an abc you re basically checking an interface so many issues just aren t big problems any more abcs are more than just interfaces -- they can also offer implementation help to their concrete subclassing -- but when we re talking about isinstance thinking of them as interfaces is probably the most helpful stance

3200733
accessor	properties
if it is a dependency properties then as dk observes binding will update the properties value by calling setvalue and will bypass the clr properties accessor

3200767
unix	aix
if you are on linux some variant of unix aix try using ldd

3200783
implements	modifiers
as interface does not has an access modifiers if you still want your method private in the class which is implements that interface you can implements that interface explicitly

3200835
for-loop	loops
you need to do this either in a subroutine or a for-loop as the following syntax is specific to loops variables or parameters

3200836
folder	directory
to avoid over-writing your customized theme when an upgrade comes out you could save the customized one to a different folder in the themes directory with a different name like twenty ten customized

gif	png
xna by default knows what to do with png gif and jp e g image types

3200925
firefox	safari
when we popup a browser window with the sharing url that uses prompt_feed.php it causes safari and in some cases also firefox to resize themselves to strange dimensions

3200963
free	malloc
you could possibly implement your own allocator using malloc free to get around this problem

3200972
boost	stl
it is possible to solve this without doing so and still use stl boost algorithms

3200988

or if you need to manipulate int not double then simply assign to int

3201346
int	double
casting to int removes decimals in case value is a double

3201366
width	height
if you specify the image s width or height as a percentage that percentage is calculated in proportion to the size of the parent block

3201366
width	height
thus there will always be extra space around the image as long as you specify the width or height as a percentage

3201395
width	height
this will produce a new image with the specified width and height integers

3201408
int	double
the expression is first evaluated as int and only the result is cast to a double value

3201409
xfs	ntfs
any file-system-dependent mode of storing metadata is out as i need to support ntfs xfs and ext3

3201418

3202351
post	get
if the reset link actually resets the password on the get rather than on the form s post then it s a bit more grey but more of a usability issue than anything else - if the reset token is only good for a given number of hits then it can t constitute a denial of service

3202400
wordpress	phpbb
change your ftp password immediately and if your using a common script such as phpbb wordpress etc

3202408
interpreted-language	compiled-language
by the books asp.net compiled-language will give you a small boost on performance rather than an interpreted-language like old asp php etc

3202434
client-side	server-side
i think you are confusing client-side and server-side here

3202519
versioning	upgrade
so if you start with these charts you can easily upgrade to the current versioning from dundas but their prices are far behind free

3202524

maven	pom.xml
if you mean all maven plugins configured within a project pom.xml maven does that automatically upon build

i find testing setter getter to be a bit of a waste of time

if you are using an application that needs to read write a lot of files it is not atypical for your cpu processors utilization to be really low - since the application might be spending most of its time just waiting for the disk operations to complete

put	get
if i modify this sql and put the condition into the where clause i will get the wrong claim consider there are 4 parent claims the last in time is ok but the fourth fails hence i will get the fourth back but it must be checked against the last

what i would like to do is get the list of certificates off the card and present that list to the user in a dialog box along with pin text field so that user can enter the pin and then select the certificate to use for authentication all in one step instead of application having to display a separate dialog box for pin and then the pop-up for certificate selection but it seems like it s not possible using nss libraries but on the other hand smart card manager gui can easily do this

if you require ssl for authenticated users on your website for any reason then the best solution is to always have your login page on https

3205791

this means your entire site will be over ssl and will be inaccessible via http other than to redirect to https

3205795
children	parent
if you cannot do this which will happen if you re using an identity column as the parent s primary key and are inserting a single parent + 0 or more children it s still simple

3206128
fadein	hide
i have fadein there in case you want to hide all of the content on the page until it s ready

teamcity	nant
i have a msdeploy in my nant script teamcity that is working except it is copying some folders that i do not want to copy

3206391
for-loop	arrays
on my machine there is about a 25x difference in speed between a for-loop with readuint16 and reading the bytes directly into a byte arrays with a single read

3206421
swt	swing
as an alternative to embedding swing or swt components within a jogl canvas you could use an opengl ui toolkit for java

3206428
jax-ws	jax-rs
do you mean jax-ws soap based or jax-rs rest based

3206434
gridview	rowdatabound
hook in to the rowdatabound event of the gridview

3206449
sortedmap	sortedset
there is sortedset and sortedmap

3206510
bitconverter	binaryreader
dtb s answer is an even better way actually it has to copy the data as well no gain there but i just wanted to point out that to extract ushort values from a byte array you should be using bitconverter not binaryreader

3206560
getter	setter
catching all exceptions in the getter setter and quietly handling them also sounds like a bad idea since the caller will not know the getter setter failed

3206583
ubuntu	linux
i m trying to run a webstart demo which ran on my friend s windows machine but throws an access error on my ubuntu linux box

technical because you have to balance several different components including disk ram and cpu and it s not always easy to know where your bottlenecks are

chromatic has a great post on how to even get a newer and multiple version s of perl onto a restricted system

3206678
multiplying	add
divide rand by the maximum random numer multiplying it by the range and add the starting number

put	get
i put the cfx jars in maven dependencies and installed the eclipse plugin but this deoesnt get you any closer to actually running a webservice with out the mystery configuration glue

the practice solution that works perfectly in ie google-chrome and firefox looks like this

jar	war
btw - you don t need groovy or groovy_home with grails - it comes with the version of the groovy jar that it works with and that gets deployed in your war

3206778
min	max
looking at flotila source i bet that xaxis min max options are not converted correctly

3206819
width	height
the div is 200x100 you position it 50 from the top and 50 from the left but to have it centered fully you need to substract from that 50 values the half of the width and height the way to do this is to use negative margins hence margin-top should be the negative value of the height 2 and margin-left should be the negative value of the width 2

3206826
cassini	iis
i generally avoid using cassini and configure my projects to use iis 7 instead

3206885
width	margin
div.centerbox-outer is 100 width so putting margin 0 auto

3206901
operands	decrement
anytime you see an operands like 3 5 etc you check the top tuple of the count stack and decrement the number of operands left to be seen in that tuple

3206901
operands	decrement
this new operands push causes you to take another look at the top of the count stack and you do the same thing we just did decrement the operands seen compare with zero etc

3206904
maven	pom.xml
even if those tools can be more java-oriented nexus can store anything and maven is only there to read the pom.xml of each artifact and compute the right dependencies

3206912

i have a page with a logical edit section which i show when the user selects something to edit and hide when the user is done editing save or cancel

integer	unsigned
so suppose i want to have an inline c++ factorial function which uses inline assembly with a 32 bit or 64 bit unsigned integer expected as a result

3207165
google-chrome	firefox
i recommend firefox with the firebug addon for debugging ajax issues even though i use google-chrome for regular browsing

3207184
mouse	keyboard
before removing a mouse or keyboard event from the system message queue

3207206
int	boolean
instead of making a boolean column per level i would suggest an enum or int column for level and either a category table and a join between the two using foreign keys to allow questions to be linked to one or more category or a category column which also uses enums or int

3207211
rss	feed
apparently the most common 2 words on my site are rss and feed because i use text for links like comments rss post feed etc

3207226
versioning	upgrade
problem is i have no control over which versioning to install and upgrade to in feature

i do not have access to cron jobs as i am on a shared server

3207318
calloc	malloc
and if you are filling memory with zeroes check for implementation speed differences between malloc and setting things to 0 vs just calloc

3207318
memcpy	memmove
also beware memcpy vs memmove - determine which is necessary

3207328
cout	cin
you should also use different names for input and output streams -- there are already cin and cout in the std namespace

3207330
put	get
the static keyword before it s declaration suggests to me the code snippet is in a header file and you had to put the static there to get it to compile without redefined symbol errors

3207335
post	put
this assembly was put in the xap file manually by a post build step in which i just add the dll to zip xap file

3207476
hash	salt
whilst we re on the subject of hashing you might even want to consider adding a salt to the password before it is hash

3207476
hash	salt
a salt is a random string for example the user s email address that will help to improve the uniqueness of the hash generated different users that have the same password will generate the same hash without the salt

3207477
hash	md5
i utilize md5 hash and base64 encode functions for passwords so i haven t really a care what they enter as long as they meet minimum requirements...strongly typed passwords are recommended

3207523
range	max	range	min	min	max
i m trying to figure out how to calculate a min max lat long bound on the specific given range of a gps coordinate

3207523

google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the code below works in firefox and google-chrome but the check is omitted on ie and opera

3207563
min	max
i was also thinking that i could sum min max rows of data by minute hour day week month etc for even faster calculations

3207591
folder	directory
if your making a ff plug-in then don t forget to add the mozilla directory to the search path for depends and when you make changes don t forget you have to reset the firefox plugin cache to try and load the plug-in again change the folder name start ff then change the name back

3207704

3208169
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
it supports addition subtraction equality inequality and multiplication

3208191
chunked	transfer-encoding
if so then the content-length header is omitted when a transfer-encoding header indicates that a chunked transfer is being used which means the data is sent in small sequential chunks thus the full size cannot be reported in the content-length header ahead of time

3208216
opera	safari
for safari opera and actually the only cross-browser method is to re-constitute the containing boxes for text nodes and then use the pixel position inside the containing box to infer the character position

each time you call a non-existing property your class would check if the property name exists in an array uses and if so assumes prop is classname and instaniates it

3208464
menhir	ocamlyacc
another possibility worth investigating is switching from ocamlyacc to menhir which is an ocamlyacc replacement with little to no porting required as the syntax is the same with some nice features that could help you such as support for parametrized parser modules functors

3208731
mouse	keyboard
every time the keyboard or mouse callback is triggered reset the timer

3208734
jar	war
one is that the war file is a jar file so you can use the jar command to expand it

3208742
int	chars
that way you take the chars cast it to an int and use it

3208753
jar	war
the ant task unzip unjar will also do the trick as the war file is jar zip

3208763
put	get
from there just upload those files and call it an archive maybe put them in a separate directory point the server to it so wordpress doesn t get totally wiped out just in case

3208821
datamodel	relational-model
now here comes my question i was wondering if someone could seriously consider using both rdbms and non-relational db in a new project the complex but not performance critical datamodel would still be implemented using a relational-model and db while all performance critical yet simple models would be implemented with a non-relational db

3208837

3208956
int	chars
the chars 0 on most implementations namely is just the int 48 but put into 8 bits

3208956
int	chars
the only difference between a chars and an int is that chars must be smaller or equal to short int

3208956
int	chars
and int must be larger or equal than short int accordingly this usually makes chars 8 bits short in 16 and in 32 nowadays

3208998

3209108
ant	maven
maven is different it doesn t really work the way you described it doesn t work like ant

3209108
ant	maven
my recommendation would be to either fully migrate to maven and adopt its philosophy or to stick with your current ant solution and maybe consider using the maven ant tasks or ivy to leverage things such as dependency management artifact deployment

3210822
for-loop	arrays
solved i put them in a for-loop to looping through each array.value and making a root if else that checks whether the value in the arrays is equal to the parsed xml value

fseek	ftell
use fseek ftell fseek to seek to end determine file length and seek back to beginning

3211063

touchesbegan	touchesmoved
when touching the screen using touchesbegan i would like to pause the current animation and change the vertical position of the uiview using touchesmoved event

3211093
post	get
i would suggest that it s still the case that ews doesn t support assigning tasks to others see post and that in order to get the functionality you require you d have to create the item in the tasks folder of the user that you want to assign it to this is different to assigning which you would do from your own folder

3211124
free	malloc
your operating system provides so called system calls to dynamically allocate memory malloc free etc. it also provides the mechanism to load and execute your program

getter	setter
well although javabeans spec asks you to declare getter and setter i usually will not declare them unless it s absolutely necessary as in case of many mvc frameworks

3211240
getter	setter
one of the reasons that getter and setter methods are often written in java is because of the use of javabeans conventions

3211240
getter	setter
java doesn t support the uniform access principle so you have to write getter and setter methods to access properties

3211242

3211337
subobject	instances
multiple inheritance adds a few other requirements --like relative offsets from each basex that must be rewritting before final overriders for the methods are called a pointer of type base2 that points to an object of multiplyderived does not point to the beginning of the instances but to the beginning of the base2 subobject in the instances which might be offsetted by other bases declared before base2 in the inheritance list

3211346
subtraction	addition
i know that addition and subtraction perform better when using sse

3211653
kde	gnome
the gnome and kde desktop environments are both worth looking at

i know scriptaculous but i m sure that others such as jquery dojo and mootools would do just as well

3211684
hash	md5
use some hash in some hidden field in view.php form in view.php create some md5 secret and then check that in controller.php

3211701

3211797
telerik	radcombobox
i m using the telerik radcombobox control

3211838
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
rather than going for a shared boolean variable between ui and worker class a more clearer approach would be to use reset events autoresetevent manualresetevent

3211839
getter	setter
well i think instead of using any external library you can do it yourself just add getter and setter in your javabeans and override to string method of it and then you can form the string as you want.then only task remaining is to write that string into one file thats it

3211872
folder	directory
during compilation your app.config file is copied automatically from the root directory to the bin folder

3211886
int	chars
memory is memory if you use 1 byte as int or chars it is still one byte

3211928

3211936
processors	hyperthreading
say if i have a processors like this which says # cores 4 # threads 4 and without hyperthreading support

3211938
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
practically most normal browsers firefox google-chrome opera safari can handle whatever you throw at them

3211947
disk	ram
as the amount of stuff increases you have to load more of it into memory - using up ram but also taking more and more time to read it off the disk and pass it over the memory bus

3211947
disk	ram
and as the ram gets used parts of the data read from disk is swapped out meaning even more time writing and then even more time reading when you want it back

3211947
disk	ram
so although its not a big deal individually the idea that disk space ram is cheap so use as much as you like is not good you should worry about the bloat in your apps and try to make your apps more efficient and therefore more responsive

3211961
nsoperationqueue	nsinvocationoperation
for loading the image from a url i m using nsoperationqueue nsinvocationoperation

3211969
user-controls	tabcontrol
now when one item there is selected not sure yet what the best selection method would be perhaps doubleclick i need to capture the event in the tabcontrol that holds my user-controls

3211969
user-controls	tabcontrol
thankfully as my user-controls is put into the xaml visualtree the bubbling event flows up and events can reach the tabcontrol

3211969
tabcontrol	tabitem
my solution was to create a tabitem collection as a source for the tabcontrol

3211969
tabcontrol	tabitem
this works while i don t like the idea of defining the company list tabitem seperatly i can t define it under the tabcontrol because i can only have defined items or sourced not both

3211969
tabcontrol	tabitem
i ve tried this idea by putting a button on the list datatemplate that bubbles the id of the company selected up to the tabcontrol handling it there and adding a new tabitem with the companymodel

3211984
cpu	hyperthreading
hyperthreading is a cpu vendor term that means a single core that can multiplex its attention between two computations

3211987
jboss	glassfish
if you need the servlet api sources javadoc you can add the following to your pom.xml works at least for jboss glassfish

3211989
disk	ram
i m sure there are other holes like that too - but the code above will work on any system which supports paging and where disk access is much more expensive than ram access

3212052
updatepanel	scriptmanager
with an updatepanel you need to use scriptmanager like this

3212073
notepad++	textpad
if you are using a new version of excel you should be able to open the file using a text editor like notepad++ or textpad

3212086
decoder	encoder
you may have to use a separate encoder decoder to go to from mp4

you could try using a set list - and if you implements your own list or extends arraylist os that the equals acts the way you expect

3212272
int	double
consider you have a int foo variable which you printf in a number of places later during development you realize you need foo to be a double instead

3212284
qstring	qbytearray
bat the truth is that any king of string manipulation using qt qbytearray std or mem is going to stop when findind the first 0 char qt qstring can do it without problems but when converting it to c string char the data will be again trimmed with the first 0

3212297
hide	show
in order to hide the label and the activity indicator together just put the inside an additional view it might be full-screen half transparent view and show hide this view instead of label and indicator view separately

3212310

i m afraid i haven t put in any tests yet but you can try it out i m using ruby 1.9.1 so let me know if you get any problems in the comments or on github

3212341
updatepanel	scriptmanager
placing radscriptmanager or asp scriptmanager inside updatepanel is not right as well

3212356
rss	feed
rss feed parser

3212378
tabcontrol	tabitem
i ve extended the tabitem control to some other classes that i want to add the tabcontrol

3212390
children	parent
if there s only children and parent and no grandchildren you can use

3212422
hide	show
anyway to show and hide your uiactivityindicator view i would recommend you to hook up onto notifications that are being sent from your mpmovieplayercontroller when load- or playstatus change

3212457
iboutlet	ibaction
the view is attached to a class that provides an iboutlet and an ibaction for the button

3212471
submit	submission
how i prevent duplicate entries in database at the time of form submit and display an alert box and stop form submission if entry is duplicate

3212484
notepad++	scite
obvious typo errors can be seen with a good text editor like pspad notepad++ scite and so on

you can not accomplish the same thing with a normal parameter but using a slightly different syntax it can be done with an array variable parameter in bash ksh zsh

3212503
subtraction	addition
now i want to convert it to integer so that i can perform addition subtraction etc

3212506
ant	pom.xml
i could hack up something with ant to switch in whatever pom.xml i want by renaming it copy pom.xml.development pom.xml

3212554

probably a new templated control based on childwindow with a new fullscreen visual state in a new state group that hides the chrome and causes the content grid to stretch with auto width and height

you need to understand one-to-many and many-to-many relations and apply then when appropriate

3212617
rss	feed
rss and feed readers

3212635
inline	inlining
it serves as a hint to the compiler to perform the inlining optimization this is basically useless on modern compilers which inline aggressively with or without the keyword

3212685
post	get
make sure you are creating the control every page request regardless of get post

3212722
wan	lan
if they are part of your corporate lan wan they should be able to get access just like a local user

3212768
mouseout	mouseleave
instead of mouseout you can use mouseleave for this

3212768
mouseout	mouseleave
where mouseout fires when entering a child mouseleave doesn t it only fires when leaving the parent element that the event is bound to

3212768
mouseout	mouseleave
the mouseleave event differs from mouseout in the way it handles event bubbling

3212836
put	get
anyway as i ve got the address i need to get the locations and put them on the map

3212884
internationalization	localization
the usual convention is that it used for localization and internationalization

3212921
versioning	upgrade
i just upgrade indy to th latest versioning 10.5.7 i was using the openssl dlls in versioning 0.9.8.13

3212944
config	ini
for advanced users they can edit the config using a text editor if it s stored in a text file ini file config file etc.. or you can make an api

3212994
put	get
the second time i put that same string in which fires -toggletag rather than -createtag but ends up in the same rendering method i get the console message

3212994
next	except
i m not going to deal with this button again except to tell it to remove itself next time i render my tag list so it seems like the view controller ought to release it

3212996
jquery	scriptaculous
and then in your javascript i am using jquery but you could use prototype scriptaculous or you favorite js flavor

3213046
rss	feed
in my table cell i am displaying images which i retrive from imge link in rss feed and title

3213059
pop-up	dialog
to make it a pop-up window use something like jquery ui dialog

3213077
post	get
what you need to do is use the post method - you can t get around this if your url is going to be over the limit although you can delay the inevitable by abbreviating names and values

3213077
post	get
take the post and then redirect the client to a get to keep things addressable you can either store the search server side against a key and retrieve it on the get from memory or a database or you could encode the keys into a single querystring key or a smaller number of keys which capture the behaviour

3213105
multiplying	transpose
instead i got valueerror shape mismatch objects cannot be broadcast to a single shape when multiplying testmatrix with its transpose

3213183
width	height
the fact that the value in prefs.bounds have x y width and height properties doesn t make it a rectangle object - it is just an object with those four properties

3213217
put	get
every datastore get put or query is a round-trip to an external server

3213217
put	get
save all of your entities using one datastore put and you will get much faster results

3213245
hash	salt
don t forget to salt it with something so reverse lookup of the hash won t reveal the password

3213293
apache	nginx
typically apache or nginx

3213297
children	parent
i want to be able to create a parent object with children and let the parent handle the update saves and deletes

3213297
children	parent
after the postback i create a new parent with children

3213298
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
you need to know that when you use a sqldatareader it is necessary to close it separately from your sqlconnection

3213322
translation	localization
if you are working by yourself i would be wary of actually doing your own localization unless you are a native speaker or are fluent in the languages you want to translation your pages to

3213343
folder	directory
rather than iterate over all images in the directory you could iterate over all products in the database and for each product copy the image to a new folder but it s pretty much the same thing

3213357
accessor	properties
for this scenario you can even go one step further and specify a public static properties with only the get accessor which in turns uses the private static readonly field

3213417
versioning	upgrade
actually i suggest to upgrade to versioning 1.2.138 because there was a bug fixed related to this feature in earlier versioning

3213449
kindle	nook
the nook and the kindle have this capability i believe but you ll need to use their protections schemes to take advantage of it

3213456
decoder	encoder
while i can sling a them at the encoder decoder directly it would be nice to have a human readable source the base64 equivalent of the quick brown dog

3213479
integer	fractions
integer and fractions parts both

3213480
int	chars
the first reason is that when you read pass a chars to a function it s actually automatically promoted to an int so is stored into the va_arg as an int

3213480
int	chars
so when you read a chars you re reading an int s worth of memory not a chars s - so you re not actually reading a byte at a time

3213480
128bit	64bit
a further reason has to do with alignment - on some architectures one example would be very recent arm processors a double must be aligned to a 64bit or sometimes even 128bit boundary

3213533
public	protected
these log-methods would be protected and only get invoked through one log-method which is public to use for the programmer

3213538
accessor	ivar
if it s defined as retain you should use the accessor instead of releasing the ivar and setting it manually.

3213574
put	get
what i now want to do is get the value of that registery key and put it in the url

3213611
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout this alternative is very similar to setinterval except that it doesn t ensures a given interval between repetition rather focuses on how long the browser should wait until repeating the action

3213628
formview	detailsview
i would rather use a formview detailsview if both the view and edit page is on the same

3213628
formview	detailsview
you can store a variable in session regarding the user level then on each page load you can check the level depending on that open the formview detailsview in either normal or edit mode

3213732
appfuse	grails
anthony- i don t know a great deal about appfuse but i can comment on porting to grails

3213741
width	height
i tried to swap height width for the camera parameters but not much of a difference

3213765
integer	unsigned
for the sake of being closer to portable you should use unsigned integer types for this purpose uint32_t etc.

3213816
range	max	range	min	min	max
sweetspotsimilarity lets you define a sweet spot for the length of a field in terms of a range defined by min and max

3213829
qfile	qdatastream
if you are using qt to implement this kind of solution you need two sets of qfile and qdatastream instances one for writing and one for reading

3213842
rss	feed
django-way of specifying channel image in rss feed

3213860
versioning	upgrade
of course this is very simplified since if you need to upgrade the versioning and the then you re in trouble

3213885
portrait	landscape
when this is run on the iphone simulator and device if you rotate to landscape on view c and then tap the back button to return to view b it does the right thing and shifts view b back to portrait mode

3213967
subtract	add
and always store the time in utc.and when you want to display that information to particular user then just access this user s timezone which is stored for this user and add or subtract that amount of time from the time stored in utc and display this.that will be in the timezone of the user who is viewing the information

3213979
public	protected
short answer start your thread by calling not run and make sure you thread s run method is protected not public

3214027
put	get
inside the loop you can get the first element and put the rest into an array

3214091
folder	directory
in a console application assuming you copy the file to the output folder copy to output directory copy always in the properties of the file at the same place as the executable you could use a relative path

3214094
nsobject	nsautoreleasepool
however that is irrelevant to the question but actually you are allowed to send -retain to any objective-c object derived from nsobject except nsautoreleasepool

3214097
inline-functions	inlining
this is necessary if you want it to be considered for inlining most compilers can only inline-functions defined in the current compilation unit

3214099
getter	setter
favoring constructor over getter setter instantiation also helps immutability that is creating an object thorough its constructor and not letting anyone modify its properties later on

3214105
vb6	vba
vba shares the same code base as vb6 and in 1996 was available to be licensed to developers to include in their own applications

3214105
vb.net	vb6
vb.net was a radical departure from vb6

3214105
vb.net	vb6	vb6	vba
though subsequent iterations of vb.net have been referred to in sequence vb7 vb8 etc. by many developers vb.net shares very little with vb6 and vba other than the basic syntax

3214105
vb.net	vb6	vb6	vba
because it s entirely different from vba and vb6 you cannot not use vb.net code directly in vba

3214105
vb.net	vb6
because vb.net code compiles down to the same managed intermediate language code as c# and shares the same .net apis you may feel more commonality between c# and vb.net than vb6 and vb.net from a programming perspective

3214144
pop-up	dialog

the openfiledialog appears to be defaulting to the last directory used but this is useless to me since it is almost always the wrong folder and i end up alternating between the two folder

3214262
mef	prism
the june 1 drop of prism 4 supports mef instead of unity as a di container

3214294

i ve tried both of these and the best i can do is hide the row make it invisible but it keeps the whitespace it takes up - i need to remove the whitespace too so if it is not show that it doesn t take up paper viewing space

3214327
nsstring	nsobject
i have a method to generate a deck object nsobject subclass with an nsmutablearray property and it populates the array with card objects uiview subclass with some integer and one nsstring property

while i understand that this annotation has been introduced to map an association properties to different types of entities that don t have a common ancestor entity i think it would be better to introduce a base type the other entities would inherited from for bidirectional relations

3214522
int	double
because if number is a double and number2 is an int they will not be of the same class and you will get an exception telling you of that fact

3214537
int	double
a double representing 2.0 and an int representing 2 are definitely different objects and certainly not interchangeable in a general sense

3214572
getter	setter
the binding is partially there because the view model s property getter and setter each get called once when a row is selected and thus causes the details view to expand

3214573
vsto	add-in
i created a office add-in in vs 2008 c# .net 3.5 and vsto

3214781
unix	solaris
three flavors of unix linux solaris irix.

3214797

3214801
pascal	delphi
wolfgang ehrhardt has done the pascal delphi port for isaac and is available at

multiplying	subtract
you can either do this by pulling apart the bits to read the mantissa directly or you can write a messy floating point loop that first multiplies the value by a power of two to put it in the range 1 x 10 then pulls off a digit at a time by casting to int subtract and multiplying by 10

3215082
queue	fifo
fifo would be a queue

3215108
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
hunky dory in firefox ie8 google-chrome and opera

3215177
width	height
and specify the height and width

3215187
width	height
you need to explicitly state the width and height in your css declaration for .plus

3215194
width	height
your image has a height and width of 0 so it won t show up in ie7 at all

3215196
implements	extends
the way to extends natives is to use the implements method

3215235
multiplying	subtract
you can either do this by pulling apart the bits to read the mantissa directly or you can write a messy floating point loop that first multiplies the value by a power of two to put it in the range 1 x 10 then pulls off a digit at a time by casting to int subtract and multiplying by 10

3215238
inline	inlining
anyway as a result of this and if you know that the - is the original one when the library is loaded some compilers will detect this and see that the - call is always going to be the actual subtraction function and therefore they will inline calls to it and inlining a call to - can eventually result in assembly code for subtracting two numbers so this is a big speed boost

3215249
accessor	properties
i imagine your thing properties is not getting retained because you re not using your accessor to set it

3215306
width	height
my math was correct in calculating the effective scale value 1 0.5 0.5 then scaling it by 0.5 again does 0.25 but what i was doing was calculating the effective width height by the original width height not the updated width height

3215306
width	height
scaling it further by 0.5 the effective scale is 0.25 but the new width height should be 4000x4000 found by scaling 1000 by 0.25 and not 500 by 0.25

3215356
pull	push
however it does have the benefit that if you want to pull changes from a mercurial user you can pull them into the hg repo and push them out to github

3215359
filtering	grouping
the two named_scope s are located in the account model and are used to filtering accounts by a user and by a grouping

3215427
cpu	processors
macro processors insert special directives into processed source that allow compiler to map compiled sequences of cpu instructions to source code lines

3215428
lisp	racket	lisp	scheme	scheme	racket
on the side of using macros racket has always been more advanced than other scheme and lisp implementations

3215428
lisp	scheme
some scheme and lisp implementations will implement a limited for of this using the identity of subforms as dmitry-vk mentioned

3215450
post	get
i will post it up when i get it working

3215487
fadein	fadeout
2 the fadein and fadeout animations don t keep stacking up

3215537
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have built a dropdown menu on a site that works perfectly in ie8 and the usual firefox google-chrome and safari

3215550
client-side	server-side
all of the code on our website is currently run server-side and is split up in multiple pages but i would like to get all the client-side features like transition animations and iphone-like buttons that jqtouch offers

3215553
width	height
i don t know what the width and or height of the cell will be ahead of time and setting the div s width and height to 100 does not work

3215555
multiplication	exponent
points out in the comments 128-bit floating point numbers already allow large enough exponent to call into question both lookup tables and standard long multiplication

3215555
integer	radix
actually the big integer package gmp already has ã n time radix conversion as well as good heuristics for which choice of multiplication algorithm

3215555
division	multiplication
in this solution they also need fast division but that can be obtained from fast multiplication in any of several ways

3215557
geocoding	geocode
the google geocoding api provides a direct way to access a geocode via an http request

3215558
post	put
i think a smart solution is to use post to create an initially empty short lived holding area for a resource to which you can put clients need to post to create the guid resource instead of discovering it via a link

3215574
factors	matrix
a transformation matrix is a factors of scaling matrix ss transition matrix st and rotation matrix sr

3215574
cos	sin
replace cos th with a and sin th with b and solve the equations

3215586
width	height
the jlabels i am creating inside of the jpanel are being sized using the setbounds method to which i provide x y height and width

3215586
width	height
furthermore the height width parameters were being pulled dynamically from the label using getminimumheight etc so the label gets sized according to how much text is in it

3215611
libs	buildpath
it works in eclipse because it s smart enough to include the necessary libs in the classpath based on the configured project s buildpath

3215625
cvs	svn
we re not only supporting svn in addition to git and mercurial but also cvs

3215643
client-side	server-side
i ve seen some examples that use server-side scripts such as remy sharp s solution but i just need strictly a client-side jquery solution

3215659
fadein	fadeout
you may also be getting continuous blinking long after typing stops because multiple fadein fadeout animations are queued

3215659
fadein	fadeout
to reduce the number of ajax calls thus the number of fadein fadeout as well put a short delay on the keyup function so the ajax call is made after a short delay and if a user types quickly only one call is made

3215692
getter	setter
i would stick with the first version until you need to add code to the getter or setter method like validating a new value for the property.

3215769
textarea	textbox
textbox is single line editor and textarea is multi line editor there is no default implementation of rich text editing in html so far

3215839
width	height
you said in your original question that setting width and height to 100 didn t work though which makes me suspect that there is some other rule overriding it

3215889
move	drag
so what happens if both fingers hit the screen nearly simultaneously is that the 2nd finger should be pointer 1 gets a move action before pointer down is called making the code think it s a drag not a pinch zoom

3215898
next	except
works beautifully except for one thing when the page loads the slideshow isn t automatically scrolling it requires the user to click prev next

3215908
getter	setter
boiler plate code ide s are great for doing all the crap you don t want to do like generating getter setter for a field comments skeleton classes etc

3215955
lxml	beautifulsoup
lxml is faster than beautifulsoup i think and has much better functionality while remaining relatively easy to use

3215958
mouse	keyboard
traditionally serial and printer ports as well as keyboard mouse temperature sensors and so forth were i o devices

3215960
width	height
there are 2 divs they both expand the full width of the browser window they are both 450px in height

3216032
put	get
there are put and get calls for servletcontext that allow you treat it essentially as a map

3216081
ubuntu	linux
i have cua-mode t in my .emacs so that c-c is copy and c-v is paste just like most other programs on my desktop ubuntu gnome linux

3216088
submit	submission
i can do it without any issues as long as i capture the submit using submit but i would have to run my own validation on the data because it operates independently of the regular submission

3216091
int	chars
hint a chars can be cast as an int

3216155
gif	png
it would be desirable if you could convert that on-the-fly into a smaller format gif jpg png depending on the content color of the image data and then serve that up to the user

3216169
next	except
everything is working fine except with the problem that when i am using the soft keyboard and switched to numeric key entry and move from first field to next field the keyboard layout automatically changed to alphanumeric

3216286
width	height
i tried to make it with changing width and height separately

3216318
viewdidload	viewwillappear
you can fix this by setting this in your viewdidload method or even the viewwillappear

3216351
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
i m trying to generate a few markers and to save code i ve put the marker generation into a for-loop which loops through an arrays of markers there are actual values instead of long lat x x x in the real arrays

3216411
viewdidload	viewwillappear
this won t work in viewdidload or viewwillappear since the table most likely haven t been populated by then at least it wasn t in my case

3216413
post	put
2 either put data in body of your request post put delete request

3216433
vbscript	jscript
the sample is in vbscript but it shouldn t be too tricky to change it to jscript

3216440
nltk	opennlp
i ve looked at a few libaries like nltk and opennlp and while they have decent tools to handle symbolic logic and parse natural language neither seems to have any kind of proabablilstic framework for converting one to the other

3216446
filtering	grouping	sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping
the view supports grouping filtering sorting and currency and the icollectionview interface is from system.componentmodel so you wouldn t have to add a gui reference to your viewmodel project

3216496
int	chars
or chars by casting the product of an int calculation to string

3216520
hide	show
basically it s using classes on the trs to show and hide them and using a larger number of hidden selects to show groups of subcategories

3216530
switching	screens
you can switching out which form is in the main context so you can load up your splash screens in an initial application context and then swap it out once it s loaded

3216567
post	put
while shifting to another page you just put the values of first page variable in sessions then you can access the value of previous page at any page then post the value to the database query

3216586
getter	setter
i ve found a way that is specifying a getter and setter for every date field however i want do it in a more convenient way 1 setter + 1 getter for every date field in every table is a lot

3216590
vb.net	vb6
you could to take a look into this article it s worth reading as a warm up converting vb6 to vb.net part i

3216595
vb.net	vb6

3216933
imperative	declarative
i like over because they feel more in the vein of xsl being declarative and are just a little bit more uncomfortable for me coming from an imperative scripting and programming background

3216951
icollectionview	ieditableobject
also i made the objects that are in my icollectionview derive from ieditableobject so when they are updated the grid will refresh itself

3216956
filesystems	ntfs
filesystems transactions do exist on windows vista and higher ntfs only

3217045

i would use jackson json processor but there are many alternatives to choose from guice or xstream if you prefer xml

3217105
hash	md5
the sso works with an iframe the user s details are given in the querystring and one of the details has to be hash md5

3217132
nsurl	nsstring
it looks like you can use an nsstring or an nsurl but either way the url you specify must conform to the standards outlined in rfc 2396 etc.

you don t need a converter from merb to webrick and another from sinata to thin

3217278
centroid	convex
find the centroid of the convex hull

3217284
extjs	qooxdoo
here we have dojo extjs smartclient qooxdoo and others.they all offer us to write js-code and do some css html design

3217284
client-side	server-side
so my initial vision was to take asp.net mvc for server-side and take some nice client-side framework

3217284
client-side	server-side
i m sure many of you faced the similar problems how to effectively connect ajax ria client-side with server-side in data-intensive crud-like often enterprise intranet applications not web sites

3217394
division	subtraction
a different way is to form your operation a subtraction and a division in two steps like this

3217425
goto	break
also there s no room for comparison with goto because break cannot arbitrarily change program s flow from one point to the other lie goto does

3217438
post	get
post some specific error messages exceptions caught and you ll get more help.

3217445
goto	break
break is a language feature used to abort a loop - you could use goto but then you incur the appropriate wrath of the xkcd comic below

3217445
goto	break
this applies to break goto c++ exceptions etc

3217451
daemons	launchd
note the launchd facility is he preferred mechanism for launchd daemons in mac os x v10.4 and higher

3217495
pull	push
then you can use normal push pull in and out hg commands on both hg and svn repos

3217553
folder	directory
i ve had red exclamation points before that were a symptom of subversion errors caused by copying a folder on the filesystem and inadvertently copying the invisible .svn directory

3217553
folder	directory
to fix it i found the .svn directory in the folder it was something like projectname src main java com package name .svn then deleted it and performed an update followed by a commit and it was all back to normal

3217554
int	chars
as you have discovered the chars value of the int 0 and the chars literal 0 are different

3217582
int	chars
see a chars datatype is really an int value which conventionally denotes a codepoint the numeric value assignated to a textual chars in unicode

3217582
int	chars
so is sort of a shortcut to say assign c1 the int value that corresponds to the codepoint of the chars a

try using google-chrome safari opera or firefox instead

3217630
width	height
another problem with your code is that for form elements you shouldn t be setting the width height on the containing elements

3217644
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome both list the following error in the console unsafe javascript attempt to access frame with url our app url on facebook from frame with url url our iframe loads from

width	height
- one approach - if so then you can calculate where your symbol needs to be using the x y width height and rotation values of the lines

3217755
hash	md5
wordpress uses an md5 password hash so make sure you hash the users password with the md5 function before passing it to the database

3217762
hex	binary
hex to decimal probably isn t as important unless of course you need to change the value from a decimal first but that s a simple conversion formula but hex to binary will be important seeing as each hex character 0-9 a-f corresponds to a specific binary output

3217762
hex	binary
i would recommend if the buffer wouldn t be too large to take the entire hex dump and replace whatever you re searching for in there to avoid overwriting a duplicate binary sequence

3217918
int	boolean
my mind is drawing a blank on how to implement it nicely i would like to implement it with out using an int or boolean to see if there is a thread waiting already

3218350
int	boolean
on why it works on strings and python â œisâ operator behaves unexpectedly with int on why it works on int thus boolean for the same reason

3218406
vb.net	vb6
my suggestion to you is to learn vb.net rather than vb6 and develop an actual desktop application or if your application is more comfortable on the web just develop a web application put it on the web and let users load it with their web browsers

3218407
bluetooth	usb
you can print direct to most wifi printers or installing by the weprint helper software on your mac or pc you can print to any printer connected to your computer via usb cable network wifi bluetooth or other means

getter	setter
a lot of getter setter

3218486
getter	setter
one point is i would like to see all private member variables to be declared first and then the getter setter methods follow

3219147
bazaar	git
at the moment they only implement mercurial but git bazaar and darcs are planned as well

3219147
bazaar	git
however amp is designed so that you use the mercurial commands on a git repository or darcs commands with bazaar semantics on a mercurial repository so there is a very clear separation between those layers

3219171

you basically just need to store references to marker objects in an array set their type school bus stop etc. and then on some event loop through and hide show as appropriate

3219614
disk	ram
it s more efficient quicker to get data from ram than to get it from disk

3219614
disk	ram
the speed of sql server depends partly on how much data how many of its index and data pages it s able to keep in ram instead of on disk

3219655
nunit	mstest
resharper has no plugins listed in the plugins dialog and in the resharper|options|unit testing item the unit testing providers listed are mstest and nunit

3219698
getter	setter
properties using getter and setter

3219717
draggable	droppable
you can use the jquery ui draggable plugin and droppable plugin for this

3219747
disk	ram
of anything that is 620448401733239439360000 will never fit in memory be it ram or disk so the best you can do is to generate a number n between 1 and 24

3219767
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome 18+ firefox 14+ ie 11+ safari 6+

3219767
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this works on ie 5.5+ firefox 2+ google-chrome safari 3+ and opera 9.6+

3219778
google-chrome	firefox
my problem is that the div will only show up when click a button in google-chrome but not firefox or ie

3219781
gridview	repeater	listview	gridview
read about the data controls data sources gridview listview repeater etc

3219791
fadein	fadeout
problem is the fadein is happening before the fadeout completes which is causing the cards to stack for a moment which looks horrible versus the current card fading out and the new card fading in

3219792
implements	extends
of course the key idea is that you ll implements item setting and getting as well as iteration by simply delegating to your chosen std map and performing the needed type conversion and low-level fiddling object allocation reference counting -- the latter is the part that higher-level frameworks for extends python save you from having to do essentially but the wrap and delegate underlying architecture won t change by much

3219825
unix	bsd
it is expensive say on a bsd system to set up a cross-compilation environment that accurately simulates gnu headers. in the days when most varieties of unix were proprietary and vendors had to support them all this problem was very serious

3219829
subclass	abstract-class
datasetobserver is an abstract-class so it s up to the subclass to decide what to do on oninvalidated

3219832
fadein	hide	fadein	fadeout	hide	fadeout
you can manually set the duration then use a timeout for the fadein calling hide and killing the fadeout effect

3219891
post	get
at the time they definitely worked on get data rather than post if it s changed to post you might need to look into curl

3219910
nsstring	nsdata
i wouldn t even mind converting the nsdata to an nsstring first if dictionarywithstring existed

3219918
int	double
double getanything int flag

3219919
implements	extends
today most applications are using some kinds of underlying frameworks and with the frameworks come requirements on the objects that will integrate with the framework - the object must implements an interface or extends a class

3219919
getter	setter
such objects are often mandated by certain frameworks which use reflection to find out the properties accessible through getter setter of the object and manipulate them beans exposed to jsps spring beans etc

3219925
backgrounding	multitasking
i m really sad because i think that multitasking of apple is not real multitasking in fact they only keep the state of the app but they don t allow it to run in backgrounding

3219993
nsbitmapimagerep	nsimage
it doesnt matter if its nsimage or nsbitmapimagerep or anything

3220007
for-loop	loops
if you aren t going to loops a specific number of times but simply want to loops while some condition is true you can use a while loops instead of a for-loop

3220012
sudo	passwd
try setting up sudo so that your hudson user has permissions to run your build command as user without entering a passwd

3220022

i am working with a cms for a web app in php that has the needs of shortening the process for inserting embedding stuff like a video from youtube or vimeo by wroting the following which are stored in the database

3220026
google-chrome	firefox
works fine in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie8

3220034
extjs	sproutcore
for ui widgets there are various libraries like dojo extjs sproutcore

3220094
int	chars
the type of pointer refers to the type of memory it is pointing to normally e.g a chars chars pointer points to a memory with chars in it also this type of pointer has a lot to do with the pointer arithmetic like e.g how many bytes of jump the address will make if you add an int to the pointer s name

3220105
metaphone	soundex
metaphone and soundex are phonetic algorithms for indexing strings by their english pronunciation

3220108
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
the subclassing as they inherited from the base class can respond to sayhello but in case they are not implementing this method themselves the call gets dispatched to the superclass sayhello

3220156
post	get
this resolution was obscure enough that i decided to go ahead create the post and answer it myself so any other newbies like myself won t get hung up

3220209
opera	firefox
for some reason firefox is messing up the following websites layout it works fine in ie and opera though.

3220211
metaphone	soundex
more generally soundex and metaphone can be used to find strings that sound similar when pronounced out loud

3220211
metaphone	soundex
when they type it in and it doesn t find me in the database soundex or metaphone might be used to say there s no nicolas knight but there is a nicholas knight

3220233
g++	gcc
when i grepped nm .o for the name of my method i found that the object files emitted by gcc had unmangled names while the .cu files which were compiled by g++ expected mangled names

3220235
daemons	launchd
i am writing a daemons in c++ on linux which would launchd

3220235
daemons	launchd
other processes launchd by this daemons

3220247
folder	directory
in the end i realized that i was making a full path call to rsync.exe which meant my current directory was no picking up the etc folder i just created

3220264
getter	setter
to oversimplify a lot the business objects should have getter setter methods and the dto should just have properties

3220304
fast-forward	merge
you do that by avoiding any kind of merge other than fast-forward

3220304
fast-forward	merge
this will be a fast-forward merge

3220306
std	ostream
or just define regular streaming for std ostream and use std stringstream

3220332
integer	fractions
now b is an integer and 0 log a 1 so log a is really just the fractions part of log x

3220366
int	double
i ve assumed int as a base type but you could use others ex double or float or even be polymorphic

3220374
ssl	https
apparently apache was sourcing the .htaccess in the parent folder of the https ssl webroot folder

3220417
width	height
and when changing width and height of svg element both to 100 it looks like this which is not correct

3220418
folder	directory
now you should see .svn folder in every directory of your local project you donâ t see them if you use the â œ export â function of the scm panel from xcode

3220541
google-chrome	firefox
with firefox google-chrome it works

3220566
int	chars
the problem is that the code is giving to pack i am referring the the last arguments a chars an array and an int

3220572
bazaar	git
native support for other version control systems git mercurial and bazaar

3220579
division	multiplication
because they are heavily used in multiplication and division an improvement would have a ripple effect

3220591
jobs	cron
the cron jobs has to be created going into cpanel cron jobs menu

3220647
post	get
if i get a resolution there i ll post here

3220651
inherited	properties
note i am not sure if the workbook based on a given template will inherited the properties defined using customdocumentproperties in the template

3220662
portrait	landscape
when the app rotates from portrait to landscape or back the font weight appears to slightly change

3220662
portrait	landscape
both bold text and regular text get slightly bolder in landscape and slightly thinner in portrait

3220693
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome or safari on a mac could be much faster than firefox on a pc especially with newer apis

3220700
free	malloc
the metaphor is pretty similar fork malloc wait free at a certain level

3220702
ggplot2	lattice
the graph should be in lattice because of the legend position i tried it with ggplot2 but you can t show the legend in one row

3220717
force.com	salesforce
you can build applications on salesforce force.com and integrate them directly within gmail

3220717
force.com	salesforce
i work as a technical lead for cloud development at the daily telegraph and i d highly recommend using salesforce force.com for any crm requirements

3220723
dictionary	map
i would just create a dictionary or map from abbreviation to full description

3220802
client-side	server-side
cookies are primarily for reading server-side local storage can only be read by the client-side

3220811
accessor	properties
it sounds like the properties is set to copy which means the synthesized accessor makes an immutable copy of the array

3220820
jsf	seam
nevertheless i m looking for a way to insert either number partially in a page of a jsf facelets seam application

3220835
ubuntu	linux
regarding python it is a very nice language and there is high usage mostly on linux platforms a lot of redhat ubuntu tools are written in python

3220835
unix	solaris
while this is not the case on unix platforms solaris hpux - python is not even installed by default on these which still lean more towards perl

3220860
button	checkbox
when the user wants to add another selection he she clicks a button checkbox radio..whatever

3220902
post	get
if you would post some real-world examples you probably would get a lot of suggestions here on so how to improve your code

3220908
operands	scalar
if either operands of scalar

3220909
datatrigger	eventtrigger
maybe datatrigger actiontrigger eventtrigger maybe by code xaml i don t care i just need a solution

3220948
g++	gcc
this compiles fine i m using g++ my gcc version is 4 4.4.1-1ubuntu2 but when i run the program it skips right over the return statement

3220955
cos	sin
going through the tutorial again today i noticed in chapter 5 of the tutorial not only a clear statement that llvm uses the abi application binary interface of the platform but also that the tutorial compiler depends on this to allow access to external functions such as sin and cos

3220961
hide	show
i would like to show a loading gif that does the following basically ajax_load_comments and pics are divs with animated gif backgrounds in comments and pics container respectively that show up on ajaxstart and hide on ajacstop

3220981
ibatis	mybatis
mybatis formerly ibatis has a schema migration tool for use on the command line

3220989
portrait	landscape
i ve been reworking this for the ipad and if you are holding the device in portrait or landscape modes everything works as intended the correct default image is used the correct image that is used to animate this off is used all orientations work fine

3221015
accessor	properties
if you have transient properties custom accessor non-entity properties etc in the game entity i would look there

3221016
ddms	adb
you can get the full stack trace via adb logcat ddms or the ddms perspective in eclipse

3221054
width	height
outside wpf you can use system.drawing.bitmap class width and height properties to get the size of an image

3221059
hex	binary
i think i ve figured the conversion part out but i can t edit the binary with the data because it seems that writebyte can only write hex values like 0xcd and there seems to be no way to store the hex value and still write it

3221072
mvp	presenter
i think you would lose a lot of those benefits with mvp as the view and presenter are more tightly coupled

3221077
hex	binary
you seem to be confused about hex vs decimal vs binary vs ascii

3221082
icns	ico	png	ico
check out - iconvert allows you to easily convert windows ico to mac os x icns svg to windows icons png ico to mac os x ico jpg images to windows icons and much more

3221088
gdk	cairo
to draw you can use either plain gdk which is more basic or use cairo which is more flexible drawing library nb

3221088
gtk	cairo
cairo is used by gtk anyway so it s not additional dependency

3221130
backgrounding	multitasking
look at multitasking under receiving location events in the backgrounding

3221167
pop-up	dialog
if this string is not empty then a pop-up confirmation dialog containing this string and some other boilerplate text provided from the browser

3221167
post	get
as a general rule any action that changes the state of the data on the server should be done through a post request rather than a get

3221190
post	get
the second and more robust way would be to implement the post redirect get pattern which when used prevents the data from being posted again when a user refreshes the page

3221193
int	chars
note that c must be an int or long or some other int type not a chars

3221193
int	chars
if it is a chars or unsigned chars the wrong overload will be called and individual chars will be extracted from the string not hexadecimal int strings

3221272
google-chrome	firefox
i don t want the automatic gray-out in firefox google-chrome

3221355
post	get
modalbox obviously is managing the get post itself and unfortunately is losing 99 of the validations that the typical constraints block gives you

3221364
pascal	delphi
first of all i must state that i m a complete newb when it comes to delphi although i did some turbo pascal programming in school some fourteen years ago.

3221364
bde	dbase
i have a commercial delphi program which uses dbase database and bde for accessing them

3221364
bde	dbase
unfortunately using oledb against dbase results in broken indexes only native bde apps seem to be able to safely access the data

3221394
switching	screens
this isn t a deal-breaker as you can just avoid full screens mode but then you also lose the ability to use your own icon in the app switching tray

3221400
onmousedown	onmouseup
prior art use onmousedown onmouseup

3221402
printf	strcpy
if you want to store the empty string in b you need to use a library function like strcpy or preferably a safer function like printf

3221456
width	height
i would expect that the width and height drastically change as the uiscrollview is how wider than it is high and vice versa

3221486
folder	directory
i want my htaccess to redirect everything in the web directory folder back to the index.php file no matter what

3221491
g++	gcc
maybe you should be using g++ the c++ compiler instead of gcc the c compiler

3221535
nstextfield	nstableview
i made a cocoa application that has an nstableview an nstextfield and an nsbutton

3221589
superclass	subclassing
i assume you come from another language such as c++ or c# where you can use the virtual keyword to let subclassing override the superclass method

3221589
public	protected
in java there is no virtual because all public and protected methods can be overridden

3221617
opera	firefox
it works fine in firefox and opera though

3221617
opera	firefox
if you do the same in opera and firefox it will work perfectly

3221663
versioning	upgrade
we cannot upgrade to latest cc versioning due to expense and complexity of this process and some administrative burden i guess

3221693
children	parent
so for example when the server processes a node it shows up in my proper css color but once the server shows that it has children it does the additem to that node and the css of the text color of the parent is reverted back to default

3221696
rubygems	rvm
i just uninstalled that entire rvm branch started a new one with 1.9.2-head on shteef s recommendation installed rubygems no problems this time and installed rails3 with no problems

3221715
union	distinct
i m on a project where i was asked to take a quick peek at some reporting sql in a sql server 2k5 environment and was surprised at what i found 4 to 5 levels of subquerys distinct clauses union and nolock hints which were needed because the sql was running so long it was blocking standard processing - all in the same set

3221740
cpu	hyperthreading
now the jit produces native code for the cpu using various optimization algorithms which tend to be more aggressive than the default c++ optimizer that comes with visual studio and the instruction set used by the .net jit compiler are a closer reflection of the actual cpu on the machine so certain substitutions in the machine code could be made to reduce clock cycles and improve the hit rate in the cpu pipeline cache and produce further hyperthreading optimizations such us instruction reordering and improvements relating to branch prediction

3221745
post	get
in the former post bennett provides some reasons why he switched to using foreignkey instead of onetoonefield but i don t quite get it especially when i see other post that recommend the opposite

3221791
teradata	greenplum
greenplum or teradata will be a good option

3221791
postgresql	greenplum
greenplum is a distributed postgresql db and also has it own mapreduce

3221817
hash	salt
the new password is randomly generated and sent by mail then salt hash and saved to the database

3221841
post	get
however i can not see any method for runtime mutation of a url as opposed to a get or post argument

3221877
hash	salt
when you have confirmed that the passwords match and they are acceptable update the database store only a salt hash of my password not the password itself

3221877
hash	salt
256 bits or so ought to do it for overkill mode -- sha256 salt email old pw hash time stamp maybe some bytes from dev urandom or similar.

3221903
next	except
essentially the application .exe file and db file sit next to each other in a folder and function like any other db application except without the use of servers

3221929
portrait	landscape
if you reference a view that is only present in one mode say portrait then in landscape you ll get the problem loading widget message in your widget box

3221937
integer	unsigned
if you can represent your similarity as an integer in range 256 you use an unsigned byte as the array.array element

3221945
google-chrome	safari
safari 5.1+ and google-chrome 13+ also support strict mode

3222022
mousemove	mousedown
i don t see any reason to use expression in mousedown event handler but it makes more sense in mousemove event handler

3222068
g++	gcc
assuming you are correctly specifying a hidden visibility to g++ for all of your source files as other posters have recommended there s a chance you might be running in to this gcc bug

3222082
put	get
if i write this bellow syntax get same out put but here i can not set table and column name

3222095
portrait	landscape
without more detail it s hard to say why your approach doesn t work but my guess is that you are seeing the sprite positioning you describe as a result of the fact that if you don t change orientation the lower left in portrait is the lower right in landscape when rotated left it s the same point in gl space 0 0

3222103
xna	spritebatch
i have looked into the layerdepth of spritebatch draw method calls but they appear to be unrelated to the xna framework draw order between the game and drawablegamecomponent classes

3222111
ant	maven
netbeans by default will create an ant project although you can use maven as well with netbeans

3222141
postgresql	mysql
i mostly use it for sql server mysql and postgresql

3222153
16-bit	64bit
64bit windows cannot run 8- or 16-bit executables due to limitations of long mode

3222170
hash	salt
if you are checking an entered password against a given user account or object you should reference the object on the same line that you have the salt and hash salt+password

3222170
hash	salt
require the account name object to be referenced when the password is given then look up the row corresponding to that account name and object and compare the password against that salt + hash

3222170
hash	salt
if you are keeping a record of items that you ve seen before then you should just go with a hash or a bloom filter and forget the salt because it doesn t buy you anything

3222196
disk	ram
1 why java is stored in ram and not stored in hard disk

3222205
getter	setter
simple stuff simple getter and setter methods is unlikely to contain bugs and can be tested indirectly by higher-level unit tests

3222212
disk	ram
if you re talking about variables storing variables in ram allows for fast read write access orders of magnitude faster than disk

3222235
textarea	textbox
create a textbox or textarea in that hidden form

3222291
getter	setter
using delegate.createdelegate to build delegates for the getter and setter

3222313
rtp	rtcp
look at the definitions for rtp and rtcp packets in rfc 3550

3222313
rtp	rtcp
with that in hand you ll see there s not a lot you can do to determine if a packet contains rtp rtcp

3222317
postgresql	mysql
by just changing the driver from mysql to postgresql found here

3222340
int	boolean
previously we used to store an object which is defined by other project objects but doest follow rules of serialization because of which it ran into numerous problems and so we decided to change the structure blob object which now contains only primitive objects only string boolean int etc

3222350
public	protected
they may still be accessed by protected and public members of the base class

3222351
std	ostream
in this situation because ostream used to be a class and it wasn t in namespace std

3222351
std	ostream
ostream is now in namespace std and programmers aren t allowed to declare anything that lives in namespace std

3222381
getter	setter	equals	tostring	tostring	getter
i jave a simple java bean with 4 attributes getter setter and some overided methods like tostring equals and hashcode

3222403
debian	linux
debian linux lenny 5.0

3222496
put	get	post	put	post	get
the background task will post the domain names to another site get the response parse it to get useful information then put data to a globle memory hash the task takes 3 seconds

3222511
decimal	ieee
because ieee floating point arithmetic can t express decimal numbers precisely in general

3222521
bash	zsh
here is a version that will work in any of the bourne-derived shells i tried including dash ksh several versions of bash busybox ash zsh with -y and even the heirloom bourne shell

3222527
free	malloc
the new and delete operators are the preferred c++ alternatives to malloc and free because they are aware and capable of invoking the constructors and destructors of classes in addition to allocation and deallocation of memory

3222528
put	get
using coredata plus sqlite i see that the sqlite store file is put into the documents directory of my app in the iphonesimulator if you want to get that path precisely you can use this method

3222530
chown	chmod
also make sure you set the fifo owner and permission chown and chmod appropriately for your application -- you might not want to allow your firefox s flash plugin to write to this file and command your database

3222593
vmware	virtualbox
if you are targeting different windows versions with your application it is a really good idea to set up a virtual test environment for each of the primary target platforms for example using vmware ms virtual pc or oracle virtualbox

3222618
put	get
the benefit of concurrenthashmap over something like collections.synchronizedmap is the combined methods like putifabsent which provide traditional map get and put logic in an internally synchronized way

3222642
mp4	h.264
i m writing a web app that serves h.264 encoded mp4 video

3222642
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome and safari it does this via an html5 video tag

3222652
ddms	adb
you need to learn how to debug in eclipse and how to use the adb and ddms tools

3222654
client-side	server-side
server-side scripting interacts with database to produce dynamic html which is then manipulated client-side via

3222678
mouseleave	mouseenter
you want if element.get checked return at the top of the mouseenter mouseleave callbacks

3222686
put	get
get put on the stack the compiler

3222694
client-side	server-side
server-side scripting interacts with database to produce dynamic html which is then manipulated client-side via

3222695
int	boolean
the following code snippet shows you how to get the address of a boolean variable and how to convert that pointer to an int converting to byte is not possible we need four bytes

3222703
fastcgi	scgi
i m looking for resources about interaction between client side web socket web server and real application backend that works behind cgi fastcgi or scgi protocols

3222712
post	get
sending + over the net in get or i think post will convert + into a space character

3222720
client-side	server-side
server-side scripting interacts with database to produce dynamic html which is then manipulated client-side via

3222725
apache	lighttpd
i installed both apache and lighttpd

3222743
width	height
the tiles of the grid should have constant height and width

3222743
width	height
it should not scale with its parent s height width changes

3222743
width	height
but when i do this i lose the container s width and height

3222743
width	height
how is the static width height achieved

3222761
cdr	cons
the primitives are atom quote eq car cdr cons cond lambda label apply

3222772
free	malloc
the only time i have ever used malloc and free in c++ is to implement dummy-versions of the memory management routines

3222778
hide	show
i am creating a diagram application in which i hide and show few elements

3222795
implements	extends
the most promising is that i have created a class that extends linkedlist and implements remote

3222838
dxcore	coderush
the graphical subsystems of both vs2010 and coderush have been largely rewritten and this means that some of the older gdi based dxcore apis are no longer supported

3222847
maven	pom.xml
i look jboss maven plugin usage example and i pom.xml is

3222866
width	height
the thermometer argument is a matrix in which the first two columns are the symbol width and height respectively and the third column is the filled z

3222880
free	malloc
using malloc and free should be avoided in c++ because they deal with uninitialized memory and

3222880
calloc	malloc
another major reason is for using new delete they are much more portable while malloc calloc

3222880
free	malloc
are not also new calls constructors and delete calls destructors while malloc and free do not

3222916
cdr	cons
in common lisp cons creates a so-called cons cell which is similar to a record with two slots the car and the cdr

3222943
hide	show
you can use the onactivate event to hide the owner and the dispose event to show the owner

3222961
background-color	transparency
i tried to do this using background-color and opacity but the problem is that the border and the text inside become also transparency

3222963
dependencyobject	uielement
the layering on of threading dispatchobject data binding mechanism dependencyobject and ui idioms of layout input focus eventing uielement and styling frameworkelement are all natural progressions of ideas in win32 or other ui constructions

3222965
background-color	transparency
background-color transparency

3222981
google-chrome	safari
it was mentioned before that both safari and google-chrome differ in handling it as the others

3222981
google-chrome	safari
both google-chrome and safari return negative values for x offset and 0 for y

i am sending in the specific width and height for each image but when i view the individual images they load at a slightly oversized size they are a bit pixelated and then they focus down to the correct size ratio

3233444
width	height
most of the images are 300 x 400 and i am sending in 300 x 400 and the width and height so when i view in landscape mode i would expect the images to appear smaller than the overall screen or to size-up to fill the screen

3233466
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
viewwillappear viewdidappear etc. but i don t remember which ones ended up working

3233527
pop-up	dialog
i am using this for a rejection reason so user clicks on reject button and must select a reason from a combo box inside an alert dialog pop-up window before submitting

3233535
ant	maven
i m trying to find the best approach with maven to select between these environments with ant we just used to have targets which would copy our configuration files from predefined directories prior to the build and rewrite some .properties files

3233537
children	parent
you d have to recreate nodes above the current node i guess but not below assuming we have children pointers and not parent pointers

3233566
public	protected
get_name must be a protected or public function for classc or classb to access it

3233605
ant	maven
there s a page on the maven site that describes how to build for different environments that seems like it should meet your needs essentially it uses the maven antrun plugin to duplicate what you were doing previously with ant

3233626
width	height
i was under the impression that if i specified width height attributes for the img tag that i would get such placeholders for free without having to resort to some complex dhtml javascript wizardry but it doesn t seem to work

3233640
union	distinct
unlike the the sql union operator this implementation does not winnow duplicates we can use multiset union distinct for that

3233651
versioning	upgrade
some devices can be upgrade to a newer versioning of the os but i d definitely have to question that move

3233656
getter	setter
specifying readonly and then asking it to synthesize a setter and getter specifically the setter doesn t make sense though it should work

3233696
uiview	calayer
i m using uiview animation blocks to animate calayer properties backgroundcolor in this case on multiple layers on the display at once

3233715
qpainter	qimage
i use qt for similar things by using qpainter on a qimage with the frame data but there may be some other api to draw on an image that you find more obvious

3233729
sqlconnection	sqltransaction
it works by re-using the sqlconnection and sqltransaction objects

3233740
vsto	add-in
i have a vsto add-in for excel 2007 and need to figure out a way to disable two types of events in the excel deletion of worksheets and repositioning of worksheets

3233854
firefox	safari
in firefox it fails silently and in safari i get unable to load resource cancelled

3233956
pop-up	dialog
if the word is found i then want to alert the user through a pop-up dialog and possibly a repeating sound until the user acknowledges it

3233965

i m using jquery animate to show a banner at the top of the page which is a div that is set to top -60 to hide it

3233967
textview	imageview
i have a lisyview every item every row have a imageview and a textview when i scroll the listview the whole item gets the focus but for every item frist i want to imageview gets focus then textview get focus so that

3233970
folder	directory
6.5 million images in one folder is very extreme and puts a load on the machine just to read a directory whether it s in shell or perl

3233979
range	max	range	min	min	max
if the double object falls outside the max and min range of keyvaluepair.key then a 0 should be returned

3233979
min	max
if the double object falls within the max min of the keyvaluepair.key but not matched any of the keyvaluepair.key within a specified tolerance then the get the average of the nearest upper and nearest lower keyvaluepair.value as measured by keyvaluepair.key

3233989
maven	m2e
i ve installed m2e in rad 7.5 updated manually maven dependencies and it builds maven way within rad

3234042
ubuntu	linux
however now i m compiling the same library with g++ on ubuntu linux 10.04 and i m seeing similar behavior and i wonder if it might have a similar root cause

3234060
folder	directory
if your goal is to build a different copy of your jar file for each environment where the only difference is what is in the resources folder then you can take advantage of the maven-resources-plugin and have it copy your configuration files from the predefined directory

3234075
16-bit	64bit
if intermediate results are kept in the registers without writing back to memory you effectively get 16-bit of extra precision in your calculations making them more precise but possibly divergent from results generated with write read of intermediate values to memory or from calculations on architectures that only have 64bit fp registers

3234089
min	max
min max will always return exactly 1 row containing requested number or null

3234124
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
it seems logical that they would inherited from the same subclassing of eventargs given not just their common properties but the fact that most times you use a detailsview for inserting you also use it for updating

3234145
hash	md5
md5 hash of

3234157
emacs	textmate
in textmate power editing for the mac the author says that textmate has emacs key bindings

3234171
pull	push
most systems have both push and pull

3234172
google-chrome	safari
here is what my web page looks like in google-chrome safari

3234173
dependency-injection	singleton
google guice is a dependency-injection framework that supports a singleton annotation

3234246
sequence	permutation
but if your question about permutation for the set a a a a 1 2 3 4 then consider the the equivalent set 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and try avoid the repeated sequence by divide over the permutation of 5 6 7 8 and the answer is 8

3234326
expression-blend	silverlight
with silverlight 3 there was introduced a new expression-blend behavior mousedragelementbehavior

3234339
width	height
then you just check to see if it is inside the bounding box of your element which you can find by calling element.getboundingclientrect which will return an object with the following properties bottom height left right top width

3234342
ienumerable	iqueryable
t.posts.where is actually an extension on ienumerable rather than iqueryable so it seems like this might not be a good idea

3234352
google-chrome	safari
safari 5 allows to create extensions in a similar way of what google-chrome allows

3234383
for-loop	loops
since you have multiple elements with that name it will be a collection rather then a single control so you can loops over it with a standard for-loop that makes use of its length property

3234474
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
right now i have a working gui that involves checkbox and dropdownlistfor

3234491
integer	unsigned
if you are worried you can include and use types with defined lengths such as uint16_t for a 16-bit unsigned integer

3234602
ienumerable	iqueryable
you re exactly right - t.posts is an entitycollection in linq-to-sql it would be an entityset and as such implements ienumerable and not iqueryable

3234644
for-loop	loops
or just do a reverse for-loop where you start at the end and decrement on each loops

3234711
addclass	removeclass
i have a standard css jquery menu where i use addclass removeclass to set whatever li i am on to current

3234773
int	chars
here s my favorite bit arithmetic macro which works for any type of unsigned int array from unsigned chars up to size_t which is the biggest type that should be efficient to work with

3234784
google-chrome	firefox
everything works fine in firefox but for some reason google-chrome refuses to do the right thing when i type

3234801
g++	gcc
â gcc g++

3234801
g++	gcc
â gcc mingw g++

3234836
inherited	properties
just create an attached inherited properties that enforces ismuted false on any mediaelement it is applied to

3234837
mouseover	mouseout
also consider replacing the mouseover mouseout with a simple css hover rule for maintainability

3234844
disk	ram
most unzip libraries will buffer the zip output in small sections and write to disk many times so shouldn t take up too much in way of ram

3234848
tostring	string.format
but string.format internally calls tostring for every argument it receives so we re no longer dealing with an implicit cast and as a result the other developer will have changed the outcome to something like

3234850
width	height
i would suggest giving them each a width and height in your css if you didn t specify that in your external sheet already

3234915
ddms	adb
you need to learn how to debug in eclipse and how to use the adb and ddms tools

3234937
maven	pom.xml
it seems you don t have neither in your pom.xml and its parent nor in your settings.xml defined a list of maven repositories allowing you to access to these artifacts

3234984
hide	show
i realise i could use ajax to pull the server code in although how do i refer to the server url.content won t work but this code is to handle page permissions ie the server data details what functions the user can access and the javascript functions are then used to show hide buttons based on that

3235070
translation	localization
if you use localization you can translation the format string to the needed format

3235094
division	multiplication
c will do your multiplication before this division resulting in values 1 - probably not what you re after

3235139
lift	wicket
wicket and lift are quite different beasts

3235139
lift	wicket
lift is not a classical mvc-framework like wicket it is model-modelview-view

3235139
post	get
the structure is the same even if ajax is used instead of http get post

3235170
put	get
edit another thought occurs to me if the fortran subroutine is huge in its execution time you should think about integrating it with java by having java put some input data into a file and modifying the fortran to get its inputs from the file

3235217
pull	push
ssis will pull data from one source transform it and push it to a target

3235242
superclass	subclassing
i ve got a number of subclassing inheriting extends from my superclass an android activity extension called superactivity

3235242
superclass	subclassing
as i mentioned i m subclassing that superclass that defines the anonymous inner class

3235242
superclass	subclassing
further if i take that mconnection variable holding the anonymous inner class and call getclass .getname on it or tostring on it it shows itself to be an inner class of my superclass and not of the subclassing

3235394
post	get
the problem is that i dont have an svcfile and according to this post you must add a reference from a web-application to get it

3235397
jquery	simplemodal
i m using the simplemodal jquery plugin and it works great

3235397
width	height
however there are times that the width and height of the modal div need to be changed so i need the modal to automatically re-position itself in the center of the page

3235425
inherited	properties
if the html page uses quirks mode the style properties are not correctly inherited by the table

3235504
qgridlayout	qframe
the easiest way is to put a qframe to each of your qgridlayout s cell and move your content to these qframes

3235535
equals	gethashcode
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value

3235535
equals	gethashcode
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values.

3235535
equals	gethashcode
so if i write an object and create a gethashcode method that does calculate a value only once and stores it inside the object to return it on later calls then i must again absolutely must create a equals method that will use stored values for the comparison so that a.equals b will never change from false to true as well

3235585
children	parent
parent application will initially create a global mutex with the name known by children

3235605
memcached	apc
apc stores values inmemory as memcached does but is way easier to install because it s not an extra daemon running but a php extension

3235625
fpc	dcu
1 and if delphi is like fpc .dcu s contain a crc of the interface section of all dcu s it depends on

3235689
versioning	upgrade
i want both apps to be able to access the same files for example a user of the free app gets some high scores then upgrade to the paid app - the high scores saved by the free versioning should be loaded into the paid app

3235701
min	max
my aim was to get the min max and avg value of the fields and render the result in another input field

3235701
min	max
this won t work because jquery library hasn t any min or max like js does

3235701
min	max
well it s just the avg and max min is deriveable

3235730
pull	push
what i want is to deny pull access for some files like i can do when i tried push comand

3235738
postgresql	mysql
bonus is that it teaches you sql not mysql not t-sql not postgresql not sql server just plain sql

3235872
getter	setter
if after all this you still want to not to write the getter and setter you can do

3235893
terminate	timeout
this function resets the timeout for a script after which it should be terminate

3235895
subtract	add
of the original length until this add subtract value is less than 1

3235943
hash	salt
edit to prevent brute force attack you should add salt to your string and then apply hash function

3236010
typedef	struct
note that in c++ you don t need typedef to declare struct

3236053
hash	md5
in order to keep leading zeroes here is a small variation on what has paul suggested eg md5 hash

3236093
rss	feed
we have recently introduced version control in subversion in our development cycle and a team mate asked me today if it was possible to get all commit comments in an rss feed

3236111
put	get
i have defined campaignimages delete method and put some debugging code there but it does not get executed when campaign delete is called

3236127
rss	feed
as a roundabout way you can set up viewvc and it provides an rss feed

3236167
rss	feed
to generate an rss feed with subversion commits you will need to use a server side application the simplest one i ve come across is pyrss2gen a simple perl application

3236189
hash	md5
if size is an issue you ll find that md5 hash are also 128-bit long and that sha-1 hash are 160-bit long

3236216
postgis	hibernate-spatial
postgres postgis integration with hibernate-spatial

3236270
post	put
i never try with that many fonts but may be u can post fonts or something so that we can also try that bcoz it would be very difficult to download fonts and then put into plist

3236286
getter	setter
and i noticed that unfortunately it is not possible to declare a property with several getter setter that have different visibility modifiers - it would have been nice to have a private setter as well as a public one.

3236318
rss	feed
for example you might want to generate an atom or rss feed which are xml for the recent articles on a website

3236319
post	get
i need to get the forum name thread name and post message with the post id 32

3236323
min	max
interpret every two sequent intersection points as the min and max vectors of a axis aligned rectangle and mark all grid cells that lie inside this rectangle this is very easy intersection of two axis aligned rects especially considering that the rectangle has a width of 1 and therefore occupies only 1 column of your grid

3236337
client-side	server-side
there s an analogy with the local storage apis here now that the browsers have local storage apis you can use sql in the browser to store things in the local database - but just because you are writing sql in the client-side code and in the server-side code doesn t mean they are operating on the same data.

3236358
getter	setter
it s probably not worth setting up private getter setter for those unless you re managing setter side-effects or getter calculations

3236395
inherited	properties
the controllercontext properties is not assigned to in any of the base constructors in your inherited hierachy

3236411
rss	feed
as a non programmer i ve broken my app down into smaller projects a project for each main function of my app twitter rss feed 3rd party api etc etc

3236445
inherited	subclassing
in my case the class hasn t got any subclassing so no need to take inherited into account

3236550
doc	rtf
perhaps a cleaner approach to the code of the report generation will make it easier for the fr converter to create the rtf doc output.

3236551
content-disposition	content-type
for headers that use parameters such as content-type or content-disposition the encoding defined in rfc 2231 can be an alternative

3236563
hide	show
i am building a .net c# web application in which i have a tabbed panel layout and when the user clicks on each of the tabs the display panel is updated using javascript to hide and show some divs

3236563
hide	show
using a function like this to show and hide tabs

3236612
poe	anyevent
there are many good event based frameworks in perl e.g poe and anyevent poe is a specific event loop with lots of modules and features and anyevent is an abstraction layer that lets you use multiple event loops in the same code

3236635
actualheight	actualwidth
i have a problem in getting actualheight and actualwidth of image control in wpf

3236650
put	get
for folder put a get parameter in the link

3236650
folder	dir
note that you must keep in mind that if you let anyone use the script they will be able to open any folder by changing the dir parameter

3236656
folder	directory
for example if i knew you just used the code above i could enter the folder path to the default password directory and view the files

3236683
mouse	keyboard
given that android has no mouse a keyboard that would allow as much as possible of the vim shortcuts would be awesome

3236752
getter	setter
that sounds like a lot of work just to generate getter and setter methods

3236752
getter	setter
why not just use eclipses getter and setter generator

3236761
getter	setter
practically spoken i usually use approach 3 - i just code the fields and use eclipse ide to autogenerate getter and setter methods

3236761
getter	setter
with the ide s autogeneration tools you can even define the visibility of the generated getter setter methods you might want to limit the setter visibility to private or edit the template if you need additional code the the method bodies

3236765
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i am getting expected behaviour in firefox safari and google-chrome

3236796
getter	setter
it s do-able but now your code isn t strictly java in the sense that if someone takes it and runs javac on it they ll get a class without getter and setter

3236796
getter	setter
this will make debugging difficult as all the line numbers will be messed up and unless you re very sure you ve done the right thing with your annotation processor you won t even be able to see the source of the getter and setter to correct mistakes

3236797
width	height
parameters height width left screenx screeny etc

3236865
width	height
i have to set my width and height on the

3236874
post	put
if it s a different machine you need to use curl or another solution to do a put or post

3236893
division	logarithm
otherwise you could think of it mathematically using the laws on logarithm and thus take division out of the equation altogther

3236903
google-chrome	firefox
firefox in ubuntu is usr lib firefox-addons plugins and google-chrome is opt google-chrome plugins

3236951
int	chars
also having nothing to do with the index issue a column like this a code flag value is better as a fixed width value chars 1 tiny int etc where a alert or 1 alert

3236975
lua	scheme
i haven t embedded cl before but i ve done it with both lua and two particular scheme implementations gambit-c and gnu guile

3236975
lua	scheme
lua has closures but you won t get continuations like in scheme and you also won t get the macros

3236982
libs	buildpath
this way eclipse will automatically add the server-specific libs to the project s buildpath

3237021
quicksort	mergesort
the two most popular fast sort algorithms are mergesort and quicksort

3237028
post	get
apart from the post get thing mentioned in the comments what i do in php is

3237028
hash	md5
a store the origional validated parameters in the session and pass a hash of them around an md5 of the string of the params or whatever

3237028
hash	md5
hash generated by md5 on the query string of the search

3237032
width	height
save the original width and height of the control in variables

3237035
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
windows platform browsers firefox safari google-chrome ie when validatemytext returns false onclick is not triggered

3237035
firefox	safari
mac platform browsers firefox safari even after validatemytext returns false onclick event is triggered which submits the form

3237035
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
now it has to be enhanced to work on all the browsers firefox safari google-chrome ie on windows and firefox safari on mac

3237048
width	height
but this basic thing is really confusing me changing the width height of a sprite does not affect it s visual contents - either graphics drawn within it or any children it may have

3237048
width	height
my code below doesn t affect the visual display at all - but it does set the width height at least according to the trace output

3237055
post	get
its all working fine except when the post gets too lengthy it doesnt get tweeted because twitter has just 140 character limit my baby nephew can handle more characters than that

3237076
post	get
its not working for get or post both

3237081
google-chrome	firefox
i think this is better than trying to hash compress these real parameter values because this way browsers like firefox or google-chrome will enable the user to search on these strings while typing in the address bar

3237088
tinyurl	bit.ly
so i d go with using a service like bit.ly or tinyurl as you suggested

3237135
google-chrome	firefox
now it works fine for me on firefox and google-chrome even though you said it shouldn t

3237160
getter	setter
so expects exactly the above getter setter pair

i want the user to drag my draggable object to one of those droppable td s

3237161
draggable	droppable
i enable draggable and droppable this way

3237187
quicksort	heapsort
i see that no one has mentioned introsort which solves quicksort s o n 2 worst case by switching to heapsort when the recursion depth exceeds a certain threshold

3237246
gauge	progress
i want to set gauge object in alert to show the progress but it is giving java.lang.illegalargumentexception

3237265
width	height
but just looking at your code i wonder why you translate on the z-axis using what i understand to be x and y values width and height

3237306
awt	swing
you basically only need to replace the applet controller by a servlet based one and the swing awt based view by a jsp html css js based one

3237323
lan	localhost
to make your gae accessible on your lan you have to configure the launcher to use the address 0.0.0.0 instead of localhost

i have a simple layout which works fine in google-chrome safari even opera too os x

3237443
getter	setter
i have an object rezultat which has getter and setter

3237447
cos	sin
i know that sin is opposite hypotenuse in a right angled triangle and cos is adjacent hypotenuse

3237447
cos	sin
and why does it use cos on one line and sin on other

3237455
post	get
i m sorry it took me so long to get back to this post

3237457
ant	maven
there are eclipse plugins for each along with ant tasks maven plugins etc

3237495
cos	sin	cos	sine
the cos and sin values represent the sine and cosine of that angle

3237495
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
although you may think of sine and cosine as something you would need to know the length of three sides of a triangle to calculate there are methods to calculate them using ordinary arithmetic addition subtraction multiplication division

3237522
submit	submission
when a captivate sco running on firefox submit a status update to one of the js functions captivate does not wait for a success or fail response before submission the next status update

3237523
pull	push
the dvcs model puts the entire repo on every developer s machine so even if you restrict files on push and pull the user could still just hg cat the file to get its contents

3237524
x86	64bit
on 64bit systems the sdk bin folder ends up under c program files x86 microsoft sdks windows v6.0a but the include and lib folders end up under c program files microsoft sdks windows v6.0a

3237534
ubuntu	linux
the problem is that my application takes about 15-20 of cpu running on ubuntu linux

3237549
division	subtract	division	multiplication
i use my keypad keys for adding subtract multiplication division numerical data entry etc

3237568
width	height
you are changing the width height of the sprite

3237568
width	height
but you are doing nothing to change the width height of the sprite s children

3237568
children	parent
and changing the parent will not automatically resize the parent s children

3237574
google-chrome	firefox
obviously it s an issue with firefox 3.6 since google-chrome and ie both underline the button-text

3237600
google-chrome	firefox
i have just noticed a site i am working on looks different in google-chrome than other browsers saf firefox everything is more saturated in google-chrome even a background-color rgb

3237607
javassist	cglib
because persistence providers make proxies of objects using some library like cglib or javassist

3237623
stdout	stderr
the 2nd issue could occur since cvs writes some lines to stderr so you would need to redirect stderr to stdout by appending to you command

3237629
rss	feed
i am currently developing an rss feed reader and i am wondering which xml parsing api would be the best fit for that

3237629
children	parent
node navigation - to siblings to children to the parent

3237629

i would continue to use graphics.measurestring but you need to add logic that will simulate a word wrap by dividing the resulting string width with the control width ie you calculate how textbox widths fit in your string width to get your rows and then multply the string height by this

folder	directory
the problem i m having is that image is not being moved to that specified sub-folder but it s going into the uploads folder which is it s parent directory

3238945

width and height in px

3238979
jquery	scriptaculous
in the past three years i ve used prototype scriptaculous and jquery

i ve worked with jquery scriptaculous and mootools and i would highly recommend jquery which seems to trump a lot of the other frameworks in its ease of use

3239105
hide	show
its a simple show hide but with lots of things to show and hide

3239120
implements	extends
there is an abstract class role which also implements the person interface for decorator substitution equivalence and a roleimpl class that extends it

doing a 302 will typically cause clients to convert a post to a get request

3239270
firefox	safari
this works great in firefox and safari but it fails in mobile safari

3239286
width	margin
i ve seen css techniques where people will use a negative margin to reverse the added pixels created from the box model but it still won t reduce the width

3239286
width	margin
so basically what i want is a technique that will allow me to keep a 10 width but 10px of that 10 be padding or margin or what not

3239288
width	height
set the image as the background of your h1 set the width height so it fits then set your text-indent to something crazy like -9999px

3239297
m2e	pom.xml
i don t work with rad so i m not sure my answer will be totally accurate but when working with eclipse m2e takes care of the .classpath and the .project files and everything is derived from the pom.xml not the other way around

3239297
m2e	pom.xml	maven	m2e	maven	pom.xml
i don t think so m2e won t translate a random dependency that may not be available in any repo into a maven artifact and add the coordinates to the pom.xml

3239329
rss	feed
more specifically large xml webpages rss feed

3239351
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
case all child view controllers in your uitabbarcontroller or uinavigationcontroller do not agree on a common orientation set

3239456
mp3	wav
i ve also looked a bit at silverlight 4 since it supports recording wav audio but i m not clear on how to tackle the uploading and encoding to mp3 bit

3239470
mouse	keyboard
it allows you to keep your hands on the keyboard longer rather than switching back and forth between keyboard and mouse

3239470
for-loop	loops
pesky things like type declarations optimizing an old-style for-loop to use the new jdk-5 type of loops removing redundant value assignments or unused variables

3239485
unix	solaris
get all git dependencies as listed in this solaris package site but this works for any unix platform

3239504
qgraphicsitem	qobject
eventfilter has a param that gives you a qobject but since qgraphicsitem isn t derived from qobject then how would it work

3239514
onfocus	onblur
note best practices advise you should avoid those global vars and that you attach event listeners for the onblur and onfocus events rather than inlining them

3239541
awt	swing
android development is primarily gui development which like swing awt in java consists of lots of anonymous inner classes reacting to gui events

3239567
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine on ie firefox google-chrome all latest

3239573
onfocus	onblur
alternatively you could as suggested add remove a specific class to the element onfocus onblur

3239580
hide	show
there are lots of ways to hide and show page content but a common approach is to wrap it in a block marked hidden using css and then use some javascript jquery to toggle it hidden or unhidden

3239580
hide	show
see the documentation for show hide and toggle for more usage examples

3239591
qgraphicsitem	qobject
you can not install an event filter to qgraphicsitem directly since it s not a qobject

3239591
qgraphicsitem	qobject
if you are deriving your own qgraphicsitem inherit from qgraphicsobject so it will gain qobject functions

3239593
qgraphicsitem	qobject
create a new class derived from both qgraphicsitem and qobject since these are unrelated as far as a glance at the docs tells me you should have what you wanted

3239603
regression	least-squares
because the data can represent a line that is vertical as i understand it the usual least-squares regression line won t work for this data set

3239603
regression	least-squares
a perpendicular least-squares regression line might work but i ve had little luck finding an implementation of one

3239631
width	margin
another option is to manually calculate the width margin padding

3239704
google-chrome	safari
however in the webkit browsers safari and google-chrome the poster is dumped in favor of the first frame from the video as soon as the video metadata is fetched

3239709
feof	fread
your assertion about not calling feof before an fread is not correct - consequently the question is not valid

3239733
subtraction	addition
2 when certain colors are given limegreen wierd results are seen in the image returned from the function i beleive this is due to overflow of the byte type in the addition or subtraction case

3239763
width	height
i tried using the basic twitter widget with different width height but the font sizes are frankly quite small and it doesn t let you edit any of it

3239791
twitter	myspace
authlogicconnect looks like it works for many sites twitter facebook linkedin myspace google yahoo

3239834
firefox	safari
all of these work on firefox and safari on the pc but not on the ipad

3239856
subtraction	addition
if you want to support better than just addition and subtraction you could do it as an eval if you are careful about how data gets into #number

3239864
versioning	upgrade
first and foremost upgrade to the newest versioning and see what happens with the bought and built modules

3239918
min	max
the basic rule is that if you re using aggregate functions min max avg etc. then all of the columns in the select statement must be in an aggregate function or a part of the group by clause

3239924
getter	setter
private field + getter setter

3239979
post	get
you can build off zachary s answer and take it a step further by creating a wcf service and switching your .ajax call to be a get instead of a post

3239985
try-catch	exception-handling
if however the intent is to handle an exception-handling and continue executing place the code in separate try-catch blocks

3239987
avr	microcontroller	microchip	avr
many small microcontroller microchip pic avr intel 8051 cypress psoc etc. have a harvard architecture

3240005
getter	setter
this is done for easy scripting later on instead of having 20+ getter setter

3240019
google-chrome	safari
this works in almost all browser ie7 8 mozilla safari google-chrome except ie6

3240038
pop-up	dialog
on-click it will pop-up with a jquery dialog box which all works great and dandy

3240052
superclass	subclassing
matlab does not allow you to create arrays containing a mix of superclass and subclassing objects because an array can be of only one class

3240089
post	get
if you can post some code of your actual fetcher maybe you will get some tips on how you could use mocks

3240091
hide	show
i was thinking i could just use multiple select fields and use javascript to hide show the appropriate subfields when the selected frequency indicated i didn t need them

3240168
post	get
accept post only no get to prevent csrf

3240217
jar	manifest.mf
the database driver usually resides in a different jar file and if the classpath entry in your manifest.mf file is blank then the driver can t be loaded

3240222
x509certificate	bouncycastle
however i have decided to use bouncycastle and its instance of x509certificate only has a getpublickey

3240250
google-chrome	safari
so far i have discovered that this is because safari and google-chrome do not accept the focus blur events for check box or radio buttons

3240260
put	get
so typically if you want to get rid of the movieplayer s view you need to put in the didexitfullscreen notification handler

3240278
x86	64bit
i m on a 64bit machine and am running c program files x86 microsoft sdks windows v7.0a bin netfx 4.0 tools x64 fuslogvw.exe

3240286
jar	war
although i would probably just use a properties file located in a directory on the classpath outside of the ear war jar deployment structure

3240288
hash	md5
a helper class for cache reads writes cleanups methods for saving restoring bitmapdrawable s as pngs creating a md5 hash for cached file name

3240292
children	parent
this is advantageous since when a parent is deleted it will delete any children is has automatically removing the need for much of the memory management that comes with c++

3240315
qgraphicsitem	qobject	qgraphicsscene	qobject	qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsitem
qgraphicsitem s are not qobject but they still receive events managed by their qgraphicsscene

3240315
qgraphicsview	qmouseevent
also note that some event classes change in qgraphicsview context qmouseevent becomes qgraphicsscenemouseevent so make sure to filter for the right thing

3240343
put	get
personally i prefer to either use the oledb way which is a bit clunky at best at times or you can use a third party library that has put in the time effort energy to get access to the data

3240365
post	get
in my opinion if the way in which you retrieve the title property in the create get method is good enough for those requests it s equally good enough to re-create it in the same way in the post requests

3240379
ready	each
on document ready grab the height of each div and then force the shorter one to a height equal to the taller one

3240384
jquery	scriptaculous
the combination of no database code generated html no templates and javascript scriptaculous jquery raphaeljs works out really well

3240386
jquery	jqmodal
for instance if i open an ajax modal on the page perform some actions and close and then go open one of the inline modals on the page perform some actions and then attempt to close i am getting wierd jquery jqmodal javascript errors such as the following

3240391
google-chrome	firefox
t return data in ie but does in firefox and google-chrome

3240420
hash	salt
you can re-use the salt of the hash password in the database for this if you like

3240421
hgrc	hgignore
the hgrc man page says you can link a user specific ignore file hgignore by including something like this in your .hgrc

3240425
int	chars
bufferedreader.read returns the chars read as an int in the range 0 to 65535

3240434
content-length	content-type
the audio files mp3 i am working with are stored in mysql and pulled into the browser by a php script that sends the content-length and content-type headers ahead of the data

3240434
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this works perfectly in firefox opera google-chrome ie 6 7 8

3240479
octal	hex
you can do the conversion with any type hex octal ..

3240517
hash	md5
if you want this kind of security you probably be better out if you save the passwords as a md5 hash

3240534
int	double
the other thing you can do is to recompile perl with -duse64bitint -duselongdouble which will force perl to internally use 64 bit int and long double floating point numbers

3240596
sequence	permutation
of course for a document with more than a few sequence there are too many different possible segmentation permutation to brute-force evaluate all of their costs

3240613
firefox	safari
safari was fine with me using text as a variable name sloppy of me i know but it gave an error in firefox

3240616
gesturedetector	motionevent
what you do is create an instance of gesturedetector override the ontouchevent method of the view you are interested in detecting gestures for and pass the motionevent to the gesturedetector

3240630
superclass	subclassing
natural and juridico are subclassing of the superclass cliente

3240640

3240685
pop-up	dialog
an installation dialog pop-up out of the blue

3240714
next	except
and i want to use a batch to periodically move all these files to another folder except the newest one in01_acct_20100709001.r because this file is sometimes still being written on and moving it might lead file override in the destination folder in the next run of the batch and causes file content lost

3240766
wordpress	joomla	teamsite	interwoven
why would i chose something like interwoven teamsite as opposed to joomla django wordpress etc

3240780
getter	setter
the basic idea is to have a builder class that has setter but usually not getter for the different constructor parameters

3240827
subtract	add
right now i m accomplishing this by simply querying all places and then subtract visited and planned from the results but i want to add in pagination and i m worried this could complicate that

3240850
for-loop	loops
nevermind i figured it out...for loops variables have to have double percentage signs while the command line versions only use single percentage sign for-loop variables...i added another to each variable in my for-loop and now it works perfectly

3240858
post	get
if you re looking for how to get your database structure not data in source control since it was mentioned in the title then you should check out this coding horror post get your database under version control

3240880
ssms	sqlcmd
to execute such a thing in an environment outside ssms or sqlcmd you will need to execute them separately implement your own batch separator

3240907
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox safari and google-chrome

3240912
post	get
if i could say if i call this via http get show the form if i call this via http post process then redirect to the default

3240927
webrat	cucumber
my cucumber step fails but only in webrat

3240927
webrat	cucumber
rails cucumber webrat redirect_to flash notice not working

3240928
postgresql	mysql
the database systems that i am interested in are sql server 2008 mysql and postgresql 9.0

3240951
hash	salt
in the first comment raise suggest using a salt hash of the id instead of the id itself

3240951
hash	salt
you ll need a new fields in your users table for the hash the salt need not be stored the id won t change and your url will look like miembros hash slug

3240975
width	height
the problem is that shopify doesn t add width and height attributes to images that are in the blog posts

3240975
width	height
when i load these into flash the width and height of the image is ignored and the height of the textfield is incorrectl which screws up my scrollbar among other things

3240999
int	chars
fahad pointer arithmetic goes by the size of the datatype it points.so when ur pointer is of type int you should expect pointer arithmetic in the size of int 4 bytes .likewise for a chars pointer all operations on the pointer will be in terms of 1 byte

3241003
opera	google-chrome
tested on ie5.5+ ff2+ google-chrome opera 9.6+

3241027
put	get
but it will also put pressure on java developers to up their game and produce better stuff - or get buried in the flood

3241030
lift	wicket
lift has strengths that wicket doesn t

3241030
lift	wicket
lift s ajax support is far less verbose than wicket s

3241053
getter	setter
i disagree with user no when he says that business objects require setter and getter methods

3241061
feedback	review
the software specification which can often be an appendix to a contract should most certainly be seen by developers but actual review sign off and or providing feedback prior to the contract being signed is often limited to architects product managers project managers technical leads and similar more senior roles

3241075
x86	64bit
on an x86 32bit kernel this works fine but when i recompile my program on an x86_64 64bit kernel i get runtime errors like this

3241076
google-chrome	firefox
if i type in a password like test1234 it passes in google-chrome and firefox but the message that my password should contain a minimum of 7 characters with at least one numeric character is shown in internet explorer

3241081
getter	setter
i don t know why another obvious choice hasn t been suggested but i would consider another approach where you just define interfaces and use a library that implements specified setter getter and internal fields needed

3241081
javassist	cglib
i would expect such libraries to exist but if not writing general-purpose one should be quite doable using byte code generation libs asm cglib janino javassist whatever

3241092
treemap	treeset
treemap and treeset and all these should throw a runtimeexception if the object you put in does not implement comparable

3241092
comparator	comparable
to use comparator it does a cast to comparable which is the source of the exceptions

3241100
client-side	server-side
the login form posts to a server-side script on clients domain to perform authentication sets up a server-side session and sets a client-side session cookie

3241100
client-side	server-side
this login form then redirects to a script on the third-party vendors domain posting the username and password and setting up a server-side session and client-side session cookie on the third-party vendors domain

3241120
google-chrome	firefox
firefox ie 8 google-chrome works fine

3241150
width	height
if you use the bitmapdata class you can get access to the width and height of images along with other useful properties and methods

3241166
google-chrome	firefox
also turn on your console in google-chrome or firefox to see a potential javascript error

3241178
git-rebase	undo
bottom line if you really don t want a branchy history use git-rebase -- don t update into uncommitted changes as it s hard to undo

3241195
stdout	stderr
i believe the prompt is going to stderr not stdout so you ll have to open a stream connected to that and read there

3241226
portrait	landscape
to answer that question they are still often used as the master view controller the left pane in landscape or the popover in portrait

3241273
button	checkbox
is there a method to uncheck a checkbox in a wx.checklistbox as i need to implement an uncheck all button can t seem to find anything.

3241280
comparator	comparable
i think if a class has a natural ordering it is more usual in java for it to implement comparable rather than have a comparator implementation for each class

3241280
comparator	comparable
thus if the objects in question have a natural ordering defined they must implement comparable and have the comparator method defined

3241280
comparator	comparable
so long story short implement comparable whenever you want to impose a natural ordering on a class only use a comparator when you want something other than the natural ordering

3241300
globalization	localization
.net has localization and globalization support throughout intended for just this kind of thing

3241314
internationalization	localization
in this case i would say yes it is bad practice -- because you likely want internationalization and localization expansion

3241352
postgresql	mysql
in mysql this is valid but apparently not in postgresql

3241417
width	margin
the first one means what you probably think it means any html element with the class class-name will have a margin of 0 width for each side ie

3241421
google-chrome	firefox
and it works great on firefox google-chrome and internet explorer as far as i can see

3241505
hide	show
the cursor is on the button to hide show the console

3241519
uiview	cashapelayer
initial investigation also brought me across references to the cashapelayer class though i m guessing this might be much the same as implementing the uiview subclassing technique

there are other options like using the tomcat maven plugin or the generic cargo maven plugin but i wouldn t use them for development and since you are a maven beginner i don t recommend them at all

3247549

3247702
width	height
your scalewidth and scaleheight should be scale factors so not very big numbers but your code seems to pass in the actual width and height you re looking for

3247702
width	height
for one thing your code always has either scalewidth width or scaleheight height and changes only one of them so you re going to be distorting the aspect ratio of your image as well

3247702
width	height
shouldn t you be checking for width maxwidth or height maxheight

after much wailing and gnashing of teeth i found the excellent open source imagetools library for silverlight which provides encoders and decoders for jpg bmp gif and png

3248279

the problem is i m completely new to node.js and express its sinatra-like web framework and i have no idea how to cache the friends array so i only need to load it once ideally into memory

3248304

i can put carstestsuite.class.getname but i d like to use the method to get the class name so that i never have to edit it

3248357
haskell	ocaml
the code is ocaml but it s useful and not too difficult to be able to translate ocaml to haskell in your head when working through papers like this

3248372
decltype	auto
yes vc10 provide some c++0x featrues auto decltype r-value reference etc and std tr1 inside std namespace and it s not optional afaik

hide	show
but if i keep clicking the edit link the textbox will show and hide the number of times that the link has been clicked ie

3248450
pull	push
however here is a much more xsl-esque version that stores the mappings in a variable to dispense with the mapping template and uses push processing apply-templates instead of pull processing

3248511
postgresql	mysql
for example in postgresql i think mysql is similar

3248654
put	get
generally unscoped variables get put into the variables scope so you can use struct bracket notation to refer to them

the sprite menu works with every browser i ve tested ff3.6 ie8 7 6 google-chrome safari

if the user selects another country different than united states or canada the state select menu should hide and a regular text field should show see html structure below

3248808
post	get
although this is acceptable for a post form it is not particularly ideal in a get url because we end up with urls resembling

3248841
folder	directory
i don t care if it s the main stkgui folder or the scripts folder--as long as it s within the application s directory structure i can work with it

3248924
matlab	simulink
in my simulink model are some embedded matlab functions

3248997
width	height
nothing else is changed but the only way to do that is to change the whole frame and in the animation instead of the height growing the object just snaps to the top of the screen with the proper width and height and just moves downward into place instead of staying in place and just simply growing

3249031
viewdidload	viewwillappear

checkout nstimer and uitableview reloaddata

3249123
subtract	add
thats right except at the start you need to subtract 50 to bring the polygon center back to 0 then at the end add 50 to bring the polygon back to its orignal position

3249129
subtract	add
you should subtract 50 from each component this causes 50 50 to be the center do the rotation and then add 50 to each component

3249133
filewriter	printwriter
i am using filewriter printwriter to write to the file flush it close it but i get am getting an exception thrown

3249288
width	height
i m a fanatic for giving people with wide screens something to look at you mention static height but there really is no such thing as static width so for me i would make the brick left right into an image that can be repeated nicely and have a repeat-x applied to it so that wide screen visitors saw more wall

3249394
fadein	hide	fadein	fadeout	hide	fadeout	hide	show
you could always replace the show and hide for fadein and fadeout too

3249394
hide	show
edit another method is to show the div when the button is clicked then make the ajax call and use the success function to hide it again

3249460

3249542
superclass	subclassing
it appears as if it finds the superclass of the exception before looking for the subclassing

3249547
allocator	stl
that s going to be wayyyy slower than the default stl container sgi uses deque because you ll lose cache locality and require dynamic allocator for each element new delete - whereas a deque will dynamically allocate chunks of the stack at a time

3249549

essentially when a user chooses a filter you would move all the filtered items from the content ul to a hidden ul using the appendto and remove functions on the set of elements that you want to hide show

3249552
spaces	delimiter
not sure how the python syntax would fit but using java you would tokenize the string on the spaces delimiter then use a random index less than the length of the token array and access that element of the token array pop it print it and repeat until the token array was empty

3249591
webkit	gecko
work in ie webkit as well as gecko

3249626

3249659
filesystems	fat
i ve found out that fat16 12 and elm-petit fat filesystems module are suites well to my needs

3249730
width	height

3249730
width	height
4 6 would be fixed width 100 height background-repeat repeat-y

3249757
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested it in google-chrome ie and firefox

3249773
gif	png
you can use many other output formats like gif png and many many others

3249793
getter	setter
all of them are jpa entity s with relevant getter and setter for relations

3249804
implements	extends
you have to define your own automapping configuration by extends defaultautomappingconfiguration class and then override the method public virtual access getaccessstrategyforreadonlyproperty member member or just implements the iautomappingconfiguration interface

3249821
width	height	width	font-size
the other thing to do would be to send the full text to the user s browser then append it into a div of the appropriate width with the font-size which could be modified by the users s personal css they will actually have and then measure the height of the resulting div

3249833
dlsym	dlopen
i don t think this behaviour is intuitive and it is more work to use dlopen dlsym but it does resolve my problem

3250068

3250150
strsplit	substr
it may be possible to do this with strsplit but i d just use substr like this

3250183

3250201
disk	ram
processor clock rates l1 and l2 cache sizes ram sizes and disk speeds are all factors as well as the number of other programs tasks running concurrently

3250288
sudo	passwd
you can even allow a user to execute a predefined command with root permissions without asking a passwd at all - which is still more secure because an attacker that could read your variant of the script has access to the root passwd and thus can do anything he wants while using the sudo variant only allows him to execute the predefined command as root

inherited	properties
the basedon attribute will make it easy to inherited the entire treeviewitem style and only change the isexpanded properties

3250957
multiplying	add
first off since these are two three digit numbers multiplying together to determine the size a char would need to be to hold that value i went to a calculator and multiplied 999 999 and it ended up being 6 then i need to add one because i found out from one the questions i posted earlier that sprintf puts a 0 character at the end

3250957
int	chars
ok now that i have a chars and all i copied result which in int main and put it in

3251048

next	except
produce the working tree and index state as if a real merge happened except for the merge information but do not actually make a commit or move the head nor record to cause the next git commit command to create a merge commit

3251078
cpu	processors
you re wasting huge resources and speed if you re running more threads than you have processors cores for a cpu intensive process such as doing quicksort so try to not run more threads than you have cores

3251093
put	get
strictly you need to get the class loaded again so you don t need to restart the app but in practice this is likely the most straightforward option available to you unless you ve previously put hooks into the classloaders

3251151
int	chars
it s possible that you could re-work your data to make your rows more efficient chars instead of varchars in some cases tinyints instead of int etc. but you re really not going to see much of a speed difference with that kind of micro-optimization

3251190
getter	setter
this has a major problem if the class changes in certain ways eg a field getter setter name is renamed i won t be able to deserialize the object anymore

3251224
oncreate	ondestroy
the activity goes through ondestroy and its oncreate method gets called

3251228

3251279
post	get
get and post worked as expected and all supported the standard set of http methods from rfc 2616

3251279
opera	firefox
trace and options are edge cases with problems found in firefox and opera respectively

3251279
post	get
i think the whole confusion over browsers not supporting other than get and post stems from the fact that the html specification lists only these two in the html element

3251279
post	get
this is the reason why browsers only support get and post natively in html

3251279
put	get	post	put	post	get
if method is a case-insensitive match for connect delete get head options post put trace or track subtract 0x20 from each byte in the range 0x61 ascii a to 0x7a ascii z

i d use a more selective approach either with the cvs i m using in the project svn in the example

3251499
versioning	upgrade
if the user upgrade to our new versioning of the application and also leaves the old versioning installed then the backups that they took previously when they open via double clicking then they open in the new versioning but the user probably expected them to open in the previous versioning

3251539
profiling	debugging
static variables are the less evil twin of global variables they keep their value but with their scope limited to a function which are typically useful to either keep some form of state caching of data or to enumerate things that should be unique but whose numbering is not very important outside the scope of your function or application say numbering debugging or profiling cries from your own debugging .. or profiling functions

3251606
int	double
jaxb throws exception when unmarshalling empty value for int double or date attribute from xml

3251612
dictionary	map
in the codebehind file mainwindow.cs create a dictionary of hitboxes that define square regions on the map and the relevant us state name

3251621
getter	setter
one additional requirement is that the synthesis such properties must always be able to synthesize both the setter and getter naturally and precisely

3251621
getter	setter
specifically when declaring a property as atomic there is no way the developer can correctly manually write only 1 2 of the getter setter pair

3251649
put	get
put error_reporting 0 at the very top to make sure you get reports on everything going less than perfect

3251698
mouseover	mouseout
the image has a mouseover and mouseout function that makes the div appear and disappear as the user rolls over from one image to another

3251713
int	double
for example throws an exception because it does not even try to convert the int 123 to a double

3251731
put	get
this should be semantically identical to befriending bill 111 and indeed after issuing the above put i wouldn t be surprised that when i get it back that i see the link changed to 111

3251765
goto	break
there is always an exception or some special case where the best course of action is to do something against best practices like using a goto statement to instantly break out of multiple nested loops

3251767
vim	emacs	vim	notepad++
most editors created with programming in mind vim emacs notepad++ etc supports some kind of regexp-based search and replace

3251780
mouseup	mousedown
unfortunately i can t use a window.settimeout .. with a mousedown mouseup combination because the maps api doesn t contain those events as it would disrupt the drag events

versioning	upgrade
this later approach is best fit for multiple deployments when each location may be at a differne tversion and each release has to be able to upgrade the schema from any versioning on disk to the desired versioning by running succesively all the upgrade scripts from the current on-disk versioning to the desired versioning

3251852
perl	tcl
swig is used with different types of languages including common scripting languages such as perl php python tcl and ruby

3251862
post	get
alright...i have kind of a big quesstion...ok here goes...usually if i understand it well...web services work in a way that i write a method to get some data from the database and then some other user client adds a reference and calls my service and gets the data...now in my case i have to get the data and actually post it to the user client in xml in soap maybe i guess....so here is what i do.

if you use maven you don t do that since maven wouldn t be aware of it you add dependencies in the pom.xml and let the ide derive the project configuration from it

3252065
maven	pom.xml
so either use maven and add the dependency to the pom.xml or.

3252357
put	get
on your initial bind where nothing is in edit mode the databinding will not fire but each time you put a row into edit mode it will execute that is why i say to somehow cache the data you want to bind to a dropdownlist the first time you get it

gridview	rowdatabound
if your data is bound to a gridview you can have an event handler for rowdatabound and do something like this

lisp	scheme
most people who are familiar with functional programming languages those in the lisp scheme families in particular appear to like lambda just fine -- i say most definitely not all because guido and i assuredly are among those familiar with etc yet think of lambda as an eyesore anomaly in python.

gridview	rowdatabound
use gridview rowdatabound when the nested control s items are dependent on other values in the gridview

3252712
hex	binary
so hex ff is 11111111 in binary

3252721

icefaces provides more good looking components than richfaces

3252727

3253785
sproutcore	qooxdoo
qooxdoo and sproutcore have started to look into incorporating mobile-specific features but i d say for them and others there is still quite some way to go

3253785
sproutcore	qooxdoo
there is an somewhat older article about popular javascript framework libraries qooxdoo and sproutcore that you might find useful

3253800
min	max
note that this solution has terrible performance characteristics if you are trying to generate a full set of random numbers between min and max

in worst-case scenario it can also take max - min space

3253948
mp4	h.264
encoding the video for showing in the browser you need to either encode the video using h.263 for flash video players or to h.264 for flash players and html5 video tags to flv mp4 formats

3254639
uiview	calayer	uiview	subviews
i noticed today when adding 1 calayer and 2 subviews to my view when i run the following code in my uiview instance

3254648
width	height
it s content should be a uiview of 3 320 width and 480 height extending 320px left and 320px right

3254662
int	chars
if i assume the loop variable i is an int then at every step you are writing an int i starting at 0x8e000000 which takes up sizeof int number of bytes and incrementing scp by sizeof unsigned chars number of bytes

3254662
int	chars
since the size of an int and a chars 4 and 1 on most systems is different scp++ is not advancing your pointer by the correct number of bytes

3254669
qtextedit	qtextdocument
i guess i should inherit the qtextdocument class then to add a new member a container that stores all the names of resources that are present in the qtextedit

3254725
strncmp	strncpy
you are using strncpy which does string copying if you want to compare strings use strncmp

3254735
strncpy	strcmp
it looks like you re using strncpy when you actually mean to use to strcmp

3254745
width	height
just as an example a div with a width and height of 10px and a border of 1px will have an outer width and height of 12px

3254745
width	height
for your case to make it appear like the border is on the inside of the div in your selected css class you can reduce the width and height of the element by double your border size or you can do the same for the elements padding

3254750
hash	md5
so it doesn t really matter much that md5 collisions are trivial to generate since a collision simply yields an alternate password that has the same md5 hash as the original password it doesn t reveal the original password

3254792
width	height
i designed the thing with width and height both set to 100 so that i could see what i m actually doing

3254838
put	get
i m trying to get the checked radio buttons in the page and it works until i put the style display none

3254995
google-chrome	safari
in safari and google-chrome the progress bar just doesn t update at all

3255007
int	chars
scp may be being interpreted as an int because you are using the d format specifier - there doesn t appear to be a format specifier for unsigned chars

3255016
sorting	filtering
however i ve since added a bunch of sorting filtering controls in the header of the table

3255030
width	height
if handling resizing is important i usually create wrapping div and check its width and height on timeout

margin	text-indent
i was able to use position relative and a negative margin to achieve the indenting effect without resorting to text-indent which required the inline-block

3257954
put	get
normally you would put the calls inside of the xmlhttprequest s response handler such that it returns immediately and when it does get that page it then executes the required code

3257960
post	get
the way it works is whenever one of those variables are changed i have jquery use post ajax to get the table data from the server passing the vars so my server can get the data correctly

3257973
width	height
the hack is to add a 1x1 pixel img with width height set to 0 and use that for an onload event to execute the script and that works but it seems like there has to be a cleaner way to do this

firefox	safari
all of this works wonderfully for the major desktop browsers ie 7+ firefox win mac linux safari mac windows etc..

3258017

3258084
margin	height
unresponsive to margin and height commands

3258093
getter	setter
i think with jrxml you can only define bean properties - the ones that have a standard setter and getter

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
notably safari and google-chrome do not place a dashed border under abbr by default while firefox and ie do

3258244
hide	show
the only solution close is to just have content in 4 cells of a table that slides into view according to the direction of the arrow you used within a div and have the overflow property set to hide so you can mask out the other cells and show one cell at a time

3258251
poe	anyevent
my preferred solution is to use an event-based framework like poe or anyevent i use poe and break out any tasks that can t be made nonblocking into subprocesses using poe wheel run or fork_call for anyevent

3258251
waitpid	fork
from time to time i ve also written code that simply uses fork and pipe or open -| and io select and waitpid directly within its own event loop but you should probably consider that a symptom of my having learned c before perl and not a recommendation

3258314
folder	directory
i have changed the template for filter.html put it in admin folder in your templates directory so it looks like this found it somewhere on django snippets i guess

the phone receives and sends stuff to the multicast group fine but it appears that the phone chokes when it receives a large number of packets at one time

3258535
put	get	post	put	post	get
there are good explanations around but you can largely identify it by the style you use a small set of verbs usually http get post put delete or part of them to achieve actions you want on resources

3258535
put	get	post	put	post	get
addresses denote resources so rather than having actions like sale authorisation and order being sent as part of the request you will deal with different addresses looking like and which you can access using get or delete using delete or modify using put or post as appropriate

3258547
folder	directory
put your content in folder dedicated to supporting the site do not make your entire c drive a virtual directory

3258553
folder	directory

3258557
min	max
i want to ignore the errors for data type min max length and required fields

3258571
folder	directory
the most ideal solution is to add c images as a virtual directory to your document root imagecentral - this way you can have images that are central to multiple websites stored in this directory it can then be referenced by clients for any of the websites just by adding virtual directory to each of them pointing at the central images folder

3258587

put	get
put a trigger on your loadid column that will get max loadid from this table and insert as the current load id

3258946
onmouseover	onclick
so i m trying to stack an onclick with an onmouseover

3258957
post	get
i ve seen some other post on this but it appears that when i do ajax calls with jquery over and over again every 30 seconds in my case i get a memory leak

3258957
post	get
changing from a get to a post whilst more secure as well cuts down on the size - it still happens

3258961
min	max
you need to join the two tables by job_title to find the min max values you should use the aggregate functions min wage max wage and include exempt_non_exempt_status in the where clause

3258998
stdout	stderr
don t use exec if you want to handle i o instead use popen for simple stuff either read or write or proc_open for full fd connectivity with stdin stdout stderr and possibly other fd s connected for openssl

the sprite itself is working fine in any browser but the text shows up in opera and google-chrome for some reason because the padding in conjuction with overflow hidden won t work as supposed

3259133
hudson	bamboo
i know cruise control and hudson are ideal candidates as well as bamboo

3259199
tcplistener	tcpclient
tcpclient and tcplistener classes

3259209
jquery	scriptaculous
this can also be done with javascript libraries like jquery mootools prototype and scriptaculous

3259255
width	margin
change the width of the #frame-gallery to just fit the width of 3 images plus any margin padding borders etc

3259271
stdout	stderr
if stdout or stderr are redirected it will output utf-8

3259275
min	max
it is defined to be the integer that can hold a pointer value so the min max values of intptr_t should work

3259275
min	max
but from your explanation of a class that just needs min max values i don t believe that you need complete accuracy

3259295
gmail	hotmail
some strip any styles declared in the head some add their own classes some add random extra elements - but by giving every element its own inline style - along with some just wonderful tables - i ve gotten it to render consistently in every major client - gmail outlook hotmail yahoo etc

3259328

it all goes around the width height and overflow

3259439
jquery	scriptaculous
scriptaculous and jquery in the same

3259461
integer	unsigned
bug-free so long as mandatorydatasize + optionaldatasize can t overflow the unsigned integer type -- the naming of these variables leads me to believe this is likely to be the case

3259537
rcurl	rjsonio
looking at your code you could achieve the same doing this you ll need to install packages rcurl and rjsonio from omegahat.com

3259558
postgresql	mysql
the chosen answer states that postgresql schema is equivalent to mysql database

3259598
des	aes
for something like des or aes for example the tables are actually intrinsic to the algorithm to separate them from the code that uses them doesn t make much sense in my eyes

3259608
integer	unsigned
you can do that with a two-byte unsigned integer but not with a two-byte signed integer if space matters that much

3259611
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
just to clarify for anyone trying this later the solution was this confirmed with h264 videos in safari 5.0 untested in firefox opera yet

for that last one the changegroup hook runs whenever one or more changesets arrive via push or pull and you can have it do some interesting things such as

3260179
integer	unsigned
the unsigned int type of c and c++ is not an always positive integer no matter what the name of the type looks like

3260179
int	chars
if you really understand and want the wrapping behavior of unsigned int then they re the right choice for example i almost always use unsigned chars when i m handling bytes

once you tell the jvm to listen on a port just point your netbeans debugging profiling to the machine ip and port

3260215
google-chrome	firefox
this is true on ie 7 and 8 but ok on google-chrome and firefox

3260239
integer	unsigned
some cases where you should use unsigned integer types are

3260239
put	get
because you can put a negative value in an unsigned it s just that it will become a really large value when you go to get it out

3260239
int	chars
you need a way to hold out-of-band values so you can test for them this is the same sort of logic behind getchar returning an int and not chars .

mongoid	mongomapper
if someone has any mongoid or mongomapper code examples of a many-to-many relationship working could you please share

3260823
multiplying	subtract
on a beast like this if you can implement your algorithms in fixed point operations primarily multiplying adds and subtract and take advantage of both wide parallelism and pipelined parallelism you can eat most pcs alive in terms of both power and processing

3260823
subtract	add
if your algorithms can be expressed as in terms of add and subtract operations then the general purpose logic in these can be used to implement gazillion adders

3261210
google-chrome	firefox
it took me a while to figure out why ie was constantly hitting 50 cpu while google-chrome and firefox barely broke a sweat -- i figured i had a rogue greedy loop somewhere until i scanned across my interval

3261210
google-chrome	firefox
running the same test in firefox or google-chrome doesn t even break 10 usage for me

3261222
min	max
if the window is smaller than max width the content fills 100 of the page unless it s smaller than min width which would make the horizontal scrollbar appear

3261222
min	max
i m willing to use some minor javascript to handle the min max width for browsers which don t support those properties i m looking at you ie6 but i m just as willing to let that part of the layout degrade

3261227
boost	stl
i am almost trying boost but if there is how to do it with stl i d like to learn

i have a subclass of uiview in which i ve added some subviews to in my initwithframe method

3261546
rss	feed
with reference to your comment stating that you could consolidate your shared items feed to create a new rss feed you could then use magpierss to fetch and parse that rss feed and interact with your database

3261585
sorting	grouping
rely on the database to perform the grouping sorting aggregation etc

3261599
put	get
this should be simple im just not getting the desired result i ve tries this a couple of ways and still not getting anywhere i need to get the total cound of records of the subquery i know this is totally wrong but when but when i put the count on the subquery it still gives me 1 here s my code

3261705

3261871
accessor	properties
he explores various alternatives like the dean edwards iframe borrowing technique direct object extension prototype extension and the usage of ecmascript 5 accessor properties

3261891
post	get
one suggestion i got was to use post instead of get or to base 64 encode the string but base64 itself does not contain url safe characters...e.g + gets converted to blank in php

3261918
sqlconnection	sqltransaction
if i don t properly implement my dispose i could have an uncommitted sqltransaction or dangling sqlconnection

3261920

assuming gcc g++

3261959
portrait	landscape
it rotates that div 90 degrees in landscape mode - back to portrait

3262048
public	protected
public and protected methods from the

3262048
public	protected
protected or public but not private

3262054
width	height
you put this state in a class because all the state in the class is related.you have function to managed this state so that invalid permutations of state can t be set the infamous square that has members width and height but if width doesn t equal height it s not really a square .

3262059
int	double
now when you have a numeric literal like 3 it is inferred to be of type until you actually commit it to a particular data type like int or double

3262065
jobs	cron
your best bet is probably quartz which provides a way to define jobs and a number of triggers including cron like expressions

3262105
dbml	edmx
the only one i know about for now is the huagati dbml edmx tools

3262125
nsobject	nsmanagedobject
in this case i am looking at class1 inheriting from nsobject and class2 inheriting from nsmanagedobject

3262126

3262293
spaces	delimiter
of course this gives you spaces delimiter output

3262311
range	minimum
a couple of other answers have correctly quoted the c standard which places minimum range on the types

3262311
range	minimum
the reason that int is provided is to provide a type that is intended to match the most efficient integer type on the hardware in question that still meets the minimum required range

3262311
int	chars
if you are storing a large number of small int such that space efficiency is more important than calculation efficiency then you can instead choose short or even signed chars if you know that your values will fit into the -127 to 127 range

3262321
width	height
if you want scrolling within an element create a container that has a fixed width and height that contains whatever content within it that is larger than the container

3262332

3262343
submit	submission
if you insist on using a disabled field you can enable it during form submission by handling the form onsubmit event where you will enable the field and submit the form

3262391
width	height
each ellipse is set with width auto height auto which for an ellipse means zero size

3262391
width	height
also the grid is set with width auto height auto which means to squeeze its contents into the tiniest space possible

3262391
width	height
remove both places where you say width auto and height auto and instead leave the height and width unset

3262391
width	height
the margins on your second ellipse are so large that even if the width 40 height 40 in your c# code were honored because the auto problem was fixed the ellipse would still have no size

3262461
google-chrome	safari
latest safari safari v4 and latest google-chrome google-chrome v3 supported but not previous versions

3262461
google-chrome	safari
safari 4 safari 5 and google-chrome 5

3262475

never put get params into string without some check

3263357
rss	feed
that page has an rss feed which i d like to use ideally but a it browser-sniffs meaning i need to fake the user-agent from a script to fetch it - and that feels really brittle b the quality of the data returned is really poor

linux web server ubuntu

3263475
post	get
in java i have a httpclient which use headers in a post method with a website to send a request and get a answer

3263482
mouse	keyboard
normally you could use a windows hook to do something like this but the only hooks supported in the .net framework are mouse and keyboard events

3263490
calloc	malloc
that text could then be in a chunk of memory malloc d or calloc d to whatever size you need

3263500
hide	show
using jquery css isn t really going to speed anything up using a naive show hide implementation but you should be able to get a way with using ajax to load sets of images in on the fly when the user presses the filter button

3263503
min	max
rrd consolidates time periods disregarding details by averaging summing up or choosing max min values in given task the detail that is lost is information on low frequency items which can introduce errors

hide	show
my thought-process was to use a jquery function to find the order was manually edited and then select the rest of the string and save it into a variable then i need make it hide the complete string and show the above string along with button

3263573
gprof	callgrind	profiler	gprof	profiler	callgrind
i come from a matlab background so i am used to a profiler which profiles every single line and not just every function like gprof or callgrind

3263595
hide	show
and if you don t want to show that link text you just hide it in css

3263617
int	chars
the simple example of const int arg is cute but i ve also seen - a constant pointer to constant pointers to non-constant chars

3263626
hide	show
note i also added in stuff to make it work on non-js browsers by having css hide the button and not the edits and then teh javascript hide the edits and show the buttons

3263634
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
well only problem is that clip-path mask and filter no not the ie filter but svg filter only works for firefox and safari yes no google-chrome

3263634
opera	google-chrome
i have yet to discover a way to do it in opera and google-chrome

3263634
firefox	safari
but for firefox and safari cross browser example i have created this

3263678
punctuation	words
they are used because they allow otherwise illegal characters spaces punctuation characters etc. and sql reserved words to appear within or as the entirety of the object name

3263689
inherited	subclassing
personally i recommend adding the inherited typedef to every subclassing

3263704
setinterval	settimeout
you could check this using settimeout or setinterval to make sure that any requests triggered on page load have completed if that s what you re looking to do

3263716
background-image	background-color
background-color background-image etc

3263717
installation	upgrade
but you need to make sure that you have a bomb-proof mechanism for backing up the customer s current installation and data and if necessary restoring it when your automated upgrade procedure fails

3263737
cos	sin
suppose we have expression like eq1 sin t cos t 2-sin t cos t 4.we want to simplify this expression by simple command of matlab.we get different forms in the matlab prompt

3263799
width	height
i must know their width height before laying them down so i am using the onload event handler

3263803
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
qooxdoo inspector ie firefox opera safari and google-chrome

3263817
getter	setter
however it seems that string i only has a getter and has no setter

3263819
gif	png
i want a regex what allows only al urls beginning with media and ending with one of the next extentions js css png gif or jpg

3263906
typedef	struct
you re using some very c-style syntax typedef struct class in front of declarations using a new function instead of a constructor using a free function instead of a destructor but you tagged this c++ and clearly you are using some c++ features

3263913
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it returns json data in firefox google-chrome ie safari but it doesn t return anything on iphone

3263940
folder	directory
also in eclipse when i changed target name as android 1.5 it gave me error in res folder tellin invalid resources directory

3263956
children	parent
you can do a join to get the children of parent that satisfy a particular condition with a query like

3263960
stdout	stderr
with system both stdout and stderr will go the same place as the script s stdout and stderr unless the system command redirects them

3263960
stdout	stderr
to capture a program s stdout but discard its stderr

3263960
stdout	stderr
to capture a program s stderr but discard its stdout

3263960
stdout	stderr
to capture a program s stderr and let its stdout go to our own stderr

3263960
stdout	stderr
to read both a command s stdout and its stderr separately you can redirect them to temp files let the command run then read the temp files

3263960
stdout	stderr
you can also use file-descriptor redirection to make stderr a duplicate of stdout

3263960
stdout	stderr
note that you cannot simply open stderr to be a dup of stdout in your perl program and avoid calling the shell to do the redirection

3263960
stdout	stderr
this fails because the open makes stderr go to where stdout was going at the time of the open

3263960
stdout	stderr
the backticks then make stdout go to a string but don t change stderr which still goes to the old stdout

3263960
stdout	stderr
to capture a command s stderr and stdout together

3263960
stdout	stderr
to capture a command s stdout but discard its stderr

3263960
stdout	stderr
to capture a command s stderr but discard its stdout

3263960
stdout	stderr
to exchange a command s stdout and stderr in order to capture the stderr but leave its stdout to come out our old stderr

3263960
stdout	stderr
to read both a command s stdout and its stderr separately it s easiest to redirect them separately to files and then read from those files when the program is done

3263972
int	chars
it says can not convert int to const chars

3263973
implements	extends
they can also be usefull when you want to extends some classes that implements one or more interfaces but you cannot make them all derive from a base class

3263976
children	parent
the macro uses umbraco.content.instance.xmlcontent.selectsinglenode to select a parent node and then loops through the children and adds these to the dropdownlist

3264002
wsdl.exe	gsoap
instead of adding web reference use wsdl.exe in verbose mode to generate code using thee gsoap wsdl and xsd file

3264113
width	height
so you need to subtract the half of the character s width and height from the mouse coordinates

3264197
int	double
since matrices are stored in mode of numeric type of int double and storage mode int double assuming that matrix holds numerical values you can use simple square bracket indexing to address specific values in them

3264203
ant	maven
using tools like ant or maven or from within your ide you can easily have your generated class files go to a different directory

3264208
hide	show
difference between two sections is that ones with uiswitches show and hide rows by activating deactivating the switch others by selecting rows didselectrow....

3264225
portrait	landscape
i have a uilabel that i need to shift up by about 50 pixels on application start because it starts out in portrait and i designed it in landscape and then once again whenever it is put back in portrait

3264232
button	checkbox
button it should go to other frame and it should display 4 checkbox

3264271
ord	chr
i suppose i can use ord and chr looping over and over this is simple to get for a to z eg

3264278
superclass	subclassing
i d rather duplicate the superclass initialisation stuff into the subclassing which seems bad and then examine the object at each of the points where a superclass is created and then call the appropriate constructor

3264278
superclass	subclassing
i ve tried making a call to subclassing object but i run into issues with both superclass and subclassing needing to be defined before the other

3264304
rss	feed
uikit is fully capable of handling unicode characters so the problem is most likely in your parsing of the rss content - and particular the way you convert the feed data to an nsstring

3264323
post	get
what i wanna do is to get only 1 post newest from each of those sub categories including category title post title attachment image

3264340
getter	setter
i think cattr_reader does this to avoid uninitialized class variable errors if you try to use the getter before the setter

3264386
hide	show
when i hover over a link in the first ul i want to hide all the descriptions in the second ul and just show the relevant one

3264444
matplotlib	scipy	matplotlib	chaco
using the numpy scipy libraries together with a nice plotting lib chaco or matplotlib for instance makes the workflow of working with the data and algorithms easy and you can lab around with the code in the live interpreter in an almost matlab-like manner

3264462
lisp	scheme
understand first what scope mean and how the different implementation behave in particular try to figure out what is the difference between lisp and scheme

3264466
hide	show
in my form i show hide certain divs based on the radio button selection by the user

3264471
google-chrome	firefox
this example page works for me in firefox and google-chrome

3264473
inherited	properties
i expected every child that does not set the isbubblesource properties itself to inherited it from its parent grid

3264486
inherited	properties
by default attached properties are not inherited

3264534
cprofile	timeit
if after timing your code with timeit or cprofile you feel this may be your situation then you could try pre-evaluating c d k j and testing

3264534
cprofile	timeit
then time this with timeit or cprofile as well

3264555
division	modulo
that is the modulo which finds the remainder of division of one number by another

3264582
int	boolean
when you defined the checkboxes as an int the framework couldn t covert the boolean to an int

3264625
put	get
note that if this is a shared host then you probably won t have access to put files in usr lib php or usr local lib php - so your only option is to use a relative path - which is going to get very messy -

3264629
put	get
now i want to be also able to put an arbitrary number of parameters into the message text that get inserted into the placeholders in the i18n-property in my message.properties

3264676
ncover	dotcover
you can use tools like ncover and dotcover to check that you haven t missed any code paths

3264696
inherited	properties
an ambient properties is one that if it s not set in the control will be inherited from the container

3264698
inherited	properties
there are some properties however backcolor and forecolor being two of them i believe that are inherited from the parent if not set explicitly so you should be able to use those as well

3264700
dictionary	map
for instance a distributed hash-table would be a good choice if you can make do with the limited api of the dictionary map interface

3264708
qobject	qsharedpointer
if you don t want to pass a parent for some reason because there is no qobject where it makes sense to own the socket object you can also use a qsharedpointer to manage the lifetime

3264750
outputstream	inputstream
you can read the file using an inputstream and write its data to the outputstream of a socket

3264790
mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout
try using the mouseenter and mouseleave events instead of mouseover mouseout

3264815
typedef	struct
don t know much about blitz array but you should be able to put the typedef inside a templated struct

3264816
google-chrome	firefox
i need to create plug-ins add-ons for ie firefox and google-chrome browsers for the following requirement

3264875
accessor	properties
this translation step also involves optimizations like inlining of trivial methods such as simple properties accessor

3264879
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately ie s addon development is still very arcane compared to firefox and google-chrome for the behavior you re trying to accomplish

3264879
google-chrome	firefox
you ll have to develop a bho for ie whereas both firefox and google-chrome use javascript as their addon platform

3264903
cassini	iis
when i run the app through the cassini web server f5 everything runs fine however when hosted in iis 7 i get the following exception

3264904
ubuntu	debian
e.g. on debian or ubuntu you can generally just do

3264917
google-chrome	firefox
hello everyone the drag and drop app that i have built functions perfectly in google-chrome and firefox but when i try it on ie i get object required as an error

3264927
for-loop	arrays
if you want only one for-loop you can first create an arrays or a list containing names1 names2 and names3

3264946
hex	binary
however when i save it it looks fine in notepad but when opened with a binary hex editor it shows these 3 characters at the start of the xml

3264998
post	get
i will try to get more and i will add it to this post

3265053
keystore	jks
one problem i ve encountered is that android does not accept jks keystore keystore.getdefaulttype returns bks java.security.keystoreexception keystore jks implementation not found

3265056
division	modulo
you have a constructor for biginteger that takes byte array and you can then manually run loops of division and modulo to get the representation in other non-standard bases

3265061
directwrite	direct2d
if you want to provide your users with modern look and use native code pretty much your only option is something like direct2d with directwrite and windows animation manager

3265063
put	get
if you want to call the second method you can either cast to the type subofparent or you can instead put those methods into the classes and then call it to get polymorphism

3265081
uidatepicker	uipickerview
use uipickerview with uidatepickerdelegate and uidatepickerdatasource not uidatepicker

3265174
addition	multiplication
ratio-of-uniforms is my favorite only a few addition multiplication and a log 1 50th of the time eg

3265210
switching	screens
there is a section opengl base code to setup a window in full screens and switching back to window mode

3265221
getter	setter
you can see that the usage is similar to property except there s only a getter and no setter or deleter

3265246
width	height
i say specify width and height inside your tag

3265246
width	height
like this would restrict your image size to 100 width and 200 height

3265299
ant	cruisecontrol
we modify cruisecontrol s config by copypasting project and changing ant targets in it

3265323
int	boolean
where it is much more obvious that we re trying to give an int variable a value of type boolean

3265357
interpreted-language	compiled-language
oftentimes i hear people arguing that interpreted-language can be used interactively but i believe that compiled-language can have interactive implementations as well correct

3265370
getter	setter
but it is specifically designed for getter setter

3265377
accessor	properties
yes the jitter is that good at inlining properties accessor

3265409
mouseup	mousedown
the rectangle has event handlers for mousedown mouse move and mouseup

3265435
post	get
the client uses the facebook javascript api to log the user in and get their details then post these to my server

3265475
interpreted-language	compiled-language
it s possible to build an interpreter for every compiled-language but it s not possible to build an compiler for every interpreted-language

3265567
client-side	server-side
you need to secure this server-side you can t protect it on the client-side nor should you

3265592
getter	setter
i have defined getter and setter tp_getset so that i can access and modify the static variable of acpp from python

3265602
interpreted-language	compiled-language
you can do anything that you can do in an interpreted-language in a compiled-language and vice-versa - they are both turing complete

3265610
dxcore	coderush
10.1 with dxcore coderush express

3265660
google-chrome	firefox
which works in ie7 google-chrome firefox but fails in ie8

3265660
google-chrome	firefox
i have to get it to work in ie8 even if it fails in google-chrome or firefox

3265665
pop-up	dialog
i ve been searching about using ajax modal pop-up in asp.net mvc and i ve only seen uses where there s a simple dialog box for input

3265680
haskell	ocaml
other languages which are compiled as well as interpreted are scala haskell or ocaml

3265710
getter	setter
in fact that s what i typically do unless there s logic within the property getter setter that i always want to leverage

3265732
sorting	filtering
it provides sorting and filtering functionality which can be used for display purposes without affecting the underlying data

3265732
sorting	filtering
by using a collection class it is also easy to switch between data formats such as to an xmllistcollection without having to re-write all of your sorting and filtering code

3265746
rss	feed
so i have rss feed of 10 000 records in file.xml i collected them from 10 feed in 1 hour time so there timestamps will not help btw i used yahoo pipes

3265801
linqdatasource	objectdatasource
update infact you can get this to working using an objectdatasource control instead of the linqdatasource control - see this article and download the sample

3265801
linqdatasource	objectdatasource	ienumerable	iqueryable
while using an objectdatasource isn t nearly as simple as using a linqdatasource control it s uses less magic linq stuff instead it uses heaps of magic strings that map to business data layer methods and allows the exposure of ienumerable for your data access method instead of iqueryable

3265891
post	put
i m planning to put together a post that explains this a little more in-depth but for now i hope this is enough

3266014
instances	transient
and here comes the problem when i am trying to save user then deep in the debugger the nhibernate checks the lastupdated value of role object and throws nhibernate.transientobjectexception object references an unsaved transient instances - save the transient instances before flushing telling that i need to save role first

3266020
google-chrome	safari
i tried different browsers google-chrome safari elinks from different machines to see if that would help but the problem persists

3266030
linefeed	delimiter
often happens that in svn repository text files have different text file line delimiter cr crlf linefeed

3266045
inherited	properties
from the documentation it would seem that this behaviour should be disabled by default as it is inherited from the uielement.allowdrop properties

3266080
classname	inherited
also constructors are usually called from expressions like new classname args which are defined in most languages as creating an instance of classname and not of a class that inherited from classname

3266104
bash	zsh	bash	tcsh	zsh	tcsh
in addition to being an interaction environment the shell be it the original bourne shell bin sh or one of the many alternatives ksh csh bash zsh tcsh ... with different or extended syntax provides programming language like features looping conditionals functions variables...

3266130
jcl	dcl
other examples of programming languages primarily intended for shell scripting include dcl and jcl

3266136
set	bag
i have mapped a bag property on the header object to the line class and also put a header property on the line class to set the two way relationship

3266142
integer	unsigned
you data type is the set of unsigned integer arrays

3266154
int	chars
if one of the operands is of type t where t is byte short or chars and the other operand is a constant expression of type int whose value is representible in type t the type of the conditional expression is t

3266194
urllib	httplib
i have tried using curl and python s libraries httplib urllib urllib2 and a third party library called urllib2_file

3266194
post	get
each method works fine with simple text post but each one of them doesn t seem to get the photo uploading done properly

3266206
inherited	subclassing
obviously subclassing student through inherited can also allow you to achieve the same thing but extension method clearly offer a very flexible alternative

3266227
post	get
i m having a hard time wrapping my head around converting the post into a get

3266231
gmail	hotmail
it s not hard to fix any specific instance but each client hotmail gmail outlook etc seems to handle things just a bit differently

3266235
int	double
object required is raised when you have a statement like where x is not an object type but is instead an simple type int double date etc

3266243
client-side	server-side
javascript is primarily for client-side browser python is primarily used for server-side - so they serve different needs disregarding the python to js converters and all

3266250
post	get
if i go straight to the page no post or get requests link_to works properly and the links and images render correctly which is to say that they actually do render

3266250
post	get
however the way that i would like to get to the page is by form post request in a previous page whose action is the results page i m trying to get to

3266250
post	get
edit i m not sure exactly what the problem was but i solved it by changing the form s method to get instead of post

3266280
int	chars
for the punctuation marks value chars for numbers the values would be int corresponding to the numeric value of the number and for variables it would be a reference to a variable object where that variable would be sitting in a list of objects having a name

3266289
int	chars
iirc the type in opencv mat corresponds to the image type ie number of channels not the data type float int chars etc

3266289
int	chars	int	double
if you want a templated image class that can transparently work with chars int bool double etc - take a look at cimg

3266320
post	get
the standard pattern is to have a controller method to handle the get and which shows the form or whatever to the user and one to handle the post which is the form submission

3266320
post	get
the post method sends a redirect after it has finished processing the submission which comes back in to the get method

3266335
submit	submission
maybe i m missing the point here but either just don t submit that value or set it to null prior to submission the form

3266372
punctuation	words
cons the standard analyzers throw out words like if and for and punctuation marks like which are important in source code searching

3266373
puts	gets
i ve got a script which gets data from a mysql database through an http request puts it into a json array then puts each item into an itemized overlay array so that each item can be put onto a map

3266403
put	get
i m not going to put an example of the code up here as that s just general knowledge and all i m trying to do is get the concept through here

3266486
int	double
and because it can not compare int and double it generates type mismatch

3266489
scons	autotools
there are several tools able to perform this task like autotools scons or cmake

3266501
post	get
i am working on creating a new controller route to only allow an http get and http post

3266511
strlen	substr
get date representation using substr and strlen

3266512
getter	setter
synthesize creates a getter and a setter for the variable

3266512
getter	setter
this lets you specify some attributes for your variables and when you synthesize that property to the variable you generate the getter and setter for the variable

3266514
getter	setter
you use the synthesize keyword to tell the compiler that it should synthesize the setter and or getter methods for the property if you do not supply them within the implementation block

3266537
getter	setter
it creates getter and setter for your object

3266537
getter	setter
mapview1 is the name of the ivar in the class mapview is the name for the getter setter method s

3266549
button	checkbox
ensure the include labels checkbox is checked and click then ok button

3266579
int	double
now c already has a weak type system in which you can do a reinterpret cast of a double into an int if you really want to so it should not be a surprise that it has a weak type system with respect to const as well

3266627
typedef	struct
typedef struct _cl_mem cl_mem

3266640
boost	stl
2 yes its used and boost also which is kinda the preview of the next stl

3266647
cucumber	autotest
so i can pass args options for rspec like bundle exec autotest -c -f specdoc but if i pass cucumber options like --tags wip --format pretty it blows out

3266674
int	double
d is for int use f for double

3266699
directx	gdi
if an the target app is running in windowed mode hooking directx still work but you could also just use gdi instead

3266716
allocator	stl
the stl can be used but you normally have to write your own allocator to avoid fragging memory see

3266748
post	get
a response to a particular url based on get post

3266764
vsto	add-in
i built an excel add-in with vsto 2005 se which i deployed to a user base that is predominantly office 2003-based but also with several workstations that have office 2007 installed on them

3266764
vsto	add-in
now because this add-in was created with the version of vsto for office 2003 the add-in does not have a ribbon and should show up under the add-in tab when excel 2007 is opened

3266780
google-chrome	firefox
i use google-chrome because the onload event seems not work correctly in firefox

3266781
client-side	server-side
along with python generally being server-side and javascript client-side python was designed to not only be easy to learn but also easy to read and to encourage a more productive environment

3266835
int	chars
for instance aligning chars vs int

3266836
shadowbox	lightbox
it should be a lightbox or shadowbox something that s not a popup

3266867
range	max	range	min	min	max
currently the range slider outputs min max values into single text field

3266901
implements	extends
you will also have to use the fact that the linw2sql tables are created as partial classes to extends them so all the relevent table implements iplantable

3266922
ubuntu	linux
os ubuntu linux 2.6.24-24-server #1 smp x86_64 gnu linux

3266991
width	height
essentially i have a scrollviewer object and i want the viewmodel to observe the width and height of the scrollviewer and then be able to do things accordingly depending on what that width and height are

3266997
put	get
i m trying to get a put request from python into a servlet in tomcat

3266997
post	put
the same code is happily working for post requests but not for put

3267019
rss	feed
pipes to merge them for you can create a merged rss feed for you

3267019
post	get
if you use pipes be sure to filter by date so you can get a feed with all the post in chronological order

3267027
width	height
i m trying to create a relatively simple page with a that is on the left side taking up the whole height of the browsers window with a fixed width say 200px and then an that uses the rest of the window width and also the whole windows height

3267097
powerpc	i386
32 64-bit universal -- i386 x86_64 powerpc

3267097
powerpc	i386
32-bit universal -- i386 powerpc

3267102
powerpc	i386
unless you have a reason to compile for x86_64 i recommend just compiling for i386 and powerpc if you support that

3267184
dependencyobject	uielement
you only derive from dependencyobject not from uielement

3267203
pull	push
what you re doing is turning a push sequence occurrences of an event into a pull one calls into ienumerable

3267203
pull	push
turning a push sequence into a pull sequence is difficult and the root of my problems here

3267203
pull	push
but the reverse turning a pull sequence into a push sequence is trivial and this insight gave me the solution

3267221
ssms	sqlcmd
i would install sql server client tools - you would at least then get ssms and sqlcmd

3267221
bids	ssis
no need for sql server itself or even ssis - you can still use bids to write packages but you have to run them interactively

3267233
kde	gnome
directly accessing the network share works in the gnome and kde file managers because they apply some magic themselves

3267243
width	height
i am drawing several shapes such as circles that are keyed off of the window height width

3267305
instances	transient
having it match two transient instances by equality is not technically possible

3267335
bazaar	git
it might seem silly or a solution for the desperate... but i think that bazaar has good support for both hg and git repositories and it works well on windows

3267344
getter	setter
then the getter setter for each field should be created appropriately based on what the structure is

3267351
r5rs	r6rs
i m using sisc 1.16.6 claims r5rs compliance and chez petite scheme v8 claims r6rs compliance

3267401
zipalign	jarsigner
4 use the jarsigner and zipalign with your new keystore

3267431
pop-up	dialog
browser knows what it means and pop-up a dialog box to the user with user pass fields

3267455
stateless	stateful
in reality http isn t really ideal for this kind of thing http is a stateless request response based protocol and what you need is a stateful persistent protocol such as xmpp

3267519
config	ini
you can drop an ini or other config file in some folder outside of program files or you can store it in the registry which is probably the best option

3267520
getter	setter
i need to declare an enum variable as a class member and need to define a setter and getter for that like a java bean

3267526
folder	directory
if you want to reach a folder in the parent directory you can do something like cd .. foldername

3267586
hide	show
you can use this script to show hide check box in particular column

3267586
hide	show
please give specific column index in eq index where you wanna click to show hide checkbox

3267603
accessor	properties
without making the language any more complex they could write the rule so that it applies to all properties with set accessor instead of to default properties with set accessor

3267620
persistent	transient
the documentation mentions returning non-managed entities but it also work with an entity there is no reason it wouldn t work and i could persistent the transient entity successfully

3267745
free	malloc
i suppose if you know what the malloc guard blocks look like you could write a function that backs up from the pointer you pass it until it finds a best guess of the original memory address and then calls free

3267807
post	put
whether or not your web framework should be expected to automagically parse out application x-www-form-urlencoded parameters in put requests like it does with post requests is debatable

3267885
dictionary	map
the object type is the closest you ll get to a map dictionary

3267892
setinterval	settimeout
first off you shouldn t be using settimeout you should be using setinterval

3267892
setinterval	settimeout
also it is faster to use anonymous functions inside of settimeout and setinterval

3267949
nsmanagedobjectcontext	nsmanagedobjectmodel
you can also just tear down the stack releasing the nsmanagedobjectcontext nspersistentstore and nsmanagedobjectmodel and delete the file

3267971
equals	gethashcode
but it seems lots of places in the framework ignore equals and use gethashcode and the documentation is not clear on that at all

3267975
jstl	taglib
that is right you didn t import the jstl taglib in top of jsp as per the jstl core taglib documentation

3267975
jstl	taglib
if that doesn t fix the problem and you get compilation errors of unrecognized taglib then it means that the servletcontainer in question doesn t ship with jstl and that you ll have to install jstl yourself

3267988
integer	fractions	division	multiplication
the reason i used it is because integer math and multiplication are faster than fractions math and division

3268000
ssl	https
https is specifically designed so that you can t do this - not only is one of the core points of ssl tls that the conversation be encrypted it also ensures that you really are talking to who you think you are that you haven t been redirected to a fake site via dns

3268043
equals	gethashcode
if you are using the items in a hashtable then their gethashcode method will be used initially to test for equality and if their hashes are found to be equals a call to their equals method will be made to establish whether they are equals

3268067
free	malloc
e.g. sometimes i used new delete instead of malloc free to invoke the constructor or used a std vector or std set for convenience

3268073
children	parent
qobject cannot create children for a parent that is in a different thread

3268073
qthread	qnetworkaccessmanager
parent is qnetworkaccessmanager 0x22fe58 parent s thread is qthread 0x9284190 current thread is resultthread 0x22fe48

3268098
equals	gethashcode
the only rule for gethashcode is that a.gethashcode must equals b.gethashcode if a b

3268116
width	height
you might have to change the height and width properties but this worked for me

3268121
boost	stl
just use c++ and all its advantages stl boost all that jazz.

3268123
hide	show
let s extend the code above to actually hide and show that other div depending on which item was clicked

3268123
hide	show
the functions we ll be using are .slideup which hide an element and .slidedown which show it

3268125
postgresql	mysql
if you re thinking about using mysql postgresql or such then you should look into something like rsyslog for buffering writes and avoiding the performance penalty with heavy logging

3268134
width	height
if you re using something like gluperspective just use the window width height ratio

3268173
width	height
so height and width is the only thing that echos in the first example in the second the view is loaded

3268191
children	parent
in other words if you look at an account you could tell that it had a parent but you would have no idead if it had any children

3268206
button	checkbox
i would like the checkbox list appears only when the user selects the second radio button is checked

3268238
single-quotes	double-quotes
also i recommend using single-quotes for string literals not double-quotes

3268264
atoi	atof
use atoi and atof in the std library

3268272
dependencyobject	uielement
so as heinz points out you would need to have derived from uielement order to be able to cast to uielement and dependencyobject

3268274
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
it can do anything a regular uiviewcontroller can do and will inherited all the same properties such as a view but since it only subclassing it you are able to add extra information that is specific to your own object

3268351
google-chrome	firefox
ie says its out of memory google-chrome lags for a second and then behaves well and in firefox the animation is sticky

3268378
email	dkim
the only issue i have is figuring out a way to sign the email with a private key for dkim

3268386
gridview	repeater	gridview	datalist	datalist	repeater	listview	gridview
the new listview is an update to the old datalist and repeater controls displaying multiple records and providing functionality like gridview but allowing for a more flexible layout through the use of templates

3268424
int	chars
what you can do is to use a .substring int start int length and then format the string to be 2 chars long but unless you specify the language our hands are a bit tied

3268428
folder	directory
if i have a folder called temp located in the website s root directory and run the following code

3268488
getter	setter
scala does provide a couple of workarounds for this annotations which force the creation of javabeans setter getter as well as native scala ones but that requires annotating every component that i wish to inject

3268488
getter	setter
much more convenient would be to override the beanwrapper used by spring with one which knew how to handle scala-style getter and setter

3268490
starttls	smtps
that will start a new smtps session and you will have to issue the starttls command all over again

3268518
set	bag
all collection mappings except those with set and bag semantics need an index column in the collection table

3268589
cassini	iis
this might not necessarily be an option if you ve already deployed the service but if you add the website as a local project rather than as an iis project it ll use the built-in debug web server cassini which vs seems to have less trouble attaching to

3268600
width	height
therefore i need the coordinates and width and height of them

3268639
mouse	keyboard
perform the action eg use the keyboard and mouse to change the attributes you wish to

3268684
children	parent
assuming your accounts are all coming in the same xml file you can use xpath to find the parent and children

3268716
cassini	iis
to do this i usually check the hosting process to see if it is iis or cassini - the gotcha with that approach is having to worry about updating the library when new os versions or new versions of vs come out

3268740
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i need either the os ids or the browser s ids i .e firefox google-chrome ie opera

3268809
cpu	processors
it benefits from multiple processors if multiple tabs are using cpu resources at the same time

3268809
google-chrome	firefox
example firefox and google-chrome on linux

3268824
post	get
although this question has already been answered here is an additional tip that may be of relevance there is an easy way to post both the html and the markdown by posting via javascript and using the preview component to get the html and the textarea to get the markdown source

3268861
cpu	hyperthreading
of course nobody could ever prove they didn t need to test on a particular platform but i would think there are bigger causes of platform difference to worry about than cpu brand all the various multi-core hyperthreading permutations for example which might expose all your multithreaded code bugs in different ways

3268883
for-loop	arrays
in my case i wrapped this is a for-loop so it would go through an arrays but it just depends on the need

3268893
post	get
one thing though in theory if your rooms.php script is modifying some data like saving something to database you should use http post and not http get

3268900
stdout	stderr
that way you can basically open file handles for stdin stdout and stderr and monitor everything from the parent

3268905
vim	emacs
i prefer using emacs and vim for writing c++ code

3269004
google-chrome	firefox
i am working on an app that is only used by a few people in-house so i feel comfortable telling them to only use firefox or google-chrome so i can use html5

3269006
instances	transient
caused by org.hibernate.transientobjectexception object references an unsaved transient instances - save the transient instances before flushing manager

3269044
short	base
the short answer is that the asp.net mvc framework code that retrievs the list of filters for each action removes duplicates action filters of the same type in such a way that it prefers actionfilters defined on the action method over ones defined on the controller or its base class

3269045
put	get
to put files into subversion or to get them out of subversion you need a client program

3269082
haskell	ocaml
f# is the closest thing though be aware it is based on ocaml and as such isn t based on referential transparency by-default as haskell is

3269098
versioning	upgrade
you set report server project properties to specify the versioning of the report server to deploy reports to and how to handle warnings and errors which might occur when up either upgrade a report from sql server 2008 to sql server 2008 r2 or revert a report from sql server 2008 r2 to sql server 2008

3269098
versioning	upgrade
the result is that with 2008r2 tools installed you have no choice but to upgrade the project file to 2008r2 however within the project you specify the target sql server versioning

3269103
int	boolean
int bit boolean dataetimes decimals types if there stored in the database as this way

3269117
fullcalendar	daypilot
unfortunately both daypilot and dhtmlxscheduler lack the clean and clear interface that fullcalendar achieves so well and web2cal just looks and feels unfinished and is still in beta

3269126
hide	show
i have two radio buttons to which i have assigned change handlers to show hide certain divs based on the selection

3269127
mouse	trackpad
os x is not really designed for touchscreens and has just recently gotten the most rudimentary support for touch-y interaction thanks to the magic mouse and the macbooks trackpad

3269142
treemap	treeset	put	get
saying you opted for the treeset while i don t have the source handy the javadoc says that it is based on a treemap providing o log n for get put containskey remove

3269151
nunit	mstest
i assume this is the nunit type of failure exception while the mstest version is assertfailedexception

3269151
nunit	mstest
since the nunit version obviously does not inherit from the mstest version the test runner in vs doesn t catch the exception and give me a nice message

3269151
nunit	moq
this problem appears with most mocking frameworks too so now i don t only want to do this with the assertionexception from nunit but also with verificationexception from moq and possibly others.

3269188
firefox	safari
my script works fine in ie7 firefox and safari but it doesn t seem to work in ie8 running on windows7 and i m getting desperate

3269202
min	max
i just want to find a straightforward c# class that takes in a starting latitude and longitude and a distance and finds the bounding box max lat min lat max lon min lon

3269209
put	get
i would like to create an interactive graph that would allow a user to click on a point and get information on the the value of the point eg if the value jumped a reason so i would like to be able to put this interactive graph on a web page

3269250
int	chars
you re trying to read an int but you re reading it as a chars string

3269267
folder	directory
for this the root folder has all of the core files that don t change and then there is a directory for each platform with the files that change

3269287
button	checkbox
not quite a checkbox but a radio group allows you to click on the radio button from the list and keep track of which one was selected

3269330
contentplaceholder	loginview
the other thing i noticed was that if your contentplaceholder for a child page is nested inside a loggedintemplate inside a loginview on a masterpage then you can forget about using findcontrol to grab the handle on a control inside the child page

3269337
doc	rtf
here s a great open-source example here parsing doc docx odt rtf etc

3269339
ubuntu	debian
if not wich is the best iron-python ide for ubuntu or debian

3269362
post	get
for example i m trying to send notification or post in news feed but get errors like undefined method however i do everything just like in tutorial

3269369
jar	war
the ear has a war and the war has numerous jar files

3269385
uilabel	uibutton
i have a bunch of uilabel that i add through code and i want to perform a specific action for each if the user s finger touches up inside much like uibutton s touchupinside in ib

3269418
client-side	server-side
you could generate your url server-side with a bogus title something that would never be used as a real title like bogus_title and when the client-side code execute replace it with the actual dynamic value

3269426
uilabel	uibutton
the easiest way is probably to use uibutton instead of uilabel

3269446
width	height
inside your user control set the clip property of the container for example grid to the size width height of user control

3269456
hide	show
the following code should allow to hide show the ckeditor form

3269456
hide	show	google-chrome	firefox
however this code works fine on google-chrome but on firefox once i have toggled once the editor one hide click followed by one show click it becomes not editable

3269461
folder	directory
iâ ve downloaded the project from the trunk and run the go.bat file which succeeded i then took the dll files from the â buildâ directory and overwritten the dll files in my projects â libâ folder

3269477
int	boolean
of course in any meaningful and sane function the input is parsed down to blocks of int decimals and boolean but the combinations of the bits in those values is still determining the output of your function

3269478
int	chars
i ve always considered it to be a primitive type like int or chars or long

3269478
int	chars
from a practical standpoint disregarding the above it would also seem proper to define a bool as a typedef to an int chars or have it #define d

3269489
int	chars
since you want to know the details bool is probably either a byte chars or an int

3269494
put	get
in my opinion the easiest way to get rid of all those burdens is to create a user control then put a

3269498
int	chars
bool is a well-defined primitive integral type just like int chars etc

3269511
hide	show
and make the hide show on the div

3269513
post	get
the api requires number message username and password and can be sent using post or get

3269530
folder	dir
they collapse the folder structure so you still can t have the same names as your root dir but you can still separate them into a folder

3269535
width	height
eclipse redlines width height width height in the dosomething arg list in the callback

3269547
post	get
i know there have been other post similar but i want to get the facts because i am going to be moving in a while and i want to have all the books with me so i can learn while i have no internet for a few days

3269586
put	get	width	height
put the final keyword on the width and height parameters of the surfacechanged ... method to make them accessible to the run method in the painter runnable and get rid of the compiler error

3269586
width	height
this is avoidable in java 8 because it would consider width and height to be effectively final

3269636
getter	setter
this line tells the compiler to create a setter and getter for mapview and that they should use the ivar called mapview1

3269676
width	margin
although li.textmenu has width 140px padding 5px and div.textmenu has width 150px the one list item i ve made so far has a big left margin and extends beyond the right edge of the div by a good 30px

3269684
postgresql	mysql
database type oracle mysql postgresql

3269690
free	malloc
malloc and c++ s new allocate the memory on the heap which means you have to free or if you allocated with new delete the buffer or the memory will never be reclaimed leak

3269690
realloc	malloc
lastly don t use malloc in c++ unless you have a really good reason i.e realloc

3269706
google-chrome	firefox
i have this test html page i tried it in both google-chrome and firefox

3269715
width	margin
only the padding affects the width but you ll probably want to take off the margin too

3269742
client-side	server-side
the maddening part is that the server-side code contains the jaxb annotations that are used by wsimport to create the client-side code which works great yet i can t marshal server-side sensors due to the cycle

3269742
client-side	server-side
i tried copying all of the extra annotations jaxb adds to the client-side code onto the server-side classes thinking perhaps there was a runtime bug in jaxb that was preventing it from properly applying the xmlidref annotation

3269780
std	ostream
you can use the std ostream write member function

3269826
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox 3.3.6 google-chrome 5.0.375.99 beta ie 8 and safari 5 it alerts 0 for me

3269831
width	height
i would like to build an image attributes editor so that once an image is inserted into the editable region the user would select it and then a modal window or properties panel would appear allowing the user to edit the width height etc

3269832
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
if you save your html as page.xhtml instead of page.html the browser firefox google-chrome or opera should find the un-closed tags for you without the need for a validator

3269836
for-loop	loops
in an optimized release build the second for-loop is optimized out entirely the call to is likely inlined and the optimizer can see that loops does nothing and can remove the whole loops

3269845
put	get
however if you re willing to put up with a cheesy workaround you might be able to get this to look how you want just by continuing to change the rotation angle in the same direction each time rather than setting it to a constant 0 or 180

3269904
int	chars
primitive type like int or chars or

3269912
qsort	bsearch
if you want to stick to standard c library functions there s also bsearch which is good for constant lookup dictionaries or dynamic dictionaries in conjunction with qsort

3269926
button	checkbox
it s easy to handle text inputs with the readonly property but radio button checkbox and dropdown menus don t use it

3269934
gzipstream	networkstream
some streams will never be seekable for instance networkstream gzipstream ... so if you re working on those types of stream there is no way to force them to seek

3269936
width	height
that unfortunately means you ll have to pre-calculate how wide your page needs to be the content won t dynamically stretch the width the way it does height

3269939
min	max
the closest i have got is select a concat min b - max b from test group by a

3269980
kerberos	ntlm
turns out that iis 7 reverse proxies do not support kerberos authentication so you have to disable it on your backend servers so they use ntlm

3270021
udp	tcp
tcp ip and udp ip make up the backbone of internet communication

3270021
udp	tcp
if you built a custom server then you will need construct the required message protocol on the iphone and send it to the server using either tcp or udp whatever your custom server expects

3270064
cpu	processors
on full smp systems where multiple threads could be active in the kernel at the same time and interrupts could be delivered to pretty much any cpu it s no longer enough to only disable interrupts on single processors or only grab a single lock

3270064
cpu	irq
both are required disabling interrupts protects from irq handler on the same cpu holding a lock protects from other threads entering the same critical sections on different cpu

3270101
post	get
in your post action method read the file bytes from the request and store them in the database this post can get you started

3270108
min	max
the idea is if you assign a value to group sequencial values then you can use min max to get the appropriate vlalues

3270120
post	get
that s why i am using jsonp and get as opposed to proper ajax with post

3270120
post	get
if b is the culprit would it behave differently for post vs get

3270162
awt	swing
it s better to stick with the swing components and not the awt gui components

3270168
folder	directory
in order to have the files in a folder listed out in html format when you browse to that folder with a web browser you ll have to turn on directory browsing in your apache configuration and make sure you don t have a default page eg

3270193
hide	show
the criminal is usually hidden to detectives but it has to show up himself in 5 specific turns and then hide again

3270209

3270237
geany	gedit
geany or gedit make gcc

3270276
put	get	post	put	post	get
this answer may or may not help you much but like i said before - put some more specific details into your question and you will get more specific answers either add comments under your question or post a new more specific question if you cannot edit your current one

3270336
post	get
sounds simple enough and i can get the multi-part post to gae happening but storing to the blob store requires the servlet return an http redirect 302

3270340
emacs	jedit
i saw lots of options tried emacs jedit and dozens of others but i didn t find anything satisfying this 5 points

3270343
hide	show	slideup	slidedown
is there any reason that you can t just have it on the page and hide show it via slideup slidedown

3270368
versioning	upgrade
you can even upgrade your php versioning there

3270428
getter	setter
unless the object has escaped during construction see below the assignment happens before any access to the getter setter

3270465
folder	directory
you could try say creating blank text files inside the mail admin directory and in a completely new folder in the root directory and see if you can access those without any problems - might narrow down where the problem is

3270480
google-chrome	firefox
the normal browser control is ie based but there are projects underway to create google-chrome and firefox embeddible controls

3270492
xslt	xquery
the .net framework implements xslt 1.0 only and the new functions such as replace are in the xpath 2.0 and xquery 1.0 functions and operators spec which is not supported

3270498
daemon	cron
typically you take the additional task you are doing after returning the page and hand it over to some other process normally that means placing the task in a job queue and having a cli daemon or a cron job pick it up and do what s needed

3270519
free	malloc
those are variables whose storage is directly manipulated through malloc free or new delete

3270563

swt	swing
with a good api swing and swt are not bad but they are not really good either.

3270771
swt	swing
which feels responsive still a problem today with swing and swt despite the claims that this is solved.

3270771
swt	swing
to clarify if i have to start a new software project on the jvm there are several existing options like using swt or swing using swing with third-party libraries like swingx jide jgoodies flamingo or using application frameworks like netbeans platform or eclipse rcp

3270848
joomla	elgg	wordpress	joomla	wordpress	elgg
honestly don t worry about it - 148 is nothing even if 0 caching happened at php side you re going to be hitting fs caches almost everytime - and in the grand scheme of things virtually every opensource anything out there has way more files without a problem drupal wordpress joomla elgg anything

3270860
persistent	transient
you can have the related entity as a transient field and persistent the related entity manually

3270874

i made sure to set them a nice size on start of draggable so that they would easily be detected by the droppable over which i was dragging them

3270963
google-chrome	firefox
firefox may be late to this game but please recognize the fact that mozilla have very strict shipping criteria for its features while google-chrome plays around with no thought about consequences

rss	feed
i have an rss parser which downloads a link to each item from an rss feed

3271092
nsstring	nsdata	writetofile	nsdata
whenever you fail to send details - write content of the array to a file using nsarray writetofile you can use serialization if array contain any data which is custom defined if your array contain standard cocoa objects nsstring nsdata etc they already implemented with serialization

3271181
post	get
now when i click the button the form is submited but it sends it using the get method because i can see it in the adress bar but it never gets sent to the php file and i checked to see if the names are correct and if i specify the post method it still doesnt go to the php file

3271205
public	protected
the private protected public access modifiers gives you either full read write access or no access

3271232
pascal	delphi
delphi object pascal

3271260
rvm	bundler
p.s put bundler aside and use rvm instead

3271264
accessor	properties
not to mention objective-c 2.0 properties read-only accessor

3271281
hash	md5
the other benefit of this is that md5 assures hash strings that are 32 characters numbers long

3271331
width	height
the only reason i can imagine why you would need the image width and height is if you don t want to scale the image

3271331
width	height
this way you will have a clean layout preserving the aspect ratio of your images while not having to use scripts to modify their width and height

3271358
hash	md5
for passwords a good solution is to use a oneway encryption like a md5 hash or sha1

3271358
hash	salt
to increase the security of using a one way hash you can apply a salt this help restrict the effectiveness of certain types of attackes like a dictionary attack etc

3271360
hash	md5
a md5 hash is always 32 characters long

3271374
try-catch	exception-handling
something like this is done sometimes when the creation of the initial value may throw a checked exception-handling and therefore needs to be put in a try-catch block

3271420
prepare	execute
1 - if you want to execute a query in a loop more than 1 time prepare statement can be faster because of optimization that you mentioned

3271422
width	height
getpixel is unbelievably slow and accessing the width and height properties of a bitmap inside a loop is also slow

3271448
jwindow	jdialog
i have tried many styles of jframe jwindow jdialog .

3271567
jcheckbox	jradiobutton
should display 5 jcheckbox for each jradiobutton in the same jframe

3271567
jcheckbox	jradiobutton
jradiobutton is displaying now but if i click that jradiobutton jcheckbox is not

3271603
jcheckbox	jradiobutton
create and add all objects that you need for testing jradiobutton jcheckbox and make sure that they are both displayed check using layout managers and a visual guide to layout managers if you add both but do not see both

3271630
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
by the way tested and works perfectly on ie6 ie7 ie 8 firefox 3.6 google-chrome 5 opera 10.60 safari 4.0.5

3271645
post	get
but when i send bigger file like 624 b on the call target php script i don t get any post parameters at all

3271684
mongoid	mongomapper
like mongomapper and mongoid in rails

3271753
multiplying	multiplication
i just code a simple program multiplying two number stored in 2 line in file using algorithm long multiplication

3271762
ilist	icollection
the default collection view will for most mutable collections although not for objects that implement icollection but not ilist

3271779
multiplying	multiplication
i just code a simple program multiplying two number stored in 2 line in file using algorithm long multiplication

3271826
apache	nginx
however when using apache nginx etc it s your responsibility to make sure that your server makes the files available at that url using rewrite rules symlinks etc

3271850
try-catch	exception-handling
typically it would this affects how exception-handling handling happens in a try-catch

3271850
try-catch	exception-handling
under c++ use wrappers and with try-catch to catch soft exception-handling

3271899
swt	swing	awt	swing
see this article for explanation on how swt awt and swing relate to each other

3271945
width	height
without knowing what specifically you need to achieve some suggestions would be to use some kind of placeholder css on the offending elements setting a width height colour whatever it is you need to try to mitigate the effect

3271975
swt	nebula
since swt gives you only the basics you need miglayout and nebula widgets to survive

3271975
swt	swing
actually i would have liked to include another option besides swt and swing for you qt jambi

3271975
swt	swing
i can t really compare swt to swing since my experience with swing is limitted

3271975
swt	swing
obviously there are more 3rd party extensions for swing than for swt - just do a google search

3271975
swt	swing
if you plan for long term i don t see more options than swt or swing for gui development in java

3272030
folder	directory
a better way to do it is to download the folder to your documents directory

3272068
jtable	jtextpane
now the problem is that i want to show jtable containing my course info on left side along with jtextpane in a single frame on right side so that user can select item from jtable and paste it in right side jtextpane in java..........

3272071
width	height
i am working on iframes and i need to show a certain portion of the page say the top right in an iframe with about 300px width and 150px height

3272088
width	height
set the iframe to the appropriate width and height and set the scrolling attribute to no

3272112
opencv	emgucv
since you are on c# you should look at emgucv .net wrapper for opencv

3272120
firefox	safari
in firefox safari all is good

3272130
disk	ram
if the arrays are larger than can be stored in your computer s ram then obviously you should store part of the array or its entirety on disk

3272189
hide	show
in the below image i am trying to achieve the following.i have a table and lots of labels embossed over table cells.the height of the labels is always equal to the cell height.so if two labels come in the same point one hide the another as show in the longer rectangles with red rect over blue.alternatively what i want is to make the height as half and there by show both the rectangles showing starting and end points of the rectangle since height is of no use i can half the height of the rectangle to accomodate one more in the same cell.

3272191
google-chrome	firefox
as you said firefox and google-chrome will open a new tab

3272203
children	parent
it s not really polymorphism if the children are just calling their parent implementation

3272213
gridview	formview
but in visual studio 2008 controls asp.net c# i have seen that when the page is displayed in the browser the controls namely gridview formview and linkbutton

3272264
irc	icq
this libpurple php binding which defines a set of internal classes gives a possibility to use aol and icq oscar yahoo msn jabber irc and much more protocols directly from php

3272284
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
if the byte-code is translated into machine-code and not just jit i mean if you execute the program and if your program uses many allocations deallocations it could be faster because the gc algorithm just need one pass theoretically through the whole memory once but normal malloc realloc free c c++ calls causes an overhead on every call call-overhead data-structure overhead cache misses

3272293
post	get
if you wanted to use something else like an existing http service in php then you would use the requestbuilder to build your get or post and send it to the server

3272295
google-chrome	safari
wkhtmltopdf for example uses the webkit rendering engine the one that safari and google-chrome use to create pdfs

3272345
width	height
the problem is that when the image is of a certain width and height the image is cropped but a 1px column of black pixels is added to the right of the image

3272345
width	height
maybe when the division of the height and the width gives a decimal number then the square is not perfect and the black pixels are added.

3272358
client-side	server-side
server-side frameworks use this approach to allow server-side guys to generate all the client-side code

3272416
folder	directory
there are only two real alternatives put the dll in the same folder as the exe or put it in the working directory for the exe

3272419
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
e.g. many more functions than algebraic datatypes or many more methods than oo constructors. in an object-oriented language if you leave a method out of a subclassing the compiler can t tell whether that s a mistake or whether you intended to inherited the superclass method unchanged

3272430
maven	pom.xml
i m not a j2me expert but what you get when using the j2me-simple archetype is a maven project using the j2me-maven-plugin with default preconfigured settings that you can tweak in various ways there are lots of commented part in the generated pom.xml

3272456
maven	pom.xml
run maven install from the plugin directory you checked out and then add the following in your plugins section of your projects pom.xml

3272467
qsort	bsearch
this particular pattern is useful in other situations generally where extensibility is needed at runtime and is frequently seen in c with function pointers in place of blocks qsort and bsearch . for just updating a field however the usual way is to just call from the simpler method to the more complex one

3272477
put	get
this resource would be located at a uri like airports jfk which would be retrieved with a get method updated with a put method and deleted with a delete method

3272477
post	put
finally adding a new resource could either be a put method on the airport s full uri or a post method on airports

3272477
post	put
the difference between the methods is who gets to decide the final uri for the airport the client decides for put and the service decides for post

3272477
put	get	post	put	post	get
i would go ahead and set up a restful design as i ve described then describe my resources as complex types using xsd and a soap service with actions that duplicate the get put delete and post operations of the restful service

3272484
nsexception	nserror
however be advised that the pool will eat up any nserror or nsexception objects created within its scope so you ll have to make sure those objects survive past the end of your code with additional retains and releases

3272537
django	turbogears
mvc in guis isn t quite the same as it is in django or turbogears

3272547

that will be either the width or height of the selection all the lines depending on which one is larger width vs height

3272600
int	chars
this works fine for basic data types such as int chars float etc

3272631

and if you want to upgrade to a newer versioning you d have to do it on all installs

3272670
switching	screens
all i want is one window preferably not resizable and i want to be able to switching out views for different screens in the game

3272672
salt	md5
they are appending and prepending salt to the password before they run it through md5

3272672
hash	salt
now they hash the salt password

3272683
hash	md5
as an side an md5 hash is not a cryptographically secure way to hash a password

3272684
folder	directory
this works as we do as the common folder so no extra configuration is needed for the different directory structures

3272735
int	chars
as far as my understanding of languages goes a buffer is any portion of memory in which a data is stored like an int float variables chars arrays etc

3272852
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
in my experience what people usually consider bad about inherited as implemented by most oo languages is not the idea of inherited itself but the idea of subclassing modifying the behavior of methods defined in the superclass method overriding specifically in the presence of mutable state

3272852
superclass	subclassing
so problems arise when for example a superclass expects a certain method to modify a private variable but a subclassing overrides the method to do something completely different

3272863
starttls	smtps
net smtps does not seem to support starttls

3272866
rss	feed
on each uitableview i have to load rss feed data

3272891
multiplying	transpose
luckily the inverse of a pure rotation matrix is its transpose and multiplying a matrix and a vector are straightforward to do manually if you need to

3272966
getter	setter
don t forget that properties are simply shorthand syntax for generating getter and setter methods

3272982
distance	altitude
altitude however is usually measured in above sealevel which means that you could determine the distance from the ground by substracting the ground evaluation from your actual evaluation ev ground - alt distance fromground

3273029
post	put
i need a query that for each user concatenates the text column of all post of that user and put them in the text column of the user

3273035
nswindowcontroller	nsviewcontroller
you use nswindowcontroller and nsviewcontroller to manage a window or a view because you should only need to create subclasses of nswindow or nsview for new kinds of window or view

3273052
apache	nginx
i doubt very much that at_exit handlers would be called if your rails instance was hosted inside passenger and the associated apache or nginx server crashed for some reason although i ve not actually tested this

3273056
vim	textmate
i know that textmate does this figured someone has ported it by now to vim also

3273068

it states that for any given proof system there are true statements of arithmetic the logic of addition and multiplication of natural numbers that cannot be proved in the proof system

3273074
apache	nginx
i m currently using nginx as a transparent proxy for apache

3273094
rss	feed
you could make a php script to parse the rss feed and email that contents

3273094
post	get
depending on whether how many post get done in a week you could either create a function for it to fire after the post is posted

3273108
mouseup	mousedown
you need a mousedown or mouseup event to determine which mouse button was actually clicked

3273108
mouseup	mousedown
the which property within a mousedown mouseup event handler will contain a number which indicates which mousebutton was clicked

3273141

double value double unsigned int value double placed double placed

3273211
metaphone	soundex
commons codec has an implementation of soundex and metaphone

3273221
for-loop	loops
even if it s declared outside of the for-loop each of the anonymous functions will still be referring to the same variable so after loops they ll all still point to the final value of item

3273240
single-quotes	backslash
also since the pattern contains single-quotes those would also have to be escaped by preceding with backslash

3273249
post	get
a post and a get are two different things

3273258
post	get
it seems you have mixed up get and post requests

3273265
uilabel	uitextview
from my limited testing text in a uitextview or uitextfield that is being edited has keyboard focus is smoother than a plain uilabel hanging out in a view

3273293
hash	salt
what i haven t found here or maybe it s my lack of understanding is how to retrieve a salt hash in my database and separate the salt from the hash password especially with unique salt to each password while maintaining the salt+password in a single column

3273316
filesystems	ntfs
filesystems is ntfs

3273317
sorting	filtering
the shop shows all the suppliers products in one big catalogue that should ideally support some options like sorting and filtering but they are not a requirement

3273323
hash	salt
secure hash and salt for php passwords

3273346
metaphone	soundex
gunslinger47 mentions levenshtein soundex and metaphone

3273346
metaphone	soundex
soundex and metaphone compute a short string intended to encode the sound of the string when spoken by a human.

3273354
typedef	struct
please note as i have written it above using the struct method as opposed to the typedef does not provide any protection against using another related sequences members to construct a sequence object it is needed i think however for the last example to work

3273358
folder	directory
from there you should be able to continue the path through your folder structure to the class directory

3273369
put	get	post	put	post	get
i have a script php+html full of forms and inputs after the form is submited via post i can give the user a code like was a get form q test t 3 u 9 q2 test t2 3 u2 9 q3 test t3 3 3u 9 then the user can put this code in a textarea for editing what he previously submitted

3273392
hash	salt
if you want to store salt and hash in the same column you need to concatenate them

3273414
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it appears fine in firefox ie7 but not google-chrome safari ie8 - it temporarily is fine in ie8 b c i set the compatibility mode to ie7 in the head.

3273422
multiplying	add
the formula is easy you add one to the exponent of every prime divisor and multiplying them

3273477
16-bit	64bit	x86	64bit
for an x86 bootloader you need to have a c++ compiler that can emit x86 assembly or at the very least you need to write your own preamble in 16-bit assembly that will put the cpu into 32-bit protected or 64bit long mode before you can call your c++ functions

3273479
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in dreamweaver the plugin works perfectly yet in safari firefox and google-chrome it does not

3273580
google-chrome	safari
your code works for me on google-chrome 5.0.375 and safari 5.0

3273627
queue	fifo
if your implementing fifo or last in last out queue like a stack you are better off using a linked-list since you can always use the same accessor to access the front or back-end of your list

3273653
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
safari google-chrome and firefox all understand this property and when set enable advanced kerning and ligatures

folder	directory
this allows you to right-click on a folder in nautilus and open a terminal window with that directory as its working directory

3273697
folder	directory
this will paste the path of the folder into the command line and you then type return to change to that directory

3273702
folder	directory
if the folder has a complicated path ie not just myfolder you could create a symlink to it in your home directory so you can get to it quickly

3273773
children	parent
it s parent originally had 3 children the left most and the right most became new seperate nodes

3273810
des	aes
there is no best cipher but i would recommend using an encryption algorithm that has been used a lot like tripple des or aes

3273825
udp	tcp
gave me this tcp udp example and he said it worked for him

3273835
getter	setter
in java or .net it consists of so-called setter and getter methods that set or get those properies

3273842
implements	extends
unfortunately i think you may need to implements this as a vs package which is a much more powerful way to extends visual studio

3273850
children	parent
you have two parent nodes and four children

3273850
children	parent
each parent must have two children because it has a single key

3273866

3273894
vmware	virtualbox
i ve played around with virtualbox and vmware personal editions and found them both very useable for standalone work but am looking for something more centralised

3273924
hash	salt
always use well known well tested modules and algorithms such as openssl blowfish encryption and salt password hash

3273979
client-side	server-side
asp.net is a server-side technology which renders client-side browsable code

3273986
outputstream	inputstream
inputstream and outputstream are instance variables that probably should not be shared across threads

3274000
post	get
for creating editing deleting data use a with method post for reading data usually use a link or a with method get

3274098
width	height
in inspector the window template size tab had the maximum size box checked but a 0 for both width and height

3274098
width	height
when i rechecked the box inspector automatically filled in the width and height parameters with valid values of 480 and 270

3274119
width	height
assuming that you already have your image loaded into a bufferedimage which seems to be the case this code will crop the image from x y to width height

3274123
opera	firefox
render nicely on non-web toolkit browsers desktop browsers such as ie firefox opera

3274124
coalesce	isnull
most if not all sql dialects have an isnull or coalesce function which allows you to specify an alternative value when underlying column is null

3274137
google-chrome	safari
i have found both safari and google-chrome to be somewhat buggy with the way they handle js as well so you re definitely not alone

3274146
cpu	processors
if it turns out that your application is cpu bound then you ll obviously want to consider splurging on a high-end processors

3274149
getter	setter
note that getter like myproperty and setter like setmyproperty are called â œkey-value-coding-compliantâ for this reason

3274164
nsnull	nsstring
the cast is bad because nsnull is not an nsstring

3274167
maven	pom.xml
on the other hand if you use maven as your build framework then the dependencies are explicitly declared in the project pom.xml files

3274184
accessor	properties
investigate the existing apis you re using before you go off and do this which i might add will not work correctly if the accessor of a properties is set to something different

3274185
dlsym	dlopen
use dlopen then dlsym to load the function into memory and get its address

3274194
mouseleave	mouseenter
try using mouseenter and mouseleave

3274198
mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout

google-chrome	safari
tested in ie6-8 ff3.6 safari 5 google-chrome 5

3274219
subtract	add
it doesn t prevent all problems but does make sure that if your program intended to add two plus two it didn t subtract them instead

background i m trying to create a convenience method that converts an nsimage instance to ciimage

3274401
bash	subshell
the bash script runs in a separate subshell

3274413
int	boolean
the rationale for this is that php is fairly loosely typed and tries to allow int strings floats and boolean values to be interchangeable

3274509
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the uiviewcontroller is inside of a uinavigationcontroller

3274512
readonly	temporary
if you don t mind temporary making your data structures readonly one way to do that is to use lockvar

3274515
spaces	delimiter
i m assuming the delimiter is tab since it is likely any message will contain spaces

3274516
mouseleave	mouseenter
just try to edit your code for a use of mouseenter und mouseleave events

3274516
mouseleave	mouseenter
as of jquery 1.4.1 the hover event can be specified mapping to mouseenter mouseleave

3274526
required	placeholder
you can usually get the required alignment simply by using a data type for the payload placeholder which has the strictest alignment requirement such as

3274563
uiview	subviews
use the uiview s subviews function it returns an nsarray containig all the subviews and enumerate through it and check all the views

3274663
super	implements
it s super easy to implements and could band-aid your application more than well enough to get you through - without any significant investment in refactoring your existing codebase immediately

3274674
plone	buildout
buildout fetches all plone zope files in the right versions

3274698

3282914

ubuntu	linux
yes switch operating systems but not how you think - get virtualbox and load in a version of linux ubuntu s nice and quick + well supported then use that virtual os as your development os - this way you get the best of both worlds and when you re finished working you simply close the virtual machine saving it s state if you like and have a nice clean pc to do what you want with

java.util.calendar	java.util.date
java.util.calendar java.util.date java.sql.time

3284484
jlist	jtable
you can still use your listselectionlistener with jtable too take a look at the javadocs of listselectionlistener jtable also implements it so you would use it like for your jlist

3284484
jlist	jtable
see an example but if you already used it with jlist than you know how to use use it with jtable too

3284510
comparator	comparable
you need to take a look at the comparator interface as well as the comparable interface

3284510

3284562
post	get
i am trying to simply post an entire form w o the need to create the url like you would have to in a get call

3284685
post	put
in the view s html the text area and submit button would be part of a form and that form s action attribute would point to and you d put a part into the same controller that generated that view that checks for post data

3284688
post	get
to get post counts from a specific category do a count on a call to get_posts with the category id specified as a parameter

3284721
width	height
paintevent on an object won t be called unless the object has a non-zero width and height

3284721

below how i get my md5 hash where password is a string what the user enter

3284791
hash	md5
where urltemplate is a string like enc 1 email a string and password the md5 hash in bytes

3284791
hash	md5
i think because of this i don t send the good md5 hash and it makes a problem

3284791
hash	md5
so when i ask this url enc 0 and give the password as is so a string not a byte and not md5 hash and do

3284791
hash	md5
i just have either a problem with creating my md5 hash or with the http post or both..

3284826
folder	directory
what i get is a folder in the current working directory called with myfolder in it

3284835
serializable	deserialization
the puts the onus of serial deserialization completely upon the class being serializable

3284848
hash	salt
in my experience api keys are actually used as salt to hash and the key itself is not actually passed

3284848
hash	salt
if the hash doesn t match it means that client making requests to the server doesn t know 1 the steps to create the hash and more importantly 2 the api key used as the salt to create the hash

3284867
post	get
when i post the 2nd i get the following

3284929
proficy	historian
i am linked to a proficy historian that allows periods in the column names

in this approach the parent class just acts as a metaenumerator bridging the children together

3284960
for-loop	loops
it sounds to me like you re looking for a while loops - not a for-loop

3285007
unix	solaris
bash is a newer shell that is not available on all flavors of unix--though by newer i mean only recently developed in the post-vacuum tube era and by not all flavors of unix i mean relics like old versions of solaris and hp-ux

the situation would be vastly improved if adriaan ever finds a spare afternoon to implement higher-order unification for type constructor inference

3285052
lxml	libxml2
upd lxml as a wrapper tp libxml2 seems to have similar functinality

3285061
tunnel	vpn	tunnel	packets
since your goal is to allow udp broadcast in the vpn i suggest to take a look at vpn solutions that does not drop those packets such as hamachi or gamer s internet tunnel instead of creating your own solution

3285091
put	get
see if you can get gcin-message out of the gcin package and put it into your own package if this suits your needs

i have an application that runs on an embedded processors arm and i d like to profile the application to get an idea of where it s using system resources like cpu memory io etc

3285467
valgrind	gprof
if your linux is not very limited then you may find gprof and valgrind useful

3285476
folder	directory
my own personal recommended way is to keep all my javascript files in one include folder all css files in another and all images in a third directory

3285476
versioning	upgrade
ymmv of course but the only issue i ve had at all is with upgrade when plugin authors start distributing a jquery.plugin.pack.js versioning instead of jquery.plugin.min.js or vice versa because i actually have to remember to change the filenames i look for

3285479
stdout	stderr
if the process writes to stderr or stdout and you re not reading it - it will just hang blocking when writing to stdout err

3285498

3285506
versioning	upgrade
we re building an application for os x and we can t rely on our users all having upgrade to snow leopard or whatever the latest versioning is

3285514
int	boolean
i want a json library which will let me read a textfile that is in json and let me convert it into strings int boolean etc

3285552
client-side	server-side
also be aware that the tag is often injected into the dom on the client-side using javascript as a work-around to an ie issue so if you are searching the html on server-side using php it s possible that the tag will not yet be written into the html

3285565
inherited	properties
i build a new viewmodelbase class inheriting from mvvm light s viewmodelbase class where i implementment a domaincontext list of possibly pending operations current operation isbusy properties a savecommand and a protected method to log any operations created by viewmodels that inherited from this class

3285695
firefox	safari
works fine in safari but firefox and ie no joy

3285700
stdout	stderr
if you don t even care about stderr just redirect it to stdout

3285700
stdout	stderr
if a process running on linux that is redirecting both stdout and stderr to dev null still produce anything then you ve got a broken non-compliant linux install

3285727
put	get
if you put any information about the encoding at the document level â get it right

3285753
pthreads	usleep
look at some timers delivered by the os like pthreads usleep

3285756
mergesort	in-place
the problem really seems to be asking how to do the merge step of mergesort but in-place

3285769
hide	show
if you want to show hide the links from the status details of your view model use a property which you bind to and update in the view model

3285769
hide	show
you can use a userinfo property then a converter class such as this to show hide based upon the userinfo property being a null value or a class result

3285841
onresume	onpause
set this variable to true when your activity resumes invokes onresume and set the variable to false when your activity pauses onpause

3285853
nullreferenceexception	invalidoperationexception
just about the biggest one is that explicit cast might throw an invalidoperationexception and not nullreferenceexception

3285908
int	chars
in fact a better way to think about it is that you can only match constructors and it so happens that int chars string co

3285913
gentoo	debian
it s just like emerge on gentoo or apt-get on debian

3285926
postgresql	mysql
mysql and postgresql install fine on it

3285928
division	modulo
you don t need loops you only need division and modulo

3285957
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
java.util.date and java.util.calendar

3285958
division	modulo
the simplest and usual way is just to store it all as one big integer number of coppers and then use modulo and division to extract each field

3285975
sorting	filtering
the bll has parameters for sorting limit records and filtering

3286000
post	get
i need to run a query in wordpress to get how many post there are per month including zeros

3286069
hide	show
i want to be able to show hide the rows

3286114
inherited	subclassing
by way of disclaimer i was generating the subclassing on the fly and inherited was a bit of a cheat to keep my code generation simple as always my first instinct is to try to remove the extends relationship altogether

3286137
children	parent
one way for the parent to know what to make is to keep a dict of the children

3286137
children	parent
there are ways that the parent class doesn t need to enumerate its children by searching for all of its subclasses but it s a bit more complex to implement

3286170
post	put
i was really looking for someone to just post a code snippet on how to read the file but i only found that on the page i put the link with

3286176
tex	sweave
cannot open corresponding tex or sweave file

3286242
codeigniter	cakephp
we would like to use an existing php framework to do this we re considering cakephp and codeigniter but are open to other options

3286255
google-chrome	firefox
i have to divs side by side in another div but for some reason in google-chrome firefox and ie8 i have to use the margin-top -1px because the div on top was 1 pixel down

3286292
multiplication	modulo
the result of the multiplication will be reduced modulo size_max + 1 which means it ll only try and allocate around 2gb

3286325
valgrind	gprof
as bobah said gprof and valgrind are useful

3286353
width	height
i figure an easy way to load the saved values such as the width and height for a div would be to have cakephp echo a variable as their width height in the css file much the same way it would do this in the view file

3286355
filesystems	fat
you can probably disable paging and disable caching for the store using the fat filesystems registry entries

3286405
width	height
the docs state the first pane of a split view controller has a fixed width of 320 points and a height that matches the visible window height

3286408
folder	directory
so the extdiff extension is working fine except that even when one side of the comparison is my working directory as in the case where i only give one revision argument hg bcomp -r 25 to get a diff between rev25 and the working directory it causes my diff tool in this case bc3 to open up a folder comparison session comparing a snapshot of rev25 to a snapshot of the working directory such as.

3286437
mouse	keyboard
apparently the latter is in effect that is the event is fired when the popup is closed either by mouse or by the keyboard like pressing esc

3286464
put	get
better yet it is compiled and its speed is competitive with java and c++ though you have to put forth extra effort to get this speed in some cases

3286471
folder	directory
i want git to ignore the build directory which is in the root folder of the xcode project

3286483
accessor	properties
however it does require that the properties be read write public properties because it s going to go through these properties accessor to get and set the serialized data

3286533
hide	show
i would argue that you should set the .visible property for each control you want to show hide

3286590
put	get
...use two indexes 1 hashed for searching value by key 2 sequential for tracking last recently used items get function put item as last item in sequesnce

3286609
stdout	stderr
the shell has no idea what the process sent to stdout stderr

3286625
stdout	stderr
the puts stdout and stderr onto the stdout stream and the sed replaces every start-of-line marker with three spaces

3286633
jobs	cron
so if you can stand only compacting once a day do it at 3am with the rest of your system database maintenance cron jobs

3286643
sproutcore	cappuccino
like bruz says cappuccino is probably more freeform at the data layer than sproutcore

3286655
getter	setter
getter setter

3286692
background-repeat	background-position
however you could use the background-position background-attachment and background-repeat porperties to achieve an alternative result

3286738
tinyint	varchar
varchar 100 char 100 or tinyint joking

3286790
memcached	apc
i am always thinking about the future so i was thinking about implementing memcached or apc cache to the project to offer an option to my client

3286802
int	chars
phone numbers - int or varchar or maybe chars depends on if you want to store formatting

3286802
innodb	myisam
also innodb uses row level locking whereas myisam only uses table level locking

3286802
innodb	myisam
therefore innodb can handle higher levels of concurrency better than myisam

3286802
innodb	myisam
myisam versus innodb

3286802
innodb	myisam
however you have to use the myisam engine to use full-text index because innodb doesn t support it

3286802
innodb	myisam
however if you absolutely need posts to use innodb for transactions then set up a trigger to update the myisam copy of your posts table and use the myisam copy for all your full-text searches

3286808
width	height
i think that the modal doesn t count them in it s height or width calculation or something

3286856
folder	directory
i have a folder in my application directory called commands.folder

3286867
mouse	keyboard
and just like any language or car or keyboard or mouse the more you use it the more efficient you get at using it

3286867
multiplying	add
some instruction sets make it that much easier and some programmers might swap the multiplying for a shift or a shift plus add

3286867
memcpy	memset
bootup code often calls memcpy for .data and memset for .bss

3286881
next	except
next is similar to the continue keyword in the c family of languages except in ruby it makes an iterator move to the next iteration

3286898
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
you may want to restore the constructor properties of the subclass.prototype object after the above line because if you don t do it the instances created with subclassing like sub in your example will have an inherited constructor properties wrongly pointing to superclass

3286923
width	height
cfimage action captcha width 250 height 80 text railo

3286957
hash	md5
if the pages don t have any dynamic content the easiest way to do that is to generate hash for the files using a md5 or sha1 commands and check then against the new server

3287026
spaces	delimiter
or just print out fields 1 and 2 using spaces as delimiter

3287037
getter	setter
the login class is a simple object containing a username and password field with appropriate getter and setter

3287038
put	get
the only way i can currently get the command to run via cron is to break the commands up and put them in a dumb bash wrapper script

3287058
width	margin
but even if you reduce the margin to 0 you still have to reduce the width to 250px to get rid of the effect you don t like..

3287059
put	get
put this together and you get which matches from the beginning of the line to the first that it sees

3287108
post	get
i wrote a blog post that could probably get you started at

3287133
put	get
in vim i d probably use the visual selection tool put the cursor on the first type v g to get to the end of the file then x to delete the column

3287215
post	get
servlet on the other hand is a class conforming to the servlet api to process http requests such as get post etc

3287234
getter	setter
use synthesize and keep the synthesized setter and getter or

3287234
getter	setter
provide a manual implementation of both the setter and the getter without using one of the above directives

3287234
getter	setter
if you declare the property with nonatomic then you can mix manual and synthesized implementations of getter and setter

3287234
clang	llvm
as of llvm 4.0 clang provides auto-synthesis for declared properties that are not dynamic

3287234
getter	setter
by default even if you leave out the synthesize the compiler will provide getter and setter methods for you

3287234
getter	setter
however the rule for atomic properties is still the same either let the compiler provide both the getter and the setter or implement them both yourself

3287237
division	modulo
a simple division will not work and tried modulo but cannot get it to give me the right answer

3287265
interbase	firebird
noting that only the oracle and firebird interbase jdbc connection objects appear to be thread safe

3287331
gitignore	git-add
if you don t want to remove the .yml files assuming they are configuration files of sort you can add them to gitignore but still git-add a default one for the repository

3287349
width	height
if you require absolutely all of the text to be visible you must either expand the width of the field or the height and use uilinebreakmodecharacterwrap or possibly decrease the font size as a last resort

3287393
min	max
it takes as parameters the wanted left coords right coords bottom coords top coords and min max depth

3287466
client-side	server-side
then again on the server-side because client-side validation is easily bypassed

3287508
google-chrome	safari
i did a view source in safari 4 windows and google-chrome

3287521
switching	screens
this will switching your app to full screens and get rid of taskbar and disallow use from doing something other than using your app

3287563
implements	extends
i am adding the list of objects using array list and i send it to the class that extends base adapter and when i extends the base adapter class it implements some methods such as getview etc

3287564
getter	setter	public	protected
if you don t need it to be public it s often safer not to due to getter setter allowing better control over what values can be assigned then you should declare if protected or private

3287583
x86	64bit
and so you d need a version of dottwain that s not been ngen-ed has a cpu reference of any too or release a separate 64bit version where all of your references are definitely not set to x86 you d want any or x64

3287585
single-quotes	double-quotes
i suspect it has something to do with the difference between single-quotes and double-quotes with string literals in ruby

3287585
single-quotes	double-quotes
the short answer is that using single-quotes does minimal text processing but double-quotes allows interpolation character escaping and a few other things

3287626
versioning	upgrade	uninstall	upgrade
i guess because an upgrade is performing an uninstall on the previous versioning

3287626
uninstall	upgrade
how can i retain the files on upgrade while removing them on uninstall

3287645
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	linux	opensuse	linux
i took the linux distro chooser at and it recommends opensuse mandriva ubuntu

3287677
floyd-warshall	dijkstra
i m thinking the best approach would be something like the floyd-warshall or dijkstra algorithms for shortest path pair but don t know how to adapt it to coordinate distances as all the documentation uses a pre-determined distance matrix

3287684
innodb	myisam
mysql has various engines - the primary ones being innodb and myisam

3287684
innodb	myisam
there s also a limit on the space for defining indexes - 767 for innodb 1 000 for myisam

3287712
width	height
grid provides much more power to control the width height of rows columns and changing the width height value at one place will affect all the rows

3287719
uilabel	nsstring
one quick way of doing this would be to create a single view that contains a uilabel and any other controls you might like that has an nsstring property that allows you to set which text is displayed in the body i m sure you get the idea

3287725
google-chrome	firefox
as google-chrome supports the netscape plugin api the firefox way might be a good starting point also there

3287726
int	chars
i have to read xml file for that i use saxparser and defaulthandler using method chars chars ch int start int length but it gives output with some extra chars such as in place of #13

3287734
accessor	properties
use the bracket notation properties accessor

3287734
accessor	properties
note that you can even use an expression with this properties accessor

3287735
onresume	onpause
in between onresume and onpause your activity is active it s on the screen and the user can interact with it

3287735
onresume	onpause
if your activity s onpause method is called then you should assume that it is no longer active and the user cannot interact with it anymore until onresume is called again

3287735
onresume	onpause
this would account for the gap between one activity s onpause and another s onresume

3287749
profiling	instrumentation
there is no substitute for profiling on hardware and with the debugger and instrumentation connected you can get everything you would in a simulator context

3287810
put	get
i am new to qtp i want get the data in chekpoint i am not asking about checkpoint return value what ever checkpoint capture data that data put display in msgbox

3287818
iboutlet	ibaction
basically you re right you could do all the notification-related things yourself with notificationcenter but since we re talking about ui-stuff here i would greatly recommend you to use ibaction -methods and iboutlet -properties in your code which you can easily connect to ui-elements respectively their callbacks in interface builder

3287853
hide	show
2- you can use 4 different tableviews and hide show them when you press the toolbar button

portrait	landscape
unfortunately when i change the orientation of the device say from portrait into landscape mode the text doesn t get redrawn correctly but gets scaled and distorted against my intentions

3287869
jar	war	maven	pom.xml
in maven this means it s a pom.xml project as opposed to jar or war and so doesn t have any jar to go with it

3288005
maven	pom.xml
it allows me to run various maven commands package install etc. by right-clicking on a pom.xml file and navigating to the run as menu

3288056
implements	extends
use extends instead of implements

3288134
free	malloc
also be careful that you can free only the pointers returned by malloc and only once

3288140
opera	google-chrome
nowadays almost every browser identifies as mozilla even ie google-chrome and opera

3288140
opera	firefox
anyway this header is essentially meaningless as several browsers provide ways of spoofing it at least firefox and opera

3288145
plural	inflection
you can add your custom inflection rules if the cake inflector gets it wrong it s only human and a singular e is probably uncommon for a plural es

3288200
fadein	fadeout
i tried your code and it works both in ff 3.6.6 and ie 8 click - fadeout click - wtf fadein

3288206
for-loop	arrays
my problem is that i can t figure out how to get multiple arrays to work properly in a for-loop

3288206
for-loop	arrays
this code does not work since i in the for-loop doesn t become an arrays

3288206
for-loop	arrays
if there is another way to handle multiple webpages without having to use arrays and a for-loop please let me know

3288243
google-chrome	safari
if you are using safari or google-chrome you can open up the developer tools and inspect the element by clicking the magnifying glass

3288275
for-loop	arrays
if there is another way to handle multiple webpages without having to use arrays and a for-loop please let me know

3288279

accessor	properties
if you intend for this properties to be used only within your assembly then make the properties accessor internal

3292741
accessor	properties
unfortunately this means you have to give up protected on the accessor of internal properties

3292745
ienumerable	iqueryable
calling asenumerable will cause cast to be evaluated on a ienumerable not iqueryable so the cast will be done on the actual object returned from the db rather than directly in the db

3292752
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade to the most recent versioning of sqlalchemy and some of my code no longer works

3292765
accessor	properties
it isn t the lack of encapsulation that removes the need for accessor it s the fact that by changing from a direct attribute to a properties you can add an accessor at a later time without changing the published interface in any way

3292773
int	double
there is no overload for int so you need to cast to a double or a decimal

3292784
google-chrome	firefox
if you don t have firefox then i am pretty sure google-chrome also has something similar to firebug built in

3292813
asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
including an anchor tag in an asp.net asp.net-mvc html.actionlink

3292862
post	put
i recently read this post floating point vs integer calculations on modern hardware and was curious as to the performance of my own processor on this quasi-benchmark so i put together two versions of the code one in c# and one in c++ visual studio 2010 express and compiled them both with optimizations to see what falls out

3292862
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
i don t understand why the division multiplication in c++ is so much slower than addition subtraction where the managed c# version is more reasonable to my expectations

3292867
google-chrome	safari
the unescaping of the url is a safari bug since the same problem does not occur in google-chrome or any other browser

3292891
int	chars
you do not need to specify a chars count for int columns

3292891
tinyint	varchar	int	chars
don t worry about tinyint vs smallint vs int vs bigint or chars vs varchar vs text vs bigtext

3292895
iasyncresult	idisposable
had they followed their own advice iasyncresult would have derived from idisposable since the implication is that it holds idisposable resources

3292912
inherited	properties
i think you re missing a case it is possible that t just inherited the properties from b without overriding it unless you know for sure this won t happen in your specific scenario

3292912
inherited	properties
however you need to watch out for the case where t hides the properties inherited from b using the new modifier

3292912
inherited	properties
to handle that case you can check the attributes of the properties s getter method obtained with getgetmethod if the newslot flag is present it hides the inherited getter

3292915
doc	odf
i am trying to parse strings from documents - pdf word doc docx excel xls x ppt odf and also mac formats

3292917
children	parent
consider the following example and assume that child1 child2 child3 are all children of parent -

3292934
ienumerable	iqueryable
cast will take an ienumerable already but you can create an overload that accepts an iqueryable something like this untested

3292939
disk	ram
ideally this file should be on a ram disk of course

3292954
gmail	hotmail
i want a php code to load contact list from hotmail yahoo and gmail something like a friend referral scripts

3292982
min	max
i have a table with the following data that i need a query to get col1 max col2 min col3

3292982
min	max
so that s for each distinct col1 i want to get the max col2 and min col3

3292987
mongoid	mongomapper
did some testing with mongomapper last week it was stable but i found the query interface a little limited also some of the ar logic was quirky switched to mongoid today and it feels much better to use - and more intuitive if you are used to ar

3292997
ienumerable	ilist
on my property so i think to expose a simple property of ienumerable and encapsulate an ilist like a private field

3293016
post	get
you will have to pass some sort of information along with your image to identiy it probably via url params or post params but i don t really want to get into that

3293027
post	get
aside from that the only ways that i ve found to get multi-project mvc to work has been using portable areas or mef blog.maartenballiauw.be post 2009 04 21 aspnet-mvc-and-the-managed-extensibility-framework- 28mef 29.aspx and

3293050
int	double
as rick mentions in his comment the reason for casting the int to a double decimal probably works too is that the function does not have an overload for int

3293092
width	height
this function is called from main and performs grayscale conversion on gpu_image based on it s width and height

3293092
width	height
cuda_grayscale gpu_image width height grid block

3293112
folder	directory
i have removed the temporary asp.net files folder in question and have also removed and re-added the references in question and deleted the contents of my bin directory

3293130
width	height
it looks like you just have to add the image s height and width attributes

3293135
exponent	modulo
create a class that contains just a modulo and an exponent

3293189
range	max
the argument does not indicate a max length or max range of values it s only a hint for display

3293224
hide	show
i do not want to use the show or hide commands i prefer to use detach but i think there should be a nice way to deal with it

3293255
sorting	filtering
offloading sorting and filtering logic to the server even at the expense of additional entities loaded in memory so that your client can remain fast pays dividends in my experience

3293266
integer	fractions
since your function couldn t use an integer in its operation it needs a type in the fractions class it makes that very complaint there s no instance of integer in the fractions class

3293285
width	height
set a min-width and min-height on the tags instead of height and width

3293285
width	height
earlier versions of ie will helpfully ignore these properties...so you ll need to continue setting height and width in an ie only style sheet

3293292
ant	maven
tomcat is used for deployment and there are also maven and ant versions in case you prefer one to another option for organizing project builds

3293328
nstextview	nsscrollview	nswindow	nsscrollview
my window is structured like so nswindow - nsview - nstabview - nsscrollview - nstextview

3293330
arpack	lapack
lapack does not have special support built in for sparse matrices but arpack does

3293341
division	addition
i think it is a few cycles slower than addition but yes division is very slow compared to the others

3293348
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
note this was a modified form of touchesbegan touchesmoved

3293354
cloudant	couchdb
mongodb support is in beta partnering with mongohq and couchdb is roadmapped for later this year in conjunction with cloudant

3293364
innodb	myisam
i think you are confused about two different issues when to use innodb instead of myisam and when to use foreign key fk constraints

3293364
innodb	myisam
as for the first issue there have been many answers that do a great job of explaining the differences between myisam and innodb

3293364
innodb	myisam
this is because it uses table level locking instead of row level like innodb so myisam can t handle high concurrency as well plus it s missing features that help with data integrity such as transactions and foreign keys again already mentioned by others

3293387
division	multiplication
it s possible that c# optimized the division by vx to multiplication by 1 vx since it knows those values aren t modified during the loop and it can compute the inverses just once up front

3293392
disk	ram
so if you have a few nonclustered indices on your table then you re definitely a wasting a lot of space and not just on disk - also in your server s ram

3293411
post	get
my options are basically to figure out how to get merge calls to send the data along with the request do a delete followed by a post delete and recreate the record on every update or figure out how to modify the odata service to accept puts for updates

3293427
spaces	delimiter
another here doc syntax doesn t require you to use the dash but it does require that the end of here doc delimiter is in column 1 or there are no spaces that precede it

3293428
firefox	safari
mozilla firefox tested with 3.6.6 doesn t support border-radius neither does safari 4.0

3293536
put	get
note bundles have get and put methods for all the primitive types parcelables and serializables

3293548
folder	directory
i think it s not so much a problem of virtual directory as the fact that the explorer tries to hide system files from users to protect them from doing destructive things like wiping out their windows system32 folder

3293581
next	except
it works i can pinch-and-zoom and drag except that the image goes off the screen and i can t scroll to the next image in the gallery

3293626
jax-ws	jax-rs
standard xml binding technology for jax-ws jax-rs and sca

3293631
sorting	filtering
if you want to take explicit control over sorting behavior there is a rich client-side api that allows you to specify sort and filtering directly

3293633
public	protected
i don t give constructors their own section like most people do except that they are the first entry of their category so public constructors come just after protected methods for example

3293650
mouse	keyboard
i want to know if it is possible to hide the scrollbar while scrolling is still enabled with mouse keyboard

3293708
inherited	properties
edit mygroupbox.cs modify to inherited from contentcontrol and add title dependency properties

3293749
post	get
when i don t have the file in the file input i get the post data but when i do the post data is empty

3293772
width	height
i think you just need to also set its width height properties

3293789
dictionary	map
build a dupe map which is essentially a dictionary with a key of the letter and a value of the occurrence count

3293791
many-to-many	one-to-many
i understand that the nature of the relationship probably matters one-to-one one-to-many many-to-many uni-directional bi-directional and probably access patterns matter too

3293809
tarfile	zipfile
by looking at tarfile and zipfile module i don t see any existing function that allow me to get a table of content of a zipfile within a tar.gz file

3293811
udp	mtu
also it is quite likely to loose big udp packets along the way because the wrapping ip packet might be fragmented due to mtu limitations

3293838
many-to-many	one-to-many
if you have a many-to-many relationship you ll need to re-work the tables so you end up with two one-to-many relationships and an intermediate resolution table

3293845
google-chrome	firefox
i don t get this behaviour with firefox ie or google-chrome

3293918
gridview	objectdatasource
i have an asp.net web forms page with a gridview control bound to an objectdatasource

3293918
gridview	objectdatasource
the methods on the data access class have sorting paging parameters so i can use the built-in capabilities of the gridview objectdatasource controls

3293971
public	protected
use inheritance and make sure that the elements from the master form your are trying to access are declared as protected or public

3294005
nsstring	nsdata
what i ve done thus far and it works but isn t pretty is to read the nsdata into an nsstring the data seems to be ascii encoded

3294021
client-side	server-side
this is often used when doing javascript programming with asp.net to get the client-side html id of server-side controls because asp.net can dynamically adjusts html ids at runtime

3294024
sqldatasource	formview
i ve written a page outside of visual web developer 2010 that uses a sqldatasource object along with a formview object that works perfect

3294046
google-chrome	firefox
i notice this in firefox not so much in ie or google-chrome

3294048
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
safari google-chrome and firefox all render this correctly

3294085
cifs	smb
cifs smb

3294096
bazaar	git
this script allows you to add bazaar repositories as git branches in your git repository

3294117
getdate	dateadd
delete from tbl_cancel where cdate dateadd d -2 getdate

3294157
ubuntu	linux
well after a nightmare trying to solve the issue finally i update ubuntu from 9 to 10 this solve the problem i think some update of linux break php if it happend me again probably i ll begin rebooting the vps

3294165
hash	md5
i suppose it s something to do with md5 hash

3294178
integer	fractions
the binary representation of a decimal value consists of a 1-bit sign a 96-bit integer number and a scaling factor used to divide the 96-bit integer and specify what portion of it is a decimal fractions

3294237
versioning	upgrade
okay i had just upgrade to the latest versioning of views and cck

3294248
ant	maven
i m in the process of moving them from ant to maven but i m having some difficulty figuring out the best way to do it in maven

3294248
ant	maven
this is how i have it set up in ant but there may not be an appropriate parallel in maven

3294275
mri	rubinius	ironruby	rubinius	jruby	mri	jruby	rubinius
pretty much all implementations of ruby have their own private extension api and extensions that are for example written for mri don t necessarily work on yarv ree or rubinius and they certainly don t work on jruby or ironruby

3294275
mri	rubinius	ironruby	rubinius	jruby	mri	jruby	rubinius
right now there are five ruby execution engines that are generally considered to be of production-ready quality ironruby 1.1 jruby 1.5.1 rubinius 1.0.1 yarv 1.9.1-p429 and also i personally consider yarv 1.9.2-rc2 to be production-ready and mri 1.8.7-p299

3294275
mri	rubinius	ironruby	rubinius	jruby	mri	jruby	rubinius
the difference becomes really dramatic when running multithreaded code on a multicore machine such as for example azul systems 864-core java appliance because mri yarv ree and rubinius cannot actually run multiple threads in parallel and thus are only ever going to use at most one core whereas jruby and ironruby will happily use all available cores

3294305
implements	extends
im trying to implements a listadapter that supports integer arraylists by extends the baseadapter when initialize the activity my app crashes

3294361
pull	push
of course this is an pull service compared to the streaming push services provided by thomson reuters bloomberg activ financial etc so there are definitely types of financial apps high-frequency trading systems etc that this sort of data feed is not appropriate for

3294408
uilabel	uibutton
for your specific problem i might approach it by designing movableview as a container class that was just an object that has a child view uilabel uibutton etc that you want to move as its subview

3294412
puts	gets
he will then have to do some searching and possible keep track of what he is discovering so that he can use the uris again efficiently in future to do gets posts puts and deletes

3294436
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
a case-insensitive wildcard search will definitely be a more expensive db query than a case-sensitive exact match

3294436
postgresql	mysql
database engine mysql postgresql sqlite etc.

3294471
inherited	properties
another approach can be to bind a method to its instance within the constructor keep in mind that the method will be defined as an own properties on each object instance you create it will not be inherited for example

3294501
uiview	subviews
what i would do is make a movableview class that inherits from uiview and simply add whatever you want movable as a subviews of that view which i think might be slightly different than what quixoto was saying my apologies if not

3294525
filtering	grouping
grouping on dates i could get then get the sum of quantity on that day however the final result set can t be aggregate due to user provided filtering that may exclude some of these records down the road

3294528
for-loop	loops
another subtle difference is that any variable you declare within a for-loop will be available outside loops whereas those within an iterator block are effectively private

3294541
post	put
415 is returned by the server when the entity sent in a request content in a post or put has an unsupported mediatype they sent xml

3294575
int	double
mostly for number types such as int double etc.

3294575
icomparable	compareto
the problem is if i do the following i get an error but according to msdn icomparable s compareto is supposed to be able to handle null values

3294583
typedef	struct
typedef struct _foo

3294583
typedef	struct
_foo x.c typedef struct _foo

3294651
rel	alt
i think if you properly use tag attributes like alt title longdesc rel rev etc

3294685
innodb	myisam
myisam has table-locks instead of the innodb row-locks

3294694
google-chrome	firefox
firefox or google-chrome doesn t wait for that but display the content right away

3294726
outputstream	inputstream
then rather than writing to an outputstream you provide the user could provide whatever kind of inputstream they wanted and your framework would just copy that to the servlet outputstream

3294729
rtos	ecos	rtos	qnx	qnx	ecos	vxworks	ecos	vxworks	qnx	vxworks	rtos
a middle ground can probably be achieved with a more fully featured rtos such ecos vxworks neucleus or qnx neutrino

3294749
rss	feed
i m looking for a list the bigger the better of rss feed to test a feed reader i m writing

3294766
post	get
when we look at the iis logs on the remote server we see that the productservice proxy is making an http get request when the method call is initiated from the page but it is making an http post request when the method is called from the wcf service

3294766
post	get
bottom line the wcf client proxy tries to do a post instead of a get when used from within another wcf rest service but works correctly when used from a page or pretty much anywhere else

3294771
maven	pom.xml
i also used stringutils you can get that by including this in your pom.xml if you re using maven

3294773
post	get
the current stable version shows you the http headers get and post variables and the response text

3294786
int	double
this isn t an issue for the int tests and would crop up much later for the double tests

3294823
post	get
to get the actual rectangle just use the function in your post

3294838
telerik	radwindow
you might consider using telerik s radupload and radwindow to accomplish this

3294842
integer	unsigned
for example a 16-bit unsigned integer is a uint16_t

3294862
hash	md5
i think md5 doesn t work in this case because i have to query if a string matches the md5 hash

3294866
vxworks	qnx
however assuming that your employer has crammed that board down your throat and you aren t willing to quit over their insistence on screwing up my first recommendation would be qnx and my second choice would be vxworks

3294866
vxworks	qnx	vxworks	ucos
because of the low-overhead low-latency requirements inherent in moving massive numbers of pixels through a system i would not consider anything from microsoft and i would put any linux at a distant third or fourth place behind qnx vxworks and ucos

3294869
super	implements
if you are trying to get your super s class what you probably want is to be calling a method in your parent s class that explicitly implements whatever action you were going to take after you looked up the parent s type

3294917
post	get
then it does get and post request to retrieve data

3294919
apache	lighttpd
however you would probably do best by using mod_xsendfile in apache or similar settings in lighttpd due to efficiency

3294931
slideup	slidedown
i m hiding the content area initially and then calling slidedown when i hover over the header and slideup when you leave the header

3294965
microchip	dspic
for example microchip s dspic pic24 compiler is c only third-party tools may have c++ support

3294965
forth	ada	ada	pascal
as well as c c++ other possibilities are assembler forth ada pascal and many others but c is almost ubiquitous

3294976
post	get
i m not quite sure what you mean by multiple levels and why the database is mentioned in your post but generally command or memento are both good options to get undo and redo in an object -oriented program

3294996
bottle	flask
in addition to flask bottle is also simple and wsgi compliant

3294998
for-loop	loops
the initialization part of the for-loop has become part of the condition tested in your while loops

3295000
subtract	add
if i add or subtract tabs that seems to update the uitabbar fine

3295007
hash	md5
instead of using a one way hash md5 sha1

3295013
jquery	scriptaculous
there are many questions discussing jquery and scriptaculous but none that directly address this question

3295022
pseudo-class	visited
the link and visited pseudo-class must be defined before you define the hover and active

3295025
getter	setter
getter and setter are the least of your problems

3295025
getter	setter
when people talk about code coverage standards of 70 or better they often say that getter and setter can be left out

3295048
move	drag
in the navbutton i have a drag feature that allows the buttons to be move throughout the grid and currently i am working on determining where each button should land on the mouseenter event

3295101
hide	show
i would like to hide and show a number of buttons at random which should run in a 30 sec timer

3295126
lsp	principles
anyway for your example code i would first go and read about liskov substitution principles lsp

3295129
stdout	stderr
just realized that there is no requirement to output to stdout so output to stderr instead and knock off another character

3295149
rss	feed
this may be a weird or stupid question but i have the following code and i want to place a simple read more link after the description which links to the the article in the rss feed - however whatever i do isn t working

3295154
postgresql	mysql
file to mysql mssql postgresql etc

3295172
stateless	stateful
the java enterprise java bean spec divides the world into entity stateless session stateful session and message driven beans

3295235
uitableview	uisearchbar
i recently moved a project over from manually adding a uisearchbar as a subview of my uitableview to using a uisearchdisplaycontroller

3295249
ssl	https
the above guides are for setting up ssl https and may be overkill but they should detail how to compile ssl into php

3295308
post	get
i really need to get wordpress to sanitize them and replace them with s s t t when it creates post slugs

3295330
addslashes	htmlspecialchars
this covers in detail the variety of functions that can be used in different situations to cleanse input including mysql_real_escape_string htmlentities htmlspecialchars strip_tags and addslashes

3295345
subtraction	addition	division	addition	division	subtraction
i need to manipulate expressions like 1 + sqrt 3 and do basic arithmetic like addition subtraction and division

3295401
spaces	delimiter
the text files that match these keys are the same then followed by a line of text also separated or delimiter by a spaces

3295439
jax-ws	jax-rs
depending on what you d like to do jsf jax-rs or jax-ws might be what you re actually after

3295453
google-chrome	firefox
this all works fine on ie and 70 of the time on firefox and google-chrome however 30 the update panel never is updated

3295453
google-chrome	firefox
i have also tried blocking browser cache on firefox and google-chrome but it changes nothing

3295481
post	get
and within the function i would use jquery to make a get post to retrieve the messages from a php scrip which would

3295496
getter	setter
i understood i think that a bean is a java class with properties and getter setter

3295517
getter	setter
all properties private use getter setter

3295519
inherited	subclassing
using inherited means that when you call a method or virtual method in c++ in the same class it isn t immediately clear that you might actually be calling a subclassing method

3295519
superclass	subclassing
a code smell that can result is a call stack that goes up and down the class hierarchy which effectively means that your superclass and subclassing are in a circular dependency

3295537
hash	md5
if you only need to verify that the .exe file is properly distributed calculate the md5 hash of the file after you yourself compile it then have users compare their copy of the file s hash when they get it

3295540
getter	setter
has properties whose getter and setter are just methods with certain names like say getfoo is the getter for the foo property and

3295540
instances	transient
chief among them is that all instances fields must be either primitive types int bool etc instances of some class that is also serializable or marked as transient so that java won t try to include them

3295541
gif	png	gif	ico	gif	bmp	bmp	png	tiff	png	tiff	bmp	tiff	ico	png	ico
supported types are bmp gif ico jpeg png and tiff

3295556
spaces	delimiter
if you set it to be delimiter by spaces assuming your words are separated by spaces this will make it so that each word occupies its own cell

3295592
nsstring	nsdata
the array representation in the file identified by apath must contain only property list objects nsstring nsdata nsarray or nsdictionary objects

3295616
width	height
either the height or the width but not both

3295669
rss	feed
the app simply downloads and displays recent news stories from the google news rss feed

3295694
sproutcore	cappuccino
desktop apps are built with frameworks that are of the same quality as those from sproutcore cappuccino etc

3295720
irc	telnet
3d games could be supported in more then one way harder to do apps like telnet or irc could be done in java

3295752
stdout	stderr
this has the advantage of writing stdout and stderr to a file

3295753
post	put
posting a message works fine through an ajax controller with a route of ajax post put which matches

3295773
xdebug	xhprof
check out xhprof or xdebug profile your code then start optimizing

3295794
width	height
it starts with a width and height of zero and expands when a toggle button is clicked notice the eventtrigger that ties the slide-out animation to the unchecked event of the togglebutton

3295801
aptana	radrails	vim	textmate	textmate	aptana	textmate	radrails
a good ide editor is useful common ones are textmate with bundles aptana radrails vim with plugins

3295825
getter	setter
if you have a property you must have a synthesize or you declare dynamic and write the getter and setter method yourself

3295857
google-chrome	firefox
for me this works perfectly in firefox 3.6 google-chrome 5 and ie 8 with and without doctype which i d suggest you also add for many reasons

3295863
getter	setter
by declaring the property as dynamic you are telling the compiler that the property getter and setter if required are implemented elsewhere potentially at runtime

3295920
versioning	upgrade
upgrade seamlessly to the new versioning

3295922
.htaccess	httpd.conf
or if you re using mod_python they need to be set up in the .htaccess or apache s httpd.conf

3295956
jstl	taglib
jsp is just a view technology providing a template to write html css js in and the ability to interact with backend java code using el and taglib like jstl

3295975
post	put
post or maybe put to create change resources

3295984
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
works in firefox and ie but safari and google-chrome don t seem to like it

reiserfs obsolete really awesome for lookups zfs xfs and ntfs all have fantastic hashing algorithms linux ext4 looks promising too

3304651
min	max
for my example i ll be using a min of 20 000 and a max of 20 000 000 for output because that s what i needed when i sat down to figure this out

3304651
min	max
since i am basically going to increase by 1000 times from min to max i want 10 3 so my slider is going to be 0-3 10 0 evaluates to 1

integer	unsigned
pointers can be negative like an unsigned integer can be negative

3304856
folder	directory
you mostly need to reference various dlls in the bin directory of the resharper folder then you can get started playing around

int	chars
and compiling as c++ will give a different result unless you re using an unusual platform where int and chars are the same size

implements	extends
in a concrete dao i m extends this trait like this setting the type and implements the methods removed all except the most important method

3309208
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
this might not actually switch back the orientation so if this alone doesn t work you might have to call setstatusbarorientation animated on uiapplication in your table view controller s viewwillappear or viewdidappear methods

the images should change from one to the other with a fadein fadeout effect

3310030
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

3310158
rss	feed
sites like the bbc would end up with rss feed several mb long if that were the case

3310186
inherited	properties
but perhaps there is a use case with nested inherited classes or perhaps where a get set might contain logic instead of just giving back the value of the properties although i would tend to keep properties strictly simple and let explicit methods do any logic getencodedpassword

3310229
mouseover	mouseenter
instead of mouseover which fires when entering the child element as well use mouseenter like this

3310229
mouseover	mouseenter
the mouseenter event differs from mouseover in the way it handles event bubbling

3310241
inherited	properties
perhaps there is a use case with nested inherited classes or perhaps where a get set might contain logic instead of just giving back the value of the properties

3310241
getter	setter
i personally use this even when i don t need logic on the getter or setter of a property

3310241
getter	setter
this gives you a public getter but keeps the setter private

3310289
range	median
this is called the range median query problem

3310289
range	median
the following paper might be relevant towards optimal range median

3310289
range	median
higher-dimensional range median

3310289
range	median
reduces a range median query to a

3310339
width	height
and by offsetwidth and offsetheight do you mean you want the width and height

3310339
width	height
use jquery s width and height methods

3310340
integer	unsigned
i am lead to believe that the size of a std string object is limited to size of an unsigned integer on the architecture of your system

3310358
implements	extends
you may find google reflections useful to find classes implements extends a certain interface superclass in the classpath

3310440
mongoid	mongomapper
if you can go with mongoid or mongomapper embedded versioned documents are sweet

3310464
draggable	droppable
it sounds like both controls use the jquery ui draggable and droppable widgets and that you have a preliminary approach

3310464
post	get
i would encourage you to post your code when you are done or if you get stuck along the way.

3310477
getter	setter
create a deep copy of mrootdata both in the getter and the setter

3310477
getter	setter
or remove the getter and setter altogether possibly together with moving data processing methods from other classes into the singleton where these can be properly guarded by mutexes

3310497
inherited	properties
basically every properties of a parametersbase derived class that inherited from type parametersbase is recursed into and flattened into a single list of parameters

3310501
int	chars
i have another function b and it takes a chars and returns an int and a function c that accepts int and returns a bool

3310501
boost	stl
i know boost bind works but i am looking for stl solution

3310548
draggable	droppable
but i ve gone away from draggable droppable and simply want the user to click the button and have it duplicated in the other list

3310551
google-chrome	firefox
the following code works with internet explorer 8 and firefox 3.6 but not with google-chrome 5

3310582
hide	show
hide the content you don t want when you are on the screen and show it for printing

3310643
opera	firefox
i want a simple solution which be compatible with at least ie firefox opera

3310648
put	get
even though i put it into the footertemplate you should be able to get the point

3310704
pull	push
once you ve verified that the users can push pull properly with the new remote you can delete the copy from the old machine

3310737
boost	stl
when a function should take a shared_ptr from boost or c++11 stl are you passing it

3310790
jstl	taglib
use tag of the jstl core taglib

3310790
jstl	taglib
use fn escapexml function of the jstl functions taglib

3310796
super	extends
also seems like you should be using extends in the generics instead of super unless i m just misunderstanding what you re trying to do

3310799
post	get
a form on the get version of the page with method post will result in the post version getting called

3310819
subclipse	visualsvn
cannot connect subclipse to visualsvn on windows 7

3310857
post	get
pure http - using get and post - this may be badly extensible

3310874
width	margin
check your header footer to make sure that nothing is wider than your page width and check that there are no elements which extend into the left or right margin

3310957
mvp	presenter
in a gui app using mvp mvvm say the presenter viewmodel presents a list collection and one or more of the items can be selected at a time

3310961
versioning	upgrade
if you experience this issue after upgrading to nunit 2.5.5 then you will need to upgrade nant to the latest versioning for me it was .91 alpha

3310979
affinity	processors
on windows you can use setthreadaffinitymask to set the processors affinity for a thread

3310999
cpu	affinity
in windows for example you can do that in the task manager by locating the process in the processes tab rightclicking the process in question usually java.exe choosing set affinity and tick the cpu s cores

3311031
try-catch	exception-handling
without the try-catch block the exception-handling propagates out of main where terminate is called

3311041
printf	getchar
it just execute the getchar prior the printf loop

3311078
serializable	deserialization
serializable deserialization of the whole class that contains the gui

3311134
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i don t know about ios4 but it matters if you put the code in viewdidload vs viewwillappear

3311221
submit	submission
when submission a form with extjs i can see the form items have values with this code just before the submit

3311249
hide	show
the special one uses some custom css from here to hide the calendar part so only the month years show up

3311255
getter	setter
if logging.config.fileconfig some.log is the setter what s the getter

3311257
google-chrome	firefox
i have a horizontal cfmenu inside of a div and in ie7 ie7 firefox google-chrome the menu is floated to the right as specified in my css but in ie6 the menu shifts to the left of the div that contains it and it s width expands beyond the boundaries of the containing div

3311261
mouseleave	mouseenter
but if i have a photo inside photo div which on mouseenter will be replaced with the flash movie everything brakes the movie isn t loaded properly and it isn t replaced promptly with fff on mouseleave

3311283
ienumerable	idictionary
i want to create a read-only keyed collection that implements idictionary k v and ienumerable v

3311283
idictionary	ilist
one thought that comes to mind is providing members that return the desired view of the data member x.list ilist v and member x.dict idictionary k v

3311337
ubuntu	debian
if using ubuntu lucid use the tutorial here which is based on the debian package

3311346
firefox	safari
no big deal - this is an internal app and i can tell people to use firefox or ie but i know that some of them do use safari

3311350
ienumerable	iqueryable
i believe the asenumerable just tells the compiler which extension methods to use in this case the ones defined for ienumerable instead of those for iqueryable

3311393
goto	break
i would never use a goto as the target of another goto so if there s some additional processing at the end of the function use break exit for otherwise just return early

3311432
int	double
but because the nodes don t use int double etc

3311508
width	height
public images logo.png width 338px height 63px div

3311508
width	height
public images banner.png width 994px height 212px

3311508
width	height
public images stopka.png width 992px height 34px

3311599
ubuntu	linux
when i push the app to my linux production server ubuntu running apache2 nginx pdb it no longer works on the site

3311646
hide	show
if your setup is more complex you might want to create a list of fields that should be visible for each item in your combo box and then show hide using the same technique

3311647
width	margin
if i put a position relative on your id main-inner and either on the id content i change the left margin from 240px to 239px or change the id sidebar-left width from 240px to 239px it seems to work

3311745
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the firefox or mozilla plugin will be used by all mozilla based browsers firefox google-chrome safari and you will therefore be able to use the same javascript to detect the firefox plugin in all of these browsers and therefore determine whether your plugin custom protocol application is installed

3311788
implements	extends
i have not found a lot of times when implements an interface would be a better system than extends a superclass

3311791
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
if you must have an open-source .net ide you have two choices that i m aware of monodevelop and sharpdevelop

3311831
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
if you only want to inherited method signatures name arguments return type in the subclassing use an interface but if you also want to inherited implementation code use a superclass

3311904
centos	linux
we have a few linux based centos virtual machines which are to be used as distributable virtual appliances

3311930
children	parent	inherited	properties
if #parent of any generation back says all my children who meet qualification x in your case span are going to be given an inherited of y whatever css properties it doesn t matter what the single individual #child wants it needs the authority of the #parent to get it if the parent has stated otherwise

3311951
inherited	properties
i think that interfaces work best when you use them to express that the object has a certain properties or behavior that spans multiple inherited trees and is only clearly defined for each class

3311951
comparator	comparable	inherited	properties
if you wanted to create a class comparable to be extended by other classes it would have to be very high on the inherited tree possible right after object and the properties it expresses is that two objects of that type can be compared but there s no way to define that generally you can t have an implementation of comparator directly in the comparable class it s different for every class that implements it

3311965
hide	show
when i click the currently displayed div i want to hide it and show the other one

3311989
ssl	https
if you start with a trusted https website you can make cross-domain tls ssl xmlhttprequests to the web servers that are running your application

3311999
width	height
flexible width and height on the other hand work as you would expect

3312022
subclass	abstract-class
you then subclass that abstract-class to provide the concrete implementations for a and b

3312033
superclass	subclassing
i use very little subclassing because it tightly couples the subclassing to the superclass and makes your code really hard to read

3312038
folder	directory
a copy of the folder in the directory with copies of the files placed in their original places in the original directory

3312042
hide	show
each input or set of inputs should be in it s own tag and you can then use the element.style.display property of the tag to show hide the inputs as described in the other answers

3312064
inherited	properties
i ve created a base class from which all business objects inherited but i am not able to figure out how to fill individual object properties from a common method

3312074
public	protected
groovy won t add accessors if the member is declared with an access modifier private protected or public

3312084
getter	setter
the first thing i see is that the getter and setter is not public

3312089
abstract-class	superclass
you can think of extends from a superclass if the derived class is of the same type.i mean that when a class extends an abstract-class they both should be of the same type the only difference being that the superclass has a more general behavior and the sub class has a more specific behavior

3312104
put	get
if you get 3 data sources as csv files and want to put them into three different object models and maybe persist them into a database you could create a csv transformer base and then override some methods when you inherit from it in order to handle the different specific objects

3312106
vsto	add-in
i have a vsto word add-in i ve been developing for awhile

3312108
rss	feed
then they can all be thrown to an rss feed easily to provide lists of things on your web page

3312147
stdout	fflush
based on the symptom of output not appearing on the terminal i suggested that you add fflush stdout prior to the getchar call

3312147
stdout	fflush
i just guessed that your printf output was going into a buffer and that calling fflush stdout would cause that buffer to be sent to the terminal solving your symptom

3312164
pop-up	dialog
when the user pushes a button the dialog pop-up with a form-editing screen in the iframe

3312217
put	get
i don t care how a list adds removes elements so long as i can call add something and get 0 to put and get elements

3312224
rss	feed
i m trying to write some xsl to style an rss feed

3312274
width	height
it removes the standard take picture etc buttons and replaces it with a black bar with the same width height of the default overlay

3312299
min	max
ps also note that in many database engines apart from mysql it is illegal to use a group by clause and then selecting columns without aggregating them via functions like min max or count

3312300
fiddler	charles
the real thing is that you can t hide anything from a sniffer like fiddler wireshark charles so a dynamic token is probably the only way to go resorting to https amf and anything palliative for securing the transport layer will just be an extra as your primary token would still be in the clear.

3312305
superclass	subclassing
if a class depends on a method of a superclass and the superclass changes the implementation of that method in some release the subclassing may break

3312310
folder	directory
i have an image named 5.jpg that has been put in a sub-folder that is in every folder in a directory

3312362
int	chars
the code works fine as long as sortvalue is an int labelid is an int as well or int separated by the delimiter chars sortvalue 420|421| compares against 420 and 421

3312362
int	chars
no problem when the string results were guaranteed to contain only numeric chars but sql refuses to cast understandably the non-numeric string to an int throwing out an error

3312388
hash	md5
i create a md5 hash from a salt.data1.data2

3312388
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
the z in your explanation becomes the md5 hash calculated from salt + data1 + data2.

3312394
width	height
i am trying to set the top gridview s column s width to the body s column width and then the left columns height to the body s coloumns height

3312399
jquery	simplemodal
i ve used one jquery plugin actually simplemodal plugin in my page

3312402
hash	salt
hash and salt

3312402
hash	salt
if your only goal is to verify the originality of x and y you can create a salt hash out of the two values

3312402
hash	salt
this means that you re taking x y and a salt password known by both the server and the client and create a hash out of it

3312442
accessor	properties
my implementation of inotifypropertychanged was pretty stock just fired the event from the setter of the properties accessor with a string value containing the respective properties name

3312442
button	checkbox
if i comment out the event notification code in the property set for the boolean propery being set by the aforementioned bulk-edit button the hang goes away entirely and the grid is snappy again -- but i sacrifice the grid updates the checkbox column cells do not update.

3312457
free	malloc
you will need a pointer that will hold the value returned by malloc so that you can free it later

3312492
inherited	properties
inherited seems to pop up mostly when i m storing collections of things where the different kinds of things will have data properties in common

3312560
post	get
i need to get the client-side instance of a radcombobox or the newly-selected value of a radcombobox when my radgrid is leaving edit mode so i can post back the changed value to the server

3312616
google-chrome	safari
webkit 5 safari google-chrome

3312635
hex	binary
you can flip between decimal and binary and hex and perform bitwise operations including or and xor etc

3312668
inherited	properties
the reason this does not exist is because what would end up happening is you implement this and then when you go to fill in the t you should create a class with strongly typed unambiguous properties that acts as the data bag for your event arg but halfway through implementing that you realize there s no reason you don t just make that class inherited from eventargs and call it good

3312721
getter	setter
when i use the generator for getter and setter methods in a class the functions are named

3312724
post	get
i want the user to select some options and then have jquery post the options to get the new price

3312752
mouse	keyboard
i need to be able to detect mouse activity clicks move as well as keyboard activity

3312769
cassini	iis
i m trying to config a wcf service for silverlight to use either http or https and it works fine with iis but not the web server built into visual studio cassini

3312769
cassini	iis
this works great with iis but not cassini

3312799
mouse	keyboard
you can set up a hook to monitor among others keyboard and mouse events

3312799
mouse	keyboard
in particular there are only two that you can use the low-level keyboard and mouse hooks known as wh_keyboard_ll and wh_mouse_ll

3312855
uiview	subviews
in the loadview method of the view controller class allocate and initalize the uiview object and add your text fields to it as subviews

3312855
uiview	subviews
at the end of the method allocate and initalize the uiscrollview object then add the uiview to the uiscrollview as a subviews

3312949
post	get
check out the blog post at the end of the readme to get a more in-depth explanation of how it works

3312986
post	get
check out the blog post at the end of the readme to get a more in-depth explanation for how it works

3312996
gif	png
the other ones i wouldn t know right now but the big 3 jpeg gif png usually cover 99

3312999
onfocus	onblur
i am working with some simple jquery to add onfocus onblur events to a generated form

3313023
folder	directory
i had to replace my cv cvaux cvcore and highgui libraries with the debug versions they may have to be built depending on which version of opencv you are running check your lib folder in your opencv directory

3313030
width	height
i m trying to make a div with a static height and variable width

3313038
superclass	subclassing
in the standard insertion pattern you have a machine generated superclass and then a human written subclassing

3313038
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
automatic alterations of the machine class are transparently inherited by the human-written class see mogenerator for a good objective-c example of this. in the reverse insertion pattern you would have a human-written superclass and then the machine generated with macro expansion subclassing

3313050
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
hi have the following flash object placed in html flash seems to be rendering good in firefox google-chrome safari but not in any version of ie

3313056
post	get
the blazehtml tutorial and other blog post make it very clear how to get string literals to work

3313059
put	get
i ve put in hackish solutions namely putting in a flag that is checked upon request completion but it would be much nicer to get a global stop all outstanding requests function

3313095
google-chrome	firefox
i ve seen thin is firefox 3.6 and google-chrome 5

3313102
internationalization	localization
internationalization and localization wikipedia

3313107
swt	styledtext
i need to display a set of strings which contains characters from gb18030 set in a swt styledtext field

3313127
google-chrome	firefox
when attempting to listen to any .wav file in firefox or google-chrome in ubuntu haven t tested other oses yet the plugin errors location not found. however right-clicking and choosing save link as allows the user to download the .wav file

3313153
children	parent
here i d like to find some potential errors in the file a children doesn t have any mutation from his parent using drools

3313155
width	height
the biggest thing that +imagenamed does is decode the image data from the source file which almost always significantly inflates the data size for example a screen sized png file might consume a few dozen kbs when compressed but consumes over half a mb decompressed - width height 4

3313187
post	put
however when i add or update a record the json produced for the post put has the data nested under a root field

3313232
getter	setter
before auto properties were around people would implement the getter and omit the setter for properties which are meant to be read-only

3313279
public	protected
the theory is that someone extending your class with protected access knows more about what they are doing than someone who is merely using it with public access

3313282
d3.js	protovis
the team behind protovis has since created d3.js so this is likely a better option than protovis

3313378
mvp	presenter
in an mvp pattern if your model exposes some properties for your presenter i would write

3313416
addclass	removeclass
i believe you re looking for addclass and removeclass

3313427
min	max
with more complex data types the set can be ordered with some other key that can be unrelated to the min max values

3313443
base-class	derived-class	inherited	base-class	inherited	derived-class
imho the primary reason to use inherited is to allow code which was written to operate upon a base-class object to operate upon a derived-class object instead

3313458
getter	setter
here s the uservo without the getter setter

3313513
width	height
for example i used to try and get the screen height and width in the oncreate but it doesn t work because it s not set up yet

3313566
width	height
width 530 height 410 id usa_locator align

3313566
width	height
xmlfile1 app_themes theme1 usa_locator.xml quality high wmode transparent bgcolor #f5f5f5 width 530 height 410 name usa_locator align

3313598
folder	directory
i can see website when i have the plugins directory not named plugins which changing it to any name will not show up in the wp system since it requires a folder by that name

3313679
gif	png	docx	xlsx	tiff	png
i developed a mass file up loader a swing application recently.one of the new requirements is to support uploading thousands of documents gif jpg png docx xlsx each of these are like 3mb-10mb of size and we don t want to upload these huge files we generally support tiff files which has small byte size like 60kb-100kb

3313727
client-side	server-side
but javascript is for client-side code only and should not be used for server-side for security reasons and you could use ajax jquery to retrieve and send data to server but that depends on your needs and application

3313731
stdout	stderr
change the destination of the stdout using system#setout and eventually also the stderr

3313731
stdout	stderr
this will redirect all stdout stderr to tomcat s logfile

3313731
stdout	stderr
using stdout stderr instead of logger is a poor practice

3313731
stdout	stderr
replace all stdout stderr calls by a fullworthy logger like the currently legacy log4j or its successor slf4j which gives you a high degree of freedom in configuring the logged information logging destination logging format etcetera

3313774
ocl	uml
the benefit of defining ocl constraints on your models is the possibility of specifying all the business rules of your domain that you cannot represent with the graphical constructs of the uml for instance multiplicities are constraints that can be graphically represented as part of an association definition saying that the attribute a of class c has to be greater than 5 is also a constraint but in this case has to be defined in ocl since uml does not provide a graphical syntax for this

3313799
width	height
you need to retrieve the canvas image data using the method getimagedata x y width height and then modify each pixel with values from your byte array

3313813
width	height
we def need some code but perhaps you re not setting the parent objects to some height or width

3313904
int	boolean
on some platforms with no built-in boolean datatype the int constant that serves as a logical true is -1 - all one bits

3313911
hide	show
#front and #back and a div for toggling which div is displayed in the foreground.the effect i am after is not a show and hide as both divs are displayed at the same time but only one can be in the foreground

3313996
folder	directory
to do this decided to turn my home folder into a git directory and ignore everything except for a few select files and directory

3314113
hash	md5
this is for the purpose of having a nice short url which refers to an md5 hash in a database

3314142
folder	directory
the only problem is the -i flag which installs the compiled module into the modules directory of apache requires root or administrator privileges to access that folder

3314228
inherited	properties
if you don t want to use inherited for some reason you can keep one object inside the other and redirect calls to the other s properties from the outer object dynamically via magic methods like __get and __set see here

3314237
mouseleave	mouseenter
we re using mouseenter and mouseleave because these are the events that .hover binds to

3314241
move	drag
ultimately i want to be able to create a drag and drop interface where users can move files between catalogs of any format

3314242
portrait	landscape
obviously on portrait view fewer slides can fit in per row than on landscape view

3314288
textchanged	keyup
i would recommend binding an event handler to the textchanged event that invokes the keyup event

3314322
hash	md5
basically you have 16-bytes of data in the md5 hash string

3314331
int	chars
and you still can t store that number in a plain 32-bit int - if you drop to 5 chars you once again reduce the space to just under one billion 916 132 832 but now you have something that can fit in a signed 32-bit int albeit it is somewhat wasteful

3314351
cvs	svn
doing this in svn or worse yet cvs would mean pain and suffering

3314369
put	get
similarly if you want each property to belong to only one category you can put a propertyid column in the category table and get rid of the categoryproperty table

3314389
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade cucumber to versioning 0.8.5 but i m getting some unexpected errors with authlogic

3314465
textview	imageview
it displays imageview and textview but two textview are absolutely the same

3314538
hide	show
then it is only a matter of running jquery s show or hide functions on your selected elements

3314541
google-chrome	firefox
but with firefox google-chrome the following is printed

3314546
put	get
actually i usually get a little fancier and put the three groups into their own components

3314550
rss	feed
right i m working on a site with a couple different rss feed

3314557
opera	firefox
when looking at it in ie opera and firefox the actual image looks fine

3314599
implements	extends
extends classes can choose how to implements the abstract methods while they also have the partial implementation provided by the superclass

3314599
implements	extends
java allows only single implementation inheritance whereas it allows multiple interface inheritance meaning that a class can implements multiple interfaces but can extends only one class

3314599
implements	extends	subclass	abstract-class
so choosing a pure abstract-class over the interface will mean that the subclass will not be allowed to extends any other class while implements the abstract methods

3314640
min	max
what if i changed one min to a max

3314650
min	max
i m not sure what you mean by destroying record integrity but there is nothing wrong with calling min or max functions

3314658
mouseover	mouseout
i also tried separating them into mouseover and mouseout events and they don t work as well

3314661
pull	push
you could set up your empty repository on your server and then push and pull from your dev machine

3314670
for-loop	loops
there s absolutely no reason to use a foreach loops instead of a for-loop if i understand your situation

3314674

jruby	mri
n sort which is written in c in mri and yarv and java in jruby

3318237
for-loop	loops
just rerun the same for-loop in servlet as you did in jsp you truly know loops conditions and do request.getparameter i on every iteration and if necessary add every parameter value to a so that you can easily process it afterwards

3318274
firefox	safari
it s a css3-only feature that only firefox and safari have implemented so far as far as i know

3318306

i am developing a servlet application i was using jwebunit to check all the basic responses but now i have to start using other http methods different to get post put and delete

3318347

client-side	server-side
since the ids weren t being generated server-side as far as i could tell although admittedly i didn t try roatin s solution because i had thought of mine before i saw his answer + mine seemed simpler since i m already doing a bunch of stuff client-side inside javascript i looked around to see what i was already getting and realized that was already getting me an extremely similar value to what i was already looking for only instead of it saying sunlocale it said sunactivity

3318485
cpu	processors
retrieving a dword at an address which isn t divisible by 4 requires at least one extra cpu cycle on a 32 bit processors

3318558
perl	tcl
currently it supports python perl jruby lua javascript beanshell and tcl

3318574
client-side	server-side
or do you already know how you can accomplish this but you re having trouble getting the control via server-side or client-side code so that you can set the maxlength property

3318623
getter	setter
self.bar uses property syntax to access the bar ivar by calling the getter setter methods -bar and -setbar on self

oncreate	ondestroy
the only way i could think of fixing it was using an static instance count that would be incremented when the activities oncreate and decrement when the ondestroy was called

3318794
textview	imageview
you just need to replace the imageadapter by textadapter and put textview in it instead of imageview

3318806

you can use the right tools firefox google-chrome opera to inspect which part of your code is playing tricks with you

3318863
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
now the problem is that - according to the man page - realloc needs a pointer which has been returned by malloc or calloc before

3318863
free	malloc
that s even worse than to expect them to provide a malloc d pointer which would imply that the caller has to free it

3318891
pull	push
set your default path for pull to . to prevent accidentally pushing to the wrong tracking branch when hg push is invoked with no arguments

3318936
realloc	malloc

3319096
hide	show
i ve followed the code from an online sample and it s similar to a lot of the other online examples but when i run it the popup panel will quick show then then hide again

3319304
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
one strategy that may or may not be worth the effort ime it isn t is to hide malloc realloc and free behind some kind of memory manager that keeps track of allocated pointers and sizes

3319307
free	malloc
for this reason i would avoid the high frequency use of malloc and free and add the extra complexity of a freelist

3319319
disk	ram
ram and a fast hard disk in this case

3319341
vbscript	vba
some colleagues and i were comparing past languages we had programmed in and were talking about our experience with vbscript with its odd features such as 1-based index instead of 0-based indexes like almost every other language has the reasoning being that it was a language for users excel vba instead of a language for developers

int	chars
unsigned int find_mismatch unsigned chars a unsigned chars b

3319430
accessor	properties
but yes properties accessor are normally heavily optimized

3319495
singleton	facade
a good example of this is the facade that is facades can be implemented as singleton because often one facade object is needed across the system

3319525
filtering	grouping	sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping
filtering sorting and grouping

3319527
put	get
i ve put breakpoints on my property set get and they never get hit at all

3319581
mbunit	nunit
it is not as easy to use as nunit mbunit but it seems to work pretty well

3319717
int	chars
ideally it would also work for regular types as well like chars and int in addition to bitfields

3319723
free	malloc
if memory is never free malloc will tend to run pretty fast

3319723
free	malloc
if many blocks of memory are used and free malloc may become quite slow

3319781
google-chrome	firefox
i am building a new input method as an extension of firefox google-chrome

3319801
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
what s happening is that when you resize the column row width height with the gridsplitter it sets the actualheight or actualwidth of the column row

3319826
cstdio	iostream
if it s possible to use cstdio instead of iostream then you can

3319834
postgresql	mysql
php is certainly being helped by the fact that mysql and postgresql to a smaller extent have become so much more powerful

3319911
post	get
all data that gets transmitted including get and post data is encrypted

3319924
typedef	struct
typedef struct mem_info void ptr

3319951

unix	solaris
development happens on unix servers should run on hp-ux solaris at least

3320062
firefox	safari
it may be safari or firefox etc

3320106
bazaar	git
if it s purely a matter of perception - that they perceive git to be too complex try suggesting mercurial or bazaar - they might not be familiar enough with them to have formed an inaccurate preconception

3320108
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
in ie google-chrome safari it honors the line breaks a bit more strictly than say firefox or opera

3320111
jobs	cron
for example we have both cron jobs and on-demand offline tasks backed by amqp which is similar to jms

3320134
profiler	aqtime
secondly aqtime contains many tools to help you including a resource profiler that can keep the links between where the code that created the resources is and how it was called along with counts of the total numbers of handles

3320291
width	height
it s not guaranteed to work according to the specifications for setminimumx since the width and height are still dependent on the parent view but it should work pretty well for almost every situation

3320320
pdostatement	bindvalue
warning pdostatement bindvalue pdostatement.bindvalue sqlstate hy093 invalid parameter number parameter was not defined in long file path on line 39

3320323
irc	nntp
you can have a jabber bot that will take commands and post to an irc server email them to someone run a command read from an nntp server and monitor a web page for changes

3320324
width	height
i would size the advanceddatagrid to it s full height and width and let the canvas handle scrolling

3320333
put	get
probably the best answer you re going to get is to put your binary files into a separate directory and use the spare directory features to manage them - ie do not check out the files until you need them

3320381
oncreate	onstart
if the service is killed and then restarted it s oncreate is called but not onstart

3320381
oncreate	onstart
so you can for example add call to onstart from oncreate to make it behave like the runkeeperservice

3320405
proficy	historian
on my machine it is stored as c program files ge fanuc proficy historian docs ihistorian.chm and i have version 3.5 installed

3320422
firefox	safari
i have verified the behavior in both safari and firefox on a connection with negligible latency

3320441
profiling	instrumentation
the real secret here is that you need good instrumentation profiling in order to be frugal with your complexity adding optimization s

3320472
equals	gethashcode
note that this assumes that windowsidentity overrides equals and gethashcode appropriately - or that you re happy with reference type equality

3320479
getter	setter
note that i use reflection to get all the properties on type t and filter to the properties that have both getter and setter

3320574
bindparam	bindvalue
i don t bother with using bindparam or bindvalue

3320605
udp	tcp
it seems boost asio defines a separate endpoint class for each protocol which is irritating if you want to perform both udp and tcp operations on a particular endpoint have to convert from one to the other

3320605
udp	tcp
i d always just thought of an endpoint as an ip address v4 or v6 and the port number regardless of tcp or udp

3320605
udp	tcp
couldn t both tcp socket and udp socket accept something like ip endpoint

3320607
pop-up	dialog
so i m trying to make my 3 radio buttons each pop-up with a different dialog box using jquery

3320650
vim	emacs
use vim or emacs since they will offer you speed

3320675
sorting	filtering
views will handle any data manipulation like filtering and sorting you might want to do

3320705
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i have a problem on my page with code executing multiple times in ie and opera though it works in firefox google-chrome and safari

3320722
cvs	svn
it s not the sexy distributed source control that all the cool kids are using but and this is the reason i am suggesting it svn should be an easy migration from cvs

3320722
cvs	svn
there are utilities out there to migrate your code from cvs to svn but not without some pain

3320730
firefox	safari
this worked on ie7-8 firefox and safari

3320730
inherited	properties
apparently the visibility properties acts on the element and unlike opacity propagates to the child elements by inherited so that if one explicitly sets a child element visibility it no longer inherited the hidden but uses its own setting of visible and the fact that the wrapper is hidden does not matter

3320857
equals	gethashcode
msdn gives a good set of instructions on how to implement equals and gethashcode

3320860
keydown	keyup
when this property is set to true the form will receive all keypress keydown and keyup events

3320866
equals	gethashcode
equals the gethashcode methods for the

3320879
ubuntu	linux
i use ubuntu server on my linux box and here are the tutorial i have used

3320888
put	get
i haven t found a way to do this on android it seems like the only way to get accelerometer readings is to put a listener that can listen at different intervals

3320901
google-chrome	firefox
i have run into the exact opposite problem in firefox and google-chrome

3320901
google-chrome	firefox
edit i have just corrected persistence problems i was having with firefox google-chrome by adding these php lines to my page

3320908
pull	push
i did a 4 part blog post on this that gets you up and running from scratch with iis including active directory integration setting up of security privileges for push pull customization of the template i d reproduce it here but it s quite long winded being that mercurial was really designed to be hosted on linux apache

3320922
keydown	keyup
i typed all that out only to realize i should have been handling keydown instead of keyup

3320922
keydown	keyup
keyup obviously fires after the keydown of the textbox even though it does fire before the keyup of the textbox

3320927
post	get	pull	push
there s a pretty good post at that ll get you started but if you need more detail or to go further than the writer did i ve got a 4 part blog post that covers everything you need to know about getting up and running on iis including active directory integration pull push privileges customization of the ui

3320935
aggregate-functions	sum
in my opinion this belongs to the aggregate-functions like avg and sum

3320972
udp	tcp
see man 7 udp or man 7 tcp for more information i m assuming linux since you didn t tag your question

3320972
udp	tcp
to solve your problem extract the ip and port from a tcp endpoint and instantiate a udp endpoint

3320978
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is no result when i start with table for looping i have multiple tables and have no id for the table. when i use tr it works well in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

3320986
submit	submission
submit the paypal information using their apis rather than submission a form directly to them

3321000
viewdidload	didreceivememorywarning
fixed by persisting state in the didreceivememorywarning method and loading from state in the viewdidload method

3321029
serializable	deserialization
i m writing some serializable deserialization code in python that will read write an inheritance hierarchy from some json

3321049
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i want to create different style sheets for the different browsers firefox google-chrome ie opera safari etc.. and specify which one to use from the master page

3321053
ienumerable	ienumerator
use a custom implementation of ienumerable and ienumerator

3321064
switching	screens
using the mvc pattern you d have a different view for when you switching screens and the variables you pass into it could be passed into the new view s controller and stored as members of that class

3321155
folder	directory
the only thing i can think of right now is i could name all platform packages exactly the same package name serial.connector with the same filenames and place them in different folder in the project archive and then upon compilation specify the directory libraries to look in for the files with -i argument and change directory names for different platforms

3321199
button	checkbox
basically users select multiple checkbox and then hits a button that executes ajax processing of their selections

3321206
vim	textmate
make sure you create this file using an editor that allows for unix formatting like pspad or vim textmate etc. using notepad will give you a parsing error - it has something to do with invisible end of file characters clrf

3321209
createfile	deviceiocontrol
you will have to use the windows api methods directly p invoke createfile deviceiocontrol etc

3321310
implements	extends
very easy to use just extends one of the existing ga classes and implements your fitness function

3321408
vim	emacs
i once tried emacs but i was already pretty familiar with vim so i didn t really have any incentive to get good at emacs

3321422
vim	emacs
as a novice programmer i just find vim s use of modes more appealing than the keyboard combinations used in emacs

3321428
vim	emacs
i tried emacs for a while and then vim and decided to stay with vim

3321428
vim	emacs
the reason was that in emacs you constantly had to use shift ctrl alt which was uncomfortable compared to vim

3321459
postgresql	mysql
anyway you solution will break in mysql and postgresql when foreign-key constraints are involved and if there aren t any you might get troubles with the sequences

3321486
width	height
two double data fields named width and height that specify the width and height of the rectangle

3321486
width	height
a no-arg constructor that creates a default rectangle with width 1 and height 1

3321486
width	height
a constructor that creates a rectangle with the specified width and height

3321486
width	height
assign width 4 and height 40 to the first object and width 3.5 and height 35.9 to the second

3321488
vim	emacs
now i use vim and still wish that emacs wasn t so painful physically and figeratively to use

3321505
int	double
wrapper.dll has a function called startacquisition int string double int

3321509
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
with ie finally getting its act together with ie 9 google s google-chrome and other safari like browsers coming along nicely and firefox rock stable as always is this an issue i need to worry about

3321563
opera	firefox
in some regions opera is the top 3 browser not too far behind ie and firefox for example russia so you should care about opera if you don t want to lose customers

3321580
minimum	max
a series of functions generate varying number of data frames minimum of 1 and a max of 11

3321648
maven	pom.xml
i personally didn t bind it to a phase since i don t want deployment to happen on every invocation of maven and didn t intend on writing another pom.xml profile to handle invoking the plugin

3321680
width	height	integer	unsigned
as a trivial example a very primitive bitmap image format could start with one unsigned 32-bit integer representing the width of the bitmap and then one more such integer representing the height of the bitmap

3321680
decoder	encoder
if you havn t been working with file formats before i would suggest that you learn a very simple format such as the windows 3 bitmap format and write your own bmp encoder decoder programs that creates and reads bmp files from scratch and displays the read bmp files

3321692
floating-point	integer
the computation may be done either by floating-point hardware or in software based on integer arithmetic

3321695
hide	show
problem i am trying to hide show elements of a page based on the language selected

3321714
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png
this could be an still image bmp png jpg etc icon animated gif etc

3321714
folder	directory
to include an image into your project you can simply drag it into one of the res drawable folder in your project directory in eclipse

3321776
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
when firefox google-chrome and ie would render websites opera and mobile phones would find their own errors

3321779
ddms	adb
you need to learn how to debug in eclipse and how to use the adb and ddms tools

3321780
mvp	presenter
depending on the flavor of mvp you would either have the presenter call a property on the view to pass it the selected index and your view would pass it to the control or the view takes the index from the model directly

3321807
put	get
if you can use a hierarchical query to get all of the related data and put it in one dataset i would recommend that

3321823
versioning	upgrade
i m using the following versioning and i m having the hardest time trying to figure out if i should upgrade

3321825
min	max
basically i set up a test to see which method is the fastest way to get data from another computer my network for a server with only a few clients 10 at max 1 at min

3321832
folder	directory
if you delete the folder from your local working directory it won t affect the version in the repository

3321838
post	get
i am writing a facebook app for iphone however when i send a request to post a comment i get the following error

3321850
post	get
this is known as the post redirect get pattern which mvc allows you to make use of it can be very effective

3321877
width	height
or does it scale according to the height width density of the phone

3321908
rss	feed
i am getting an html fragment from an rss feed and am attempting to load it into a uiwebview using the loadhtmlstring method

3321965
post	get
just make sure that the method get post is the same and the field names are the same

3322076
ddms	adb
also when you get application has stopped unexpectedly try again use adb logcat ddms or the ddms perspective in eclipse to examine the java stack trace associated with the error

3322258
debian	linux
works perfectly here with bash 4.1.5 under debian linux

3322270
put	get
i need this to repeat until i get to the end of the file but when i put this in a loop it craps out

3322276
g++	gcc
all i need is the way to transparently append -m64 to every gcc g++ call

3322302
git-svn	svn2git
git-svn will gives you a branches for each branches and tag in svn unless you use a ruby script like svn2git

3322302
pull	push
for the sake of simplicity and interoperating with a less-capable system svn it is recommended that all git svn users clone fetch and dcommit directly from the svn server and avoid all git clone pull merge push operations between git repositories and branches

3322331
hide	show
based on some condition i do need hide authenticateuser div tag and show forcetochangepassword div tag

3322331
fadein	fadeout
i really like the jquery fadein fadeout effect

3322331
fadein	fadeout
i tried to call javascript method from code behind that method has a fadein fadeout logic but it seems like that javascript method is never been called

3322344
public	protected
so you can mark the class as public protected internal or private

3322347
stdout	stderr
i m adding a feature to the c server when i can request it to fork run a new process via a socket and pass back stdin stdout stderr

3322380
fadein	fadeout
if you make any ajax request then you must have to call the function which handling fadein fadeout logic within the response callback function

3322431
mouse	keyboard
when i execute myvbs.vbs via mouse or keyboard enter command it works fine

3322434
hide	show
the above assumes that you re creating and destroying the respected s as you hide and show them

3322434
hide	show
if you need them to all exist in the source and you ll show and hide them you ll need something like the following

3322509
stdout	stderr
which forks detatches from the controlling terminal reopens all of stdin stdout stderr to dev null and changes the working directory to the root directory

3322581
width	height
i made a test i opened windows paint.exe made a surface of the windows width and height and black as filled color

3322582
onreadystatechange	onload
using the script block s onload and onreadystatechange handlers

3322602
calendar	gcal
i just download fullcalendar today and i ve been trying to combine the json calendar with the gcal

3322615
sorting	grouping
if your data is complex you could give jorder a try as it s designed to deal with fast search sorting grouping on the js side

3322628
implements	extends
i d create a custom class that extends textarea and implements your call to save the data right there

3322649
maven	cargo
the maven cargo plugin this a container agnostic plugin that now supports glassfish 3

3322677
floating-point	integer
for example the add method or + operator in the integer class might perform integer addition while the add method in the float class performs floating-point addition and the add method in the bignum class performs the correct operations for an arbitrary-size number

3322706
division	modulo
first of all you can t do i o in a sensible way without the basic operations division and modulo

3322706
division	modulo
fortunately you can implement division modulo by one word much more efficiently than when it comes to two bigint s

3322723
tunnel	vpn
note that i define proxied i mean using some kind of tunnel vpn ssh etc to another computer that does not share your ip address

3322755
tunnel	vpn
vpn is almost undetectable unless you re using a blacklist as all the traffic is routed through the tunnel not just http

3322759
fontfamily	font-size
you may also want to check out this discussion on determining the font being used changing body font-size based on fontfamily with jquery

3322795
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
firefox handles it just fine but safari google-chrome opera and ie all throw hissy fits

3322799
stdout	stderr
only relay stderr and not stdout

3322825
stdout	stderr
otherwise you ll need to redirect stdout to devnull and stderr to stdout

3322826
client-side	server-side
and location instead of having some code server-side and some browser client-side in different languages it s definitely an exciting technology

3322829
versioning	upgrade
i m using the following versioning and i m having the hardest time trying to figure out if i should upgrade

3322900
versioning	upgrade
the issue with displaying the site was caused by the wrong versioning of .net the server needed to be upgrade from 1.1 to support 2.0 3.0 and 3.5

3322922
hex	binary
however i cannot find a way to uncompress the hex data even if i convert it to a binary string with it still gives an error about wrong data

3322928
folder	directory
i copied the dll of the isapi in a folder and created a virtual directory in the iis of the server

3322942
fgets	getline
my suggestion is to dump fscanf_s and use either fgets or std getline

3322950
mef	linfu
for instance mef usually works by finding classes with the export annotation and linfu by finding classes with the implements annotation

3322959
int	boolean
from that perspective generating lots and lots of strings and computing hash codes on those strings seems like an expensive way to avoid an equals operation that consists of 3 int and 1 boolean comparison

3323006
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
so until you re confident that you re able to recognize valid nullpointerexception i d recommend to use illegalargumentexception when you want to tell to your api user that null is not a valid argument value

3323019
hash	hmac
you definitely don t want to try to combine a key with the hash in an amateurish way this has been broken already which is why we have hmac s

3323023
ant	maven
i ve implemented that behavior using a copy task with the ant plug-in on maven

3323025
hide	show
or if they can t hover and javascript is off setting a php session and reloading the page then inserting a style to the style tag at the end of the page which will overwrite the visibility and display according to whether the clicked to show or hide

3323037
put	get
my recommendation would be that if you have objects that are either cheap to copy or expensive to copy but don t get copied often put them into the container as a value

3323081
aggregate-functions	sum
i changed out total for sum which is more consistent with other databases sqlite aggregate-functions

3323097
queue	fifo
this could easily be implemented on an array or arraycollection as a fifo queue

3323139
django	turbogears
i am new to using frameworks for web development and i have noticed that frameworks like django turbogears etc come with auth packages which contains user models

3323153
ubuntu	linux
i d like to start using emacs but i want also a gui in which it will be available in windows ubuntu linux desktop and mac osx

3323161
config	ini
it asks you to create an ini file called crunksauce.ini i kid you not in the same directory as the executing script and contains config variables

3323196
jsf	wicket
many presentation frameworks support bean validation jsf 2.0 wicket spring mvc.

3323204
put	get
you will have to deliver the messages in the end via smtp i still suggest using your own from and put the sender in the reply-to unless these are corporate customers that you can get to add your smtp server to their spf records

3323207
firefox	safari
it removes it in safari but i m have no luck with firefox

3323208
prepare	execute
next we tell the prepare statement to run itself using the execute method passing an array of variables

3323208
prepare	execute
once again we prepare a query with placeholders then execute with the actual variables

3323232
google-chrome	safari
only popular browsers which allows the outline tag are safari and google-chrome not sure about linux browsers

3323282
subclass	abstract-class
it s an abstract-class so you ll need to derive your own concrete subclass es but that s easy enough

3323292
onclick	onsubmit
are you using an onclick instead of onsubmit

3323292
onclick	onsubmit
then the answer to this problem ...cannot get the form to submit when the return key is pressed is use onsubmit instead of onclick

3323347
sproutcore	cappuccino
kinda like ext-js and sproutcore but without the acidental complexity and lack of fluidity and more like cappuccino but without requiring a mac and the horrible load times from objective-j which also has no ide support

3323363
folder	directory
i currently have a c# program that goes through every folder and file and tries to copy the whole backup directory to a dated backup-backup directory which is how i discovered this problem in the first place

3323368
multiplying	add
once you have a number of hours add 15 and multiplying by your normal hourly rate

3323461
min	max
i use coercion to ensure that value remains between the min and max inclusive

3323483
children	parent
parent elements do not take the height of floated children

3323530
width	height
cgrects are not cpobjects but simply javascript objects with x y width and height members

3323531
margin	height
you could try setting a negative margin on the #large_div that was equal to the height of the h2

3323561
xna	spritebatch
in this version of xna you can easily specify your own vertex shader for spritebatch

3323561
xna	spritebatch
2 you could use a custom vertex shader with spritebatch in xna 3.1 it s just not as easy

3323576
google-chrome	firefox
take a look at this link inside firefox google-chrome browser content browser.xul

3323594
lisp	sml
if you look at a language like sml for example and compare it with lisp the functional core of each is almost identical

3323596
add-on	xpcom
the development of extensions or add-on is done in xul and xpcom i am assuming you did not mean plugins pardon me i am wrong and this answer then would be only half of what you want to know.

3323664
move	drag
i need to get the location updated when the user drag move zoom the mapview

3323689
free	malloc
you could use and instead of malloc and free here but i assume the only reason that you would do this is to inter-operate with c code

3323750
for-loop	loops
on your other question it is definitely necessary for you to know how to do a for-loop and believe me it isn t hard just like you need to know how to do a while loops

3323769
g++	gcc
using g++ in place of gcc should allow you to use c++ code

3323771
multiplying	add
i am currently using the cramer s rule method of solving the system and it works quite well it seems that my processor really likes add and multiplying operations it gets solutions in 1 microsecond despite the explicit equations being over 2 pages in length

3323794
subtract	add
it should convert it to a unix timestamp where you can add or subtract seconds to it etc

3323814
button	checkbox
specify a name for your database click the from device radio button and browse to your databasename.bak file make sure and select the checkbox after choosing your file

3323835
onkeyup	onmouseup
saveselection is attached to the onmouseup and onkeyup events of the div and saves the selection to the variable savedrange

3323835
onclick	onmousedown
to achieve this the onclick and onmousedown events are canceled by the function cancelevent which is a cross browser function to cancel the event

3323835
onfocus	onblur
the variable isinfocus stores whether it is in focus and is changed to false onblur and true onfocus

3323835
onclick	onmousedown
or similar then simply remove the onclick and onmousedown events

3323859
accessor	properties
typically dependency injection frameworks use attributes and reflection to discover which fields properties and methods of a class require dependencies to be injected at creation time and then use reflection to actually inject the dependencies - thus getting around the normal accessor restrictions - injecting into private fields for example

3323861
for-loop	loops
i do not have experience on your language but it seams to me you are using to nested loops one is for-loop another is repeat lope inside for loop.if so then my suggestion is you can use either loops with break statement

3323861
for-loop	loops
if you really want to use both loops then you have to use goto statement to come out of the for-loop

voip	sip
it seems there is something for apple open source voip sip objective-c code

3323904
put	get
one option would be to put the value main index#user profile 33 inside a hidden field and get the contents of this from your controller

3323922
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
firefox just provides far more access to its own internals and system to the extensions so its technically possible to do more with them than with opera widgets or google-chrome extensions

3323927
tapestry	struts	tapestry	stripes	tapestry	wicket	struts	stripes	struts	wicket	wicket	stripes
if your requirement is for a more traditional web application then compare click with struts stripes wicket tapestry etc

width	height
this can be achieved by dynamically loading the css based on iframe width and height

3323954
ubuntu	linux
i am on ubuntu linux and i could compile it

3323962

also learning the kill yanking keys will help you when using bash zsh shells and other old-school programs that welcome emacs users by implementing compatible keystrokes

3324008
firefox	safari
i want to update my entire site to use html5 through firefox safari flash for older browsers and hopefully for android and iphones

there is an object customer and it has among other two properties of type one property for password salt the second one for password hash

3324062
mouse	keyboard
i find that quite annoying because i m totally keyboard oriented and that is practically the only thing for which i have to use the mouse when in eclipse

3324087
nullpointerexception	illegalstateexception	nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception	illegalstateexception	illegalargumentexception
if the value you have to return is null then clearly the caller has either given you bad arguments illegalargumentexception you are not in a valid state illegalstateexception or some other much more meaningful exceptional condition has occurred other than nullpointerexception which usually indicates a programming error

3324089
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
its working fine in opera firefox and safari

3324113
viewdidload	viewwillappear
inside your viewcontroller in viewdidload or in viewwillappear try this

3324150
voip	sip
check siphon which is described as home of the world s first free sip voip application for iphone and ipod touch 1 and 2

3324195
for-loop	arrays
in my current c# project there is one place that still uses a traditional for-loop and that deals with shifting an arrays left and right to find the best match between two curves

3324195
for-loop	loops
i think eventually we will see the purpose of the traditional for-loop fade in preference for a foreach style loops

3324210
rss	feed
i am getting the html data from rss feed

3324214
post	get
after more detailed digging -- autogenned wsdl has different declarations for post get vs soap responses and the diff is that they just reference the autogenned elem type for array and not the whole response type elem which has new name

3324214
post	get
slightly different declarations for get post - misses the new name

3324259
feedback	review
the .net team review stuff like this based on consumer feedback - presumably enough people petitioned them to say the existing settings were incorrect so they changed them

3324260
jdom	dom4j
your rendering code could use the w3c dom apis directly or jdom dom4j etc to access access the metadata .

3324263
accessor	properties
for retained properties i have grown accustomed to a specific way of using the accessor methods to alloc initialize the actual ivars

3324385
flip	slide
depending on which revision of jqtouch that you are using you will need to add an animation class to your link like slide flip disolve in order to actually cause a transition from one psuedo page to the next

3324393
width	height
i think you need to specify elements width and height with this background image

3324487
post	get
that should help you get a feel for what it s like to post text to one s wall

3324515
robocopy	xcopy
for the second option you can use xcopy s or robocopy s

3324516
post	get
apparently default model binder is capable of binding from the url querystring parameters to the viewmodel on post so even if the textbox for slug is disabled it can get the value from the querystring

3324546
hash	md5
sig on the other hand is a md5 hash of all session data combined with your application s private key

3324572
folder	directory
that file wants a path to a file folder which it will move to another directory and will then return done if it successfully moved the file

3324634
width	height
so i m trying to find some ways to get actual size of loaded page then i can change height width of control or change scale of loaded page to fit it to the actual webcontrol control

3324701
codeigniter	cakephp
i know also there is some good php frameworks like codeigniter cakephp etc.

3324715
quicksort	heapsort
i don t see how we could apply quicksort and thing like heapsort require to know the index of the card within the deck

3324725
stdout	stderr
what i d like to do is similar to what visual studio does in its output window or other editors in their tool windows start another process b from my process a and capture its stdout stderr output

3324725
stdout	fflush
i wrote my own test program that outputs something and does an fflush stdout directly afterwards

3324762
integer	unsigned
does the complement and implicitly converts to an integer like all numeric operations do then masks out everything except the lower 8 bits to get the unsigned value again as an integer

3324801
happy	alex
i m trying to build a simple lexer parser with alex happy in haskell and i would like to

3324805
move	drag
when drag starts see if there is a draggable object under the mouse that you want to drag store it locally and use the draggable interface method to move the object around

3324805
move	drag
on drag end remove the draggable object from your local store and stop calling its move method

3324910
pull	push
you would still have to download a repo to push it on the heroku node but at least you can control what to pull push and do some cleaning between each push

3324942
hash	md5
i actually don t really need md5 just a simple hash function which i can compare against a stored value to see if its changed

3325119
nsxmlparser	nsurlconnection
i myself intend writing a simple subclass of id with a few object methods and all the nsurlconnection and nsxmlparser delegate methods contained in it -- so that responsibility is with this subclass and can simply be instantiated in a viewcontroller

3325155
aggregate-functions	sum
my goal is to make an aggregate-functions sum and group the elements but there is an error

3325171
domxpath	domdocument
for instance load the html in a domdocument instance search the table with either domxpath or getelementsbytagname and use the replacenode or other manipulation functions

3325234
free	malloc
edit basically i m supposing that the electric fence library replaces the malloc free calls of the regular libc

3325251
freemarker	velocity
click supports velocity freemarker jsp

3325252
stdout	stderr
your description sounds like printing to stderr works since that s where warn goes whereas printing to stdout does not

3325252
stdout	fflush
update as per daotoad s excellent suggestion this could also be attributed to lack of fflush - if so then setting autoflush on stdout would solve it

3325282
introspection	typechecking
the language doesn t have features behind the scenes like garbage collection reference counting synchronisation reflection introspection bounds-checking run-time typechecking meta-classes and so on each of which can impose a cost on general operation

3325286
outputstream	inputstream
if the flash file is stored outside the public webcontent then you ll need to create a servlet which gets an inputstream of the file from the local disk file system and writes it to the outputstream of the response along a correct set of http headers and then let the url of the element point to that instead

3325292
post	get
i need to send data via http protocol get or post request from the function or trigger

3325319
getter	setter
if you do you spring perhaps occasionally to create the bean or you don t really like having a lot of temporary variables in the method which constructs that bean you can also use getter and setter

3325343
public	protected
for example it does not support private public protected access level modifiers

3325373
public	protected
access modifiers public private protected etc are not required for class-based programming

3325410

yslow	pagespeed
i ve been working 2 days on doing improvements on ui using yslow and pagespeed

3325457
superclass	subclassing
- create only a table for the superclass all attributes and associations of subclassing are moved to the table corresponding to the superclass with the possibility of taking a null value

3325457
superclass	subclassing
- create only tables for the subclassing all attributes and associations of the superclass are repeated in each subclassing

3325457
superclass	subclassing
- create tables both for the superclass and for each of the subclassing

3325457
superclass	subclassing
in this case the pk of the subclassing is at the same table a fk to the superclass this ensures that all identifiers in a subclassing table correspond to an existing identifier in the superclass table

3325520
formview	detailsview	objectdatasource	formview	objectdatasource	detailsview	gridview	formview	gridview	objectdatasource	gridview	detailsview
if we want to add editing support to the gridview with a custom shaped type we d want to either move to using an objectdatasource control where we could supply a custom update method method to handle the updates or have the user navigate to a new page when performing updates - and display a detailsview or formview control that was bound to a product entity for editing and not try and do inline editing with the grid

3325525
hide	show
you will need to edit the portfolio.js file in the public javascripts directory to show hide the correct titles and descriptions on the portfolio page

3325555
std	ostream
using overloading with an ostream left operand std cout is of ostream type it s used as a stream operator to print data of various types

3325580
postgresql	mysql
it s compatible with the syntax from mysql and postgresql

3325580
postgresql	mysql
mysql supports both syntax forms and its docs claim that the second syntax with offset was meant to provide compatibility with postgresql

3325581
melt	reshape
if so if you reshape melt the data first you can create one multidimensional table

3325594
width	height
that is when the view itself decides its width and height

3325615
int	boolean
there s no logical conversion i can think of between an int and a boolean value

3325635
cpython	pypy
the current version of pypy is 99 compatible with cpython version 2.5 and can run django twisted and many other python programs

3325635
cpython	pypy
there used to be a limitation of not being able to run existing cpython c extensions but that is also being addressed with cpyext module in pypy

3325635
cpython	pypy
an alternative to pypy is unladden swallow a google project which aims to speed up cpython implementation by using llvm s jit capabilities but progress on unladden swallow was slowed because the developer needed to deal with bugs in llvm

3325662
int	chars
therefore you can simplify things a lot by sticking to an int type and converting that to a chars int8_t when writing

3325663

width	height
the images contain different plain-coloured irregular shapes and i d like to find the point or pixel where the maximum width matches the maximum height see figure below

3325728
mouse	keyboard
this is a sad moment in most any usability study seeing the subject banging away at the mouse and keyboard and not understanding why it doesn t work

3325745
put	get
i m going to expand on the comment i made earlier suggesting that common functionality should be put into a library to avoid duplicated effort in maintaining the same code base in two places and suggest that if you can get away with making each instance a branch of the common codebase then that s probably ideal

3325747
int	chars
i only use chars in context of strings and never use short as it s as long as an int on most desktop systems anyway

3325764
versioning	upgrade
these models are representing the upgrade versioning along with time and released

3325822
post	get
depending on the sensitivity of the data you could store it in a session variable and check for the presence of post or get variables prior to falling back to the session variables when the form is being displayed

filtering	grouping	sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping
the easiest and fastest way of doing client side data manipulation sorting filtering grouping is jorder

3325874
rss	feed
a better approach might be to find the rss feed for the site and get the content that way because that will be stripped down as is

3325877
portrait	landscape
the buttons extend to each side of the screen so i ll need two images for each layout portrait and landscape

3325898
rss	feed
with the json feed it removes all but the standard rss and atom tags and then translates to json

3325914
16-bit	64bit
for the same reason it would not be feasible to have made short 32-bit and int 64bit a 16-bit type is essential for many things audio processing being the first that comes to mind

3325924
updatepanel	scriptmanager
by adding the trigger you are telling the scriptmanager to update this updatepanel whenever button1 is clicked

3326009
portrait	landscape
i have a universal ios app with a custom view that has three buttons each with an image background that extends to the sides of the screen for each orientation portrait and landscape

3326009
portrait	landscape
ipad in both portrait and landscape mode

3326009
portrait	landscape
iphone in both portrait and landscape mode

3326027
unsigned	short
as far as memory goes you may find it trivial but when i use known sizes that are unsigned and not unreasonably large i use unsigned short s for my for loops

3326027
unsigned	short
very small change to note the loop is going only 10 times so you might as well use an unsigned char rather than a short

3326034
mouseover	mouseout
or is it something wrong with mouseover mouseout

3326049
mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout
the mouseover to mouseenter and mouseout to mouseleave changes are because the former events will happen when entering leaving a child as well which you usually don t want

3326054
inherited	properties
document2 is of an inherited type the properties might be overloaded to return something different

3326081

lisp	scheme
yes it s very possible although a standard hm-style type system is usually the wrong choice for most idiomatic lisp scheme code

3326198
lisp	racket	lisp	scheme	scheme	racket
see typed racket for a recent language that is a full lisp more like scheme actually with static typing

3326199

3326315
facebook	fbconnect
i have scoured google and the facebook documentation but half the links i find are to deprecated fbconnect wiki articles and the new docs are helpful but sparse on the examples

3326319
implements	extends
the above page also says that a pojo should not have to extends prespecified classes implements prespecified interfaces or contain prespecified annotations

3326330
implements	extends
many products that work with data objects used to force you to implements someproprietarydataobject or even extends an abstractproprietarydataobject class

3326330
getter	setter
many libraries will expect bean behavior getter and setter

3326333
jobs	cron
using cron jobs

3326349
implements	extends
if for example a dependency injection framework tells you that you can inject a pojo into any other pojo they want to say that you do not have to do anything special there is no need to obey any contracts with your object implements any interfaces or extends special classes

3326388
vim	emacs
i would like to translate the following function from vim script to emacs elisp i use it to set the email recipients when writing emails

daemons	systemd
i d rather not mess with permissions of systemd files or daemons users

3326625
int	double
if you re storing a value type int float double etc - or any struct arraylist will cause boxing on every storage and unboxing on every element access

3326639
vb.net	vb6
biggest of all is that adding new features to your vb6 application is more expensive than it would be if the application was in a better language like c# or vb.net

3326641
mouse	keyboard
mouse keyboard tablet input multiplexing it provides is too downwatered for modern programs

3326646
runtimeexception	invocationtargetexception
so when i throw a runtimeexception from methodb cglib ends up throwing an invocationtargetexception which is actually a checked exception

3326649
width	height
using linearlayouts and setting the children to fill_parent on both width and height and assigning them the same layout_weight you would get the desired effect

3326672
hide	show
in trying to build a page where i can filter the types of jobs and the offices using the hide show function i find that if an element is hidden then an element underneath the element is told to hide it doesn t actually hide

3326672
hide	show
in other words hide only works if the actual element is show

3326672
hide	show
here is the code to duplicate hide office 2 then hide developers then show office 2 again

3326703
comparator	comparable
as you can see you can t pass primitive type like int array since i am comparing elements by comparator method that defined in comparable interface

3326714
hide	show
in addition to the hide show use a class named hidden with the css

3326776
division	modulo
modulo is basically the remainder of division the operator in most languages is is

3326791
put	get
the fix is to put the two apis in different namespaces so that they get generated into different packages with different object factories

3326861
google-chrome	safari
if you just want to look at it for debugging purposes do a console.log myobject or console.dir myobject and take a look at the firebug google-chrome safari console

3326879
setinterval	settimeout
then just use a timer or settimeout or setinterval to stay on the image a certain length of time then rinse and repeat

3326891
uitableview	nsindexpath
uitableview has an instance method called indexpathsforvisiblerows that will return an nsarray of nsindexpath objects for each row in the table which are currently visible

3326891
uitableview	nsindexpath
because the uitableview method returns the nsindexpath you can just as easily extend this to look for sections or row section combinations

3326893
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
which should be supported by google-chrome safari and firefox

3326904
width	height
an important point here your question isn t defined for concave shapes - on concave shapes you will have a list of height for every x and the maximal height line may not intersect the maximal width

3326930
onmousedown	onmousemove
though it may be more complicated why not just have an onmousedown event on the element and thet event will then attach an onmousemove event and onmouseout event so that if there is a mouse movement while the button is down then remove the class on the span elements and once the user exits the element then you can put them back

3326970
range	infinity
it further assumes that all your input data is in a reasonable range away from infinity and nan

3326976
keydown	keyup
the stackoverflow site does a bit more because it does syntax highlighting too but the basic idea is to listen to the keyboard events - keydown better keypress or keyup not so good if a button is continuously pressed and in its callback update the value of the target container with the value of the source container

3326976
keydown	keyup
the best solution is to bind to both - keyup and keydown or keypress

3326998
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
according to this page modern browsers firefox safari opera with the exception of ie can handle very long uris

3327000

and a smaller image with the same width but much less height

3327119
postgresql	mysql
i would pick postgresql v8.4+ over mysql given the choice

3327122
dictionary	map
you can do it by iterating over each character in your input string and using a dictionary to map it to another character or leave it unchanged if the character is not found in the dictionary

3327141
short	base
it s because for the java base types int byte short etc. it performs autoboxing and autounboxing

3327141

imagemagick	graphicsmagick
i ve had luck installing and configuring graphicsmagick similar to imagemagick and using rmagick on my mac

3327169
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
if you provide some more details on your thumbnail generation needs and your setup that might help give you a better answer but i d suggest giving at least graphicsmagick and imagemagick a try along with mini_magick or rmagick

stdout is buffered i would have after that fflush stdout

3327238
stdout	fflush
can t find documentation whether exec on its own would fflush stdout or not.

3327403
width	height
the maximum width and maximum height of a bitmapdata object is 2880 pixels

3327403
width	height
in air 1.5 and flash player 10 the maximum size for a bitmapdata object is 8 191 pixels in width or height and the total number of pixels cannot exceed 16 777 215 pixels

3327403
width	height
so if a bitmapdata object is 8 191 pixels wide it can only be 2 048 pixels high. in flash player 9 and earlier and air 1.1 and earlier the limitation is 2 880 pixels in height and 2 880 in width

3327413
opera	firefox
it s been tested on ie7-8 firefox 3+ and opera 9-10 and works like a charm

3327458
portrait	landscape
the function normally has some simple code that runs if the orientation is portrait or landscape

3327460
accessor	properties
you re only accessing the properties when you send an accessor message to the properties s holder self in your examples

3327460
accessor	ivar
that s the key difference hitting the accessor may cause side effects whereas accessing the ivar directly never will

3327460
accessor	properties
hence the best practice use the properties in all your instance methods as you probably want the accessor side effects except in init methods and dealloc where side effects would be a bad thing

3327484
hide	show
setwindowpos works too and has a flag to hide or show the window but it is to only make a window visible or invisible not about minimizing or normalizing

3327499
folder	directory
in a unix or mac filesystem the software does exactly what you suggest writing its settings in normal files usually organized in hidden folder in the user s home directory

rss	feed
leo suggests having a unique id generated programatically to be appended to the rss feed url for each time the referring page is loaded

3327688
rss	feed
you could query your web server logs for traffic to your rss feed perhaps filter it by ip to get the number of uniques

3327688
rss	feed
the frequency of hits to your rss feed by one individual could vary day to do and the number could be lower

execvp	fork
you should also check for execvp and fork failing and you shouldn t be setting the child side to non-blocking - that s a decision for the child process to make

3327889
ant	maven
maven differs greatly from ant in that maven defines project types archetypes such as a web application

3327889
ant	maven
like i said you may have reason to use make with java such as an existing project but for any new project you should absolutely use ant or maven instead in my opinion

3327932
ant	maven
a2 imo a better alternative to this would be to ditch the existing makefile and create your own build file using either ant or maven

3327956
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
in order to use a uitabbar you would need a uitabbarcontroller which is different than the uinavigationcontroller

3327956
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
in your question description you mention trying to add these buttons to the navigation controller toolbar on the top. a uinavigationcontroller has a uinavigationbar which is the bar that runs across the top and a uitoolbar which is the bar that appears at the bottom

apple s navbar demo shows how to put a uisegmentedcontrol into the uinavigationbar

3328027
portrait	landscape
if you want to automatically switch between both landscape and portrait orientations as the phone is rotated

3328027
portrait	landscape
but switching between landscape and portrait alters the backbuffer dimensions short-and-wide vs

3328027
portrait	landscape
not all games will be able to handle this and some designs only make sense one way up so dynamic switching between landscape and portrait is only enabled for games that explicitly opt-in by setting supportedorientations

3328114
hash	salt
the simplest thing you could do is hash and apply a salt to your passwords before entering them into the database

if you re planning on debugging with the data it helps to know if the data was part of a post request or a get request

3328317
apache	nginx
i found there are a lot of articles comparing nginx and apache in internet

3328317
apache	nginx
so i don t understand the meaning to compare nginx and apache with php code

use the sqlconnection sqlcommand classes rather than oledbconnection oledbcommand classes when accessing sql server

3328431
getter	setter
note that this will result in a getter function being generated when you use synthesize but not a setter function

3328433
apache	nginx
php is something of a standard for web development and so is what people usually care about with servers so just because nginx or apache are optimised to run an obscure programming language y times faster than the other is irrelevant unless it s php

int	double
but if that doesn t work out ghci starts being confused about which interpretation of the literal he must make int double float ...

3328864
http	spdy
both s3 and cloudfront allow domain aliases however cloudfront allows multiple aliases so that d1.mystatics.com d2.mystatics.com and d3.mystatics.com could all point to the same location increasing the capacity for parallel downloads this used to be recommended by google but with the introduction of spdy and http 2 is of lesser importance

3328866
int	double
this can be awkward to work with so ghci implements type defaulting it assumes that bare numbers are int or double if the type is ambiguous

3328900
rss	feed

ant	maven
in my ant script i m executing maven like this

3329069
int	chars
they are all int of course not chars it s just pasting issue

in the following example i want the shirt to automatically inherited the properties of both the material and pigment classes

3329080
inherited	properties
i realize i can create interfaces but those won t automatically inherited the properties

3329104
getter	setter
simple call the setter call the getter verify that the value is what you stored or the exception you expected is thrown

3329112
equals	gethashcode
for example value objects should override equals and gethashcode

3329135
portrait	landscape
btw the phone can be located in landscape or portrait position when the user click the button

3329212
put	get
higher values decrease the space overhead but increase the lookup cost reflected in most of the operations of the hashmap class including get and put

3329240
folder	directory
i usually call this kind of information directory structure or folder structure

3329249
for-loop	loops
you can loops pretty quickly through your elements using a for-loop

3329262
setinterval	settimeout
from an overall standpoint never pass a string to settimeout or setinterval if you can avoid it it results in many unwanted side-effects...like this one

3329272
maven	pom.xml
use a second repository like nexus for storing those jars and only reference a txt file or a pom.xml file for maven project in order to fetch the right jar versions

3329283
int	double
you need to collect all the information from the ui in the main thread before starting the background worker you can use only simple types string int double etc. and thread-safe classes structs you can not use any wpf classes in the code executed by the backgroundworker

3329312
int	chars
for example the string literal xe2 produces a single-character string with a chars with int value e2 hexadecimal or 226 decimal

3329323
inline	inlining
unless either a you absolutely need to define a function in some header or b you are profiling and optimizing a piece of code and know better than the compiler what should be inline and what shouldn t inlining should be of no concern to you

3329365
config	ini
multiple config types ini

3329410
nstextfield	nsimageview	nstextfield	nstableview	nstableview	nsimageview
this is a simple nstableview with a redrawn table cell which consists of nsimageview and a fiew customized nstextfield s

3329415
for-loop	loops
i don t think an anonymous function is a substitute for a for-loop nor do i think it s necessary to replace for loops with them

3329415
lisp	scheme
sure if you re using lisp or scheme they are but that s out of necessity

3329415
for-loop	loops
i think recursion would just be unnecessary if the task is just as easily accomplished with a for-loop and therefore you re not kissing for loops good bye

3329477
super	abstract	super	implements
i assume you are asking about annotating methods which are defined in an implements interface or as abstract in a super class

3329508
wordpress	joomla
i don t want to use an existing cms such as joomla or a blog like wordpress because i want to be building my own app from the ground up

3329510
inline	inlining
please remember that inlining is relevant at the function call site the same function can be inline in some situations and not inline in other

3329569
updatepanel	scriptmanager
i chose to use the updatepanel scriptmanager components for the grid even though there is some bandwidth costs

3329595
int	double
sadly your best bet is to implement the extension method on all objects and do a switch based on type or to create a set of methods for int double floats etc

3329604
free	malloc
the function g_list_free can do the job but don t forget to free the data before if allocated dynamically as also said here in that case you have to go through each element of the list and use g_free if allocated with g_malloc or free if allocated with malloc or whatever matches the alloc function e.g delete for new in c++ ...

3329610
icomparable	compareto
in this case you want to constrain your generic to icomparable interface which gives you access to the compareto method since this interface allows you to answer the question shouldbegreaterthan

3329615
128bit	64bit
gcc supports built-in __int128_t and __uint128_t types on 64bit platforms but it looks like formatting support for 128bit integers is less common in libc

3329648
hide	show
i thing you need to load everything on page and selected content who you want to show is show by using jquery.show and all other content unselect is hide using jqury.hide

3329672

3329677
google-chrome	firefox
under windows xp firefox google-chrome

3329700
children	parent
if you are using an orm to implement your classes the orm tools you are using will provide you options generally two options one class one table or one parent class one table and each table for each children class

3329702
pseudo-class	visited
visited along with the others modifiers are all pseudo-class and there was never a standard syntax setup to do what you re trying

3329705
post	get
when you use get the variable post contains an instance of news

3329705
post	get
so first i would suggest you use filter instead of get so post would always be a queryset and therefore you wouldn t have such an inconsistent behaviour .

3329719
datediff	difference
datediff measures day hour etc boundaries you re asking for a true date time difference

3329740
datediff	difference
you can use diff datediff mi intime outtime to get the difference in minutes

3329835
rss	feed
can i display html tags like links and span tags inside the description in rss feed code using php

3329844
backtracking	greedy
+ is normally greedy which means it matches as many characters as are available and then backtracking if the rest of the regexp fails to match

3329855
getter	setter
most models in rails inherit from activerecord base which has all of the conventional getter and setter and the association methods validations and support

3329864
ant	maven
still for production use i d recommend formally compiling using ant or maven and the jdk

3329870
next	except
interestingly the next line which you did not query is syntactically valid but is not giving you the answer you want except in the case where

3329874
hide	show
also another problem with this code is that once you show the tracklist then hide it again the words stop toggling

3329880
rss	feed
rss feed is not a html document

3329880
rss	feed
my answer is that you should not use html elements inside rss feed

3329953
rubygems	bundler
i m certainly no ruby developer but i have an application on my server using rubygems and bundler

3329959
put	get	post	put	post	get
i m building a header with login data get and delete work fine but when i try to send a put or post request i get 404..

3329991
width	height
or i can set the width to more than 36 and it appears to grow by width-36 but if for instance i set both the height and width of one of these narrow cells to the same number lets say 60px the height of what gets displayed is greater than the width and it appears as a rectangle not a square

3329995
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
to sum up the enhanced for-loop offers a concise higher level syntax to loops over a list or arrays which improves clarity and readability

3329997
pull	push
nobody will see any changes until you push those commits to another repository or the original one or until someone pull commits from your repository if it is publicly accessible

3330008
postgresql	mysql
personally i d try something that s popular and free such as mysql or postgresql so you can more easily google your way out of problems

3330047
inherited	properties
iâ ll create a new extendedmembershipuser class that inherited all the default properties from the membershipuser

3330076
mkplacemark	mkreversegeocoder
gets called when mkreversegeocoder finds info for your coordinate you can retrieve info you need from corresponding fields of mkplacemark instance you get

3330084
curb	libcurl
i ve installed the curb and curb-fu gem and libcurl on my ubuntu box

3330132
quicksort	heapsort
so for instance heapsort is faster than quicksort in the worst case but slower in the average case

3330146
inherited	properties
if your control inherited from combobox and you don t override the defaultstylekey properties it will use the same style as combobox thus the same template

3330149
for-loop	arrays
use a normal for-loop to iterate over an arrays

3330182
inherited	properties
if your clientside objects are not inherited from other custom objects you see if you could use the javascript s object.hasownproperty method to find out if a certain properties exists in the object itself and not up in the inherited chain via the prototype object

3330185
post	get
when ever i pass a value from a form using submit to a php file using load .get or post and try to receive data or load it in general as shown below i just get ruturned a null or undefined value

3330216
post	get
without needing javascript seperate get urls etc just plain old html the original post just add the id to the name of the button

3330226
r-tree	quadtree
if your objects are sparse then a quadtree or related data structure r-tree etc. is probably better

3330234
width	height
if you want more control over this you would use .footers 1 .shapes.addpicture instead as that let s you set the width height top left etc

3330253
put	get
i also put a breakpoint on the dealloc routine for the core data objects and it doesn t seem to get called at least not unless i specifically add additional releases

3330258
hide	show
you can hide and show the right view using the mode that is show in the above code

3330260
getter	setter
i think it was late night coding that made me overlook my getter and setter on the view- model

3330260
getter	setter
i was missing a getter and a setter for both properties

3330277
for-loop	arrays
if you are passing arrays use a standard for-loop

3330359
nsmutablestring	nsstring
stringbyreplacingoccurrencesofregex returns an nsstring which can t be cast to an nsmutablestring you ll likely get a crash later on when you send a mutating method to the string

3330407
inline-functions	inlining
you may -- though note that i never have -- want to consider playing with the optimization flags too so that only inline-functions are considered for inlining though of course this has a global effect and that may not be what you want

3330429
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
try not to overuse inherited in the first place - this is only going to become an issue when you ve got a subclassing deriving from a superclass other than object designing for inherited is tricky

3330431
post	get
thinking about rest it s relatively easy to map http methods to crud actions post for create get for read etc

3330431
post	get
post would spring to mind but i think get is also an appropriate method because 99 of the time you only supply a bunch of parameters to these types of actions

3330440
queue	fifo
the java.util.concurrent concurrentlinkedqueue class supplies an efficient scalable thread-safe non-blocking fifo queue

3330461
post	get
you should use post if your request modifies data and get if it only reads it

3330481
superclass	subclassing
a superclass constructor is always implicitely explicitely called before a subclassing constructor

3330489
post	get
i would try loading the web page with webbrowser class if it s a server side calculator you should figure out the get post parameters to give input and choose desired functionality you could do this by analyzing the html source and request the answer page

3330493
post	get
i think in the general case we might well supply various payload parameters and these plausibly might exceed what s possible with get so post is quite reasonable - the action of starting a job doesn t to me fit well with get sematics

3330499
vmware	virtualbox
i realize this has been well-answered already but i d like to add a couple of notes about virtualbox 1 in my experience it is much faster than vmware when running as a linux host and 2 the snapshot features have been greatly improved in recent versions the comprehensive snapshot functionality is what kept me in vmware for a long time.

3330520
public	protected
methods must be public package-private or protected methods must be

3330542
post	get
i sort of understand what rest is - the use of existing http procedures post get etc. to facilitate the creation use of web services

3330551
inherited	subclassing
activerecord normally detects when you subclassing an already subclassing activerecord base and uses this to turn sti single table inherited on

3330568
int	chars	int	double
note that i assume here that unsigned chars is 1 byte unsigned int is 4 bytes and double is 8 bytes large. the t is also used for stl containers because i use them a lot a vector a map and a list are used in many of the functions involved in processing files

3330568
int	chars
everything works perfectly fine with built-in datatypes chars int etc.

3330568
memcpy	memcmp	fread	memcmp
note that i m using mainly c functions for reading no streams here but some memcpy and memcmp fread etc.

3330570
folder	directory
i noticed that there was now a net.rim.ejde.componentpack4.5.0_4.5.0.28 directory in my eclipse plugins folder so thinking that perhaps i updated the component packs without realizing it i adjusted the target path of the ichabod library and rebuilt it with bb-ant-tools

3330595
move	drag
i tried hooking into the click event but i can t get the drag to work right i want the other elements to move out of the way once i drag an element over a suitable spot so the user can see where it would end up

3330614
post	get
basically it seems that it is about using http methods get post delete to identify the exposure of resources the application allows

3330614
post	get
we can further define what methods are allowed to this url - get for retrieval of the resource post for updating creating delete for deleting

3330654
debian	linux
i have never seen a problem like this before so i think the problem is with my django server it s running through apache 2.2.9-10 on debian linux

3330669
division	modulo
this code should be general purpose since you will be able to reuse it for part of your general division modulo code

3330670
memcpy	memcmp
it s actually not safe to memcpy or memcmp many many c++ types and using them is a habit that you definitely should cut

3330677
implements	extends
i ve tried to use stringio but it doesn t extends django.core.files.file and thus doesn t implements method chunks

3330682
post	get
as suggested in other post you may be able to come up with some shell game to arrange to run sudo for you for some enumerated list of commands but that s all you are going to get

3330694
google-chrome	firefox
the following line of code throws an argumentnullexception under google-chrome and firefox in silverlight

3330726
folder	directory
it had to be built in another folder different than the root directory

3330743
folder	directory
so for example you know includes create_table.php s path to your root directory is .. so it has a folder difference of 1 if the path was was includes foo create_table.php the path to root would be .. .. so a difference of 2 etc.

3330750
webkit	gecko
it appears to be used in gecko and webkit browsers to test if a lazy-loaded stylesheet has been completely downloaded of course if you won t be lazy-loading stylesheets you can remove that section completely

3330757
slider	supersized
i want an image slider plugin to crossfade backgrounds for performance reasons i cannot use the supersized plugin

3330764
children	parent
however i have to do the calculation in day as period instances don t know anything about their siblings and it feels wrong if a child walked up the tree to parent level and summed the children

3330789
post	get
the other link is in the comments i cannot post it until i get 10 pts of reputation

3330818
innodb	myisam
the default myisam does not support transactions i recommend using innodb

3330819
spaces	delimiter
i have to write an argument parser it is passed in as a string ala a b c delimiter is comma with a spaces after it but it can be escaped with a pipe | before it

3330850
mouseleave	mouseenter
now this is fine the issue is when the mouseleave menu2 whether the mouseenter submenu or not #menu2 should hide

3330892
margin	height
you don t need to add any padding or margin to the li just be sure the height of each li is less than the div#menu height + padding

3330920
apache	nginx
so the classic setup is nginx accepting external requests proxying them to the local apache

3330920
apache	nginx
apache handles the requests and gives back the responses to the nginx to transfer to the clients

3330920
freebsd	linux
that s epoll for linux kqueue for freebsd

3330953
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
another possibility is to use nsdatecomponents and nscalendar

3330980
rss	feed
i m trying to get simplepie to loop through a few rss feed using codeigniter but i can only get it to display the feed items from the last feed in the array

3330981
lisp	scheme
including clojure which is otherwise closer to common lisp than to scheme

3330981
lisp	scheme
scheme like clojure wasn t originally a divergent dialect from lisp 1.5 and for their purposes it makes sense

3331015
put	get
i need to get this data from the .txt file and put it into a html div showing the new song name when it has been logged into the file until a new song is played

3331029

i have some old javascript code from around 2000-2002 which surprisingly still works in ie but doesn t in firefox google-chrome opera etc

3331058
google-chrome	safari
the console for safari and google-chrome imo is better

3331064

width	height
qimage qimage const uchar data int width int height format format

3331216
int	chars

3333273
google-chrome	firefox
the easiest way to implement such a crawler is to write addon firefox or extension google-chrome then inject your javascript code into the visited page

3333994
equals	gethashcode
equals ... and gethashcode ... should always be implemented equivalently

3334005
equals	gethashcode
since you are using id to determine if objects are equals your gethashcode implementation should be using id too

rss	feed
instead of trying to scrappe the page like you said a better solution could be to use its rss feed -- for example in your case

rss	feed
to extract data from that xml feed you can use simplexml to work with the xml data by-hand or some library like simplepie that knows rss atom

3334100

free	malloc
free is the opposite of malloc and is used in c

3335467
svcutil.exe	wcftestclient
i would recommend that you use the wcftestclient or command line svcutil.exe

3335467
serializable	deserialization
if all else fails would recommend that you run a serializable deserialization unit test against your entity entity graph

3335512
ssl	https
however this solution hinders compatibility by requiring a plugin to be installed is much more complex and ultimately rendered unnecessary by the existence of http over ssl tls https

3335536
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
you d have a couple of tables within that database where the user s permissions are defined in as well when the user logs in from either the webmail application or the music download application the security database is checked for valid credentials and you can persist the login through-out and across multiple sites by passing something like a salt md5 hash so that a user only have to login once and when forwarded to the next website automatically get logged in

getter	setter
you might not like it but that what even the automatic properties syntax does after compilation - it generates a private field and uses that in the getter and setter

3335694
range	max	range	min	min	max
if max - min is not so huge for example you define bounds in 1..1024 you could use just an array which point every x to the list of range

3335721
firefox	safari
my favourite is support gradients for nice modern browsers new safari firefox versions internet explorer and use a normal background-color as fallback for the bad browsers old safari firefox versions

3335786
pop-up	dialog
the web server has only one screen and the dialog boxes will pop-up according to the people browsing the web page

3335786
pop-up	dialog
all of these points combined means that the servlet won t be configured to have access to a graphics environment and there will be no opportunity to display a pop-up dialog

3335786
awt	swing
in general you can t mix swing awt code with servlets

3335786
awt	swing
however there is a subset of graphics operations available in both swing and awt which allow image manipulation without needing a graphical environment

3335808
post	get
post would spring to mind but i think get is a more appropriate method because 99 of the time you only supply a bunch of parameters to these types of actions

3335808
post	get
you could use a post to create a new batchjob resource and allow the user to do a get to see the progress of the job so far

3335860
vb.net	vb6	int	boolean
this made quite a few things difficult for the migration to .net because the loose type system of vb6 allowed to mix int and boolean in the same expression and 2 and true meant something else in vb6 than in vb.net

3335866
viewdidload	dealloc
we would need your property declarations and the viewdidload viewdidunload dealloc methods of the controller in question

i would expect that i get something like width 320.000 height 480.000 when in portrait and width 480.000 height 320.000 in the landscape mode

3335887
width	height
instead i always got width 320.000 height 480.000 what ever the actual orientation is

clang	llvm
llvm is an alternative that might be even easier to install but less people know how to use it at the moment need the base llvm plus clang i normally build from sources but that takes forever

3335996
margin	height
i d like to include all padding margin in my height

3336024
accessor	properties
as far as i understand when you use properties the compiler still converts them to accessor methods during compilation

3336045
margin	height
if you want to include the padding and border use outerheight false if you want to include padding border and margin use outerheight true and if you want to include only the height of the element use height

3336048
javadoc	scaladoc
i wish to compile scaladoc and javadoc in a project with both scala and java in it

3336055

using the md5 hash of the username is not a very good idea because anyone can automate that

3336062
gmail	hotmail
i generally test against gmail hotmail and a server running spamassassin to check mails i send out

3336062
salt	md5
however if you salt the md5 you can easily prevent people from generating the md5 s in an automated way that s an open invitation for automated signups

3336096
hash	md5
the md5 hash is fine if you re hashing with a timestamp

3336114
client-side	server-side
can be easily achieved with server-side languages like php but i have no idea if it can be achieved with client-side languages like javascript if so i d love to see an answer about it too

3336247
rss	feed
i d use wordpress built-in plugin search to search for an rss plugin feed and go through each of their features

3336247

google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly in firefox and google-chrome after execution i check the html and everything has worked alright

3336441
children	parent
and even then i don t know for sure if it would work because i don t know if tortoisesvn shows the status of external children in the icon of the parent

3336455
uninstall	upgrade
be careful to test upgrade to ensure that you add the other parts of the condition remove all so that the upgrade of the old product stays an uninstall and doesn t flip to repair

3336470
ant	maven
i use maven not ant

3336474
margin	height
if you want the height including padding or margin then you can use outerheight

i ve put breakpoints on the filestream property setter and getter and the size property of the stream is always correct never zero

3336558
width	height
i am trying to get the height and width of images via a url in java without an imageobserver

inherited	properties
i wish to be able to inherited these properties methods in a child class

3336770

3336783
postgresql	mysql
i m one of those that recently decided to migrate from mysql to postgresql and with it a lot of old habits are being torn apart

however there is functionality from mysql i would like to preserve in postgresql

3336816
pylons	turbogears	django	turbogears
zope turbogears django pylons etc

3336818
fastcgi	scgi
as such for hosting wsgi applications in conjunction with apache it has a lower memory overhead and performs better than existing wsgi adapters for mod_python or alternative fastcgi scgi cgi or proxy based solutions

3336821
width	height
you are not supposed to set width height of any resizable yourself

3336841
portrait	landscape
it s seems to be ok at time of launch but if i turn the device to landscape then back to portrait the table in the popover will have an additional blank row at top so that i have to scroll down to see the others..

3336877
min	max
for each of your subranges min max you can find the iterators i_min and i_max and

3336926
children	parent
i would try having a parent process which forks out children processes

3336926
children	parent
the parent process will still need to have a longer max_execution_time setting which can be set within the script itself while the children have a max_execution_time setting of 30 seconds

3336964
globalization	localization
globalization and localization demystified in asp.net 2.0

3337014

the server-side file handler displays a document in the context of the browser rather than opening the document in a client-side application infopath excel etc.

3337049
integer	fractions
the most natural extensions are either integer programs similar to lp s but all variables must take on integer values--that is no fractions components or convex programming perhaps a more general extension

3337089
put	get
when you start tweaking things and get into non-standard configurations then that s one more thing you or your dba s have to remember to do when you put your application into production

3337130
webkit	gecko
the result works with webkit and gecko but ie 7 + 8 what a surprise they load no content

3337138
put	get	filtering	grouping	min	max
the key is to always think in terms of sets and how do those sets get put together through joins filtering through where conditions or on conditions within a join and when necessary grouping and aggregated min max avg etc.

3337194
post	get
even in the most trivial of cases a bland post on a forum didn t happen or some such i would match rather get a cryptic message that at least gives me the idea that something went wrong and if i care i should try again or call somebody then just say update complete when it really isn t

3337203
getter	setter
essentially getter and setter are allowed to have side-effects other than just setting a variable

3337210
min	max
this program takes in the max and min that the data can be and throws out data that is less than the min or greater than the max

3337210
range	minimum
this case only happens when the minimum range of the variable being checked is 0

3337214
mouseleave	mouseenter
then when the mouseenter for the panel fires set it to true...then stop the mouseleave logic from firing unless it is set to false

3337251
min	max
and throws out data that is less than the min or greater than the max

3337251
min	max
then you need to set 0 as the min value and -1 as the max value --- which does not make sense

3337251
min	max
and throws out data that is less than the min and greater than the max

3337289
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
i have a uiimageview that responds to touchesmoved touchesbegan it works perfectly

3337290
integer	fractions
this by the way is a special program called a binary integer program or bip for short because all the variables are integers no fractions values and all values are either 0 or 1

3337314
width	height
my current method of iterating over the cells in the usedrange is slow since it requires repeatedly polling for the top left width height of the cells

3337314
width	height
1 find the interesting set of rows in the used range by looking at the tops and height of the first cell in each row my understanding is that all the cells in the row must have the same top and height but not left and width

3337351
children	parent
i want a query to return the following true 1 in the case of oracle if the parent has at least one child that has graduated and false 0 in the case if oracle if the parent does not have a child that has graduated or has no children at all

3337351
children	parent
in the above parent with parent_id 5 may have 1 children that have graduated

3337351
children	parent
parent with parent_id 6 either has no children at all or has children but none of them has graduated

3337352
dijit.form	dojo
when i call this the scope within the dojo method is dijit.form

3337364
range	max	range	min	min	max
if you need to generate a single forumala for all of these cells i think it should be possible using the offset in combination with max min and row to generate the appropriate range with just a little arithmatic

3337408
min	max
2 generate the value and look for the max and min existing unique identifiers

3337408
range	max	range	min	min	max
the min and max value give you a range of available values to work from if the random value is already assigned

3337426
maven	m2e
i am trying convert to using maven and m2e but am unclear on the best approach

3337458

folder	directory
i m working on a new feature for an existing iphone application and would like to create several new directory in the application s local documents folder

3337622
for-loop	loops
if you do need to loops then using a for-loop is essentially as fast as anything else lapply can be a little faster but other apply functions tend to be around the same speed as for

3337640
m2e	pom.xml
the m2e plugin will then automatically pick these up from the pom.xml and add them as library references to the build path within eclipse

3337649
addclass	removeclass
using classes in this case would be better than setting the css directly though look at the addclass and removeclass methods alecwh mentioned

3337660
folder	directory
the also explained why the application ran well on other computers with their tomcat folder directly on the root directory

3337664
post	get
if â on the other hand â your app is a native app youâ ll most likely want to use core data for storage and get incremental updates in a separate thread or using libdispatch in case youâ re only targetting post 4.0 devices using a separate managed object context which you can then merge to the main thread using mergechangesfromcontextdidsavenotification

3337680
post	get
this will always respect your current permalink structure and is the safest way to get post s url

3337715
post	get
first make sure your form that post to the search page is a get operation this way the search details are in your query string

3337717
uiview	subviews
each subviews is a custom uiview subclass not a uilabel or uiimageview

3337734
uiview	subviews
the uiview has a number of subviews

3337734
uiview	subviews
this handling should be transparent uiview and its subviews should still receive their touch events even if they intersect with the specified rectangle

3337734
uiview	subviews
button to the end of uiview subviews

3337762
maven	m2e
assuming you already have maven installed in your computer then download the m2e pluging install it and restart eclipse

3337866
google-chrome	firefox
works great in google-chrome and firefox but it doesn t fire in ie

3337879
hide	show
that means that when it overflow horrozontally it will just hide the content rather than show a scroll bar

3337883
hash	hmac
but the existence of collision attacks implies that the compression function on which the hash function is built is not a random oracle and this voids the hmac security proof

3337913

3338144
unix	bsd
on unix bsd and linux try

3338189
int	double
i think it s trying to say that it s not clear what type h_x is so it doesn t know which of the overloaded operators to use double int double double etc

3338189
int	double
you could try casting it h_x to int or double to tell it what version to use

3338202
serializable	deserialization
serializable and deserialization itself will work but then you re faced with this exception

3338330
filtering	grouping
if you do specifically want to filtering for rows where there is a fem_company_login value with a grouping value 0 then use your original query and change the left join to an inner join

3338330
filtering	grouping
if you want to filtering for people that either have a grouping value 0 or no value at all then do something like

3338380
post	get
no soap here just http get post with xml responses

3338388

if you are only using one radio box for checking on and off maybe you should use checkbox or toggle button instead

3338388
button	checkbox
scroll down and see checkbox and toggle button

3338417
pull	push
that is to say i use a code editor with a built in ftp window and push pull files to work on them upload the changes etc

3338418
accessor	properties
in objective-c properties you can set alternative names fpr the accessor

3338430
multicastdelegate	delegation
i thought the delegation keyword was just shorthand for a class which inherits from multicastdelegate

3338451
multicastdelegate	delegation
but tbh just use delegation in place of multicastdelegate

3338455
hide	show
toggle reacts to the state of your selector s display attribute so if it is visible it will hide and show if it is hidden

there it was an architectural decision made before i came to the project as they want to spread the tiers on different servers in different domains outside and inside dmz

3338652
rss	feed
failing that you need to look in the old blog code to find how to set the rss feed to show more or all entries

3338652
rss	feed
or try a standalone rss client reader for win or os x and see if it gives you the full history of feed items and then export from that

is there an exact ratio of width height i can depend on to measure this

3340408
width	height
it is not a problem with the width and height setting

3340469
postgresql	mysql
this is one thing that sql is consistent about - if you don t provide a time portion on a date data type that includes a time portion ie oracle postgresql while mysql and sql server explicitly call it datetime then the time portion is defaulting to exactly midnight of that date - 00 00 00

3340477

its bottom-right corner is 210px from the top and 230px from the left which gives you your 200px of width and height

3340577
try-catch	exception-handling
whatever overhead try-catch incurs is probably negligible but what draws my attention more with the first case is that it s misleading you re catching an exception-handling only to abort the loop

3340663
super	self
i m only initializing self with super init which is initializing a base class pointer to a derived class

3340682
getter	setter
for example you can provide a getter but not a setter so that they may be read but not written

3340694
getter	setter	mutators	getter	mutators	setter
some of the advantages are you can specify different access level for setter mutators and getter accessors for example public getter and private setter

3340760
getter	setter
since the clients of the class only see the getter setter you can easily change the implementation of the class methods by switching the phone number representation to a phonenumber object

3340842
opera	firefox
this works in firefox but it fails in ie and opera

3340858
integer	unsigned
for example you need an unsigned 32-bit integer type

3340858
integer	unsigned
that s why you typedef a separate type to be 32-bit unsigned integer and use the new type in your code

3340932
int	chars
when you have just an array of abstract chars s int s or something else

3340960
accessor	properties
the atomic keyword in properties declarations does double duty--it s both documentation and an instruction for synthesized accessor

3340960
accessor	properties
you can still write your own accessor if you use properties declaration syntax but if you do you should adhere to the declaration if you don t declare it nonatomic you should manually implement atomicity

3341010
boost	stl
this does not mean that in the implementation of the interface you cannot use stl or boost types it s just that your interface definition should only consist of com convertible types

3341033
keyevent	onkeydown
you can try overriding onkeydown int keycode keyevent event

3341060
minix	linux
tanenbaum so assuredly stated when he attacked linux in a famous posting on the minix mailing list almost twenty years ago as a cs professor he said he d fail linus for choosing a monolithic architecture for his os -- linus of course responded spiritedly and the whole exchange is now pretty famous and can be found in many spots on the web

3341083
int	chars
this is a direct consequence of the fact that the standard does not mandate that chars int float etc

as magnus mentions you may need to check the event handler for the textchanged keydown and keyup events for the textbox es that give you that response

3341169
keydown	keyup
it is possible to code something to make a sound on every keydown or keyup event but there is no setting in windows to do that nor does wpf do something like that by default

3341174
client-side	server-side
because javascript is not 100 full-proof and i can t think of a good reason not to treat all users as malicious it s always best practice to validate on server-side even if there is validation on the client-side

3341183
mouse	keyboard
when the mouse starts hovering over an element because of scrolling either by wheel or by keyboard scrolling it does not trigger a mouseover event on the elements it is hovering chrome 6 on osx

gridview	repeater	gridview	datalist	datalist	repeater
you can use a repeater a gridview or a datalist

3341593
fontfamily	font-size	width	height	width	font-size
the problem with you example is that inline text does not have a height it only has a line-height for it to have a height it needs to be in display block mode so that all the lines are added to a block of text even then it all depends on the width of the box and the font-size fontfamily etc

3341593
width	height
what itzwarty suggests is getting the text selection and putting it in a div that has the same font and width as the textarea which has display block and allows you to get its height

3341618
explode	implode
implode explode - need to find delimiter which won t be in values - since it s almost user generated not safe

3343798
for-loop	loops
of course this function will automatically match against the first name regardless of whether or not there is a second identical name but unfortunately in what seems like the weirdest quirk i ve ever seen any code after the end of that for-loop does not get executed even if there is no return statement in loops

you could use a for-loop to loops over the length of the smaller of the strings and check at each position individually

3346433
for-loop	arrays
i would split the strings by spaces then i would do a for-loop looking for numbers in the resulting arrays

3346435

width	height
i am trying to set the width and height of images in a datalist in the codebehind

3346452
width	height
the plan is to do something more complex than this based on the width height so setting width and height in the aspx file to 50 is not an option

3346452
width	height
for some reason i always get 0 for width and height

3346484
stdout	stderr
if you re totally confident no-one has pulled any stunts on you like closing stdout you can avoid using dup2 by closing stderr fd 2 before calling open

tortoisehg	hgsubversion
now the tortoisehg binary will be used when you invoke hg from the command line and the hgsubversion extension will work as advertised

3346594
getter	setter
should i have a normal getter and setter for every field

3346608
width	height
your code above is referencing a image control that more then likely does not specify a width and or height

3346608
width	height
then you could determine the width and height

3346608
width	height
then you would be able to do your adjustments to the height and width and apply to the properties of the image tag

3346616
width	height
remember with an img tag you don t set width and height by default

3346616
width	height
in this case unless you set width and height they will be 0 or undefined

3346616
width	height
if you need the actual image pixels width and height you ll need to discover that for yourself by loading the image into memory

3346616

load it into a bitmap then query the width and height there

3346620
vb6	vba

i m not at all sure i like this one as it means additional complexity but without it finding the particular getter setter you want say via autocompletion in an ide becomes a nightmare

3346725
nstabview	nsviewcontroller
you create an nsviewcontroller subclass for each tab and assign it to the nstabview using nstabviewitem

3346771
textarea	textbox
you didn t mention how and where the checkboxes textbox and textarea will be used so i m not sure how to incorporate them in my example

3346780
keyup	mouseup	mouse	keyboard
since they might paste a url via mouse or via keyboard you could try binding to both keyup and mouseup and check whether a valid url is present

3346784
hash	salt
the best way to handle the password is store a random salt value for each user and the result of a hash of the password + salt

3346784
hash	salt
when the user wants to login compute hash password + salt and see it if is the same as the hash value you stored when the password was originally set

3346828

for example the rails bundle within textmate on the mac lets you quickly open the view file associated with a particular model and there s a plugin for vim that provides an equivalent feature

3347004

if this were a c program the way to fix it would be to disable buffering on stdout or else to use write to fd 1 bypassing stdio

3347035
hash	md5
hash md5 johnny_381 example.com p4ss 0rd

3347035
hash	md5
hash md5 some_uuid_value p4ss 0rd

3347039
children	parent
using the view achieves what you want without the time overhead of having to update the child tables without the space overhead of making child rows wider by adding the redundant column and this really begins to matter when you have many rows as the wider the row the fewer rows can fit into memory at once and most importantly without the possibility of inconsistent data when the parent is updated but the children are not

3347047
put	get
and that works for the most part except for the fact that i have to put the namespace on every element or else i get the following structure in the result

also if you are choosing between two algorithms that have the same big-o complexity o n log n quite often one is better than the other random-pivot quicksort generally outperforms a binary heapsort

3347248
min	max
when i run the above query the min returned is larger than the max

3347248
min	max
i was thinking at first that mysql was processing the min max before it got to pline.

3347250

3347328
excel	listobject
when i set the formula for a selected cell in a listobject if the listcolumn is empty excel fills the formula for the whole column rather than just the selection

3347374
width	height
as far as the bit about the width and height attributes if you re trying to display the images at their regular width and height you shouldn t need them

3347374
width	height
the only time you should need width and height is if you re displaying the image at a different size than the original image s size which doesn t appear to be the case here

3347403
min	max
-- a gcc-specific language extension providing specialized operators for implementing min and max

3347406
hash	salt
1 each password is salt differently and the salt is stored with the hash

3347406
hash	salt
it sends the password which the server salt hash and compares

3347424
subtraction	addition	subtraction	add	subtract	addition	subtract	add
the next problem is a compare is a subtract subtract and add go through the same alu and take the same time as addition so for most platforms old and new trading compares subtraction for addition wont save you anything you end up looking at the branch cost pipeline flush etc

3347470
hash	salt
a hash the password along with a random salt using a method producing 128-bit or longer output

3347470
128bit	64bit
now instead of guessing 128bit keys he just guesses your 64bit password and then uses the same algorithm

3347470
hash	salt
yes if you salt the key someone needs the salt to decrypt things you encrypted using the salt key s hash value

3347470
hash	salt
again the purpose of the salt is not to raise the strength of the encryption it is only to prevent precomputation attacks against your hash

3347482
hash	salt
the idea is that even if the password hash database is stolen it would be very difficult to get the actual passwords you d have to try a lot of combinations without having the salt as well

3347482
hash	salt
server adds a random salt to the password and then hash it

3347482
hash	salt
the salt and final hash are stored in separate tables

3347482
hash	salt
server hash the password and salt

3347504
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
objectoutputstream serializes the objects hashmap in this case in whatever format that objectinputstream will understand to deserialize and does so generically for any serializable object

3347514
post	get
the test will 1 do a get or a post to fetch a page then 2 confirm the page actually loaded and has the right stuff

3347514
post	get
the tests will 1 attempt a get or post to process a page

3347514
post	get
some tests will 2 confitrm that the get or post worked

3347514
post	get
the test will 1 do a get or a post to fetch a page then 2 confirm the page actually loaded and has the right stuff

3347604
vb6	vba
i am in the middle of trying to create a class library available for use in vb6 vba

3347645
folder	directory
the idea is to store the secured files in a folder that is not available from the web not a virtual directory

3347665
client-side	server-side
this was the ideal solution too because i didn t want to implement a hack of server-side code for a specific client-side solution

3347726
google-chrome	firefox
it works with multiple languages including python and allows for testing in google-chrome firefox ie and other browsers

3347730
emacs	textmate
it works the same for emacs textmate etc

3347764
children	parent
when a user searches for the top-most product this query is supposed to return the parent its children and its children s children

3347774
g++	gcc
usual gcc version that i use 4.1.2 produced four undefined reference to errors during linking with g++ specifically to _m_widen_init and

3347799
children	parent
basically since you stated the xml is hierarchical you need to put the children indre the appropriate parent

3347799
children	parent
that way the children are beneath the parent nodes

3347848
client-side	server-side
ch can be used for both server-side and client-side web development

3347857
post	get
but one service is going to be handling post request while the other is handling the get request

3347857
post	get
edit another weird thing only one of the services throws this error my jsonp get service while the regular json post service works

3347862
comparator	comparable
that happens because you use the raw type comparable and the compiler can t be sure what you re comparing against since comparator uses the type parameter of comparable

3347862
implements	extends	super	extends	super	implements
super t since you may have a class a that extends a class b which implements but a doesn t implements

3347865
textarea	textbox
i m assuming so if it has textbox textarea etc

3347890
accessor	properties
i know i can use properties but sometimes accessor methods are still needed

3347963
pull	push
i need to fall-back to command line for a workable push pull behavior

3348023
min	max
parameters-- the values of those parameters are tightly bounded by a max and min value

3348108
backgrounding	multitasking
this will kill the app when the home button is pressed instead of suspending it into the backgrounding which is what ios4 does for multitasking

3348195
put	get
don t know if you can get away with all the nil pointers i put in here but if it doesn t work just look up the docs

3348202
onmousemove	onmouseup
the above function should be attached to window.onmousedown onmouseup onmousemove whatever

3348222
pull	push
but then when i do a pull an update and change that file as user a and then try to push i get

3348271
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works in google-chrome and safari but if firefox you see the 2f in the address bar

3348280
uipickerviewdelegate	uipickerviewdatasource
just use a generic uipickerview and return appropriate values from your uipickerviewdelegate uipickerviewdatasource methods

3348305
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
we unfortunately have as part of our testing 7 win vm s to test just ie then two for firefox on windows firefox 3.0 and 3.x - the latest plus two vms for google-chrome and two vms for safari on windows

3348355
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
.focus and .blur both work in firefox and ie but not entirely in safari and google-chrome

3348391
memcached	apc
then you can use memcached as suggested you may also look to apc cache as well

3348403
sorting	filtering
generally you should let the database do things databases are good at - filtering sorting and joining data

3348453
profiler	visualvm
netbeans has its own profiler which is based on jdk s builtin visualvm profiler actually it s the other way round the visualvm was born out of the netbeans profiler ages ago

3348516
jar	war
put the classifier in the configuration of the jar war ear plugin

3348526
partition-problem	np-hard
this smells like a variation of the classical partition-problem which is np-hard although some heuristics exists

3348556
google-chrome	firefox
the following code is working fine in firefox and google-chrome but works sporadically in ie7 8

3348561
mousemove	mouseleave
it works great except for i would like the image to be hidden by default and to only appear when the mouse is present and then when the mouseleave to disappear again. this could normally be handled with the hover property but it does not work when placed with the mousemove property

3348615
google-chrome	firefox
this link displays properly in firefox but the flash youtube player loads way down the page in google-chrome

3348618
profiling	debugging
if i m not mistaken it should do this automatically as long as the profiling is set to debugging

3348632
onclick	onsubmit
in general you should be trapping onsubmit on the form rather than onclick on a particular button to ensure you always get informed if the form is submitted by another means such as enter being pressed

3348632
submit	submission
consequently you d use a normal submit button. use return false from the event handler to prevent the form submission from going ahead

3348647
post	put
just as the blog post suggests i ve put paperclip into the config initializers directory

3348651
fseek	ftell
well from the manpage we can see that ftell and fseek use type long int to represent offsets positions in a file and may therefore be limited to offsets which can be represented in a long int

3348657
factors	matrix
i think you have loaded your data without and what you have is a factors matrix and so your generally good idea fails

3348833
submit	submission
this a lot of overhead in relatively slow client-side code to be compressing submission data and it s not trivial to submit the raw bytes you will obtain from it

3348833
post	get
even in a post form the default enctype is application x-www-form-urlencoded which means a majority of bytes are going to get encoded as nn sequences

3348838
free	malloc
this will free the whole block that was allocated using malloc

3348838
free	malloc
if you allocate a single block of memory using malloc like you do in your example then you need to call free exactly once to free that entire block

3348881
portrait	landscape
some of the images are portrait and some are landscape however i need to display the thumbnails at a uniform size and crop off the excess where it fails to meet the desired aspect ratio

3348890
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have successfully been able to do this in firefox but not safari or google-chrome by setting padding-top 20px

3348890
google-chrome	safari
i need this to work for safari and google-chrome however these browsers seem to auto vertical align the text to the middle

3348921
mktime	strtotime
strtotime takes a string date format but anyway you can also look into mktime

3348940
width	height
i am having some trouble when i try to adjust the width of my nav bar to be flush with the rest of my page and it appears to throw the height off for some reason

3348947
post	get
take a look at the post request before you post it my guess is _urlencode_rfc3986 converts it so that you get status this+is+my+tweet when you want status this is my tweet

3348956
getter	setter
also make sure that the field is within a tag and that your instance variables for your command class have the correct capitalization in the jsp and getter setter

3348973
sorting	filtering
jquery is quite poor in that area but still when a problem arises that has something to do with sorting or filtering - we go instantly into searching for a jquery plugin

3348986
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
to make it work in safari google-chrome opera add line-height 40px or any height your field has

3349004
melt	reshape
for whatever reason we need to make column names unique for reshape melt

3349012
folder	directory
obviously there will be many common directory you may need as routes and or folder interchangeably some of which we already know like properties probably can t be deleted

3349031
children	parent
if i do explicitly set the width of the parent then the children will fill the width

3349048
free	memcpy
some data points they don t use ucontext.h and they do 2x memcpy alloc and free on every context switch .

3349061
onresize	onscroll
better to catch onscroll and onresize from script to call the repositioning and add a slower setinterval poller to update it for the other cases that can t be caught from events

3349104
boost	stl
if you want to use some solution based on smart pointers don t be tempted to use auto_ptr as the copy semantics are wrong for stl containers - go for something like the boost shared_ptr

3349135
put	get	post	put	post	get
handling rest in general is a pain in the neck because dispatching to a view function based on method get post put or delete isn t part of django

3349137
free	memcpy
basically you ll see there is no real hooking to speak of the c level stack is switched back and forth under the interpreter s nose so to speak except for the delicate interactions with thread state in multi-threaded code and the saving and restoring of a greenlet s state from to the stack is based on memcpy calls plus some calls to the python memory manager to allocate reallocate and free space coming from or going back to the stack

3349152
strlen	strdup
what happens is that strlen refuses to give me anything i know how strdup works and i ve tested this myself and segfaults

3349162
emacs	aquamacs
the problem is that cocoa emacs and aquamacs uses the same .emacs.d but the elpa of cocoa emacs and that of aquamacs are not compatible so that some files are overwritten and not usable for both of them

3349213
getter	setter
hi i have a component that contains getter and setter which is fed by a structure for session variables

3349213
getter	setter
when i call the component and use cfoutput tag for that getter and setter the output is giving gibberish as results

3349228
firefox	safari
safari is ignoring our set-cookies completely while firefox and ie accept and send the cookies

3349239
toupper	uppercase
convert it to uppercase with toupper

3349242
feof	fread
besides the fread loop should check for feof since you would stop reading now if for some reason you would encounter an empty read

3349247
google-chrome	firefox
i m building this site and it looks good in firefox google-chrome ie8 but apparently it looks like death in ie6

3349257
ant	maven
and the generation itself was probably done using ant and the ant task or maybe maven but the idea is similar

3349257
ant	maven
instead look for a build.xml an ant build script or maybe a maven script and see if you can get those file generated at build time this is just how it s supposed to be used

3349260
firefox	safari
it seems that ie and firefox are less strict than safari

3349264
iboutlet	ibaction
i have a currently working program that has iboutlet and ibaction connections from the interface to file s owner

3349271
emacs	aquamacs
i am not familiar with elpa but if aquamacs and carbon emacs are using different copies of package.el you could try changing the definition of package-user-dir in one of them

3349275
width	height
should fix your width without adversely changing the height

3349275
google-chrome	firefox
checked in firefox google-chrome 5 and ie 7+8

3349289
post	get
i ve found a few post referencing this- _tpl_vars somevar to get smarty variables when inside the php tags but that doesn t seem to work with foreach

3349324
folder	directory
if you re using the web application project - make changes build move the files to the virtual directory target folder then test

3349325
free	malloc
one thing to be careful of when doing this sort of thing is that the allocation record used by free to determine what memory to deallocate is created by malloc and associated with the address malloc returns

3349325
free	malloc
what this means is that you can call free on any pointer pointing to the first byte of the malloc d block and it will deallocate the correct block of memory but if you call free on any address in the block other than the first byte you will at best sigsev or sigbus and at worst corrupt the allocation tables leading to bizarre and inexplicable behaviour

3349375
nstabview	nsviewcontroller
my window has an nstabview and each tab therein has its own nsviewcontroller they all have submenus and its own methods

3349381
getter	setter
thus creating a property in the first instance will avoid that issue if you need to add getter setter logic at a later date

3349420
justmock	typemock
i just use justmock since a couple of days and one of the greatest features that i have found is that justmock let the edit and continue of visual studio work instead of typemock that lock totally your code like with the old version of visual studio

3349443
put	get	post	put	post	get
secondly don t confuse http methods get post put delete with what you are trying to accomplish

3349443
post	get
most requests are get unless you are submitting a form then they are post

3349455
wan	lan
when testing nat in full-mesh mode one wan port and others are lan port we observe the significant system s slowdown especially console responds very slowly and there is also packets loss

3349461
spanned	charsequence	int	chars
the inputfilter interface has one method filter charsequence source int start int end spanned dest int dstart int dend and it provides you with all the information you need to know about which chars were entered into the edittext it is assigned to

3349532
for-loop	loops
a for-loop variable provided it is not declared as final can be modified in the body of loops

3349584

salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
i forgot to include the facebooksecret as salt in the md5 hash

3349696
pop-up	dialog
it s a fairly straightforward layout - when you click the pop-up dialog link the dialog div shows positioned over the top of the link

3349701
children	parent
giving it a height of 100 overflows it s height by 20px because height 100 uses the parent height not taking into account the children

3349728
udp	tcp
a program that broadcasts a list of public files configured in a text file over udp and then accepts tcp connections to download them

3349736
unix	solaris
i ve got the server.c compiled on the server s unix terminal solaris 9 but i can t figure out how to run it on apache 2.2

3349838
int	chars
should i add a type column like a chars or int so that i would know

3349853
hash	md5
though you might want to avoid simple hash functions for example any half-baked idea that you could think up quickly because they might not mix up the sentence data enough to avoid collisions in the first place one of the standard cryptographic hash functions would probably be quite suitable for example md5 sha-1 or sha-256

3349882
submit	submission
now the issue i have is that if the user edits one of the fields being checked at any time if they don t click out of it and try submission the form data the .blur function takes control as it should by how this is coded so it takes a second click to submit the form data

3349899
subtraction	addition
i would use a heuristic like approximating the distance with simple addition and subtraction

3349903
thin	webrick
i was getting 0.5 reqs s on the front page of my rails app a very simple mostly static page that made a couple of database calls but nothing that webrick said took longer than 0.8 ms served with thin

3349910
client-side	server-side
there is no reason why you cannot have php running on your own server computer that returns html or xml that gets consumed by your mobile application but to the best of my knowledge there is currently no way to have php running on the mobile phone itself although even if you could php is typically a server-side technology and not a client-side technology so that would be unusual

3349947
google-chrome	firefox
it doesn t work in either firefox or google-chrome

3349962
children	parent
the children could insert values into their tables that already exist in the parent or the parent could insert a value that already exists in one of the children

3349962
children	parent
likewise foreign keys cannot reference the parent table and or its children because it s ambiguous which row is referenced if multiple rows can exist in parent children with the same primary key or unique value

3349963
min	max
edit given a slight clarification in the op s edit of his q the heuristics i would suggest is to pick some sensible max and min relevant substring length say 2 and 5 call them minrsl and maxrsl for definiteness

3349963
range	max	range	min	min	max
but if you have many more words to index or substantially-longer words or need much-vaster range of min to max rsl then the numbers can grow worrisome and this is the case in which the savings of say a factor of three for the more complicated slower-to-search scheme may be considered worthwhile

3349975
int	chars
the first is declaring a pointer variable a variable that holds a pointer instead of an int chars or float notice that you have to specify what type of variable it will point at

3350006
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	modulo	multiplication	modulo	addition	multiplication	addition	modulo	division	addition	division	subtraction	division	modulo	division	multiplication
you have the same problem in subtraction division and modulo and it wouldn t hurt to do it the same way for addition and multiplication either

3350010
width	height
your problem lies in the static height and width values of your div containers

3350019

if you think there is some lag with what you are doing and you don t want your users to see then set display to hide and then fade in or show once the manipulation has been done

3350239
mouse	keyboard
as an ehr implementor since 1983 i d suggest you look for a language that provides a user interface that allows multiple inputs including keyboard mouse touch voice and stylus and potentially runs on multiple devices including phones and pcs

3350244
innodb	myisam
mysql provides several storage engines for creating tables innodb and myisam are the most popular

3350263
unsigned	short
firstly if you use writeutf it will write an unsigned short representing the string s length first then write out the string data

3350280
nsbuttoncell	nstablecolumn
answering my own question it appears you need to bind the target and the argument to the nstablecolumn instead of the nsbuttoncell

3350305
int	boolean
numeric classes int boolean string have static methods

3350315
width	height
i want to move an uiimageview represented by a clock pin width 9px height 73px from position 1 to position 2 around point 3 which is one end of the image

3350441
google-chrome	firefox
i have seen the proper behavior in firefox and google-chrome

3350443
children	parent
the simplest solution is to maintain a parent nsmutabledictionary dictionary of children nsmutablearray arrays each child array being its own section of rows

3350443
children	parent
make sure you adjust your delegate methods to reflect the size and content of the parent dictionary and children arrays

3350457
filtering	grouping
if you run always the same sets of data over filtering etc it is a symptom that they belong somehow together so you should consider to grouping them using either a tuple or a dedicated class usually a case class in such cases

3350480
unsigned	short
defining the ushort explicitly #define ushort unsigned short has no effect

3350508
passenger	thin
here s a good link benchmark of mongrel thin and passenger

3350579
width	height
please note that the text in the paragraph with the class main_content will be dynamic and the height will always change so i can t just set a width and a height for the white_bg class and use position absolute and place it right behind the paragraph

3350590
typedef	struct
in c++ you can direcly use the struct name without keyword struct and so you dont need the first typedef that is buffer_info

extjs	smartgwt
extjs gwt and smartgwt are libraries which give you more components to use in your gwt applications to use either of these you ll need a gwt application

3350903
extjs	smartgwt
this is why i preferred it to smartgwt as it had a lot more java code which meant when you had a problem you could have the debugger look at the extjs gwt code so you could work out what was really happening

3350957
free	malloc
this will ensure that user code does not by mistake create your objects in the stack nor will it mix calls to malloc free with calls to new delete since you manage creation and destruction of your objects

3351548
maven-antrun-plugin	pom.xml
ok then you ll have to uglify your pom.xml with the plugin definition below which will bind to the generate-test-resources phase and invoke the maven-antrun-plugin to create the directory

3351618
put	get	post	put	post	get
couchdb s rest api requires a post or put request in order to insert data but jsonp only supports get requests

3351645
awt	swing
swing or awt for gui

3351672
hash	md5
hashing sha1 md5 etc is a one-way encryption - in other words it s very difficult to determine the original value of the hash value so what you can do is compare one hash value to another since these hashing algorithms will always spit out the same thing

3351672
rsa	aes
encryption rsa aes etc is a two-way encryption - in other words you can determine the original value of the encrypted data usually by using a public private key combination

3351688
floating-point	fractions
here we re really working with fractions 20 10 18 10 16 10 ... 2 10 0 10 where the iteration is done with integers easy to get correct in the numerator with a fixed denominator before converting to floating-point

3351722
min	max
my goal is to get back an for the min max of posns where i get a none for min if there are no values below zero and similar for max

both easymock and mockito can be configured to be strict or nice the only difference is that by default easymock is strict wheras mockito is nice

3351813
jquery	curvycorners
you can use the jquery curvycorners plugin that does its job in cross-browser fashion

3351890
stdout	stderr
maybe this program doesn t output to stdout but stderr same as ffmpeg for example

3351949
ant	maven
the build script can be ant or maven it doesn t really matter - but ant will require a little bit more work to set up

3351967
stdout	stderr
this pipeline works like a charm until gs receives invalid pdf data instead of reporting all error messages on stderr as i would have expected it still writes some of the messages to stdout instead

3351986
jar	war
can i create a web resource jar war and include this in both applications

3352006
pull	push
so each team can push and pull from it

3352028
for-loop	loops
i have a for-loop inside loops there is a switch statement

the following code hide the border around the listbox and does always show a white background on the item if its generated through the itemssource -property

3352042
width	height
i have a subclass of uiview that needs to calculates it s height according to it s width

3352047
public	protected
you could subclass your event listener in your test code and provide a public method with the same signature as deleteentity which simply calls the protected base implementation of deleteentity

3352173
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
in ie and opera when i load my urls in a browser they stay encoded but in safari and firefox the urls are automatically decoded and my code breaks

3352188
int	chars
it represents one continuous block of memory which can be interpreted as either an int floating point value or a chars pointer

3352190
inherited	properties
having a setstatus method in the masterpage is always the way i ve done this to access the masterpage from inside a user control just create a private properties in the usercontrol or create a basecontrol class that all user controls inherited from

3352200
int	chars
in the example you posted the size of union would be the size of float assuming it is the largest one - as pointed out in the comments it can vary in a 64 bit compiler while the size of struct would be the sum of sizes of float int chars and the utype_t and padding if any

3352253
int	chars
in your example int float and chars members can all have different values at any time when used as a struct

3352254
super	abstract
to make it reusable i have created my own super dialog class that contains 2 onkeylistener objects and an abstract submit method

3352261
ssms	sqlcmd
use sqlcmd mode in ssms

3352269
folder	directory
then on your server you would probably have a cron job or other service that will copy the files from your branch directory of your repository to the actual document root folder of your site this would run at say midnight every day to ensure the site gets updated daily

3352299
versioning	upgrade
making sure the upgrade code is the same as the previous installer and that both the product code has changed and the versioning number has been incremented here is the full solution

3352318
gridview	objectdatasource
here s a sample of a gridview bound to an objectdatasource with the objectdatasource binding to a dropdownlist for a parameter

3352343
jstl	taglib
rather use a servlet to prepare the data for jsp use taglib like jstl to control flow in jsp page and use el expression language those things to access backend data

3352359
int	chars
both can be cast to the underlying int and then cast to chars c#

3352378
google-chrome	firefox
consider this example which works fine in the browsers i ve tested firefox google-chrome ie

3352387
nsstring	nsdata
i have the following code for creating an nsstring to contain the body of the text file and then convert it to nsdata and output it to a file

3352395
dictionary	map
also - you need to know that the sorteddictionary is somewhat of a misnomer if you equate dictionary to map or hashtable

3352432
maven	pom.xml
can you please tell me how can amend pom.xml in maven for achieving the same

3352464
folder	directory
i created a windows service app which knows how to create virtual directory in the root folder of the iis 7.5

3352464
folder	directory	folder	dir
now lets say i created a virtual dir named myvdir within the root folder and then i want to create another virtual dir with the same c# function as above - within the myvdir virtual directory create nested virtual directory

3352480
hash	salt
looks like hash password + random salt is the way to go

3352481
put	get
even if i put the object in models instead app_code where i normally put all code in webforms i still don t get the normal intelisense so.

3352540
width	margin
if at the point that you create and populate the listbox you set the width of the child items whether textbox or textblock to a known value for instance the width of the listbox minus any margin and then set textwrapping.wrap as normal your text will wrap as you expect

3352564
children	parent
the important point is that child_first is used to iterate over the children files first before their parent folders

3352617
imperative	declarative
it s important to realize that sql is a declarative language and not an imperative one

3352671
division	multiplication
exercise 14.16-17 in thompson asks me to add the operations of multiplication and integer division to the type expr which represents a simple language for arithmetic then define the functions show and eval evaluates an expression of type expr for expr

3352686
stdout	stderr
in your case file descriptor 1 stdout and file descriptor 2 stderr are open to the same file as the parent

3352697
temp	tmp	folder	directory
my temp tmp environment variable was pointing to a ram drive root folder t without any further directory nesting

3352697
temp	tmp
now my temp tmp environment variable is pointing to t temp and everything is working fine

3352725
uicontrol	uibutton
in ib view identity inspector when i type in my uicontrol subclass into the class field it reverts back to uibutton when i tab out

3352725
uicontrol	uibutton
any uibutton subclass works but not a uicontrol

3352725
uicontrol	uibutton
the first plan was to go to xcode and change the superclass of my new control temporarily to uibutton change the class of my ib buttons and then change the xcode code superclass back to uicontrol

3352749
swt	swing
file io networking and the standard guis swing and swt work on different os without changes

3352758
min	max
also it would be nice to save max min avg etc

3352797
put	get
by default objects included in a style will be shared and you will get one image object shared by every menuite but if you put them in a separate resource dictionary you can mark them as not shared

3352931
redhat	fedora
i use fedora 13 on my laptop and i use yum to install recordmydesktop just for fun.one day my boss ask me to install recordmydesktop into his computer whose operating system is redhat enterprise 5.2

3352942
singleton	facade
the major gof design patterns are decorator state iterator facade strategy proxy factory method adapter observer template method composite singleton abstract factory and command

3352955
arraylist	treeset
i want to write a type-safe map method in java that returns a collection of the same type as the argument passed arraylist linkedlist treeset etc. but with a different generic type that between the angled brackets determined by the generic type of another parameter the resulting type of the generic mapping function

3352957
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
the following code does not work and throws a runtimeexception caused by nullpointerexception

3352968
google-chrome	firefox
i was just wondering is this a bad thing because when i open it in google-chrome or firefox it loads fine

3353019
unsigned	short
java does not have type like unsigned byte you have to use larger short for this for unsigned int it has to be long

3353022
invariantculture	cultureinfo
replace your use of invariantculture with new cultureinfo en-us and it will become obvious why the first parse doesn t work

3353051
mvp	presenter
another pattern that might be interesting for you is the mvp model view presenter -pattern

3353087
scheme	racket
i m using racket though any other scheme implementation will also do

3353112
width	height
you can try to use the methods winfo_screenwidth and winfo_screenheight which return respectively the width and height in pixels of your tk instance window and with some basic math you can center your window

3353112
width	height
i am calling update_idletasks method before retrieving the width and the height of the window in order to ensure that the values returned are accurate

3353116
accessor	properties
so you ll probably use both when a control exist in ajax toolkit and you need some server side properties accessor etc

3353217
public	protected
due to the fact that an ilist will not meet your needs and how you re not luckily using automapping i would set foos to be a protected private ilist nhibernate-friendly collection and then create a public readonlycollection that reads through foos

3353268
width	height
my problem is my width height and scrolling options don t actually do anything

3353286
agile	sprint	agile	greenhopper	greenhopper	sprint
you can use greenhopper another 10 purchase to do agile planning around these issues such as backlog planning and sprint tracking

3353309
mouseleave	mouseenter
jquery also fiddles a bunch of event code to try to make submit focus blur focusin focusout mouseenter mouseleave events work and bubble across browsers

3353351
client-side	server-side
asp.net ajax is part client-side but also part server-side

3353351
updatepanel	scriptmanager
if your application has any updatepanel you have no choice but to include microsoftajax.js which is coming in automatically with the scriptmanager

3353433
ant	emma
ant cant find the emma jar files make sure you have emma.jar and emma_ant.jar in your classpath

3353479
ant	maven
in other words given some makefiles and maven or ant xml files and the name of the top-level target is there a way to identify all of the files that will be generated the programs used to generate them and the input files associated with those programs

3353525
daemons	systemd
rather than reinventing the wheel do not implement your own queueing systemd for processing of messages - route the messages directly to a maildir or mailbox and run a daemons to poll the contents and process it

3353614
inherited	properties
classical inherited s main usefulness is if you have a number of related classes that will have identical logic for methods that operate on instance variables properties

3353614
outputstream	inputstream
for example java has the classes inputstream and outputstream

3353626
implements	extends
10 from top would be trickier you d have to implements your own positioning logic in an onload callback everytime the colorbox is shown or extends colorbox s code but no quick way to do that

3353638
hide	show
if you look at my code when i click on hide button it clear the pieflowpanel panel but when i click on show button it does not show my piechart

3353660
google-chrome	firefox
the firefox and google-chrome understand this but eval in internet explorer is failing

3353685
ant	buildr	ant	maven	maven	buildr
buildr is a framework of rake tasks that is explicitly designed as a replacement for ant and maven to build java applications

3353722
g++	gcc
there is only one file and g++-mp-4.5 is the macports executable for gcc g++ 4.5

3353722
folder	directory
warning var folder xa xaqho9peec8k-nrd0l9xwk+++tm -tmp- cc2ivfto.o can t open to read symbols no such file or directory

3353736
put	get
when my function get a img object then i d like to put the img inside another div

3353783
post	get
i think it will need to be post service operation as get would assume some response but since you declare it as void it would have no response

3353784
client-side	server-side
you can do reverse geocoding both on the server-side or on the client-side but with reverse geocoding you pass one coordinate and you are returned the address of that point only

3353838
gridview	rowdatabound
i m trying to modify the output of my gridview in the rowdatabound event handler but it s not working - nothing happens

3353842
stdout	stderr
i want to read the password prompt from stdout or stderr and write the password into stdin but ssh is writing and reading from the console from which i started my mono app

3353846
x86	64bit
one solution is to go to programfiles common files microsoft shared msenv or programfiles x86 common files microsoft shared msenv for 64bit systems and right-click vslauncher.exe and select properties

3353853
centos	linux
using php 5.3.3 stable on linux centos 5.5

3353877
getter	setter
the thread class itself only refers to the m_name member in the name getter and setter

3353950
width	height
my usercontrol width and height are set to 100

3353951
post	get
here s a similar post request note that you can send both get and post parameters in a post request

3353951
ssl	https
https is a wrapper around http where with http the client connects to the webserver and starts the conversation https first establishes a secure ssl tunnel and the http communication goes through that

3353958
post	get
without ssl data sent through post is equivalent to data sent through get or in other words not encrypted at all

3353960
maven	pom.xml
further probing google turns out that spring and maven don t get on too well with the following in my pom.xml although no solution is forthcoming

3353975
children	parent
let s say you want one parent to have only two children

3353994
uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
i m only guessing here but i d presume it is because you made mywindow the key window now even if it is transparent and shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation is part of uiviewcontroller class not uiwindow

3353998
width	height
- put a tablelayout as root of your activity with fill_parent as width and height

3354002
maven	pom.xml
first starting from artifact c all the way through a use mvn dependency analyze to verify what dependencies are really being used and not just declared in your pom.xml this maven plugin is very useful as a first step to debug your dependency tree

3354008
post	get
data sent via post is practically as unsecure as sent via get

3354008
post	get
but if someone can sniff the link he can spy very easily user and passwords sent via a http request post or get unless ssl is used

3354048
rss	feed
i m trying to create a rss feed in my kohana app

3354062
dom4j	xom
i suggest that you use some xml dom library like xom or dom4j

3354062
dom4j	xom
you can pass inputstream directly to your sax xom dom4j parser there is no need to build string first

3354100
post	get
i will not post the whole source code to this problem here because it is quite long but i will get people started

3354127
qmainwindow	qdockwidget
i have an qmainwindow displaying a central widget and a qdockwidget containing this custom widget

3354173
google-chrome	firefox
works fine in google-chrome and firefox

3354178
post	get
i would be sending a new get post

3354247
fuzzy	stemming
unlike other types of lucene queries wildcard prefix and fuzzy queries are not passed through the analyzer which is the component that performs operations such as stemming and lowercasing

3354284
hash	salt
i had an idea about hash passwords and salt values

3354284
hash	salt
or keep a single salt value securely stored and re-use that each time i hash a password

3354284
hash	salt
the hash result and salt would then be stored in the database in the users profile when their account was created

3354307
equals	gethashcode
be sure to override equals and gethashcode on your listclientobjectx object

3354349
ostream	istream	std	ostream
you are trying to copy or assign a stream descendant of std istream or std ostream

3354376
getter	setter
note that all attributes and relationships mentioned here use vanilla kvo-compliant getter setter

3354378
plm	glm
i want to look at it since it looks like i will have to use glm instead of plm pooling for this analysis since the dependent variable is a binary variable and plm does not support these d.v. s

3354391
superclass	subclassing
a better way to do this would be to make the fields of the superclass protected instead of private - this will give you access to them in your subclassing

3354391
superclass	subclassing
note that when you defined the subclassing constructor you will need to call a constructor from the superclass as well so in that respect you ll still be able to pass in all the required variables

3354391
superclass	subclassing
and don t forget that all public methods in the superclass can be called as-is by any code that has an instance of your subclassing

3354391
superclass	subclassing
let me know if i ve misunderstood your requirements but it sounds like you want to access fields and behaviour of the superclass - which you ll have automatic access to in your subclassing so long as they re not private

3354402
stdout	fflush
you can add fflush stdout after each printf and see if that helps

3354420
google-chrome	firefox
having a stable and usable firefox driver is my #1 priority so i haven t yet spent much time testing ie google-chrome or htmlunit remote

3354434
post	get
msdn forum post regarding this issue suggested adding the contentpropertyattribute setter to the controls codebehind but i could not get that to work

3354511
google-chrome	safari
this can now be done in google-chrome safari ff4+ and ie10pp4+

3354538
hash	salt
if you believe someone will actually build a precomputed table of your one single salt to a database of passwords then look up the salt password hash they found in your database with said table then you should use a unique salt for each password

3354552
config	ini
you could define the password in php.ini or via the ini setting in the apache config or .htaccess

3354570
client-side	server-side
you should consider the importance of your data and either choose to keep it always server-side requiring internet connection or keep it at client-side making it vulnerable

3354579
width	height
i d like to know some css technique so that i can have the gradient box and the shadows within a div with undefined size i mean dynamic height and width

3354580
google-chrome	firefox
i thought i had this worked out but unfortunately it does not work in firefox or google-chrome

3354609
expander	itemscontrol
i am using an itemscontrol to place n number of expander s

3354609
expander	itemscontrol
i want to make sure my itemscontrol will always occupy the entire available height to do so it can expand some of the expander s

3354660
post	get
change the method attribute from post to get

3354677
hash	salt
re-generating the salt hash combination every time the user logs in is a bit pointless unless you ve got cpu cycles to burn

3354677
hash	salt
i d recommend using something like the rfc2898derivebytes class to generate a secure salt hash combo

3354713
scheme	racket
i m really in no huge rush to immediately learn a language that can land me a job though i d like to do it soon and i m considering using plt scheme now called racket to work through how to design programs or structure and interpretation of computer programs essentially one of the scheme classics because i have always heard that they teach people how to write high-quality usable readable code

3354717
hash	salt
using a salt hash does not protect against brute force dictionary attacks

3354734
post	get
if you actually want the form to submit then you should indeed just change the form s method attribute to get instead of post

3354734
post	get
if however you do wish to stay on the form page and need to post the data to some other resource with the data in the url string there are reasons for and aganist doing this that you should look into -- scroll down to 9.3 get then just make an ajax get request otherwise just post the data using ajax

3354739
post	get
i dont know python and autoit but in teh general sense you d just need to get the name value pairs by looking at the html of the form or by examining a request being made to the server is probably better and then make a post request

3354739
post	get
as others have said if you want to just append the values to teh url then the server will need to be happy to accept a get request instead of a post

3354739
post	get
sometimes you will find that servers will do this happily they don t care how form submission is done as long as they get data other times it will be specifically looking for a post and will ignore parameters passed as part of the querystring

3354764
width	height
i guess imageview sets its width and height initially and then when it rotates it uses those dimensions

3354773
getter	setter
i was just wondering do you know any portable tricks or language patterns besides obvious getter setter

3354783
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
one way would be to bind the height and width properties of your control to the parent s actualwidth and actualheight properties

3354784
uiview	subviews
for instance if i have a bunch of subviews of uiview that i ve also put into an nsarray to be able to iterate through them doesn t that double the retain count.

3354788
stdout	stderr
you re also not checking the output either the return value or the stdout stderr streams of the compilation step at all so you have no idea whether the compilation was successful - and if not what useful error messages you got from the compiler

3354797
client-side	server-side
but not only that this is also a clear violation of cwe-602 client-side enforcement of server-side security and cwe-603 use of client-side authentication

3354807
vb6	vba
all methods and properties seem to work correctly in vba vb6 but when i try to access the method with a paramarray it won t event compile

3354838
src	attr
you can pass a function into attr to change the src attribute like this

3354885
mouse	keyboard
hooking the keyboard mouse screen scraping is pretty much the limit of what you can do with an applet

3354891
versioning	upgrade
i have an issue that popped up when i upgrade my versioning of xcode

3354897
for-loop	loops
also the for-loop isn t necessary as the inner while loops will read the entire file

3354914
x86	64bit
on x86 at least most fp operations are done in 80-bit internal registers but only have 64bit in memory

3354941
public	protected
as a side note it doesn t make sense to have an abstract class with a public constructor -- the constructor should be protected because the constructor can only be called by classes deriving from it anyway

3354972
freemarker	velocity
use velocity or freemarker to transform that xml file into a template by replacing your dummy data with variables and macros what would produce the same result

3355027
mouseleave	mouseenter
you shouldn t need to handle the mouseenter and mouseleave events at all

3355068
post	get
then when you post you should get an instance of that view-model out

3355084
children	parent
your function should accept a parent id and return an array of its children without changing any state of any object

3355094
post	get
post is not the same as get -- if you append the data that you want to the url the page will not see your variables

3355123
width	height
the problem comes from the fact that if you don t supply a height and width for any control it will try and determine it s available area based off it s parent container

3355123
width	height
if i define a grid that has 2 star width columns and 2 star height rows

3355125
haskell	scheme	scheme	prolog
track two is the very high level language track - scheme prolog haskell perl python c# java and others that execute on a vm or interpreter lie in this area

3355126
width	margin
i d look at using css and putting a margin 0 auto on the with a maximum width container

3355131
google-chrome	firefox
it works on ie and google-chrome but not on firefox

3355135
hide	show
so i am using positioning to show hide the dialog

3355178
hide	show
with show grid button one can show the grid and with refresh button from the navigator with the sorting of any column or with the button hide grid one could hide the grid

3355206
hide	show
try to wrap the menu and submenu to a parent div element and just hide show the submenu when needed

3355229
pop-up	dialog
since your application is embedding a small window you can trigger a compact pop-up version of the authorization dialog with the display parameter

3355246
post	get
it seems only zend_http_client post and zend_http_client get are working

3355350
rsa	dsa
a normal way to get around the public-key expense is to encrypt a symmetric dsa key using rsa - that way your encryption of the actual data is fast and the only slow part is decrypting the shorter key

3355832
int	double
the table consists of a sorted 2d array 500-3000+ rows columns of simple int x double y tuples

3355849
int	double
ideally however if your only going to allow adding of int float double etc i would really just create overloaded version of the add method to handle those various cases

3355868
hash	salt
rather than directly storing the username and password in the cookie store the username and a hash of the password and a salt in the cookie then when you authenticate the cookie retrieve the password for the given username re-create the hash with the password and the same salt and compare them

3355868
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
creating the hash is as simple as storing the password and salt values together in a string converting the string to a byte array computing the hash of the byte array using md5 or whatever you prefer and converting the resulting hash to a string probably via base64 encoding

3355905
int	double
all types like int double short etc

3355915

3356091
gridview	detailsview	listview	gridview
sounds like a gridview is what your after you want the ability to add edit delete and you might make use of detailsview from your rows in the gridview may or may not be useful to you but for adding new records you ll probably want it in coordination with the gridview the listview would be too simplistic for what your after i think

3356092
versioning	upgrade
supported versioning and edition upgrade paths are listed at versioning and edition upgrade

3356101
gridview	detailsview
i use a detailsview and gridview if i just want to display data that in straight columns and rows

inherited	properties
as you ve noted calling attribute.getattribute even if inherited is true on a properties does not return attributes decorated on the interface properties that your class has implemented

3356156

the way we handle this complexity in c# is we define addition operators on a smaller subset of types int uint long ulong decimal double float all enums all delegates string and all the nullable versions of those value types

3356299
pop-up	dialog
i have the following code which builds a jqueryui dialog pop-up

imo kentico dotnetnuke are the ones

3356378
put	get
you could put all your find get queries in the models corresponding table class

3356383
innodb	myisam
if you re mostly do selects so the inserts updates do not happen too often to lock the table the difference will not be all that much even though in recent benchmarks innodb seems to be outperforming myisam

3356385
width	height
i account for the div s height and width when measuring the distances to the right and bottom edges as well

3356406
width	height
in in elements that are arranged vertically like a list you will almost always want wrap_content on the height and fill_parent on the width

primitives int float double short etc.

3356594
free	malloc
make sure you do some research into allocating and deallocating memory with malloc and free

3356631

if i need to do something like that i first get the code from my scm and then run a script to make changes like changing the build properties and than start the actual build process usually by kicking off maven or ant

3356712
int	double
you need to read an int or float or double etc or else the wrong formatter will be called

3356721
unsigned	short
iâ ve used unsigned int since thatâ s the most natural although unsigned short would of course also work

3356747
firefox	safari
works beautifully on firefox safari and ie8

3356750
powerpc	i386
for example if you built a python 2.6 on os x 10.6 with the 4-way universal option powerpc ppc64 i386 x86_64 get_platform should report macosx-10.6-universal

3356763

all requests will need to have the oauth_consumerkey oauth_token oauth_version oauth_nonce oauth_timestamp oauth_signature_method and oauth_signature added either to the querystring for http get form fields for http post or to an authorization header

3357028
inherited	properties
if a dependency properties doesn t have a local value it will obtain its value either through value inherited or through coercion depending on how the properties has been implemented

3357028
inherited	properties
but as long as the properties s getting its value through value inherited instead of value coercion - you can accomplish fundamentally the same thing by binding the properties to the properties it s inheriting from on the appropriate ancestor

3357029
client-side	server-side
you can use node.js to run javascript code server-side for the protected stuff and interact with it from client-side javascript

this is what i use in one of my apps to show hide a little options view

3357115
implements	extends	lisp	scheme
looking for ways to improve the performance of my genetic program i concluded that i need almost all the additional functionality that comes with a functional language and i believe scheme or to a lesser extends lisp are the best solutions for it unless i want to implements features like cond if comparisson operators etc myself extends the existing implementation

3357115
lisp	scheme
my question to the forum is if there is any efficient way to call scheme or lisp from a .net application passing data back and front in some array form

3357160
cpython	ironpython
i should add that what i wrote is true for cpython but not necessarily for jython ironpython

3357318
google-chrome	firefox
everything works fine in google-chrome but in firefox all the non-american characters are shown as a strange mark

3357322
jar	manifest.mf
i don t really get the point - that s not a manifest.mf anymore - but if you move the contents to say src main resources src home something.txt src home something.txt will end up in the jar

3357340
google-chrome	safari
similarly is actually 0 - i imagine you d get a similar result using google-chrome or safari or a web browser on any other computer

3357360
width	height
the view had an explict width and height which constrained the view when placed in the cell

3357398

but when the application is started and next if i lock the phone and then unlock the application first 1-2 seconds is in portrait mode and then in landscape

3357411
draggable	droppable
while you can accomplish what you want with the event.drag drop script it is also easily done using jquery ui - draggable droppable

3357411
draggable	droppable
this creates a big droppable area but it will only accept the draggable id of drag1

3357440
mouse	keyboard
as an aside when you work on a system like this you naturally become very very proficient with the keyboard and all that it means to use keyboard shortcuts in windows because you will likely not have a convenient way or place to put a mouse

3357441
keydown	keyup
so the problem is this works when the user is selecting from the menu with the mouse and when tabbing out of the field keyup keydown to choose then tab out works but keyup keydown to choose itme then enter and nothing happens

3357450
post	get
anyway i ll post a few bits and pieces from my oledb solution that will hopefully get you started

daemons	systemd
i have written a daemons in linux for doing dhcp for an embedded systemd

3357614
int	chars
i would have expected the type of a | b to be an unsigned chars as both operands are unsigned chars but the compilers say that the result is an int and the call to foo is ambiguous

3357616
namedtuple	dictionary
if you re really never defining any class methods a dictionary or a namedtuple make far more sense in my opinion

3357643
put	get
put your perl code in a script which makes it much easier to get the regex right without wondering about escaping quotes and such

3357644
daemons	systemd
you will want to write and debug your daemons in a full featured environment first then install it on the embedded systemd at the end when you are sure it works properly

3357651
width	height
crayon_boxes have width height crayons.

3357667
hide	show
basically what i did was to hide the adview and show it only when the bannerviewdidloadad is called if the view isn t being show already

3357676
folder	directory
this is probably most definetely because i don t know where to put the cake_1_3 folder installation currently my directory tree for localhost in htdocs looks as follows

3357676
post	get	folder	directory
this means that when i navigate to localhost i get nothing and when i navigate to localhost post i get nothing just the directory listing for the folder post which shows i have the directory cake_1_3

3357684
unsigned	short	int	chars
unsigned chars short int or can be converted to an

3357686
ironruby	ironpython
since ironscheme uses the dlr it can be embedded into any .net application using the standardized dlr embedding apis in exactly the same way that you would embed say ironruby or ironpython

3357687
int	chars
short and chars and other int smaller than an int are weaker types than int

the category s methods are added to that particular class so the myothercategory implementation will belong to your subclassing and it will be looked up before going on to the superclass during message dispatch

3357719
jruby	mri
alternatively you might consider making these java library facilities available to your mri rails app as an internal web service which could be rails or sinatra or similar built on jruby

3357780
unsigned	short	int	chars
any time you specify a smaller operand any flavor of chars or short the operand gets promoted to either int or unsigned int depending on the range

screens	mdpi
update as described in providing screens resource compatibility for android 1.5 i m using android sdk r6 and have put my mdpi resources in the drawable directory

3357847
hide	show
you simply can t hide show elements like this cross-browser you need to either have a backup hidden and copy only the elements you want each time or just disable the elements you don t want to be selectable this will however leave them visible

3357851
dictionary	map
the other answers do what you asked but i wanted to add a small measure of flexibility and protection. i would use a dictionary to map the line names to the class objects so you re not letting the text file instantiate anything it wants

3357877
cart	oscommerce
having used oscommerce zen cart and more recently prestashop i would say prestashop is probably one of the easier solutions for building a relatively simple attractive looking site

3357877
cart	oscommerce
unless you are an experienced designer developer then i d stay clear of oscommerce and go for zen cart or presta

3357877
cart	oscommerce
zen cart is in a way a simpler version of oscommerce

3357878

rss	feed
what i m trying to do is take an rss feel url and using linq be able to write a query that will let me sort the subject line of the feed or sort the author line of the feed or even do where clauses that will let me filter by keywords for example

3357884
rss	feed
i know i can read the rss feed parse each element put them into some sort of class object collection and linq off that but i was wondering if microsoft provided a simpler way to do this in the .net framework

3357983
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
you may have to explicitly thread the processes to make firefox run them in parallel firefox hasn t had a recent release so their support for parallel may be weaker than the more recently updated google-chrome and safari

3357989
outputstream	inputstream
then you can write commands to the outputstream provided by its getoutputstream method - i presume you re already getting the output by reading its inputstream

3358055
x86	mips
some of the x86-specific stuff won t be relevant - in particular the step which translates x86 to a low-level intermediate representation is probably not necessary for mips mips is essentially just one basic operation per opcode already - but otherwise much of the content looks like it should be very useful

3358065
free	malloc
brk is the system call used on linux to implement malloc and free

3358072
free	malloc
on linux malloc and free are not system calls

3358072
free	malloc
malloc free obtains memory from the kernel by extending and shrinking if it can the data segment using the brk system calls as well as obtaining anonymous memory with mmap - and malloc manages memory within those regions

3358082

i had a location listener in ondestroy an because it was not initialized because of skipping oncreate it returned nullpointer

3358638
r5rs	r6rs
racket is ultimately based on r5rs and not r6rs and not a strict superset of either

3358638
r5rs	r6rs
most implementations offer extensions but are otherwise backwards compatible of course the compiler that comes with racket can also run in r5rs or r6rs mode

3358638
scheme	racket
valid r5 6rs scheme that runs in racket mode may either be rejected cause runtime errors or behave differently than it should

3358638
r5rs	r6rs
what racket calls letrec is called in r6rs and doesn t exist in r5rs what r5rs and r6rs call letrec doesn t exist in racket

3358638
r5rs	r6rs
and as equivalent r5rs does not but r6rs does
