jquery	scriptaculous
for simple js animations look at jquery or scriptaculous

10061
bluetooth	usb
i d like to be able to do this with the gps hooked up to a laptop by bluetooth or even just a usb cable

10061
pull	push
bonus points if you can show me some examples of using an api to push and pull data to and from the gps

10062
haskell	ocaml
so you might want to learn haskell ocaml or another functional language

10083
put	get
for these last ones i could always put .bat files on my path but that s going to get old fast.

10101
integer	unsigned
for example if you wanted to drop the left-most bit of an unsigned integer then you might try this as your mask

10103
int	chars
reads and writes of the following data types are atomic bool chars byte sbyte short ushort uint int float and reference types

10106
uniq	grep
unxutils for ls rm grep uniq sort .

10146
entity-relationship	diagram
i currently use toad data modeler i ve been using their beta cycles for a while now free and little to no bugs and they have a great html documentation tool that provides everything including entity-relationship diagram

10232
ant	maven
they do a great job for us and i would highly recommend using maven over ant

10232
ant	maven
that being said if you re already using ant it can be a little tricky to transition over to maven

10346
width	height
allows for auto width and auto height elements

10366
opera	safari
this works great in ie7 not at all in every other browser i ve tried ff2 ff3 opera 9.5 safari

10416
textmate	gedit
textmate is a great editor and there is a way to replicate some of the functionality in gedit

10416
textmate	gedit
check the article out here to modify gedit to behave like textmate

10478
firefox	safari
ideally i d like some function that can return the currently selected text in the browser window that works in ie7 and 6 if possible firefox 2 3 and safari 2

10485
width	height
try setting the height and width of the div and make sure it is on top by setting its z-index higher than everything else

10528
fink	macports
it s also available through macports and fink

10532
postgresql	mysql
i ve been using php mysql for ages and am about to start using postgresql instead

10536
lisp	scheme
however common lisp is very different from scheme

10536
lisp	scheme
as you mentioned sicp is for learning scheme not lisp or at least not common lisp and not emacs lisp

10634
mbunit	cruisecontrol.net
i currently use nant cruisecontrol.net cruisecontrol.net svn mbunit

10684
solaris	sunos
it no longer occurs in solaris sunos 5

10714
cpu	processors
the asp.net worked thread afaik doesn t come from the thread pool and shouldn t get affected by your call to the remoting service unless this is a very slow processors and your remoting function is very cpu intensive - in which case everything on your computer will be affected

10748
perforce	cvs	cvs	rcs
i ve used rcs cvs sccs sourcesafe vault perforce subversion and git

10809
listview	gridview
listview much better than the gridview dataview in that they let you write out clean html

10846
lxml	elementtree
i ve also use lxml and pyxml and i find elementtree nice because it s a standard module

10856
ienumerable	iqueryable
it s not that they were deliberately not allowed on datatables it s just that datatables pre-date the iqueryable and generic ienumerable constructs on which linq queries can be performed

10870
move	drag
once the user drag over one of these areas i call dragmanager.acceptdrag this from a dragevent.drag_over handler but if the user then move out of this area i d like to change the status of the drag to not accepted and show the dragmanager.none feedback

10926
sorting	filtering
filtering and sorting are the main reason

10949
accessor	properties
that i haven t needed to write hundreds of public properties or other accessor

11034
versioning	upgrade
definitely upgrade to tfs 2008 and visual studio 2008 as it is the v2 versioning of team system in every way

11163
nunit	mstest
nunit mstest ect all do pretty mutch the same thing

11201
prepare	execute
what i d probably do is just prepare several queries and execute the right one depending on what i ended up needing

11288
sorting	filtering
so wpf doesn t support standard sorting or filtering behavior for views of compositecollections so what would be a best practice for solving this problem

11288
sorting	filtering	put	get
i d get all the default view sorting and filtering behavior on my new composite object collection and i d be able to put a data template on it to display my list items properly depending on which type is actually stored in that composite item

11305
vb6	vba
i m a newbie when it comes to xml since i m stuck in vb6 and vba because of the field i work in

11312
nstextview	nsresponder
note that this is an inherited nsresponder method not a nstextview method

11471
sorting	filtering
i m not yet very familiar with wpf but i see this as a question about sorting and filtering collections

11615
entity-relationship	diagram
there s a lot of here s normalization here s entity-relationship diagram have at it but not much in the way of real examples

11664
anjuta	gnome
anjuta for gtk gnome

11819
ubuntu	linux
i have warehouse installed on a linux machine running the ubuntu server edition nginx for the http server and mongrel cluster

11857
put	get
i would like to gauge what solutions other people put in place to get team system functionality

11960
post	get
yes it s ugly but it ll get you going until someone post something nicer

11970
vmware	esx
i ve only had experience with vmware esx and while it s a fairly expensive product it is also very powerful

11994
getter	setter
all properties do is give you a concise syntax for specifying both the getter and setter in a single line and allow you to synthesize their implementation

11994
getter	setter
that s generally a good pattern with properties only ever touch the underlying instance variable for a property in initializers in -dealloc and in the getter and setter for the property

12047
post	get
wow - ok - will get a post on this but will be big

12055
post	get
again sorry for the long post but i wanted to get the code here so we can discuss this

12087
opera	safari
there are various workarounds at the moment but they re different between ie and fx i don t know about safari opera etc

12093
ienumerable	ienumerator
every time you use yield you get a whole new class that implements both ienumerable and ienumerator clever optimisation unreadable code

12130
onsubmit	onblur
using onblur and the form s onsubmit event in conjunction could be a better solution

12144
config	ini
at the moment every application we distribute is using it s own ad-hoc config files whether it s property files ini style xml or json internal use only at the moment

12161
config	ini
usually this is handled by an ini file or xml config file

12161
config	ini
having config files in the database is ok but it does tie you to the database and creates an extra dependancy for your app that ini xml files solve

12194
config	ini
we are using ini style config files

12248
put	get
and with the now very small amount of application specfic code they get put into company.applications.applicationname this helps me really think about business objects a lot more since i dont want too much within this namespace so i come up with more flexible designs

12313
nant	cruisecontrol
nant is far far easier to set up your build to do automatic testing deploy to multiple production environments integrate with cruisecontrol for an entry environment integrate with source control

12349
folder	directory
i didn t reinstall php i just copied all of the dlls in the ext folder to my php extensions folder as specified in the extension_dir variable in php.ini and i copied the versions of libeay32.dll and ssleay32.dll from the php download into my system32 directory

12351
width	height
i can permit things like width height 1+1 3

12353
atexit	main
it is also responsible of calling any code that should run after main like atexit

12408
stdout	stderr
as others have said this entry point will not be main but will instead be a part of the runtime library - it will do things like initialising static objects setting up the argc argv parameters setting up stdin stdout stderr etc

12509
rss	feed
its feed rather than rss

12515
rss	feed
there are a lot of rss feed readers out there that people are used to using and most importantly rss is very well known and has been around much longer

12524
rss	feed
personaly i have a large number of rss feed that i generate myself

12553
cvs	svn
but more importantly it s plain text which means it s really easy to manage with our vcs cvs svn git etc. and it can easily live right there with the code -- so there s no excuse for not updating the documentation as you develop

12561
mouse	keyboard
though they re mostly targeted at automating administration tasks or shortcuts for users autohotkey and autoit let you automate nearly anything you want as far as mouse keyboard interaction

12568
rss	feed
vincent i m not suggesting that anyone rewrite existing rss feed just for the sake of it that would be a big waste of time

12568
rss	feed
in terms of rss being the acronym that defines the category i m guessing that most users now identify with the orange feed icon rather than the specific flavour of xml behind it

12586
rss	feed
the rss brand very much defines the entire feed category though so on the rare occasion that someone does know enough to choose they will tend to choose rss because it s got the name. they will also tend to choose rss 2.0 because it s got the bigger number

12586
rss	feed
rss and especially rss 2.0 are very much entrenched in the feed industry. atom hasn t taken off because it doesn t bring much except a new name

12642
webclient	webrequest
i have tried both webclient and webrequest both have their problems

12671
button	checkbox
since the two pages are separate i can t call the modalpopupextender from the aspx.cs code i can t reach the list of checkbox from the ascx.cs code and i don t see a way to populate my session variable and then programmatically activate some other hidden button or control which will then open my modal popup

12700
hide	show
the modalpopupextender uses javascript and dhtml to show and hide the controls in the usercontrol client-side

12703
config	ini
if your app s config is simple then something simple like an ini file that s read into a dictionary is probably fine

12703
config	ini
but for something more complex like server config an ini file would be a huge pain to maintain and something more structural like xml or yaml would be better

12716
put	get
some google research indicates i could #import mscorlib.tlb or put it in path but i can t get that to compile either

12762
collabnet	svn
but as others have said there are now more friendly packages containing the svn stuff - visualsvn server so badly named it makes me weep and the collabnet distribution - the later is apache only and is hand rolled on the thighs of virgins which means that it always seems to appear about three weeks later than everyone else

12896
pecl	pear
and before i get pointed at pear pecl i need actual code

12910
mouseover	mouseout
for instance if you change enter and leave to mouseover and mouseout your events fire with no problem

12928
pascal	delphi
in pascal delphi

12961
profiler	visualvm
it s also worth noting that starting with jdk 1.6 update 7 there is now a bundled profiler called visualvm which can be launched with jvisualvm

13123
mbunit	nunit
i think you can do this with the row test attribute available in mbunit and later versions of nunit where you could specify several sets to populate one unit test

13130
keydown	keyup
even if you capture the keydown keyup event those are the only events that the tab key fires you still need some way to prevent the default action moving to the next item in the tab order from occurring

13218
slug	permalinks
some people call them slug wordpress also permalinks

13271
profiler	yourkit
facing the same problem i used yourkit profiler

13277
junit	testng
testing - junit testng

13277
hudson	bamboo
there are also bamboo plugins for findbugs pmd and checkstyle but as noted the free hudson ci server has those too

13295
multiplying	add
if i have to add five numbers and multiplying then get a percentage i ll do each step on it s own line

13355
pop-up	dialog
it s annoying when i drag a window to another monitor and then if the application generates a pop-up dialog or spawns another window if that pop-up dialog gets displayed back on the primary monitor

13359
translation	localization
there is no way you should be doing this and i see this as a fault in your translation process i am an ex-localization engineer and ex-developer of localization tools

13435
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
the increment in the original foreach loops will not affect the contents of the arrays the only way to do this remains a for-loop

13455
cvs	svn
i would definitely choose svn over cvs if only because people who learned source control using cvs tend to use svn delete then svn add instead of svn move

13566
post	put
edit the preview seems to showing the links ok but when i submit the post they are all wrong so i ve had to put the urls inline

13586
interpreted-language	compiled-language
defining standard functions methods in the interpreted-language or performing the processing of those calls in the compiled-language in which the interpreter is written

13590
jquery	scriptaculous
if all you need is a sortable list then a simple scriptaculous list or jquery list with a quick webmethod callback should fit the bill quite nicely and you can obviously stick this into your own user control

13594
opera	firefox
firefox and opera ignore the o and set the max length to 2 while internet explorer ignores the field altogether

13627
ironruby	ironpython
so from jython and jruby you can easily access java code and from ironpython and ironruby you can easily access .net code

13643
lisp	smalltalk
the last twenty years of evolution in interpreters can be seen as going the other way - polymorphism eg naive smalltalk metacircular interpreters to function pointers naive lisp implementations threaded code c++ to switch naive byte code interpreters and then onwards to jits and so on - which either require very big classes or in singly polymorphic languages double-dispatch which reduces the polymorphism to a type-case and you re back at stage one

13645
lwp	libwww-perl
lwp short for libwww-perl lets you connect to websites and scrape the html you can get the module here and the o reilly book seems to be online here

13688
floating-point	fixed-point
it s fast light-weight and can be configured to run with fixed-point numbers instead of floating-point since most microcontrollers don t have an fpu

13690
client-side	server-side
you can reduce the server-side load by performing this logic client-side

13757
ftp	smb	cifs	smb
if you mean if the server provides a protocol intended for file transfer such as ftp smb cifs etc. it ll be a lot easier

13758
post	get
you could also use it to easily compile a list of all used get post variables to help you eventually replace all occurrences of say return_url with _request return_url

13809
versioning	upgrade
i m all for pushing users to upgrade to the newest available versioning of ie since problems improve with every release however i m also against telling people to upgrade or change their browsers

13809
versioning	upgrade
unless of course you re developing an internal application then i d say everyone should upgrade to the newest available versioning

13817
profiling	benchmarking
also it provides a profiling that will benchmarking your code and provide pie-charts execution time etc

13851
opera	firefox
in opera and firefox the header and the menu are neatly attached to eachother

13914
firefox	safari
this code works in safari ie and firefox - hope it s of some help

13918
onkeyup	onkeydown
you can do this by adding onkeyup onkeydown etc

14006
getter	setter
need to attach logic to a getter setter

14165
min	max
i m seeing strange errors when my c++ code has min or max calls

14169
min	max
check if your code is including the windows.h header file and either your code or other third-party headers have their own min max definitions

14177
min	max
scope it dude std min std max

14194
firefox	safari
i would launch with it working in firefox ie7 and safari and look at who goes to your site

14247
actionscript	mxml
i ve gathered that you can t have it both ways -- that is to say have the class functionality in a separate actionscript class file but have the contained elements declared in mxml

14261
actionscript	mxml
if you write your own reusable components then writing them in actionscript may sometimes give you a little more control but for non-reusable views mxml is much better

14261
actionscript	mxml
this is what makes manual bindings in actionscript a little less convenient than those in mxml

14261
getter	setter
the currentemployee could be made into a getter setter pair and implemented like this only showing the setter

14373
cvs	svn
i am converting from existing cvs repository to svn repository

14373
cvs	svn
that is cvs head becomes a normal branch and cvs brancha becomes svn trunk

14373
cvs	svn
both cvs and svn repositories will be on same linux machine

14373
cvs	svn
also conversion where cvs brancha becomes svn trunk and all other cvs branches are ignored might be enough

14383
cvs	svn
it s been a while since i ve done a cvs - svn conversion and probably even longer since i did one with a nontrivial branch structure

14410
vim	emacs
pretty much every other editor that isn t a vi descendant vim cream vi-emu seems to use the emacs shortcuts ctrl + w to delete back a word and so on

14424
put	get
i ve used it a couple of times to get some decent looking class diagrams to put in presentations blogposts etc

14603
cvs	svn
i m thinking svn and cvs aren t friendly enough to non-technical users but i m curious now as to the possibly uses for version control for non-engineering projects.

14630
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
this is due to the fact that files from subversion can be checked out on both case-sensitive file systems nix and case-insensitive file systems windows mac

14640
selecteditem	selectedindex
to set a default value just add the item to the combobox s collection and set the selectedindex or selecteditem to that item

14656
post	get
anytime we wish to perform a get that is not cachable or a post operation it will be performed over ssl

14661
cvs	svn
anything you can do with cvs can be done with the command line and i am pretty sure svn is the same

14718
manual	rcs
i personally use rcs for this type of thing - whilst it s got a manual aspect it s unlikely i want to push something to even the test server from my dev machine without testing it first

14796
ant	maven
a good start point could be this maven pluggin not for use it or maybe yes but this maven is build over ant task

14819
listview	gridview	gridview	repeater
use the listview - it gives you the features of the gridview combined with the styling flexibility of a repeater

14893
put	get
get any necessary additional resources - mostly things like documents images and reports that are associated with the project and put into directory from step 5

14909
client-side	server-side
i think it would be very helpful if the client-side and server-side code both saw the page the same way

14919
bazaar	git
i ll second eridius suggestion of git but i d expand it to the other drcs distributed revision control system such as mercurial and bazaar

14943
pop-up	dialog
i am using a form as a pop-up dialog to display a progress bar and i do not want the user to be able to close it

14968
getter	setter
i ve found using setter getter made my code easier to read

14980
public	protected
private fields with public or protected properties

14989
feedback	review
after you have a set of proposals then send them out to the team for feedback and review

15011
cruisecontrol	teamcity
cruisecontrol or teamcity is probably the best choice for this because they include a lot of tools you can use to make this step easier

15011
cruisecontrol	teamcity
cruisecontrol is free and teamcity is free to a point where you might have to pay for it depending on how big the project is

15028
ant	maven
2 ant maven

15028
trac	bugzilla
4 bugzilla trac

15035
gemini	bugzilla	trac	bugzilla	trac	gemini
issue tracking trac bugzilla gemini if it must be .net and free-ish

15045
nant	cruisecontrol
nant and cruisecontrol are staples of my environment

15072
redmine	trac
it s got trac redmine and subversion as well as several other unrelated ones

15091
lisp	smalltalk
technically ruby is more sophisticated than java or c# being closer to smalltalk in terms of oo purity and closer to lisp in terms of meta-programming facilities

15161
ncover	fxcop
check out these articles on continuous integration using msbuild cruisecontrol.net fxcop nunit ncover and subversion.

15177
folder	directory
if you re talking about scripts created by a user that will be run from that users crontab i typically put those in either a bin or scripts folder in the home directory or if they re intended to be shared between users a usr local scripts directory

15212
ienumerable	ilist
the list class implements the ilist and ienumerable interfaces so that you can easily iterate through them basically any way you want

15217
vim	emacs
getting it right is hard enough competing agains the likes of vi vim emacs would be extremely tough -- most people who use these editors are die hard fans and you d have to give them a compelling reason to move to another editor

15234
firefox	safari
performance even though great progress has been made with firefox and safari

15243
pop-up	dialog
i am using a form as a pop-up dialog to display a progress bar and i do not want the user to be able to close it

15261
ubuntu	debian
on debian and ubuntu the defaults are 28800 mysql kills connections after 8 hours but maybe the default for your platform is different or whoever administrates the server has configured things differently

15277
put	get
you can then put the re-usable sql code inside one of these or if you want to get really high tech you can use a library which does it for you

15286
post	get
if you find a log file but can t get any clues from it post it here

15362
trac	bugzilla
any of bugzilla trac or fogbugz will help you with your bug tracking and each offer an export feature so you can always change your mind later on

15412
srp	principles
an answer to a stack overflow question stated that a particular framework violated a plain and simple oop rule single responsibility principles srp

15412
srp	principles
now don t get me wrong - i believe srp to be the key to most good oo designs but i feel there are cases where this principles can and should be broken just like database normalization rules

15412
srp	principles
i aggressively push the benefits of srp and the great majority of my code follows this principles

15427
ant	maven
maven is a joy to use when it s working but as an old ant hacker i find maven to be hard to follow once things go wrong

15432
srp	principles
srp is a software engineering principles that can apply to the role of a class or a function or a module

15448
notepad	textpad
textpad replaces notepad for me

15476
folder	directory
i like my home directory to be clean at first glance with very few folder

15504
cvs	svn
i ve just setup a new project on sourceforge and the admins set it up with cvs as the scm however i want to use svn

15532
client-side	server-side
my only suggestion is to programmatically remove the dojotype on the server-side or client-side

15583
wan	lan
all of my visio experience is with lan wan documentation

15672
public	protected
public protected private and static properties of classes all work roughly as expected

15683
ubuntu	debian
this is my install scrpt i use it on debian servers but it will work in ubuntu ubuntu is built on debian

15731
post	get
i am looking for either a firefox extension or a similar program that allows you to craft get and post requests

15783
entity-relationship	diagram
now you should think of designing the database entity-relationship diagram class design dfds deployment etc

15810
folder	directory
you can set the build action copy to output directory property on individual files select the file and hit f4 to open the properties window to control what happens to them during build but not for folder

15902
png	ico
i like the free silk icons at famfamfam but they re png s and when i convert them to ico format they look pretty crappy

15928
onmouseover	onclick
either a library like jquery that has been mentioned or by modifying the suckerfish code to use onclick instead of onmouseover out

15947
coldfusion	railo
there s a swiss company called railo who are currently in the process of releasing an open source coldfusion engine that is affiliated with jboss

16071
aptana	radrails
edit for full disclosure i m biased toward aptana and radrails as i know a few members of the original radrails dev team

16086
aptana	radrails
i ve been using aptana eclipse radrails but if i were to do it again i d definitely try netbeans

16095
aptana	radrails
i have been using eclipse aptana radrails and unlike gaius have been pretty happy with it

16101
robocopy	xcopy
you can achieve that using tools like rsync unix or xcopy robocopy windows

16155
implements	extends
when i implements the ishipper interface i don t have to make the shipper object extends the vendor object that implements the ivendor interface

16164
rss	feed
i wondered if anyone can give an example of a professional use of rss atom feed in a company product

16169
rss	feed
they use rss feed for updates on your search

16180
rss	feed
sharepoint provides rss feed from its lists

16180
rss	feed
many faceted navigation products allow you to get an rss feed based on a selected filter

16180
rss	feed
for example you can navigate to view 24 lcd monitors on newegg.com and then get an rss feed of that view

16181
rss	feed
mantis bug tracker includes rss feed although i wish they were more configurable

16181
rss	feed
also we use mediawiki for documentation which has all sorts of rss feed including a per page watch and recent changes

16186
wxpython	pyqt
one of the fastest ways is to use python with a gui binding like pyqt pyfltk tkinter wxpython or even via pygame which uses sdl

16193
rss	feed
our website has a news page that i wrote an rss feed for as well

16215
switching	screens
i occasionally switching back to a monospace to disambiguate something but mostly find that a good clean sans-serif font is easiest to read and doesn t waste screens estate

16245
implements	extends
this allows you to both extends interfaces and also have a class that implements multiple interfaces both allowed and very useful in many cases without worrying about having to satisfy a particular constructor

16245
implements	extends
all shippers ups fedex etc now implements ishipper which extends ivendor and extends the abstract class shipper which has all common non-abstract methods for shippers defined in it getname getzip etc

16255
firefox	safari
safari and to a lesser extent firefox 3 have support for font-face in css which lets you use custom fonts

16305
rss	feed
i just added rss feed to the ticketing system i use at work ticketdesk and that feature should be in the next release of the product

16305
rss	feed
i m looking at implementing an rss feed for calls for service that our agency takes to provide the administrators a quick and easy way to see what has been going on

16381
equals	gethashcode
gethashcode should be a lot quicker than equals but doesn t need to be unique

16408
hash	md5
the md5 hash you re using has 128 bits with billions and billions of possible hash

16454
spaces	delimiter
then move on to state again use the spaces as the delimiter

16455
accessor	properties
what that means in the long run is that when you come back to make a change to your string format you will either have the ability to pop in and make a few adjustments to the format string or wrinkle your brow and start moving around all kinds of properties accessor mixed with text which is more likely to introduce problems

ienumerable	ilist
and if you don t even need everything in ilist you can always use ienumerable too

17179

this will allow me to do generic processing on almost any array in the .net framework unless it uses ienumerable and not ilist which happens sometimes

17233

mainly i like the form view and listview the gridview still needs some work

this one takes most of what has already been mentioned into consideration but includes hex and octal numbers negative scientific infinity and has removed decimal scientific 4e3.2 is not valid

19079
coalesce	isnull
terrapin there are a few other differences between isnull and coalesce that are worth mentioning besides ansi compliance which is a big one for me

19398
put	get	goto	break
you can put in a conditional statement or several and when conditions are met properly you can use a goto statement to get out of all the loops instead of having a break statement at each level of nesting with a conditional statement for each

19403
goto	break
they are not adding a real goto but extending the break keyword to use static labels

19404

then you don t have to worry about using multiple break statements or goto d

19419

it goes through methods for doing this in mysql postgresql microsoft sql server ibm db2 and oracle the following is copied from that link

19433
mp3	flac
re-encoding audio file from flac - mp3 or vice versa

visualvm should be the profiler from netbeans as standalone

19732
int	boolean
use int instead of boolean

19732
128bit	64bit	x86	64bit
in principle such a thing could be written cmpxchg the underlying processor instruction can operate on 8 16 32 and 64bit operands on x86 8 16 32 64 and 128bit operands on x64 but in practice most apis stick to pointer and double pointer 32 and 64bit on x86 64 and 128bit on x64 operands because they re all you really need

19767
yourkit	jprofiler
as mentioned both jprofiler and yourkit are both fairly good and not prohibitively expensive

19793
ostream	istream
the best thing to do is create public print ostream and read istream functions

19796
jlist	jtable
i d probably be looking to use a jtable rather than a jlist and since the default rendering of a checkbox is rather ugly i d probably be looking to drop in a custom tablemodel cellrenderer and celleditor to represent a boolean value
