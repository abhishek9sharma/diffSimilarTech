if you re not getting errors in your php error log about failing to allocate memory and you re not seeing other problems with your server running out of ram such as extreme performance degradation due to memory pages being written to disk for demand paging you probably don t need to really worry about it

joystick	keyboard	hid	keyboard	hid	joystick
your best option is to buy a joystick keyboard so that you can read the device usb hid as a non-keyboard non-mouse as keyboards and mice are restricted by os non-bypass-able because it s hard coded into the device management.

13924176
mouse	keyboard
a program can access more or less every device both input and output except for the keyboard and mouse which microsoft has deliberately blocked from this api

13924176
mouse	keyboard
it does provide access to the mouse and keyboard data but not as individual devices

13924176

gunicorn	uwsgi
if you use wsgi and your process is being watched by a controller like supervisord gunicorn uwsgi or similar then you can simply send yourself a sigint or sigquit depending on controller

13924224
puts	gets
so i wouldn t recommend the signal method unless all you do is set a flag in the signal handler which later gets checked by some other function which puts you back in the same place as the threaded version

13924231
int	boolean
you need to convert your boolean expressions into int 1 for true and 0 for false then compare them to 1 to get a boolean again

13924253
spaces	delimiter
ngclass is looking for an angular expression to get evaluated with the result of the evaluation can be a string representing spaces delimiter class names an array or a map of class names to boolean values.

13924316
ilist	icollection
to fix this error either change the json to a json object name value or change the deserialized type to an array or a type that implements a collection interface icollection ilist like list that can be deserialized from a json array

13924316
ilist	icollection
i ve tried setting the observablecollection s to ilist icollection s to no avail

if you want to create a key from a password choose a character-encoding convert your password to that encoding and feed the result together with a salt and iteration count in a function like pbkdf2

13924332
classname	inherited
you can use the classname binding inherited from ember.view to set a css class on the element and define your css styles on it display block

13924337
equals	gethashcode
the alternative solution is to implement on employeeinfo or overriding equals gethashcode and the equality operator

13924362
couchbase	couchdb
as a third option it looks like couchbase server 2 is also based on couchdb but has the clustering built on amongst other features

13924388
opera	firefox
i have a java applet that works totally fine in eclipse but when i export it to a jar-file embed it in a html and open it with opera or firefox the key listener does not work properly

13924388
opera	firefox
as i said the applet works fine when run in eclipse but when run it in firefox opera the player starts running after hitting the d -key then the applet loses focus while the player keeps running

13924392
getter	setter
here is a quote from trying to learn understand ruby setter and getter methods

13924399
margin	height
if it s likely your content is going to be different sizes then you can use jquery to calculate its height and dynamically set its margin

13924402
margin	height
you need to set a negative top margin which should be 50 of the height of the div

13924413
debian	linux
in gnu linux debian squeeze i have installed the libsndfile1 libraries and the program compiles without problem

google-chrome	firefox
but when i deploy this to a remote server ibm was v8.0.0.5 and open the app using google-chrome firefox ie8 the follwoing happens

13924417
int	double
you may have some int to double conversions that you need to explicitly cast to get the position part of the code to run right not common in vba but it happens when the runtime engine guesses wrong

13924419
coalesce	nvl
another approach might be to use coalesce instead of nvl since the syntax for coalesce is the same in both oracle and sql server

13924451
portrait	landscape
in my project i have 1 single viewcontroller slide i want to enable both landscape and portrait in

13924451
portrait	landscape
see the scheme below where the viewcontroller i want to enable both landscape portrait is named referredviewcontroller

13924451
portrait	landscape
referredviewcontroller can then rotate both portrait landscape and the rest of the project is locked in portrait

13924493
google-chrome	firefox
but if you view with google-chrome firefox or ie9 or above you ll see them on different rows or single row depending on the browser width

13924499
portrait	landscape
until then your view will be in portrait mode even if you only support landscape in your app or your app is already in landscape mode

13924499
viewdidload	viewwillappear
since viewdidload occurs before viewwillappear orientation layout changes haven t occured yet

i have tried everything the codes runs fine on google-chrome safari firefox but when i test it on ie8

13924578
daemons	systemd
if you are running on a numa systemd then using numactl to run your daemons with an interleave policy will probably fix your issue

13924600
getter	setter
however looking at this code from the cancan wiki i see that both the setter and the getter are actually doing something to the variable in it

13924601
subtract	add
when i try to change the order of the items i find the next or previous if there s no next item and get it s priority then i add or subtract one and set the priority of the moved item to the result

13924607
google-chrome	firefox
as i said in google-chrome works great but in firefox not at all the part of login works fine it actually call the post method and log in but the part of getting the data with the function data doesn t works

13924627
getter	setter
that is the wrong way to think about getter and setter

13924627
getter	setter
it is usually advisable for the getter and setter to take return the same type of value and affect report the object state in a consistent way

13924644
calendarview	spinner
however i am noticing that the calendarview s title december 2012 as it would be for today doesn t change immediately when the year is set in the spinner s

13924644
calendarview	spinner
furthermore if the month is changed in the spinner s then the calendarview is updated immediately

i ve tried using setinterval and settimeout but for some reason i get the below digits that don t even update

13924790
hash	salt
here is how i generated the password hash and salt

13924880
int	double
more generally the exact value of a double always has the form where a and b are int and represents exponentiation

13924943
nullpointerexception	classcastexception
your function should be as below to avoid any kind of exception such as classcastexception or nullpointerexception

13924985
super	self
but super a self .get_unit_display doesn t work

13924995
super	implements
it s really basic and not super powerful and there are things like communicate with databases and such that i d like to implements that aren t possible convenient with js

13925023
google-chrome	firefox
updated code works for me in google-chrome firefox

13925027
post	get
coz i am doing the same and im getting my querystring and the trick for that is you have to pass that in alongwith your get or post call like following

13925034
hide	show
i have a select menu that show or hide list items depending on id

13925071
sorting	grouping
the easiest thing i think would be to create a fetched results controller on grouping and to add an intermediary object of your own that remaps those to sections and supplies group.objects with a suitably deterministic sorting applied as the rows per section

13925082
superclass	subclassing
you should be able to override any method on a superclass by creating a method with the same name on the subclassing

13925090
hide	show
since mysql workbench v5.2.22 it can be set through preferences whether to show or hide such values

13925107
int	boolean
the boolean return type of the isxxx functions would get promoted to an int and added to the counts as either 0 false or 1 true

13925148
avasset	avurlasset
additional info #5 not sure if this is important but the hasprotectedcontent method returns yes for the avasset and avurlasset if i convert

13925156

edit interesting side-note did some testing and seems there s a bug in google-chrome 23 and internet explorer 9 and opera 12.11 that makes it load just once

13925172
ubuntu	linux
it works in linux ubuntu

13925177
accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
it s generally advisable to not use the ivar for setting the properties but rather use the properties s accessor

13925177
accessor	properties
by the way that reference to use accessor methods to set properties values is a roundabout answer to your main question at least if you were ever tempted to use that local variable to change the value of the properties

13925177
accessor	properties
you should only be using the object setter accessor for changing a properties s value

13925189
awt	swing
i m assuming the means anything under the awt and swing directory

13925225
ant	maven
you could use the maven ant plugin to run an ant script that did the copying or use the maven resources plugin which seems aimed at your exact use case of copying stuff to the output directory

13925229
centos	linux
if you happen to be on a linux distribution that includes selinux such as centos you need to make sure selinux permissions are set correctly for your document root files or you will get this error

i already know backbone.js and zepto is pretty much same as jquery so i was thinking about using this combination and packaging it with phonegap

13925315
for-loop	loops
then you can loops through them with a for-loop

13925352

just keep rebasing topic on top of master and when done fast-forward merge master to topic push master

13925361
min	max
suppose i wanted to create a record type that represents acceptable min max bounds

13925392
cpython	pypy
switching from cpython to pypy may solve that automatically and it also means you ll get the pure python implementation whether you want it or not

13925465
udp	tcp
a single io_service object can be shared among a multitude of networking objects -- tcp udp resolves sockets timers and any other beast that takes an io_service object reference

13925465

13925554
post	get
in this file get a list of countries from mysql table based on the state name you post with ajax

13925664
width	height
for the first div it would be pretty easy since i could use jquery to get the width and height of the div and compute the corner coordinates

13925693
post	get
if you are trying to get the caption while in a post you can echo it out inside your the_post_thumbnail tag

13925724

13925938
sorting	filtering
i am a complete programming novice having an issue of trying to get ajax data appropriately into an existing table structure on my main page without losing the separate java script functionality of the table sorting filtering etc.

13925938
sorting	filtering
file not shown here that gives it the ability of sorting filtering etc

13925938
sorting	filtering
in the table body section results in loss of that separate scripting sorting filtering etc functionality of the table although the data itself is displayed in a table format by virtue of table.php and does update correctly via the ajax script

13925947
xmltype	clob
for example place the text into a clob and then use xmltype and extract to get the elements out using an xpath query see for example this question

13925952
jar	war
setting the scope to provided totally avoids the jar from being pushed into war s lib

13925979
firefox	safari
btw the same occurs in safari and firefox

which i use to show and hide a div at the top of my page that bring down the entire page

13926104
post	get
i tried read a few post regarding about the issue i still can t really get what s the cause of it

13926112
width	height
the image would have to repeat to fill up the width and height of the div

13926112
width	height
my initial thought was whenever i rollover a div with that class i dynamically create an absolute positioned div that has the same exact width and height of the div i m rolling over and that new div has the transparent repeating background image

13926150
children	parent
will call the method in parent class and print the parent are the children of the grandparents and they are the sub sub class for family

13926174
width	height
you may set dimensions to each from the remote file via attribute then set autosize true and remove the width and height options to get a dynamic size

13926245
hide	show
it is a multipage form using the hide show method and that does not work either since that function is in he form.submit code

13926273
children	parent
the parent are the children of the grandparents and they are the sub sub class for family

13926295
button	checkbox
but i d suggest using radio button instead because checkbox allows user to select both options

13926319
wxpython	pyqt	wxpython	pygtk
pyqt piside pygtk and wxpython all have webkit widgets

13926377
loops	if-statement
the part where i m getting confused is the first if-statement in the while loops

13926377
loops	if-statement
yet the if-statement in the while loops is testing if the found boolean array is set to true and if it is true run the code in the if-statement

13926402

int	double
both are array objects - remember everything in java with the exception of the basic numeric types like int double and so on are objects

13926592
free	malloc
however note that in c c++ allocating an array using malloc new means you also have to free it which is something you don t have to do in java since it will reclaim the array for you

13926701
post	get
to use the refresh_token to get a new access_token make a post request to

13926729

13926739
post	get
when i want to query post count for each person it takes a long time to process since it needs to iterate over each person and query each post to get the aggregation

13926740
superclass	subclassing
running the above code illustrates that jackson writes the superclass fields even though the runtime instance is of the subclassing type

13926740
superclass	subclassing
on the other hand if you declare the fields as the subclassing type then set the using as the superclass

13926749
google-chrome	firefox
since it appears the issue is not firefox related but something in the asp.net web server since it happens in google-chrome as well i ve asked a different question and will close this one

13926754
hash	md5
hash are tried in this order blowfish md5 multiple des

13926754
crypt	md5
since your string starts with 1 which is for crypt using md5 that is what it ended up using

13926754

13926783
put	get	post	get	post	put
it has all the methods get post put and delete

13926793
implements	extends
if you re stuck having to use a view that can only be configured the way to need via its programmatic constructor you could just include the view from your activity_main.xml but the view isn t what you need it to be unless you construct it yourself like with offline tile maps using osmdroid s mapview then you re stuck extends that view and implements that view s constructor that includes the attributeset

13926793
super	extends	super	implements	implements	extends
for example i had to extends the osmdroid mapview then implements my offline map tile source from the super entirely

the uibutton and the uilabel was addsubviewed in the sysumycalloutimageview

13926874

a common pattern is to have two widgets with and equal weight to make them equally sized inside the parent container where you don t care about the actual size width or height

13926914
matlab	simulink
i am not sure if this capability exists either in matlab or simulink

13926926
hex	binary
for converting a binary hash value to a string use base64 or hex encoding

13927057
width	height
i want to mention on both screens height and width of image view is same

13927070

udp	tcp
supports multiple protocols like http s messaging tcp udp smtp etc

13927094
put	get	post	get	post	put
any browser can be used because the rest approach uses the standard get put post and delete web operations

13927133
children	parent
i ve set it up so that the child array controller only contains the children of the selected parent and the grandchild array controller only contains the grandchildren of the selected child

13927133
children	parent
when i add childs or grandchilds to these arraycontrollers they are automatically set as children of the currently selected parent

13927151
unsigned	short
jchar is defined as unsigned short not wchar_t

my webpage works great on both google-chrome and firefox but not on all versions of internet explorer

13927553
post	get
i finally figured it out and made a post on msdn forums regarding what else needs to be done to get this working

13927579
min	max
just that traverse the array grab first point s y value as current min and max and compare all the others

13927593
valgrind	glibc
i do not have valgrind on my machine yet would require rebuilding glibc with debug flag

13927631
int	double
you can fix this by removing the cast operators int and double

13927644
put	get
so i get 1 data from my table and put it on like that

13927652
mp3	wav
it supports wav files by default but you will need smpeg library along with some more complex lines of code to make mp3 s work

13927656
google-chrome	firefox
i get an infinite loop too much recursion on firefox and stack_overflow on google-chrome

13927751

13927815
put	get
this is some thing i want to do but unable to get how to put in front of case because it is not appropriate as per switch case rules

13927826
getter	setter
think of them as very pretty getter and setter rather than a binding to a database

13927826
getter	setter
they are an activerecord convention is defined on your model but for example if you want to have a string on your foo model you define that in your migration and the appropriate getter and setter will be available on your model for you to play with this string

13927881
portrait	landscape
on one of the screens i have set the orientation of the activity as landscape and there it works fine whereas all the other screens having portrait orientation are turning blank on loading

13927895
listview	gridview
this would have to be done through a data control like the gridview or listview

13927935
setinterval	settimeout
also i think you d be better off with setinterval in this situation instead of using an infinite settimeout loop

13928008
width	height
positions don t change depending on width height of other elements

13928028
width	height
alternatively you could use windowfrompoint to determine if there s a window at 0 0 and x-1 y-1 where x and y are the width and height of the screen and if so if they re the same window

13928088
filesystems	fat
how long it actually takes will heavily depend on the filesystems you are using ext3 ext4 fat ... and of course on the speed of your hard disks and hard disk connections your motherboard

13937487
getter	setter
you can do this by offering a setter and getter which use the mutex in order to protect the member

13937487
getter	setter
obviously myclass itself should only access that member with those setter getter itself

i use the same command to uppercase all orm classes and to capitalize the class names in the factory

13937575

13938051
client-side	server-side
i think the best way to approach it would be to think about how to achieve it on the client-side and then move to the server-side once you re happy with how things are being displayed rendered using dummy data

13938125
folder	directory
say you had a base source file that you wanted in each directory we ll call it main.cpp you could create the folder like so

13938138
short	base
my situation is a bit of a special case but long story short i have a scenario where it is safe to cast from a base entity to the derived entity and is also safe to cast from a list of derived entities to a list of base entities or vice versa

13938370
post	get
the redirection works but all the original post http requests get redirected as get and so all the parameters from the original post request are lost

13938386
post	get
it will not be possible to hide a parameter using a get request link if you used a form post then it would be hidden from the user

13938387

once the website was moved into the iframe clicking the link in ie not firefox or google-chrome i would get the ever-so-helpful error

your version isn t working because i expects an int and you re feeding it a pointer to chars

13938711
post	get
coming back to the core of your question you re certainly experiencing the post redirect get pattern which can be considered incompatible with the http specifications depending on how it s implemented and on which redirection codes you re using

13938711
post	get
besides the possible arguments regarding the correctness or usefulness of the post redirect get pattern you should fix this by not using a redirect but posting to an https uri directly it s often better to use relative urls within your site once you re using https

13938719
equals	gethashcode
not sure about the overhead of calling gethashcode a few million times but comparing two ints is probably going to be a lot quicker than the equals object method

i tried with sin function or cos function but it work sonly if x or y point is the same for both start and end point

13938964

13938975

i tried setting margin padding text-indent to 0 but no avail

13938996

both clients and server works with udp port 45454 and tcp port 8888

13939285
ostringstream	std
all you ve determined is that std string is probably smaller in size than std ostringstream and so it doesn t fill up the stack as quickly

13939361
range	minimum
you have to check the rand api for your language framework of choice but most rand functions will return a float between 0 and 1 by default with overloads for minimum maximum value range

13939361
min	max
and the latter call with min max can be coded by you pretty easily if it s not available

13939367
prng	random
there are many ways to implement prng but unfortunately none of them is real random number generator

13939370

you can alter the sz parameter to indicate the width height of the rendered image for example

13939812
gridview	sqldatasource
the select columns and the update parameters should match in order to update using sqldatasource that means if you select query or procedure is returning 3 fields in gridview then all of them should be the parameter for the update you can miss out the actual updations in database if not required but the should have all the fields say for example if below is my select query

13939864

int	chars
most of the fields are int and varchar each of varchar less than 32 chars

13940163
multiplying	multiplication
the original purpose of gpu s was to multiplying matricies as fast as possible because that is the primary type of computation involved in graphics rendering. since matrix multiplication is an embarrasingly parallel problem each output value is computed completely independently of every other output value and the code path for each of those computations is identical chip space can be saved by having several alu s follow the instructions decoded by a single instruction decoder since they re all performing the same operations at the same time

13940163
addition	multiplication
since the primary computations performed in matrix multiplication are floating-point multiplication and floating-point addition gpu s are implemented such that each of these are single-cycle operations and in fact even contain a fused multiply-and-add instruction that multiplies two numbers and adds the result to a third number in a single cycle

13940178

as long as you set a fixed width and height and center it it should perform just as you want

so for example when i access an image in my image folder the link depends on how deep the page i m on in the directory structure is

13941243
graphics2d	bufferedimage
the basic flow is that i create a bufferedimage and graphics2d instances

13941443
oncreate	onstart
on your oncreate or onstart method you must register receiver

13941450
viewdidload	viewwillappear
the reason you canâ t is that the view size isnâ t definitely known until viewwillappear and since you use the size of scrollview when calculating the minimum zoom things might go wrong if we do it in viewdidload

13941452

as x-argument interestingly the splines class does create an interpolator but it still breaks when trying to interpolation extrapolate to a larger datetimeindex which is my final goal here

13941475
inherited	subclassing
your code doesn t match your description in the code b does not inherited from a whereas in your description it does but i think what you re saying is i have a large number of classes like a and a large number of classes that inherited from classes like a c in your example and there s a bunch of common stuff in those subclassing i d like to factor out into b in your example but it includes stuff that depends on the specific a calling an a method in your example and it defeats the whole point to have to make many b s one for each a mostly all alike.

13941483
hide	show
and even if you go into that category and hide created and show modified it still only impacts the article and not the category list view

the problem is that if you log in with some mechanism that does not involve a terminal such as gdm running on the console to start a gnome or kde or unity session then there s no login shell so .bash_login logout never get run

13941749
put	get
for that case the easiest is probably to put something in your .xsessionrc which will get run every time you start an x session which happens for any of those gui environments regardless of which one you run

13941772

apache	nginx
began life as a client-side cache or apache and nginx which are

13941917
apache	nginx
as for running apache and nginx on port 80 there are reasons why you might want to do this but remember that both are full-fledged web servers in their own right

13941917
apache	nginx
using nginx as the primary frontend webserver can increase performance even if you choose to keep apache running on the system

13941917
apache	nginx
and so it s common to find nginx handling images and other static components while leaving the dynamic heavy lifting to apache

13941921

i ve prefer to use post instead of get

13942338
google-chrome	firefox
i ve dug into it and the parse error is because phantomjs thinks that the jquery variable is uninitialized but the thing is the pages i am trying to load in phantomjs work perfectly fine in google-chrome ie and firefox so there is no parse error that i can see the code to load jquery is a boring script tag at the top of the head tag so nothing exciting there

13942340

i ve got the extjs folder in my web-inf directory shouldn t that mvc resources above fix that so i can reference it like so

13942370

then the program reads the video or audio stream from the other socket parses it into packets and then wraps each packet into one or more rtp packets which are sent over udp

13942370
rtsp	sdp
for rtsp you also need to serve an sdp header that describes the stream

13942404
width	height
the last case is the most interesting when you have some gradient set on an element it would be rendered at this element s height and width and that could be resource consuming sometimes

13942404
background-position	background-size
however there d be ones that are smaller or bigger than that and background-size would be perfect here â you could use the cover here to make this image fit the area well that s not with absolute values but it is really handy often with background-position 50 0 to make heads to be shown withou trimming in case of portrait photoes for usepics

you should create a suitable stream buffer and use a reasonably constructed std ostream with this custom stream buffer

13943369

children	parent	for-loop	arrays
i have a multidimensional arrays but the id s are unique across parent and children so i have a problem looping through using a for-loop

13943825
glfw	glew
i initially was using glload and glfw from the unofficial glsdk but then i decided to do away with glload which meant that i had to use glew in order to get at the modern headers

13943825
glfw	glew
i have included glew before glfw as per the instructions

the performance depends of the browser as firefox implementation of indexedb api is much more ahead than google-chrome or ie

13943940
google-chrome	firefox
comparing to google-chrome implementation where idb is implemented on the top of leveldb which is nosql is much more slower comparing to firefox

13943940
google-chrome	firefox
on the another end websql depreciated is performing fast in google-chrome in firefox not supported anymore

13943947

mouse	keyboard
in short think of any inputs that would affect the application mouse clicks keyboard smashing sending it messages and then record what the outputs are

13944711
getter	setter
the performance loss for setter and getter is negligible

13944711
getter	setter
using a setter or getter requires one property call more than accessing the field directly

13944711
getter	setter
and have getter and setter in the public interface but within a

13944735
getter	setter
as of the documentation found here using a getter and setter is a bad idea in android

13944749

if the intent is to return a single value there would need to be an aggregate-functions sum in the select list

13945065
subclass	abstract-class
coding to interface provides reusability and polymorphism.as far as class implements interface the interface or abstract-class can be passed to parameter instead of class that implements the interface.urs common technical problem is handled vis designing interface and abstract-class and implementing it and giving subclass the specific functionality implementation.imagine its like framework.framework define interface and abstract-class and implement it that is common to all.and those that are abstract is implemented by client according to its own requirement

13945316
loops	while-loop
this code wraps the read in two while loops where the inner while-loop checks each file for new lines while the outter while-loop checks for new files

13945377
serializable	deserialization
the serializable runtime associates with each serializable class a version number called a serialversionuid which is used during deserialization to verify that the sender and receiver of a serializable object have loaded classes for that object that are compatible with respect to serializable

13945377
serializable	deserialization
however it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialversionuid values since the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations and can thus result in unexpected invalidclassexceptions during deserialization

13945386
width	height
also the width and height of the element have to be fixed

int	double
note that this assumes that basic4android follows the same casting rule from int to double as java numbers are rounded down to whole

13946152
getter	setter
by making the vector instance as private and providing setter as private with getter as public would be the correct path in my opinion

maven	pom.xml
explanation of the workaround if you try to install the addon using just mvn install and then reference the dependency in your pom.xml maven will complain about not finding the parent pom.xml for this library something like cannot find parent org.vaadin.alump fancylayouts for project thats why we have to delete the parent tag and rebuild the addon without it

hide	show
if possible i would then add hide to the custom create button to hide itself after being clicked and would want to show it again after clicking the inline update cancel command buttons

13950950
submit	submission
the submit button s value being sent with the form is an html thing apparently when doing the dom html forms module it just didn t occur to anyone to say hey we should have a property on the form that only exists during the form submission event that tells you what submitted the form. it probably should have occurred to someone but apparently it didn t

13950976
folder	directory
please install the chrome to the default directory the chrome installations would automatically install the app to the default folder

13951459
int	chars
now i know that assigning an int to a chars variable is all right is okay

13951459

after all the right hand side is still an int so assigning an int to a chars variable should work just fine

13951508
width	height
when i load svg image inside a div with certain width and height in android phonegap the image displays full screen covering all the other div rather than in its designated div and cannot proceed further

13951527

13954888
versioning	upgrade
the problems i have found with installshield is it is relative expensive to license and once you start using it you become hooked into paying out more money to upgrade it or get the latest versioning because the person who used it last is no longer around license keys have gone astray there are not enough license keys anyway a license key that used to work no longer does for some strange reason...etc etc

put	get
now the issue is the client can of course fake step number 3 by submitting a wrong userid to my server - for example if my server responds to the request and the user manages to get the fb-userid of someone else he could just put that into the request and he d get the data that belongs to someone else

the populated iframe plus the white space around it encompass the original width and height of my iframe before being shrunk by transform and zoom

13955493
action-filter	onactionexecuting
a bit late to answer your question but i imagine that what is happening is you are setting the current thread culture in the onactionexecuting method of an action-filter but model binding happens prior to that so it doesn t pick up your change

13955763
firefox	safari
in my case the worker also runs in firefox with the safari user.agent option

13955764

for example to get list of things for tableview i need to put category subcategory filter and 5 more parameters into request

13955939
onclick	onmousedown
if you got here from google this is probably what you want handle onmousedown instead of onclick

13955954
std	ostream
since member m_ostream is declared as non-reference the second line above attempts to make a copy of ostream which is not possible because the copy-constructor of std ostream is disabled by having made it private which is what you see in the error message cannot access private member.

13955971
post	get
in case of post request there is no as for me way to get the response

13956256
folder	directory
trying to list the directory and files within a specific folder

13956256
folder	directory
this folder will depend on the current user page.user which logs in by windows authentication ntlm and is retrieved from the active directory homedirectory property

13956281
rar	zip
here s an example of the file and folder structure that the class will use to be able to create a compressed archive zip rar gz whatever

13956281
folder	directory
as you can see the file and folder structure needs to be mantained in the backup file so the list of file and folder to be backupped has been structured so that if an array leaf contains a sub-array the leaf is a directory if a leaf contains no sub-arrays the leaf is a file

13956281
folder	directory
p.s added the current function that creates the folder and directory structure

13956348
hide	show
then when the jsp is loaded it has the parameters needed to know what to show hide

13956363

first and foremost the preferred thing to do is to implements runnable instead of extends thread

13956366
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it works il firefox google-chrome safari

13956366
width	height
i use the .load method because in webkit browsers the width and height are set after the image is loaded

13956366
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
but when i try to load another image when i click on a thumbnail the image doesn t work in safari and works in google-chrome and firefox

13956380

however i want to make them a bit more interesting and travel on a sin or cos wave a bit like galaxian did

13956399
equals	gethashcode
system.object declares the methods equals and gethashcode as well as other members

13956399
equals	gethashcode
if you override equals you have to override gethashcode as well in order to keep consistency

13956409
hide	show
but on the context of this specific crash doing show hide instead of add replace avoids multiple fast calls to oncreateview on the fragment

13956454
width	height
you need to add the height and width attributes to your scrollviewer

13956455
width	height
this code makes the entire page embed but you can adjust the width and height

13956539
button	checkbox
what i want to achieve is i want to give checkbox and radio button all individual names so instead of what i have now i can have the submit button outside the while-loop meaning there is only one submit button for all x20 checkbox radio button forms

13956543
width	height
use gtksizegroup to make like widgets in different tables request the same height and or width

13956554

i need to use bbterminators arrays outside the iterating for-loop for basic blocks

13956571

13956610
hide	fadeout
as fadeout is just hide that row but not really delete and the inner loop should use input type checkbox this

13956625
width	height
as a work around you can avoid being relaid out -- try placing both views inside a relativelayout and have them completely overlap by setting fill_parent on width and height to both

13956645
button	checkbox
to create a checkbox button assign it the style tbbs_checkbox or use a ccmdui object s setcheck member function in an on_update_command_ui handler

13956650
google-chrome	firefox

what you need is to set the width and height attributes as a user is typing within a text box

13956650
width	height
the em measurement is supposed to be a square representing the width and height that a single character takes up

13956650
width	height
this doesn t take kerning into account so the height of a char is usually accurate but the width is dependent on the chars around it

13956688
put	get
i put a breakpoint in this method and did not get stop here when the current password was incorrect

13956721
width	height
i have this problem in my really easy css file that i want to transform a div from 75px in height and width with hover but it seems to only change the width

13956757
qstring	qobject
name - an object name which can be set with qobject setobjectname qstring name

13956773
for-loop	loops
everything inside can stay the same because your radio buttons have unique names per while loops iteration and are grouped per for-loop iteration

13956827
implements	extends
i don t think cakephp implements anything similar to what you are looking for so you could try to create a helper for this purpose extends the form helper

13956847
jobs	cron
the cake way of using a cakephp application in cron jobs would be creating shell and then calling it as a cron job

13956866
next	except
each non-leaf entity owns a container it s a rb-tree in fact which contains the sched_entity s in next level task group it s sched_entity.my_q exactly except the sched_entity s which are associated with the real threads

13956890
cgpoint	cgrect
i actually want to get the minimal cgrect that contains all the cgpoint in that array

13956914
put	get
to get around this i put a placeholder popover on each page and populate that with some js when the site is loaded or if you want every time the menu button is clicked

13956930
google-chrome	firefox
firefox has a nice add on that enables you to adjust the page to a particular viewport so that you can see the changes pixel by pixel though im sure google-chrome would have something similar

guava	lambdaj
this way you have all the built-ins of a collection object plus you can also apache commons lambdaj or guava on top of it

13956984
range	max
note that this approach will always call arc4random once and require 1+n calls with a probability of 1 max n so for low range and high performance requirements you might consider a different algorithm to exclude the one index

13957002
pop-up	dialog
response doesn t have a value success so an emply alert dialog pop-up

13957060
post	get
i have implemented some rest webservices with netbeans ide but when testing the post request i get some exceptions like the following

13957356
post	put
i rewrote the post from memory and put it back on the site

13957377
width	height
if the source images are of uniform height and width already then resizing them whilst maintaining aspect is straightforward albeit increasing size will eventually lead to distortion

13957377
width	height
however if they are of varying height width you ll distort by just forcing them to a uniform size

13957377
width	height
best way to do this is probably find the center of the image and work out a width and height that s in the aspect you want from there

13957402
post	get

like said in the previous post i had 2 attributes color strength which i needed to match for exact product matches but ubercart didn t have anything for that so i wrote them into url for get statements as variables 1 2 so for example a url which had both attributes selected would look like

those subviews are located in own nibs which means i can t pin their width and height

13958061
getter	setter
in ruby there are four different getter and setter methods for instance variables attr attr_reader attr_writer and attr_accessor

13958067
margin	height
also i don t know the height of the parent so i can t align each to the top bottom of the parent and margin them down up to center them

13958368
put	get
now it takes some jwplayer javascript to get it to work so your best bet is to use shorttag codes to put it all in there for you

13958376
fgets	strtol	fgets	atoi	strtol	atoi
one method for reading it would be to use fgets and read each line and assign the data into the structure converting numeric values as necessary with functions such as strtol or perhaps atoi if error checking is not as important

13958406
getter	setter
i know it would be faster if i use cdef setter and getter functions like get_params and set_params params but if i do this change then i would have to do it too in the python code so that my python and cython code don t differ too much and can be compatible but that makes the python code less readable..

13958406
getter	setter
or do you have any other suggestions so that i don t have to change my python code to use setter and getter functions too

13958461
couchbase	couchdb
a good reference link since couchbase views work much like apache couchdb views inspired by them

13958465
width	height
where 2 is for width 3 is for height

13958485
fgets	strtol	fgets	atoi	strtol	atoi
if you need a better description of the error just use fgets to read one line at a time and parse it with sscanf atoi strtol and similar functions

13958485
int	chars
if you want to directly save data in the structure no you can t with that kind of file in a text file 30 is a string of two chars not an int in binary form

13958543
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
also tried using the contentoffset property on uicollectionview as it s a subclass of uiscrollview but this parameter is also only set sometime in-between viewwillappear and viewdidappear

for a long time i was using around 40 checkbox and 40 button in one page

13958756
button	checkbox
i made another page with same amount of checkbox and button so i thought a little bit about faster page loading

13958806
getter	setter
have your cython code implement getter and setter and create a python type that exposes them via properties

13958870
inherited	properties
it needs to be a an explicit properties or implicitly inherited via the datacontext ie..

13958905
innodb	myisam
mysql supports full text search with myisam not innodb engine

what i do is load the player into the dom once hide it if not needed show it when loading new src for play

13959023
build-helper-maven-plugin	pom.xml
construct a series of pom.xml files in an empty multimodule structure and use the build-helper-maven-plugin along with source includes excludes to fragment the codebase and allocate the classes to different modules out of a single source tree

13959053
gif	png
we support png jpeg and gif formats

13959152
prepare	execute
and the driver packs and sends a message containing only a list of values parameters for the prepare statement to be execute with the result of an sql injection attack would be for the fraudulent string to be used as a value - saved inside a mysql record value

13959181
int	chars
what this does is after matching one or more digits digit+ it forces the lexer to look ahead in the chars stream to see if there are one or more spaces followed by a year month week or day the predicate and if so it goes ahead and matches this and you change the type from int to date_period_constant

13959192
hide	show
possibly hide show a div based on browser support

13959193
opensso	openam
if you want a .net application to speak direct to a sts using saml you can use the .net opensso fedlet or the openam one

13959194

see the javadoc for some side effects of using virtual viewers restrictions on sorting or filtering

13959391
post	get
1 there is no quick method to get all users without post

13959407
int	double
also scala has a sugar for tuple type declarations so the following would also be correct tup1 int string double

13959421
cos	sin
a good math library will calculate cos x and sin x correctly even when x is large

13959443
google-chrome	safari
so i am guessing that there is just a bad character somewhere in the code that i can t find which doesn t belong there or a missing somewhere else maybe also in another class - or anything like that - which lets some browser interpret it right google-chrome under windows and safari under mac but not under windows for example and others don t

13959444
atan2	sine
atan2 a b is similar to atan a b and you need the arctangent of the average sine over the average cosine

13959453
width	height
try setting a specific height and width on the element

13959454
getter	setter
of course i could put nicely named getter and setter on the struct public short family.

13959501
didreceivememorywarning	dealloc
apple deprecated viewwillunload now you shoud use didreceivememorywarning or dealloc to release your objetcs

13959537
cos	sin
when dealing with a circle your x and y coordinates are cos angle sin angle so inorder to figure out your x and y coordinates you should probably do something like the following

13959573
put	get
all is working ok except when i call put and the rest service sends back the persisted poco object i get a strange javascript error and you do not get to the success method of the datasource

13959613
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade from lucene.net 2.9.4 to lucene.net 3.0.3 thinking that that might help but the memory usage looks about the same between the two versioning

13959646
post	get
i d like to get this right without wasting any more time on post that seem they almost answer it but don t

13959683
for-loop	loops
i have a javascript for-loop that adds a row to a table as part of a web form for each iteration of loops

13959698
inherited	subclassing
what i want to do is to inherited from this class template and at the same time add another class template parameter to the subclassing

13959715
pull	push
quick way is make sure your changes are committed pull the changes your teammate made by using git pull merge the branch into yours with git merge branchname merge your branch into master by git checkout master git merge yourbranchname then git push the changes back up to the remote repo

13959765
mouselistener	actionevent
you may need to add a mouselistener to trigger on clicks and if a click event is followed by an actionevent within some small period then it s a double-click otherwise it s a click on the message being displayed

13959766
fileoutputstream	bufferedwriter	fileoutputstream	filewriter	fileinputstream	bufferedwriter	fileinputstream	fileoutputstream	fileinputstream	filewriter	filewriter	bufferedwriter	bufferedreader	bufferedwriter	bufferedreader	fileoutputstream	bufferedreader	fileinputstream	bufferedreader	filewriter

13959796
outputstream	inputstream
binary - inputstream outputstream

13959850
put	get
best of all since treemap guarentees log n for the containskey get put and remove methods it ll cost you nlog n to insert all the files in the source and nlog n to remove basically your compare all the keys in the destination

13959867
implements	extends
i have 3 fragments each extends sherlocklistfragment and implements 1 in each tab

13959879
rss	feed
i am new to android i am currently making an app which parse rss feed and i want to also get the images of the rss feed but did not know how can i show images in the list view along with the text.you help will be very helpful for me

13959889
addclass	removeclass
in an earlier version of this project i had been using jqueryui s addclass and removeclass functions but i am not sure if that s still appropriate with this set-up or if there is a simpler way to accomplish it

13959904
aggregate-functions	sum
the most likely cause is that aggregate-functions like sum and count don t automatically ignore deleted dead assets

13959957
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
that all works just fine in google-chrome or safari but not in firefox

13959969
inherited	properties
i assume you are doing this to learn because otherwise this is a pretty terrible way to manage your inherited classes and their properties

13959985
outputstream	inputstream
they accept other reader writer or inputstream outputstream

13959997
voip	sip
sipbroadcastrequest sip voip not supported com.android.phone.sip_remove_phone

13959997
voip	sip

13960065
width	height
get resize image width and height

13960098
public	protected
i d recommend that you kept the implicit implementation as protected instead of public

13960109
put	get
so what you need to do is get predicted values of the raw weight area relations and then log those and put everything on a log graph

13960109
put	get
or get a the linear of the log values and put them both as curves on a raw graph

13960170
width	height
if you re trying to scale the image with the container there s a simpler method than re-computing the width height when the window resizes it is part of the fluid layout idea

13960188
width	height
looking at the returned metadata looks like it thinks it s named img_0281jpg note the lack of a period between the name and the jpg and thus it is not registering as a jpg and the system cannot calculate width and height for non-images

13960225
public	protected
if you have other issues with mixing public and protected methods here s a blog post by peter hallam that describes the issues

13960225
public	protected
basically you can t call a protected instance method in a base class from a public instance method in a derived class

13960225
public	protected
doing so would allow a malicious derived class from making all the protected methods in the base class public just by writing wrappers for them

13960242
int	double
e outputs a double d outputs an int etc

13960333
post	get
it sends these updates via http get or post requests such as

13960341
google-chrome	firefox
however on google-chrome and i m told firefox most of my alpha-blended backgrounds render either not-at-all transparent or as solid colors

13960387
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in google-chrome and firefox

13960388
textview	imageview
you then need to override its getview method to return your custom view in this case a view that contains an imageview alongside a textview

13960420
width	height
you can use 50 left and top positions and then subtract half of the width and height to make up for the size of the element

13960420
width	height
you can use width and height and use simple math to figure out the left and top positioning

13960425
folder	directory
if git was installed in root as prefix you might find usr etc lib etc directory in root folder

13960461
folder	directory
simply put content such as localizable.strings in a tl.lproj folder in your project s directory then add that content to your project

13960469
padding	overlapping
because of the padding the images were overlapping

13960485
folder	directory
your other mistake is that you re relying on the disk file system s current working directory always being the eclipse project s source root folder

13960527
move	drag
then you change something in your world may be the user drag her finger and you have to move an object and back again tell opengl to render your world to screen

13960533
addition	multiplication
if you are lucky it is present although it will only help you with addition and multiplication but it may be implemented using native functions which would make it much faster

13960595
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
google-chrome firefox safari display the website fine in 32 or 64 bit client machines

13960597
jar	war
make sure all the dependent jar files are stored in web-inf lib directory of your war file including sam-3.3

13960605
post	get
if you perhaps mean that you need to build a query string with more than one parameter from your post get request you might need to look at http_build_query and append it to the url

13960616
fontfamily	font-size
a point to be noted is that the fontfamily and font-size should be the same in the input and in the div in order to have the correct value that is the reason of the css rule

13960625
octal	hex
an all-true-bits byte 1111 1111 is 377 in octal but ff in hex

13960625
hex	binary
hex is easier for most people to convert to and from binary in their heads since binary numbers are usually expressed in blocks of eight because that s the size of a byte and eight is exactly two hex digits but hex notation would have been clunky and misleading in dennis time implying the ability to address 16 bits

13960625
octal	hex	octal	decimal
the compiler parse tree to distinguish 1-9 first digit of a decimal constant 0 first insignificant digit of an octal constant and 0x indicating a hex constant to follow in subsequent digits from each other is considerably more complicated than just using a leading 0 as the indicator to switch from parsing subsequent digits as octal rather than decimal

13960625
octal	hex
0x for hex probably because it was a natural and backward-compatible extension on the octal prefix standard and still relatively efficient to parse

13960673
portrait	landscape
i use a layout and then a landscape portrait set of style sheets

13960673
width	height
now if i hard define the android width and android height in the base layout everything else runs perfectly

13960679
google-chrome	safari
works fine on macs in safari and google-chrome

13960704

13960852
pascal	delphi
if you are from vb old pascal and delphi - vb.net

13960862
textview	imageview
if that doesn t help you can try constructing the textview and imageview separately and adding them to viewgroup parent using addview

13960864
width	height
when i run it in xcode it doesn t adjust to the correct width.when i put the width and height manually i don t have any problem but since i m developing through cross platforms i would like to put it in or like it just fill the right screen

i assume the screen width and height to be less than 2000

13961033
union	distinct
union is only really used to concatenate two distinct sets

13961145
post	get
so every post or product that is queried in wordpress get s posted to site then the json sends and creates an session of the product id and than colorbox opens it now it always takes the last post that is queried and i think that s becuase of the this is a global variation to each post

13961153
dictionary	map
you could use map along with a mapping dictionary

13961166
post	get
it isnt built with post get capabilities you need to define the search term within the functions parameters

13961166
post	get
i see post on how to get return url parameter but i can t seem to find any explaining how to turn it into a variable and pass it to another function

i think the best would be to run tcpdump or wireshark and collect the whole sip and rtp traffic for that destination

13961362
jar	manifest.mf
another way to explain it is to say that bundle plug-in is a jar file with specific structure and metadata descriptors manifest.mf and plugin.xml which describe its contents in java language concepts - which java packages and services this specific jar contains and will expose to the osgi runtime so that they can be consumed by other bundles

13961368
memcmp	strcmp
i decided to try memcmp instead of strcmp

13961423
postgresql	mysql
i want to make it abstract so that i can declare specific database connection sub-classes for mysql oracle postgresql etc

13961429
profiling	instrumentation
at the same time i can t find the functionality of cache miss profiling in instrumentation

13961438
children	parent
how can i find all parent s names where all their children have names in the following list dave henry myriam jill

13961438
children	parent
i don t want to see a parent if they have a child with a different name but if they have 1 or more children and all their children have names in the list i want to see the parent s name

13961438
children	parent
i did find this that will help me find a parent with children of the exactly those names but i can t figure out how to the parent who only have children with names in a subset of that list

13961449
hash	salt
i understand how the code works but the article also mentions storing not only the hash password in the database but the salt as well

13961482
children	parent
you should use find or children method and append the row closest method selects the closest parent of the element

13961515
metaphone	soundex
i think soundex might be a bit limited but a double metaphone would probably be a good choice

13961518
cpu	processors
the cpu caches are important because they help avoid the processors having to read or write data from ram

13961586
hash	salt
user salt will be included in the hash location 3 in a colon delimited hash

13961619
children	parent
if you always want to get only the children items of the parent repeater then set the nested controls id in the webpart properties of the parent repeater

13961619
inherited	properties
alternatively if you are trying to set the path to be somewhere else in the content tree and not inherited the path of the parent then do not set the nested controls id properties but instead on the inner repeater specify that path you need and then set delayedloading to true in order to allow the control to break out from its parent s path and find documents in other path of the cms tree

13961676
google-chrome	firefox
also firefox and google-chrome have removed support for their vendor-prefixed -moz-border-radius and -webkit-border-radius

13961736
tablelayout	margins
linearlayout and tablelayout support weights so i can use those reasonably well but if i want margins that scale with the screen size i need lots of nested layouts

13961736
base	fractions
it should be quite straightforward to implement a layout which is similar to absolutelayout but base everything on fractions of available screensize but no such thing exists

13961758
hide	show
if you want an example of a show hide button that flips here is one

13961780
pdu	smpp
in smpp specifications you have this paragraph 5.3.2 smpp optional parameter tag definitions where you find all optional parameters you can add to a pdu

13961791
width	height
the sizewithfont call you use is an nsstring addition that does nothing but calculate and return a cssize with the width and height of the text you give it in the font you give it

13961814
pull	push
i m not allowed to push the remote branch and then pull it from here

13961823
jasmine	qunit
we use qunit for our tests but jasmine works too

13961831
rss	feed
ycombinator is nice enough to provide an rss feed and a big rss feed containing the top items on hackernews

13961831
rss	feed
i am trying to write a python script to access the rss feed document and then parse out certain pieces of information using beautifulsoup

13961831
rss	feed
here are a few sample lines of the rss feed

13961839
screens	tablet
this unit is density independent so when you make your layout fit the emulator screens size perfectly then android will take care of scaling for you and it ll work for screens as small as a cheap phone 320x240px to screens as large as 10 tablet

13961921
pull	push
so the thinking is to have a central warehouse that wraps this data in a service api and then the other apps push pull to it

13961929
division	modulo
i am carrying out the following modulo division operations from within a c program

13961959
int	double
the conversion from double to int in the cast expression is undefined behavior in c and in c++

13962005
int	double
you could use 64-bit int but beware you ll have precision issues when converting from double eventually

13962017
put	get
the main advantage in my mind is being able to use the normal state monad methods get and put

13962029
superclass	subclassing
the alternative is having variables in the superclass be completely uninitialized and yet accessible by the subclassing and or its methods which would be spectacularly bad

13962036
superclass	subclassing
this is easy the constructor is responsible for setting up the state of the object and since there can be state in the superclass not visible to the subclassing code private fields this can only be dealt with by calling a constructor of the superclass

13962037
width	height
thanks guys but the error was on my end i wasn t initializing the frame properly so the button was there but had a height and width of 0 0

13962042
superclass	subclassing
if the superclass does not have a no-arguments constructor then you must explicitly call super arguments in each subclassing constructor

13962129
hide	show
i ve tried to load both bitmaps at an application start and keep them in memory so i can show the first one and hide the second one or vice versa in a moment

13962144
hide	show
i would use jquery toggle function as well as the hide and show functions

13962159
filtering	grouping
i believe you d have to use pwd.getpwall and filtering it for the grouping id to get the rest of the members of that grouping

13962183
lxml	elementtree
i then installed lxml 3.0.2 i believe bs uses lxml if available using apple s built-in usr lib libxml2.2.dylib which according to xml2-config --version is 2.7.8 and did the same tests using its elementtree and using bs and again everything worked

13962191
iprincipal	iidentity
i created a filter named principalfilter implementing iauthorizationfilter interface to set a custom iprincipal and iidentity

13962253
profiling	instrumentation
when profiling a function it is best to place instrumentation as near the function as possible

13962261
hide	show
i need to show hide data based on global_location_id column in all my tables

13962264
google-chrome	firefox
i know this works in ie8+ as well as google-chrome and firefox

13962284
subtraction	addition
and if you know anything about computer representations of numbers and two s complement addition and subtraction you know that computing the difference a-b is the same as computing the sum of a and the two s complement of b a+ -b

13962284
subtraction	addition
if you ve never investigated it before look up on wikipedia or wherever about how two s complement makes a computer s alu able to re-use their addition circuitry for subtraction

13962293
jar	war
different archives like jar war ears to isolate logic...

13962330

13962386
pull	push
if that happens the push will fail and the user will have to pull before he can push as the push is no longer a fast-forward

13962398
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
i see the same weird visual distortion in the latest versions of google-chrome google-chrome canary ffx safari and opera on mac osx

13962398
put	get
i tried to put this up in a fiddle but i couldn t get jsfiddle.net to load

13962446
public	protected
youâ re requiring sub-classes to implement connecttodatabase as a protected method but then you implement it as public in your sub-class

13962454
bids	ssis
i have a package that runs fine from within bids or whatever ms is calling vs for ssis now and from the execute package utility too

13962507
primefaces	richfaces
for the record there is basically zero examples of the backing bean code for the richfaces examples which is just another reason why primefaces is that much better

13962532
folder	directory
this code will not work if all of the directory do not yet exist as well so i d assume hopefully i am correct that you have a typo or are missing a folder

13962549
width	height
if it helps any the cameras viewports width and height are the same as the textures width and height

13962576
width	height
but if it passes i want it to check for the width and height

13962576
width	height
but i don t want it to download the file again to check for the width and height

13962596
put	get
i want to only put get restaurants in from it

13962600
uicollectionview	uitableview
in my viewcontroller i have four subviews i.e uitableview uicollectionview view with uilabels and view that displays preview image for that item

13962625
createfile	deviceiocontrol
on windows you communicate with a driver by first opening it using createfile and subsequently sending commands to it using deviceiocontrol

13962627
put	get
from my perspective the correct way to write this and get the desired output would be to put a guard inside the inner loop and break it when i reaches 10

13962662
geocoding	geocode
there is a geocode class in android and a variety of other geocoding web services available to you

13962720
vim	emacs
in emacs or vim what s a smooth way to join strings as in this example

13962720
vim	emacs
i use evil in emacs which is why a vim answer would likely also help

13962757
daemons	systemd
i had a similar situation with yours and i ended up using the systemd daemons class which constantly checks sqs and then calling a cli codeigniter via systemd passing the message as a parameter

13962766
for-loop	loops
i would say change your foreach loops to for-loop as discussed here in .net which loops runs faster #39

13962766
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
according to the answer of the foreach vs for-loop question assuming it s correct for loops on list are a bit more than 2 times cheaper than foreach loops on list and looping on arrays is around 2 times cheaper than looping on list

13962793
min	max
an aggregate function being as ken white says something like min max count etc

13962805
uicollectionview	nsindexpath	uicollectionviewlayout	nsindexpath
cgsize collectionview uicollectionview collectionview layout uicollectionviewlayout collectionviewlayout sizeforitematindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

13962838
inherited	subclassing
there are many ways you can reuse one of them is to inherited a class ie creating a subclassing

13962842
hide	show
in other words make sure your euler8.txt is really called that and not euler8.txt.txt for instance because with hidden extensions the file explorer will show the first but it may not strike you as odd initially if you don t remember that it s supposed to hide the extension

13962845
uiview	subviews
let s say for example that you wrote a custom view extending uiview in which the positioning of subviews is complex and cannot be done with autoresizingmask or ios6 autolayout

13962849
google-chrome	firefox
the following code consumes about half a meg of memory per second in google-chrome 23.0 linux and also leaks albeit more slowly on firefox

13962852
getter	setter
note that getter and setter of properties and indexers cannot specify a redundant access level

13962949
sudo	passwd
although your ssh login works without a passwd you also need to configure sudo on your target server so that it doesn t require a passwd

13962953
profiling	debugging
right click on project - properties - run debugging settings - delete the profiling that is there

13962997
google-chrome	firefox
this occurs in both firefox and google-chrome so far so i m assuming it happens in all browsers

13963010
gitx	repo
however when i look at the git repo history gitx on mac it appears to be empty no history of the original alivepdf author s commits

13963013
public	protected
inside an abstract class for an instance constructor modifiers public protected internal and protected are all equivalent

13963013
public	protected
the only situation i can think of where it makes a difference if an instance constructor of an abstract class is public or protected is when you use reflection

13963013
public	protected
will give an empty array if the sole constructor is protected and a length-1 array if it s public

13963097
hide	show
i ve added a new menu item to my xml file and then i am trying to reference the new menu item to either show it or hide it

13963135
width	height
if i understand correctly you want a horizontally displayed list where each item has a set width and height but the text inside is vertically centred and there may be items that have two lines of text

13963146
google-chrome	firefox
inspect the input element in google-chrome or firefox and you will see how the library builds the new input

13963226
pull	push
you pull the latest 0.9.1 then push your fix to 0.9.1

13963226
pull	push
switch to 1.0 pull latest 1.0 merge 0.9.1 push to 1.0

13963226
pull	push
switch to 1.1 pull latest 1.1 merge 1.0 push to 1.1

13963244
superclass	subclassing
as part of my rock paper and scissors game i would like to create a abstract superclass weapon which has subclassing rock paper and scissors in vb.net

13963286
int	chars
strings containing non-numeric chars will evaluate as int 0 - so your cases in your switch statement will match 0 to ready as easily as 0 to 0 and 1 to 1

13963309
width	height
a 3rd party app saves images in such naming format where q85 is the quality aaxbb means width and height

13963471
width	height
if you need to support these browsers you might have to use image elements with percent based width and height instead of background images or ie s proprietary filter

13963476
hash	md5
sometimes the first column is omitted and you have to know from elsewhere what type of checksum hash is being used often md5 as a hex string

13963496
width	height
in air 1.5 and flash player 10 the maximum size for a bitmapdata object is 8 191 pixels in width or height and the total number of pixels cannot exceed 16 777 215 pixels

13963496
width	height
so if a bitmapdata object is 8 191 pixels wide it can only be 2 048 pixels high. in flash player 9 and earlier and air 1.1 and earlier the limitation is 2 880 pixels in height and 2 880 in width

13963500
width	margin
to fix the width of the non-float panel to not go under the floated panel you can add margin to the right side of it

13963510

viewdidload	viewdidappear
calling this in viewdidload assures that it s setup correctly by the time the first viewdidappear gets called

13964013

13964231
inherited	properties
you can pretty much write one simply by inherited control a couple of properties and then draw your image using the paint event of the control

13964239
put	get
so in that case if you need to get best performance by using a column name then call getordinal once put it into a variable and then use typed accessor with the column ordinal in your loop

13964243
prepare	execute
your prepare and execute calls are correct with your two parameters correctly bound

13964258

13964362
cpython	ironpython
there are a handful of differences between ironpython and cpython listed in the release notes

13964362
cpython	ironpython
if there s any heavy application logic as opposed to all of the work being networking files database ironpython is much faster than cpython at a few things and much slower at a few others so you probably need to profile and perf-test before you go too far down either path

13964362
jython	pypy
and consider at least pypy if not jython while you re at itâ but usually this isn t an issue for servers

13964362
cpython	ironpython
you can and probably should write either all or most of your code in a cross-platform way that runs on both ironpython and linux cpython

13964362
cpython	ironpython
then you can code test and debug with ironpython in visual studio use native windows cpython and or cygwin cpython for occasional sanity checks and only touch linux for performance tests final acceptance tests before releases and debugging problems you can t repro on windows

13964429
width	height
i m not sure if i understood your problem but if your problem is that you need to resize your image to a certain container that has a maximum width and height then i think that what you want is a function like this using jquery

13964432
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
for some reason when i load the website in google-chrome safari and opera the div container starts from the top of the website then moves into place where i positioned it

once the oncreate finishes execution the system calls the onstart and onresume methods in quick succession

13965061
heroku	engineyard
one exception is if you have a lot of linux sysadmin chops then heroku may not be worth the cost even early and in that case you might be more comfortable with something like engineyard that still provides you with a full rails stack out of the box but keeps you closer to the metal

13965097

for-loop	arrays
this for-loop in your on click listener is setting the string for all of the members of your arrays that underlies your list

13980316
hide	show
i think it has to do with the parent list element changing height everytime the div inside hide show

13980324
min	max
otherwise in the ordering you need to apply an aggregate function like min max avg etc

13980370

getter	setter	tostring	getter
all the getter and setter work just fine the problem is when i try to do the tostring equivalent to c++ which is the operator overloaded

unfortunately if they enter a string instead of an int in the age field the program crashes and returns conversion from string examplestring to type double is not valid

13980569
subscript	superscript
for example xml for a 0 overlapped with a + superscript + and subscript -

13980703
inherited	properties
so far i have two options either i provide a get-set pair for every of four decorated properties in decorator wich seems tideous and mouthful and basically it s what i want to avoid or i inherited databag from dynamicobject and then somehow manage to get decorated properties using trygetmember method which is dynamic and does not seem to be the right way to do things in c#

13980720
uninstall	upgrade
the reason to use pip is that easy_install has no uninstall functionality it handles upgrade badly it can end up leaving stuff part-way installed when it fails it doesn t work right with virtualenv etc

post	get
if you are not really trying to do a get and instead you are trying to post data to the server then you should use a post

13981043
factories	presenter
create a factories for instantiating your presenter

13981043
factories	presenter
you could probably use the typed factories facility -- meaning you d only have to define the interface for the presenter factories and let the facility do the rest

13981063
pull	push
you can then push pull from github as you normally do and then explicitly push to codeplex whenever you want

13981081

the svg document you are creating doesn t knw how to autosize itself so setting the width and height of the svg element to 100 does nothing

13981304

create the canvas tag on the fly in jquery and create it with the width and height attributes set to the width of the table s border-box

13981304

13981356
rss	feed
is the rss feed binary encoded and if so how do i correctly decode it

13981359
trie	tree
use a in-memory tree data structure trie

13981359
trie	tree
i d suggest avoiding large in-memory data structures but if you still need want to manage big data structures with text you may find interesting the trie tree where descendants of a node have a common prefix of the string associated with that node

13981397
feedparser	beautifulsoup
use feedparser to download and parse it instead of using urllib2 and beautifulsoup

13981564
switching	screens
if i switching into work offline this file cannot be read and i only see a gray screens

for more complex apps if you have custom classes that inherited from other classes you can also make a separate method that returns descriptiondict and then in the subclassing call and continue adding removing elements to it

13981663
superclass	subclassing
super t which mean that the type parameter of class of the super could be t or any of its superclass now how come a superclass s class type parameter be the same type as the subclassing

13981712
maven	m2e
from a methodology perspective i would really prefer the m2e way -- eclipse invoking maven for builds so it does exactly the same thing as a pure maven-build

13981712
maven	m2e
the problem i found with the m2e though was that it always got so horribly ridiculously go-have-a-coffee-break-while-you-wait-for-it slow performance when the maven project became larger adding more and more sub-projects

13981712
jar	war
the mvn eclipse eclipse plugin on the other hand works like a charm as long as you just have a pure java jar war build

13981712
ant	maven
but if the maven build does other plugin stuff for example legacy rmi-compiles or using ant for sub-tasks etc that will just be ignored during the eclipse-build and so doesnt work

13981724
for-loop	arrays
by doing so you may omit setting for-loop size manually but setting it using lower and upper bound of the arrays

13981732
put	get
when ever i try to do it i get an error saying file not found and after reading the docs a little more it seems that trigger may have src coded into the class because if i put just image logo.png the logo.png will show up in the header because its part of the app package

13981770
versioning	upgrade
so you would want to make sure you upgrade your versioning of ef to the true ef5 which is supported on the .net 4.5 framework

13981790
dictionary	map
the instance that was just created is used as the base class for map so its __init__ method gets called using the same arguments as the three argument version of type the name base classes and a dictionary

13981790
dictionary	map
this is why you end up with that weird error you see you end up with a call to game.__init__ where w is the string map and multi is a dictionary and attempting to multiply a string by a dictionary results in that typeerror

13981873
width	height
normally the html tag squeezes the image if the width or height attribute is smaller than the image itself

13981902

13982076
width	height
...the inner div is the one that will very in height and width based on its contents and it needs to be horizontally centered equal space at its left and right sides within the outer div which may or may not have fixed dimensions so the inner may be within the outer div s width or it may spill out but always be centered in it

implements	extends
i tried to implements a panorama viewer using a touchimageview extends imageview

13982117

13982297
getattr	setattr
setattr and getattr kind of got into my style of programing mainly scientific stuff my knowledge about python is self told

put	get
as with the prepared statement any values larger than a 32bit integer since i put an i as the type in the bound parameter will get truncated and altered unexpectedly

13982535

i m pretty sure it is because of the those pesky dialogs with their own width and height

13982549
robotium	uiautomator
or do not use robotium i would suggest use uiautomator

13982575
min	max
if there is a single a.value for each idindice then you can simply use min a.value or max a.value instead of sum idindice

13982580
minimum	max	min	max
you could even set a minimum length by substituting braces for the plus and providing a minimum maximum leave the max out to allow it to be any length over min .

13982586
hide	show
if yes and visible then hide if yes and hidden then show

13982632

for-loop	arrays
mark s solution is pretty close but fails if the arrays contains values like 0 false or which evaluate false in the second for-loop expression

13983035
for-loop	arrays
this solution works for all arrays and is a bit closer to the spirit of a for-loop

13983035
for-loop	arrays
the second expression in the for-loop needs to evaluate if the element the arrays pointer points to exists

13983045
put	get
i get that exact exception i put above

post	get
this is not what i want as as the post gets redirected and the second request is a get loosing all the data

nsurl	nsstring
the key difference is the first gives you the path as an nsstring while the second gives you the path as an nsurl

13983135
post	get
after reviewing the html i think you can get the post id and title without having to add anything to the template

13983140
for-loop	arrays
if you expect haystack to be an arrays you should iterate it with a for-loop instead of enumerating keys with a for-loop see javascript for...in vs for for the difference

13983163
width	height
if any to the largest size such that both its width and its height

13983163
width	height
smallest size such that both its width and its height can completely

13983168
for-loop	loops
also the grandmasterlists method i use towards the end of the program combined with all of the double for loops and the linearly increasing number of calls of the compare function in each for-loop must also make this much more inefficient than it needs to be

but on chrome in the first page s loading it includes the bottom and top margin s size in the height of the div which i am getting the height so the div gets bigger than i desired

for-loop	loops
the next step is to allow that process to run for a set number of loops - i ve tried wrapping setinterval in timer1 in a for-loop which doesn t work

13984009
hide	show
i would agree with tvanfosson and recommend something like ui tabs or ajax loading but if you want to see a very rudimentary way you can do it with jquery hide show

13984017
ddms	adb
the first solution i have come up with is to continually grab the framebuffer through adb like ddms s screen capture function

13984056
hash	md5
if you like you can hash it with md5 or whatnot

13984059
postgresql	mysql
instead have offloading process connect to database using standard sqlite api or some scripting language with sqlite support read rows using that api and create copy of that data elsewhere for example in another sqlite database or in big real sql database like mysql postgresql or mssql or in text file if so inclined

13984127

13984185
appdata	uninstaller
yes shared preferences are stored until the app is uninstaller or the user clears appdata

13984186
getter	setter
but the more ethical way is to define getter and setter of all the variables like this

13984186
getter	setter
why use getter and setter in java

13984187
width	height
width and height attributes are not working properly

13984314
width	height
set the height to auto which will keep the ratio respective to the width

13984314
width	height
if you wanted the image to go larger or smaller with the window like in a pop-up window set the width to 100 and leave the height to auto

an alternative approach might be to have the ime service create a popupwindow or dialog

you re not assigning the string literal i m sub. n to the shared superclass field you re creating a field local to the subclassing and assigning it to that instead

13984549
thin	unicorn
just wanted to get people s opinions on using unicorn vs thin as a rails server

13984549
thin	unicorn
bellow is a link that suggests replacing thin with 4 unicorn workers - this makes perfect sense to me

13984556
hide	show
done this way you ll have to have code to show and hide the two views when you want to enter and exit edit mode

13984556
hide	show
so in your onlongclick event you ll hide the textview and show the edittext

13984569
nsstring	nsdata
nsuserdefaults deals with storing property-list-compatible objects nsdata nsdate nsstring nsarray and nsdictionary for persistence between app launches

13984569

apps often need to store non-object type values like boolean or int yet only objects are supported so these convenience methods intforkey boolforkey etc. allow a more concise way of saving them

13984611
rss	feed
i m attempting to pull in an rss feed but i only want to show one of the items - a random number - not all of them

13984614

public	protected
php public private protected

13984685
ceil	floor
the use of floor and ceil is nice and specific but maybe confusing

13984685
min	max
for what it s worth i believe the best solution of find the second smallest element out of two sorted vectors is min max a 0 b 0 min a 1 b 1 which requires three comparisons

13984702
put	get
to get around that load the image as a and put it into a bytearrayinputstream

dlsym	dlopen
instead of doing dlopen and dlsym just call the functions directly

13985577
getter	setter
property and synthesis work together it helps you define setter and getter automatically

13985596

if you use scrapy you don t need beautifulsoup because scrapy uses lxml which in my opinion is currently the best html parser

13985602
put	get
since i don t want other requests to get affected i am unwilling to put a host entry on the server hosting my app

13985606
accessor	properties
properties are a feature in objective-c that allow us to automatically generate accessor and also have some other side benefits

13985606
getter	setter
the synthesize directive automatically generates the setter and getter for us so all we have to implement for this class is the dealloc method

13985606
getter	setter
synthesize will generate getter and setter methods for your property

13985606
getter	setter
dynamic just tells the compiler that the getter and setter methods are implemented not by the class itself but somewhere else

13985640
accessor	properties

13985775
hide	fadeout
tried it with hide instead of fadeout and it worked fine

this could be a bug in fadeout fadein because your home-featured is also a home-section

13985818
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome render it perfectly

13985836
width	height
width and height might be other way round

13985842
put	get
unless you have access to the latex source that was used to produce the images in a way that isn t apparent from your question the answer is you cannot. casual inspection of the website linked implies that the latex that is used to produce the equations is not readily available it s probably on a backend system somewhere that produces the images that get put on the web server

13985849

13986094
qmainwindow	qapplication
if you create the qapplication and qmainwindow on the heap then they will lurk around until the os cleans up the memory

13986094
qmainwindow	qwidget
sending a close to a qwidget and qmainwindow is one will only close it

13986111
mvp	presenter
if your application is not tiny small then i will suggest you to follow some design patterns like mvp and move all this logical things in presenter

13986118
listview	gridview
instead of regular gridview child you need to inflate an xml with listview in it

13986144
inherited	subclassing
instance methods however are inherited by subclassing and can be overridden as long as the following two criteria are met

13986157
mouseover	mouseout
so when you add overimage it appears below the mouse and that fires another mouseout and mouseover

13986190

you need to pass variables to php code from html-form using another mechanism such as submitting form on get or post methods

13986333
jacoco	eclemma
according the the paper eclemma 2.0 jacoco that you looked is supposed to work with java 1.7

13986333
jacoco	eclemma
java runtime as jacoco requires java 1.5 the same minimum jre is required for the eclipse instance running eclemma and the application under test

13986500
post	get
html by itself can t access submitted post get data

13986500
post	get
you could use javascript to access get variables but not post

13986511
post	get
the purpose of using those server side extension is to manipulate the data sent from the form elments on the server with the method of post or get but if you only want to show the data entered on the browser you can send it to the .html file because they do not need to be manipulated at all

13986542
google-chrome	firefox
the html5 parser as used in firefox google-chrome and ie10 has some nifty tricks to cope with your invalid markup but the older ie9 parser cannot cope

13986569
onclick	onsubmit
also you haven t shown how where you are calling the editaccountdetails function that is sending the ajax request but if this is inside an onsubmit handler of the form or an onclick handler of a submit button of this form or an onclick handler of some anchor you should make sure that you return false from this handler to ensure that you are cancelling the default action and giving chance of the ajax call to execute

13986593
google-chrome	firefox
i need to add zoom feature like zoom web page in firefox google-chrome or zoom edit page in word to a edit control which wrote by our company

13986604
gif	png
take a png or gif with alpha-channel so that the non-text is transparent

13986604
cos	sin
i think the best thing to do here is using a sin or cos function for the scaling and rotation

13986679
switching	screens
sometimes when i run skype and switching between resolutions for full-screen programs the skype window disappears off screens and i have no way of dragging it back

13986713
squash	branch

13986738
shapefile	geojson

13986741
mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseleave	mouseenter
try mouseenter and mouseleave instead of mouseover mouseout

13986775
gif	png
doesn t have an image extension jpg png gif fancybox doesn t know what type of content needs to be handled

13986776
mouseover	mouseout
just use jquery.hover instead of mouseover and mouseout -

13986786
daemons	systemd
granted in practice on most modern linux systemd most device nodes are located in dev and maintained by udev - but it is user-space daemons which your kernel driver cannot talk to

13986792
google-chrome	firefox
i have a outer div which is working correctly in google-chrome firefox but not in ie

13986807
uitabbaritem	uitabbarcontroller
i have two tab bars in order to have effect like the one shown in question of sliding uitabbaritem in uitabbarcontroller

13986897
division	multiplication
multiplication of complex numbers can be seen as a positive rotation and division as a negative rotation

13986897
division	subtract
we want to use division as it acts to subtract one angle from the other

13986919
post	get
i am trying to tag some of my friends in my wall post and i am sending the following parameters but this post to my wall the fb ids i provide do not get attached to the post.

13986951
width	margin
so i set the main content area to have a margin of 225 on the left so that it doesn t overlap the side bar then i set its width to 100 but doing this pushes the entire document out by 225pxs on the right skewing the entire page

13987045
width	height
you will get simple small width height on your onsizechanged and onlayout

13987152
iprincipal	iidentity
consider implementing custom iprincipal and or iidentity - it s sometimes a better extension point and since not everyone is aware of it it s often not used

13987170
comparator	comparable
i have a simple c++ class called square that inherits from comparable an interface with a function comparator

13987186
nullpointerexception	illegalstateexception
i ve been following the android tutorials and created myfirstapp see and i can launch the app ok on the emulator but upon entering a message and hitting send i get an illegalstateexception caused by a nullpointerexception at this line in the below code

13987188

try jprofiler or visualvm

13987290
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
when using fractional floating pixel values for width however ie9 and ff4 seem to round to the nearest pixel while opera 11 google-chrome and safari truncate the decimal places

13987290
children	parent
in deeply nested grid layout systems where parent widths are em and children are and including up to four decimal points upstream had a noticeable impact

13987303
width	height
so basically on click i add a new width and height to the box that i am clicking and display another div in the box

13987303
width	height
if i add the height and width inline the div pushes the other boxes like it should but when i use jquery it just expands underneath them

13987315
accessor	properties
hopefully you re using accessor properties

13987347
onclick	onsubmit
use an onsubmit attribute on the form tag rather than onclick on the submit

13987380
keydown	keyup
note textevent won t help because many real-world controls listen to keydown keyup specifically

13987474
post	put
for example put a break point in the action and then look at the post object in your browser or in visual studio your choice

13987490
appjs	tidesdk
i tried doing so in appjs and tidesdk

13987538
width	height
imo giving height and width in percent through css will be a better idea than changing it every time

13987544
uilabel	uibutton
now in this view i have a uilabel which show my text selected from main tableview and most importantly i have uibutton add to favorit

13987577
hide	show
i wonder why you want to destructor your mainwindow it seems that you ve made a system tray entry so my suggestion is just to hide the mainwindow but to destructor cause there is a system tray you may want to click it to show the mainwindow

13987612
google-chrome	firefox
but even though the html formed is correct the javascript does not execute and inspecting the element in firefox google-chrome shows the value of the textbox to be exactly the same as i entered

13987620
qapplication	qobject	qevent	qobject	qevent	qapplication
inside of the customized class bool qapplication notify qobject receiver qevent e function was implemented

serializable	deserialization
this code is an example for serializable deserialization

13987633
serializable	deserialization
see the javadoc of serializable as an introduction to serializable and deserialization of objects

13987640
serializable	deserialization
this is an example of object serializable and deserialization

13987656
post	get
this service communicates via post while the other two services which seem unaffected use get

13987689
getter	setter	post	put
and i m thinking using a phase listener to change the display cos i read some post saying that it is bad to change the getter and setter and put business logic in them

13987694
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox and google-chrome

13987739
google-chrome	firefox
im not getting result in firefox but it does show in google-chrome in firefox it shows invalid date

opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
firefox and some other browsers namely safari or opera don t like milliseconds

13987828
implements	extends
public class zoominzoomout extends activity implements ontouchlistener

13987841
google-chrome	safari
webkit browsers like google-chrome safari android ios have a problem with jqm and async false ajax call

13987853
int	double
because when you cast a double to int decimal part is truncated

13987878
int	double
explicit cast does a conversion a float double value to an int variable which discards the fractional part

13987885
int	double
casting double to int truncates the non-integer portion of the number

13987892
rdf	owl
protã gã ontologies can be developed in a variety of formats including owl rdf s and xml schema

13988031
google-chrome	firefox
which seems to work fine in firefox but in google-chrome the whole tag is ignored from the

13988055
getter	setter
the key difference is that in the first case your local variable is called _myentity while the getter is myentity and the setter is setmyentity

13988055
getter	setter
the compiler will take care that the setter and getter is called

13988055
getter	setter
so far from accessing properties or their getter and setter from outside

13988055
getter	setter
self.myentity calls the setter or getter

13988055
getter	setter
doing so it is explicitely clear for you and the readers of your code when the actual property is accessed directly and when the getter and setter are used

13988107
accessor	properties
in the properties accessor

13988111
versioning	upgrade
i m not interested in the cause of the particular error shown it s obvious enough that pandas expected a different versioning of matplotlib -- that s a fair risk of getting one package from the standard debian repository and the other through pip and i already solved that part of the problem by allowing pip to upgrade matplotlib

13988121
width	height
to fit the image on the screen or view probably you can grab the width and height of your view

13988121
width	height
check the width and height of your image and calculate the maximum scale factor

13988126
mouse	keyboard
the mouse is locked but you can use the right click mouse button on the keyboard to get the context menu and then select restart at 1 while recording your macro

13988129
udp	tcp
having multiple threads receiving data from a socket is usually fine for udp socket but doesn t make much sense for tcp sockets most of the time

13988146
portrait	landscape
but the problem is that when i changed the device orientation from portrait to landscape and then tapped the button it will show the view in the portrait view not in the landscape mode and vice versa

13988180
getter	setter
had re-sharper detected that your getter and setter were going more than just assigning to and reading from the backing variable my assumption is that it would not be an issue

13988231
disk	ram
each node or bunch of nodes in the trie will be on disk rather then on ram

13988231
trie	tree
ps radix tree is usually faster and more compact then trie but suffers from the same side effects of trie comparing to hash tables though less significant of course

13988234
width	height
i am very new to css3 transitions and don t understand the whole s and width thing or height

13988255
hide	show
you should note that if you do hide this and don t show any indication of progress using the code above for example your user may navigate away or close the browser which may cause the action to stop processing or be terminated forcefully server-side so the confirmation would never happen

13988290
getter	setter
also make sure you have public getter setter for your variables inside action class

this would give the largest smallest index that has the max min pairs are compared by first comparing the first element and then comparing the second element if the first ones are the same

13991863
mp4	webm
all the mp4 extension files and webm files work fine but the flash files .flv and .f4v are not recognized and therefore php returns the value application octet-stream which i believe is the default mime for any files which aren t recognized

13991878
subtraction	addition
another interesting explanation that i found concerns addition and subtraction

13991878
subtraction	addition
in particular the addition subtraction argument was most valid on 8 bit systems.

13992244
children	parent
my query needs to return the lowest set of children given a parent

13992250
put	get
ignoring the fact that i also think this is a fairly poor question and might very well just be a thinly veiled request to get somebody else to do the work as meagar put it it is easy enough to answer

13992256
width	height
you can do this for the width and height

13992320
width	height
for images with the 2x suffix in the filename it sets the scale property to 2.0 and halves the width and height values to compensate for the scale factor

13992335
versioning	upgrade
i had suggested oringally we only have one versioning of the software and have certain modules be upgrade but there are some good reasons they can t really do that

they re in that format because they re chars stored in a text file which represent int digits

13992423
mamp	wamp
xampp lamp wamp or mamp on your

13992440
cpu	irq
ofcourse it saves some cycles but again it is not wise to have more handlers serving one fiq and yes fiq is having more priority but it is not any reason to say it handles the interrupt faster both irq fiq run at same cpu frequency so they must be running at same speed

13992465
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome work fine

13992472
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the odd thing is though this is working in google-chrome but not firefox or safari and there are no js errors in the inspectors for those browsers

13992472
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i m stumped as to why it would work in google-chrome and not safari or firefox

13992535
width	height
i want to scale the image to the width of the screen and adjust the height of the imageview to reflect the proportionally correct height of the image

13992565
padding	right-align
it is probably better to make the column right-align but with a suitable left and right padding selected as a good guess based on the width of the column header and the expected widths of the numbers

13992634
for-loop	arrays
it stores its index in the arrays from of the for-loop so that should be accurate

13992644
ienumerable	ienumerator
however my question is that instead of making a custom collection that first implements ienumerable and then constructing another class to implement ienumerator to store a group of custom objects why can t we just use

13992710
ienumerable	ilist
for example a listviewitemcollection would have to notify its parent listview when updated so it needs to implement ilist t and therefore ienumerable t

13992775

13992878
rss	feed
i have a line of code in my wordpress widget that outputs from an rss feed

13992892
google-chrome	firefox
you ll need to use something that lets you inspect the dom such as web developer tools in google-chrome or firebug in firefox although firefox s built-in tools are decent now too

13992913
children	parent
and at the same time allows for a group to be the parent of multiple children groups

rational-numbers	fractions
so to have the result as you expected a remainder with fractions rational-numbers

13993216
client-side	server-side
so you may still be able to add client-side validation for that added ux touch and if the client does indeed disallow javascript then they wouldn t see that and would just use the server-side validation instead

13993218
subtract	add
if you add 1 to integer.max_value you bet integer.min_value it wraps and if you subtract 1 from long.min_value you get long.max_value

13993258

int	double
i really don t want to double my data size and make each field an unsigned int

13993494

portrait	landscape
currently i am solving this in js ontouchstart i get the size of the main parent and set each slide to that width but i don t like this solution because when switching for landscape to portrait you have to touch the gallery for it to update and even if i add an event lister to the change its still not a pretty solution

min	max
however unrolling the loop a bit more may buy you additional speed pass the first set of results into the packed min max function to combine them

13993643

13997025
multiplying	addition	multiplying	multiplication	addition	multiplication
one approach is to measure how many processor cycles each output is taking calculate many divide time by number of outputs multiplying by processor speed to the latency in cycles of a multiplication from an addition from the documentation for the processor model you are using

you don t have just one box of shirts that you can punch a button on the side to turn to any size of color you have to deal with the actual shirt and tedious task of putting them somewhere so i deciding against trying to get outrageous with a bunch of foreign keys and indexes besides that it gets just as tedious and you wind up having to represent just as much but with a lot more tables when you could ve just put the data it s linking to in the first table

13997412
floating-point	fixed-point
since your target is armv6 the first thing i would do is to switch from floating-point to fixed-point arithmetic

13997412
floating-point	fixed-point
armv7 is usually better but for arm fixed-point arithmetic is usually a lot faster than floating-point implementations

13997417

the problem began after i upgrade to mountain lion while still using versioning 0.12.2

13997732
macports	homebrew
i do not use homebrew macports or any similar tools

13997743
post	get
if plugin detects some get or post requests it should override wordpress theme and show its own

13997747
versioning	upgrade
we are in the final stages of producing a versioning 2 upgrade

x86	mips
i suspect it s trying to run the mips or x86 version of the emulator

13997778
pop-up	dialog
on my page i need to pop-up a dialog and inform the user that his session is timing out and if he wants to keep it alive he needs to click on a button

13997841
hide	show
this is supposed to hide two elements and show one after a link with the id mov is clicked but nothing is happening

13997909
children	parent
the positive-flex makes sense as it distributes space proportionally from the parent element to the children

13997911
range	min
in your case min would be 50 and range would be 50

13997920
getter	setter
you just construct the json containing the information you need in the serializer using the getter then in the deserializer you create a new instance of location and populate it with the information from the supplied json using the public setter

13997929
rank	percentile
to determine the percentile score for a given value use the rank operation on the order statistic tree to look up what index that value appears at

13997929
range	percentile
you can then multiply that number by 99 n - 1 to get a percentile score for the value that runs in the range from 0 to 99 as required

13997929
range	percentile
using the select operation on the order statistic tree then can be used to find the first value in the range that is at or above the given percentile

13997929
rank	percentile
percentile o 1 expected time to look up the value associated with the key o log n time to do the rank operation and o 1 extra time to map the rank to a percentile

13997929
rank	percentile
find-percentile o 1 time required to map the percentile to a rank and o log n time required to do the select operation

13997957
hide	show
it looks like what s going on is that the uisearchbar is failing to invalidate its intrinsic content size when it show and hide the scope bar

13997967
text-align	height
set the line-height of the parent container to its height 200px and the text-align to center

13997972
post	put
my problem is to create a code that will search for the user id and put it in that code insert the code for every facebook user on a group with their post

13997983
g++	gcc
if you use a c++ compiler say g++ instead of gcc you can call c++ code from your c code seamlessly and everything will work just fine

13998021
mouse	keyboard
an android app that implements this profile then connect your android device to your pc it basically becomes a bluetooth mouse or keyboard

13998027
postorder	inorder
then you may use pre-order postorder inorder for a dfs deep first search or implement some bfs breadth first search using a queue

13998067
profiler	perf
i would recommend using profiler on your actual code the one with global write to see if there s anything like unaligned access or other perf problem

13998085
jcl	rexx
jcl to run rexx program mkaltr

13998152
bash	subshell
to run echo hello in the new bash subshell bash first expands anything it can hello in this case and the parent shell set that to hello world for us

fink	homebrew	fink	macports	macports	homebrew
homebrew unlike macports and fink is designed to work well with any python installation you want to use and with that python s pip

13998211
int	double
i have implemented the my above algorithm using an self written arraylistint which does the same as arraylist but uses primitive types double int instead of objects types

13998234
coldfusion	railo
for a detailed look at the source code to this proprietary xor check this answer to compare password hashes between c# and coldfusion in which leigh who also commented on one of these questions helped provide an accurate port of the algorithm lifted directly from the railo source

13998288
mouse	keyboard
instead of writing your own keyboard hook app unless you re doing it for fun the thrill of it the exercise you might want to look at autoit or autohotkey which are both pretty good for keyboard mouse automation

13998319
google-chrome	firefox
other mainstream browsers firefox ie and google-chrome seem to produce the expected result both in js and non js situations

13998326
hide	show
hide and instead of show i need show

13998334
width	height
sfml 2.0 rectangle types were changed from left top right bottom to left top width height

13998356
client-side	server-side
also as you have talked about validation it s always good to have both client-side jquery ajax validation and server-side django validation to keep away from spammers and badboys

13998372
width	height
then set this viewport s overflow property to hidden and give it a specific width height

13998448
google-chrome	firefox
this is only a snippet of the script but the entire thing works fine in firefox and for the first three prologue functions it works fine in google-chrome

13998522
background-image	background-color
secondly the little trick is that the background is not only set by the background-color which is a fallback but by the background-image as seen from the less call to the less mixin - code shown at the bottom

13998524
google-chrome	firefox
the issue is that it displays properly in firefox but not google-chrome or ie

13998536
nsdata	nsjsonserialization
nsjsonserialization jsonobjectwithdata will turn that nsdata into an object

13998548
screens	mdpi
it reports a screens size of 1280x752 and a mdpi density

13998549
fadein	fadeout
if fadein.xml does not have rotation then fadein and fadeout both don t work

13998549
fadein	fadeout
if fadein does have rotation fadein and fadeout both do work

13998607
pyramid	web.py	pyramid	cherrypy	django	web.py	web.py	cherrypy
i have some experience with different web frameworks django web.py pyramid and cherrypy and i m wondering in which one will it be easier and hopefully cleaner to implement a route dispatcher to a different view handler based on the accept header and the http method

13998625
screens	tablet
i have an app that has a screens like this on a 10 tablet

13998638
int	chars
your first parameter must be an int not a chars array

13998665
children	parent
into play when the children overflow their parent container in the

13998728
screens	tablet
then you use layout alias files with the screens size qualifiers described in the link to determine when the tablet layout should be used

13998736
hash	salt
sha512 hashing is the best way with salt if possible but i have found loads about this and using pdo but i cant make a register form that uses the sha512 hash any ideas reply please

13998770
addition	multiplication
it is just addition multiplication and squaring which is really just multiplication

13998777
folder	directory
i am trying to write a script that will get the names of all the folder in a specific directory and then return each as an entry in an array

13998817
qapplication	qwidget
so now i am using qapplication but whenever i try to use a qwidget based class my program either crashes or results in some nonsense error messages

13998818
put	get
this will not put your content in the trusted zone but it is better than the internet zone you get for the about protocol

13998849
cherrypy	cheetah
i had a similar issue a few weeks back when i was trying to use cherrypy to create a webpage in the tutorials i found cheetah templates and it made writing the forms so much easier

13998857
google-chrome	firefox
on google-chrome i get an error but on firefox it always shows success

13998859
integer	unsigned
--- it is a series of bytesâ unsigned integer values in the range 0 to 255 which have to be interpreted according to the latest pdf reference

13998867
sorting	grouping
many people learning sql think of grouping as something done in the context of sorting the rows

13998877
tweepy	python-twitter
i have also used tweepy and python-twitter i found it on github

13998911
ant	maven
unless i use a tailored build process using ant or maven

13998966
for-loop	arrays
and then i have a bunch of code where i create some buttons and inside a for-loop i assign a different function to those buttons depending on the position of the arrays

13999005
profiling	instrumentation
when i profiling with the leaks and allocations instrumentation no leaks are found and the live bytes value for all memory ranges between 30 mb and 80 mb depending on what it s doing at the time

13999031
titlebar	window
support for no window decoration no titlebar minimize- or close button

13999130
nsurlconnection	nsurlsession
now that nsurlconnection is deprecated and nsurlsession is now available that offers better mechanisms for downloading a series of files avoiding much of the complexity of the solution contemplated here

13999130
writetofile	nsdata
personally i d just create an operation queue so that i could specify how many concurrent operations i wanted and download the individual files using nsdata method datawithcontentsofurl followed by writetofile atomically making each download it s own operation

13999150
width	height
iframe true width 400 height 200 to my links as the lightbox is going to display iframes.

13999165
strcpy	malloc
to actually get the contents of path copied over to rawdata you need to allocate memory for it in malloc and then use strcpy

13999193
builtin	isinstance
for checking if an argument is of the expected type use the builtin isinstance function

13999217
width	margin
this also means that the width and horizontal margin padding of the placeholder elements has to match that of the articles

13999229
mouse	keyboard
the controller can tell the headless browser what pages to load what javascript to run which is like typing javascript into the console and even mimic events such as keyboard input and mouse clicks

13999263
google-chrome	firefox
edit unfortunately it only works in firefox and google-chrome

13999282
draggable	droppable
i am trying to implement a new jquery ui draggable droppable and sortable list so this gui will be the setup of my new custom made sql crud via ajax capable - gridview

13999305
int	double
however it has the nice benefit of only keeping track of a double and an int instead of an object

13999307
listview	gridview
i have a property that when set changes the itemssource property but i can only get one of the controls to bind at a time either the gridview for non-snapped or the listview for snapped

13999310
put	get
by working i meen that i get responce when i make index.php file and put something to echo

13999341
hex	binary
the buffer corruption problem occurs when binary data is decoded using any encoding text except base64 and hex

13999341
hex	binary
if compatibility is an concern a work around this would be to encode non- utf-8 buffers ahead of time with a binary-safe encoding like binary base64 or hex

13999341
decoder	encoder
turns out another module msgpack-js which is a msgpack encoder decoder all written in javascript leaves raw binary data as such hence solving the above problem

13999407
devise	cancan
i m using rails + devise + cancan

13999439
bluetooth	usb
the serial port is a usb with a bluetooth connected

13999445
for-loop	loops
i believe you want to use a regular for-loop vs a for each loops

13999446
spaces	delimiter
instead the string is spaces delimiter

13999453
put	get
my applet queries a mysql database so i included the connector j jar in the eclipse project libraries and my applet runs fine in eclipse but when i put it on the website i get an error about that jdbc driver

13999504
google-chrome	safari
it displays properly in all browsers but google-chrome and possibly safari can t test that one - i want the lines at the top to be all the way at the top of the screen

13999504
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried but this only works on opera and firefox but has a 28px blank space at the top in google-chrome

13999504
opera	firefox
if i change the margin-top to -28px it doesn t display properly in opera and firefox

13999572
portrait	landscape
i have the initial view controller that is portrait and i want the next view controller to only be landscape

13999595
maven	pom.xml
the sauce connect maven plugin can be included in your project by adding the following to your pom.xml file

13999671
width	height
when people say using tables for formatting is bad they re referring to the ancient technique of using empty table cells with set width height as padding rather than using css

13999691
mouse	keyboard
also consider offering keyboard control for one player and mouse control for the other

13999695
vala	genie
since vala and genie were already mentioned i ll put bacon basic converter out there for those who reminisce about hand coding programs from a monthly print publication but want to use it with a modern gui

13999698
hide	show
show a progress indicator when you start reading then hide it when you finish reading

13999706
submit	submission
and i noticed you are binding an onclick to a submit button in your form without preventing the default behavior from executing the default behavior being a form submission which refreshes the page and thus makes you lose your place and go back to the beginning

13999731
min	max
i want to pass the min price and max price into the form like

13999743
min	max
you could always have a divisor set up for each popular device or somehow fetch the max and min values

13999743
min	max
if the min number was negative subtract that from the current value so that it has to be positive then divide by the max

13999758
width	height
i had the exact same issue with a class i wrote in which i had to override the width and height getters by adding 1 to the return values of each super method

13999799
multiplying	add
you can take the top image and multiplying it by the mask using cimultiplyblendmode then add it to the bottom image using ciadditioncompositing

13999803
sorting	filtering
the benefit is that you are able to lazily load only what is needed for the clients demands such as sorting filtering etc.

13999822
switching	screens
try switching the simulated view to a 3.5 screens in your storyboard there s a button for that in the bottom right of the storyboard in xcode

13999855
folder	directory
when i run the development server i notice that my css files are not getting pulled in but they are specified with the correct directory implying that django is not finding my static files folder

13999855
folder	directory
my folder is defined in the project directory fold as static and contains a folder called css with bootstrap.css

13999862
uiview	calayer
to pull a view into gpuimage you can use a gpuimageuielement source which takes a uiview or calayer as input

13999903
min	max	aggregate-functions	sum
this demonstrates the single-value rule which prohibits the undefined results you get when you run a group by query and you include any columns in the select-list that are neither part of the grouping criteria nor appear in aggregate-functions sum min max etc.

13999904
button	checkbox
i m not sure if this is because i m using javascript and custom button or if the default cakephp checkbox do the same thing

13999909
for-loop	loops
for instance in c89 should you decide to declare your loops counters within a for-loop declaration the following typically produces a compiler error

13999914
touchesbegan	touchesended
to recognize a tap i simply compare the coordinates for a touch object at the touchesbegan to touchesended and consider it a tap if the coordinates are the same or moved insignificantly

13999922
disk	ram
context i m trying to implement an intelligent system that responds to jvm state specifically memory usage shifting between caching working data to disk and holding it in ram

13999928
for-loop	loops
loops starts with and should iterate to which means it should iterate 11 times but why is it entering the for-loop again and printing loops 11

13999967
touchescancelled	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchescancelled	touchesbegan	touchesended
my original assumption that each touch would have its own object that starts at touchesbegan and ends with either touchesended or touchescancelled i think is correct

13999967
touchesmoved	touchesended
tracking by coordinates didn t work because i found that for the second touch the touchesended coordinates were identical to the last one in touchesmoved rather than the previous location in touchesended matching the touchlocation in touchesmoved as with the first touch

13999971
width	height
i m not sure exactly what is going on as i set the width and height of the frame to the pagesize.width height any help is appreciated

13999971
width	height
my guess is the pagesize width and height are in different units than the pixels unit type used for defining the frame of the view

13999971
width	height
i could manually figure out the width and height by experimentation but that would not be very dynamic for different paper sizes i m assuming

13999995
stdout	stderr
evidently the interactive interpreter writes everything to stderr except for print output which it writes to stdout

13999995
stdout	stderr
every time a byte of data is written by the child process stdout or stderr it s redirected to the appropriate print function in my shell

14000035
sorting	filtering
i don t feel this extends to paging sorting and filtering imo there should be one specifically crafted database query per page of data you are displaying which returns exactly the data set required to display that page

14000041
post	put
i ve been trying to put names in the buttons and was hoping to detect them via isset _post name but when i click the save or the other button it just saved my variables but does not put anything in the post variable

14000063
portrait	landscape
i am able to display the grid view without any issues but the problem is i have to make to work in both portrait and landscape in portrait it will be 3 rows and 2 columns with fixed height without any scrolling and in landscape mode it will be 2 rows and 3 columns without any scrolling challenge here is currently there are 6 items in my gridview suppose tomorrow if i change that to 8 or 4 items it should work without scrolling in both orientation and also should work for both mobiles and tablets

14000063
width	height
i tried searching a lot and got this and tried it which will give me height and width of device and i tried decrementing the header 40dp value and footer 40dp with the height and width but not working

14000073
cells	tablecell
you can access the text within a tablecell with gettext but it s a good idea to confirm that the cells contains text first

14000074
width	height
i m not sure about your code what s really happening.but the thing is that contentsize of scrollview takes two param ie height and width which you want to scroll as it s nature of cgsize unlike the cgrectmake as you used

14000079
apache	nginx
i know how to install apache or nginx to an ubuntu server on aws

14000101
pop-up	dialog
android documentation tells us that an implicit intent might be received by multiple components as all of them would have registered with the specific intent filter and the system pop-up a dialog asking which component to use to handle the intent

14000101
pop-up	dialog
after posting my question i found a related question here but it is not exactly same because in my case i am looking at ways to avoid that pop-up dialog

14000120
mouse	keyboard
i completely agree with what the other folks here say -- some of these opening all other processes and hooking writeprocessmemory mouse keyboard emulation functions are crazy and ludicrous -- especially since the user can bypass this by dropping privileges to your process

14000129
implements	extends
i know it s a bit counter-intuitive but for this you write extends rather than implements

14000147
rubygems	bundler
usr local lib rubygems 1.9.1 gems bundler-1.0.18 lib bundler spec_set.rb 88 in materialize could not find rake-0.9.2.2 in any of the sources bundler gemnotfound

14000170

i m not used to seeing that and the post method i thought it was only for get

14000173
pull	push
it prompts me the below dialog every time whenever i do a push pull

14000188
subtract	add
hey guys i m new to c++ - i wanted to make a program to add and subtract time using a hh mm format

14000228
post	get	webclient	webrequest
you can continue using webclient to post instead of get which is the http verb you re currently using with downloadstring but i think you ll find it easier to work with the slightly lower-level classes webrequest and webresponse

14000228
post	get
there are two parts to this - the first is to post the login form the second is recovering the set-cookie header and sending that back to the server as cookie along with your get request

14000239
client-side	server-side
however my server-side and client-side hash-digests don t match up even when the hash-messages are the same i have checked this

14000249
width	height
dear you know about apply height and width dynamic then apply this height and width of image view of gridview runtime

14000249
width	height
it s work dear and where landscape then interchange width and height

14000249
width	height
interchange height and width

14000267
for-loop	loops
i tried it in a for-loop to see if i could just bounce 100 times but bounce would just call once after loops finished

14000284
post	get
also note that match will match all http requests post as well as get

14000292
for-loop	loops
another tip if you have no particular reason to use the for-loop using a while loops instead will make your code cleaner and shorter

14000309
primefaces	icefaces
i believe that myfaces primefaces and icefaces all have video player components which could be used for displaying videos saved on your server but there are obviously quite a few nuts and bolts to get out of the way before you are live streaming video from one user and broadcasting the live feed to others right in the browser

14000323
hide	show
i m trying to achieve a simple group option switcher with jquery show and hide

14000323
hide	show
on click hide all other select tags and show the one i d like to see

14000340
width	height
you should never use css to resize the canvas element rather you should be using the width and height properties via js like i do in my example above

14000341
lan	localhost
but when i switch my dev environment eclipse to 1.7 the same operations perform really slow about 4.5 to 8kb s and these are to localhost servers and another server within the lan

14000342
swift	objective-c
special thanks - this is pretty much a swift translation from the objective-c version given by the other answer

14000372
onclick	onfocus
using settimeout in the onfocus event in addition to the onclick event solves the problem as the onfocus doesnt seem to be inhibited

14000374
subtraction	addition
using a two s complement representation where the highest bit represents a negative value of twice the magnitude of the next highest bit in this case -2 1 will simplify matters immensely as it will allow you to perform addition and subtraction exactly as if both numbers were unsigned

14000412
width	height
increase the size of your chart as a whole using it s width and height css values under the style attributes

14000426
udp	tcp
that is the tradeoff that improves the speed of udp versus tcp

titlebar	window
support for no window decoration no titlebar minimize- or close button

14000461
getter	setter
in a simple example if you created one method that is a setter of something and a one method used as a getter of that something then you will write a test that says when i use the setter the getter will return the same value..

14000467
apache	nginx
i change apache port to 8080 and restart service for making changes and start nginx and there is some problem

14000467
apache	nginx
when i try reaching every domains on my centos vps i face to apache start page welcome page and when i enter my vps ip in browser like x.x.x.x i face to nginx start page welcome page

g++	gcc
c++ 11 threading model it s not ready yet for gcc based on g++ 4.7 or clang from the latest svn rev

14000722
post	put
last note to create an object on calling api objects you should do a post and not a put to adhere to rest best practices and widely adopted patterns

14000729
client-side	server-side
however it can be helpful to use the partials name from angularjs in the public folder to help avoid confusion between server-side views client-side partials

14000729
client-side	server-side
for instance towerjs has a pretty clean config folder however they mix up server-side client-side code which i personally do not like

14000770
width	height
for your case you would add a width and height constraint and link them to two outlets

14000799
width	height
i have given fix width and height to cols divs

14000801
client-side	server-side
first time we have an api that unifies client-side and server-side

14000820
post	get
unfortunately javascript can t use many of the rest features setting accept header calling anything but get post etc. but it s not a big deal

14000839
zoo	xts
when you manipulate times series it is better to use zoo or xts packages

14000891
width	height
you could even go to 10000 but at that point and depending on the width or height of the control you will probably bump up against the resolution of the monitor

14000896
post	get
i wanted to post a workaround that seems to work for me consistently because in the end we have to get work done and not spend hours trying to fix this

14000896
post	get
simply add view-source to the beginning of the url and it will show the source with the get post data that you are trying to use

14000898
post	get
i currently write all get and post methods in the same file but i want greater readability and manageability

14000898
put	get	post	get	post	put
i ve tried to put the code in different files but while running the main app the rest of get and post methods in other files are not able to called

integer	fractions
the integer part of a floating point number is present in the binary in its normal form for instance if the value is 25.7482 you will have the bits 11001 25 in the floating point with the bits following representing the fractions actually the first 1 is never stored it s implied in the format

14006001
integer	fractions	multiplying	subtract
if you subtract 25.0 from that number and multiplying by 10 you get 7.482 and by examining the integer part of that value you can obtain the first fractions digit 7

14006001
multiplying	subtract
subtract 7.0 multiplying by 10 gives 4.82 thus the next digit 4 and so on

filtering	grouping
if you want to perform a filtering after the grouping by then you will use a having clause

14006304
filtering	grouping
a having clause is typically used for aggregate function filtering so it makes sense that this would be applied after the grouping by

14006304
filtering	grouping
using this order you will apply the filtering in the where prior to a grouping by

14006338
filtering	grouping
if you want to filtering on something that could be determined prior to the grouping everyone with firstname mark that s done via where

14006339
filtering	grouping
the where clause comes before the grouping by because conceptually you filtering before you grouping not after

14006339

14006346
implements	extends
sadly annotating annotations with other annotations doesn t give inheritance like i d hoped and annotations can t extends or implements other classes it seems

14006356
filtering	grouping
the filtering specified in the where clause is used before grouping

14006356
filtering	grouping
after grouping you can have a having clause which is similar to where except you can filtering by aggregate values as well

int	chars
the idea is to go through each chars and add the int form of it to the vector see full sample

14006436
int	chars
what this does is loop through from the beginning of the string to the end take each chars and add the value of it minus 0 5 - 0 would be 5 to the end of the vector leaving you with a vector of the int equivalents

14006436
int	chars
instead this finds the distance between 0 and the chars which is the int we need

14006905
inherited	properties
i ve read about properties sheet inherited but i don t see how that s useful because it seems that if you want to add a project-specific include directory then you will have to set the additional include directories in the properties for that specific project which will then override the inherited properties sheet which defines the boost include directory

inherited	properties
this will automatically inherited those project configurations from the same properties sheet

14007258
inherited	properties
provided that the project configurations have inherited from parent or project defaults checked this controls inserting inherited vs noinherit in 2005 2008 and propertyname in 2010 2012 for those properties you should see any project-specific properties set in the project configurations prepended by default to the values in the properties sheet

14007258
inherited	properties
the value on the command line for a single-value properties comes from the first place in the properties inherited chain that specifies it starting with the project configuration then the properties sheets then the built-in default in the project system

14007258
inherited	properties
thus by default you should see the boost paths showing up in your project settings provided they have intentionally not inherited the properties from the properties sheet

keydown	keyup
use the keydown or keyup events instead

14009401
keydown	keyup
however the noncharacter keys do raise the keydown and keyup events

14009429
lseek	fseek
i know about fseek and lseek and i might use those instead if they work but regardless i want to know why the above does not work

14009466
put	get	multiplying	subtract
now i know this is simple just put a nanotime object when the intent is executed and another nanotime when i get the result subtract the two and multiplying to get it in seconds milliseconds

14009466
for-loop	loops
however i have the intent on loops because i want to scan a sequence of qr codes and i figured that a for-loop is the best way to go about it

14009466
put	get
what happens is if i call it before the loop i get one result only if i put it inside the loop i get multiple results which aren t so far from one another

14009479
next	except
i looked at some other picture websites and 9gag had exactly what i wanted on my site each image had a number assigned to it in the url whenever i clicked the next button all it did was change the number at the end of the url except with 9gag the images are uploaded by users so the site must somehow create another url each time someone uploads a new image and i m looking for a way to do this except i m the one choosing all of the images

14009480
put	get
so you can put the resource name into your property file and then use this method to get the id

14009506
postgresql	mysql
i have a very extensive php update script based on php yii that updates a database on different database types mssql postgresql and mysql

14009521
implements	extends
in your code what happens is when you implements two interfaces expression and statement which is extends to different generics here what happens is compiler gets confused that what to consider hence it will not allow you to implements both the interfaces expression statement for the same class

14009525
width	height
rest is up to you how you make the looks an feel in your application i just solved your entire width height issue of text area

14009542
try-catch	exception-handling
you are supposed to throw or try-catch all checked exception-handling its not required for runtimeexception and exception-handling that you are talking about is a runtimeexception

14009543
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
if you want to define an unchecked-exception yourself derive it from runtimeexception insted of exception

14009547
inherited	properties
styling a single element is never dependent on a single class it inherited some of the properties from the parent class too...for example

14009561

put	get
since i couldn t find a way to use that i copied the file put it on a public folder get the url and used it in the style.

14009667
integer	unsigned
instead of unsigned long long you could use std uintmax_t from cstdint to get the largest possible integer range without using an actual big-integer library

14009701
width	height
as far as the jquery zoom animation you currently have it is correct for you to animate both the width and the height at the same time

14009721
post	get
also you can omit and attributes because in web api action methods with name starting from get will be mapped to get requests post to post and so on and other part of the method name chapters is treated as the action name

14009758
post	get
if the target action is post only let s assume it s called targetaction you could create a new action that allows get and does return targetaction

14009819
min	max
i need to cast float to short if integer part of float more than short max value short should be equals short max value and if integer part of float less than short min value short should be equals short min value in other cases i need to convert float to short and get only integer value of float

14009854
width	height
i have set width and height but it ignores this and shows as original size

14009860
sqoop	hadoop
another hadoop technology you can find useful is sqoop - which moves data between hdfs and rdbms

14009863
getter	setter
but you can do this using getter and setter it will help you like this

14009923
redhat	fedora
on redhat fedora suse linux you could just type

14009927
client-side	server-side
you cannot rewrite to an url with hashes they re resolved at the client-side not at the server-side

14009928
getter	setter
you must provide a getter and a setter

14009932
concave	convex
poly2tri - is a robust lib also having java port which triangulates both convex and concave poly sets.also deals with holes

14009952
width	height
yes twitter bootstrap css overrides the height attribute and depending on browser and its mode the width attribute as well

14009952
width	height
it sets height auto and width auto 9

14009954
getter	setter
when defining an as3 class you can use implicit getter and setter to call functions for simple property get set operations

14009954
getter	setter
however i d find it extremely useful to be able to define getter and setter on dynamically created properties

14009990
maven	pom.xml
after adding spring-core to pom.xml i had object scala not found while building a project with maven

14010016
unsigned	short
is the comparison signed or unsigned is it int or short etc.

14010096
vmware	virtualbox
2 maybe setup some windows virtual machine with help of virtualbox or vmware fusion to test ie

14010148
cout	cin
other sites talk about iostreams and threads like this one but that doesn t explain why i was getting corrupted output when i was using std cin in only one thread and std cout in its own thread too

14010148
cout	cin
the problem is that internally the std cin input thread was calling to std cout to flush its buffer but as the streams where not synchronized with mutex or something similar the output was corrupted

14010148
cout	cin
why std cin was messing with std cout

14010148
cout	cin
in c++ by default the standard streams cin cerr and clog are tied to cout

14010148
cout	cin
it means that when you try to read from cin first it will force a flush to cout

14010258
post	get
if it works for get it most likely is properly configured for post actions

14010282
uilabel	uisegmentedcontrol
|- within this i have 2 uiviews that i show 1 contains a uisegmentedcontrol the other just contains nothing but uilabel

the linear plot of the density results in a tall column in range 0 1000 with two very long tails towards positive infinity and negative infinity

14010340
width	height
your images most likely do not have width and height set

14010340
width	height
webkit browsers will see images on document.ready with zero width and height

14010340
width	height
fix html to have width and height attributes on images

14010421
domxpath	domdocument
domxpath would also be a nice addition in this case because it would allow you to avoid the hassle of selecting domdocument nodes with dom functions like getelementsbytagname etc

14010431
rspec	capybara
first attempt using standard rspec capybara selenium

14010505

14010879
ant	maven
below is a helloworld style example although it is written for maven and not ant

14010883
lxml	elementtree
use the elementtree or the faster api equivalent lxml then use the function to serialize the tree back to just the text content

14010957
int	chars
the size of chars images im1 and im2 can be such that an int overflow can happen but i think that this kind of situation is handled equally by the two compilers but at this point i am not so sure

14010961
slideup	slidedown
so basically i m wanting to make the slidedown and slideup horizontal

14010984
lxml	elementtree	lxml	celementtree
lxml can be problematic you can do the exact thing martijn pieters said with elementtree or c version celementtree which is in standard library

14011301
reverse-engineering	obfuscation
now i know obfuscation basically is used to eliminate the reverse-engineering possibilities of a code and to secure it but i ve found that many obfuscators also include .net linker feature

14011344
for-loop	arrays
if you know the keys or indexes of the arrays you can do what kingcrunch is doing a lot faster by simple for-loop

14011348
hide	show
i am using magento 1.4.1.1 and i want to disable payment option for some products.i want to show only cash on delivery method for some products and need to hide other

add a real imageview not textview to your layout using an linearlayout to have both the textview and imageview

14011548
g++	gcc
you can test it yourself using the -e flag with gcc g++

14011602
put	get
if you havent checked for what you are getting in your arrey then offset error 2 will show because of array is not getting what it expects to get and so you should put the above on the top of the file to disable the html errors

14011606
junit	testng
i m now trying to write a series of successful integration tests using junit as the underlying testng lib between myrestclient and the 3rd party api to make sure this class behaves correctly under a variety of circumstances

14011699
int	chars
chars plus int is not string

14011699
int	chars
and when you add an int to a chars you get an int a + 2 produces the int chars code corresponding to c not the string a2

14011699
int	chars
you re getting some crazy int by adding the user id to the colon chars

14011715
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the webpage is fine in google-chrome firefox and safari

14011749
try-catch	exception-handling
why can t i do it just normally with a try-catch statement like this sorry i don t know how to simulate an io exception-handling so couldn t check it myself

14011755
google-chrome	safari
however on webkit based browsers such as google-chrome and safari i am given the first alert but not the other 2 until the process has completed

14011768
decltype	auto
expression templates could help speed up this use case though it would cause problems with auto and decltype type inference in c++11 as well as with template type inference in c++98

14011771
implements	extends
so the variable we want to be bindable must be of a type that extends eventdispatcher or implements ieventdispatcher

14011771
implements	extends
another options is to use objectproxy which allows you to add eventlisteners and make an object bindable even though it doesn t extends eventdispatcher or implements ieventdispatcher

14011771
public	protected
also note that you need to make your variable public protected or private for bindable to work

14011771
public	protected
you can use the bindable metadata tag ... b efore a public protected or private property defined as a variable to make that specific property support binding

14011785
hide	show
show and hide close it as per your requirement timers etc

14011801
put	get
usually you should put a limit statement in the end of the query script to limit the amount of rows you want to get

14011806
post	get
but when i change the get to post both at the client side and server side everything is ok i can get the parameter correctly

14011809
domxpath	scrape
i am using domxpath to scrape the contents

14011814
illegalargumentexception	runtimeexception
runtimeexception and error and all of their subclasses illegalargumentexception stackoverflowerror etc are unckecked exceptions

14011814
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
one famous such exception is nullpointerexception often abbreviated as nullpointerexception which is a subclass of runtimeexception and therefore unchecked

14011814
try-catch	exception-handling
another very crucial difference between unchecked exception-handling and checked exception-handling is that within a try-catch block if you want to catch unchecked exception-handling you must catch them explicitly

14011826
post	get
in order to get params from bodyparser you must use post not get

14011833
int	chars
you are working with chars and int which are not automatically converted to a string unless they are used within a string expression

14011837
filesystems	ntfs
as far as i know if the filesystems is ntfs for example files can t be copied from a mac platform to the drive

14011842
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
because that s how the jls define an unchecked-exception an exception that is or extends runtimeexception which itself extends exception

14011867
filesystems	fat
the only filesystems set that is that compatible is the fat family

14011969
width	height
since you asked this question in the context of using auto layout the issue here is that a uibutton has an intrinsic size communicated through the intrinsiccontentsize method that provides auto layout with information about width and height but a uiview normally does not

14011969
width	height
so you need to add more constraints related to width and height

14011969
width	height
note that the toitem argument is nil and the second attribute is nslayoutattributenotanattribute because you aren t specifying the width and height relative to anything else

14011969
width	height
if you want the subview s height and width to be relative to the superview say 0.5 you could do this

14012118
width	height
the following are the input and output images that i get when resizing the input to twice its width and height

14012123
typedef	struct
in c a struct definition is not a typedef

14012126
queue	fifo
researchers have designed things like lock-free linked lists and fifo filo queue and some lock-free trees

14012233
nullpointerexception	illegalstateexception
for example a programming error like division by zero nullpointerexception a wrong usage of an api illegalstateexception operationnotsupportedexception an hardware crash or just some minor situation that are not recoverable lost connection to a server or a doomsday -

14012258
equals	gethashcode
you have to override equals and gethashcode and if you like need the syntax you need also to overload and

14012291
multiplication	exponent
also note that you have the wrong order of operations exponent come before multiplication

14012292
strncmp	memcmp
you may also try to first check that reply.len is 2 and then call memcmp instead of strncmp

14012295
yacc	bison
there are lots of examples in the net how to use lex and yacc bison

14012378
post	get
i ve read similar post for .match search and .findall and they all go over the searching part but nothing goes over how to get the results in a useful format

14012431
x86	64bit
i have the following java version installed version 7 update 9 in windows 7 64bit in the program files x86 folder

14012436
post	get
this is the raw response that i get from the post

14012494
getter	setter
below is how entities looks like with setter and getter

14012494
instances	transient
references an unsaved transient instances - save the transient instances

14012496
vim	emacs
i really like the incremental development aspect of cl i don t use emacs however - i m running slimv in vim but i find myself developing more slowly than i would in python perl c or even nasm

14012504
client-side	server-side
deliver the first page of results using a server-side view then subsequent pages via ajax - either as json results delivered and mark-up created client-side or as html rendered server-side and inserted into the proper spot in the dom

14012514
prepare	execute
execute prepare statements

14012542
hide	show
when each section is selected in navigation i want to hide some static elements in the page hide other sections if they have been selected and loaded before and show the current section

14012566
min	max
but i am not sure if min and max have been automatically computed and interpolated

14012569
subtract	add
and have only done a cpl programs that add - mulitpy - divide and subtract values for the golf program for putting

14012569
put	get
but under each of these staements spingroupbox.spin1radiobutton.checked i get wavy lines and when i put my mouse over it it says - upradiobutton is not a member of system.windows.forms.groupbox

14012591
hash	md5
based on the hash_file manual i m extracting the contents of the file and create the md5 hash hex on java but i can t make them match

14012612
width	height
each page is a div with css to take up the whole screen with height width properties and float left

14012613
single-quotes	double-quotes
it is perfectly fine to use single-quotes double-quotes heredoc and nowdoc depending on what you need formatting variables inside etc.

14012649
min	max
the queries i m calling avg min max work fine with the values i ve got as the fields store numerical data this is merely due to another script that deals with adding or updating the data -- that s already running mysqli and using text was the best solution for my situation

14012649
min	max
that s shorter than the original as there s 4x3 sets of queries temp0 temp1 temp2 temp3 and min max avg for each

14012649
min	max
i ve cut the code down to only show the avg query loop but the min and max loops are nearly identical

14012667
awt	swing
do not use keylistener use a keyadapter however as you are using swing and not awt you should use keybinding s for swing see here for example

14012669
setcontentview	findviewbyid
you get an error because you try to use findviewbyid before calling setcontentview

14012669
setcontentview	findviewbyid
you will not get an error as you call findviewbyid after calling setcontentview

14012707
range	max	range	min	min	max
if so you should adjust the gamma value dynamically giving the min and max range

14012710
width	height
if there is no restriction on having real dom width and height you can also go for css transforms

14012721
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
alternative 3 - using javascript native filter method ie9 google-chrome firefox opera safari

14012756
oncreate	getwritabledatabase	oncreate	ondestroy
getwritabledatabase is called from the activity s oncreate and the resulting database is closed in ondestroy

14012774
vbo	vao
if you implement a ray intersection approach then having a vao or vbo is completely irrelevant because you re not going to use opengl for this

14012778
min	max
from my reading of your code you have a fixed number of columns and know their names and you are applying the avg min max aggregates to the same table over the same aggregate group with no where clause applied

14012794
put	get
or if you actually intend to get rid of the argument then you should put parentheses in the el method expression

14012797
min	max
you can use nsexpression with you fetch to get really high performance functions like min max average etc

14012852
folder	directory
the root folder of the skeleton directory does not contain any index.php file thus the 404 error

14012860
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
on all of my browsers firefox google-chrome and safari on os x 10.8.2 the open sans regular font weight 400 is displaying as semi-bold

14012922
hash	md5
therefore the code that i use to compute sha1 or md5 hash for example is exactly the same with the exception of elements that i use from the said library constants functions and structs

14012922
hash	md5
for example when i compute md5 hash i have this

14012931
getter	setter
this little class takes an instance the name of a property and then two functions a getter and a setter

14012931
getter	setter
the public getter and setter are backed by the functions passed in

14012931
getter	setter
there are some obvious improvements that one could make namely abstracting the passed in getter and setter into static methods for reuse

14012982
portrait	landscape
what im trying to achieve is have a few ipad only xibs in landscape only rest of app is portrait

14013000
width	height
i tried setting width and height to fill_parent

14013018
awt	swing
you re trying to select a file using swing awt

14013018
awt	swing
so swing awt would also run in the physical machine where the webserver runs and thus definitely not in the physical machine where the webbrowser runs

14013018
awt	swing
basically when swing awt shows some ui it would be shown in the monitor attached to the webserver not the one attached to the webbrowser

14013018
primefaces	tomahawk
the normal approach is to look for a 3rd party component library such as tomahawk or primefaces

14013076
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the basic rule seems to be that the root controller whether it be a uinavigationcontroller uitabbarcontroller or just a simple uiviewcontroller takes control of the rotation

14013083
public	protected
though on the whole i must say it s probably a good idea to assign the actual connection to a private or protected property and add a public geconnection member-function if ever you might need it

14013088
google-chrome	safari
webkit bugs the rendering engine used by google-chrome and safari

14013088
opera	safari
safari internet explorer and opera do not share their issue tracking with the general public as they are proprietary closed-source software

14013099
ubuntu	debian
this works for debian linuxes ubuntu

14013147
public	protected
but mg is only protected and inherited using public access

14013236
free	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	calloc	malloc	realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc
you should only call free on objects that were allocated by a call to malloc realloc calloc etc

14013255
for-loop	arrays
i have a for-loop which creates text fields from an arrays to represent high scores

14013278
getter	setter
the property declaration declares the existence of the getter and setter methods

14013328
width	height
edit forgot to also state that i removed the height and width on the current css declaration that was unnecessary and almost definitely causing the spacing issues

14013412

14013654
opengl-es	glkbaseeffect
if you are a beginner there is far too much going on in there to understand properly and it mixes opengl-es 1.1 glkbaseeffect and 2.0 shaders

14013666
button	checkbox
checkbox select lists radio button etc and not just text then you could use the following snippet i put together assuming you re using jquery

14013671
width	height
problem is that i cannot fill completely the height of the layout the size of the custom view is always squared width height

14013678
division	multiplication
but since division is pretty expensive i think that this is even worse than 2 multiplication

14013686
calloc	malloc	realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc
also to clear up what other purpose malloc has you can t return stack-allocated memory from a function so if your function needs to return allocated memory you typically use malloc or some other member of the malloc familiy including realloc and calloc to obtain a block of memory

14013686
free	malloc
however a pointer obtained using malloc remains valid through function calls until you don t call free on it

14013769
free	malloc
i would add that in this particular example malloc is very wasteful as there is more memory allocated for the array than what would appear due to overhead in malloc as well as the time it takes to call malloc and later free - and there s overhead for the programmer to remember to free it - memory leaks can be quite hard to debug

14013774
apache	nginx
multiple apache servers for load balancing behind an nginx reverse-proxy to deal with the high concurrency

14013795
namedtuple	dictionary
and possibly instead of your functions to return items - use a dictionary or a namedtuple .

monadfoo classes are generally for providing the essential operations for each monad generically get and put for monadstate

14013955
google-chrome	firefox

14013969
floating-point	integer
since floating-point numbers aren t exact there s no guarantee that your number will actually be an integer

14014011
put	get
one way to get this to fire when a user touches the background is to add a tap event to the view and put the above message in the tap gesture event handler

14014028
width	margin
when i resize the windows below 767 768 px width the body and navbar get a strange right margin padding 20px each

14014203
rdf	owl
that s technically fine and possible though it leaves one to wonder why you would need this since owl rdf provide both for you already

14014219
versioning	upgrade
if you add this repository after upgrade the netbeanside you â â will see that all base modules will have replaced by the development release and practically you will have another versioning of netbeans installed

14014246
arduino	avr-gcc
edit if you really want to use objective-c and arduino i suggest researching avr-gcc and objective-c

jboss	glassfish
use jboss 7 or a recent glassfish and save your energy

14014273
submit	submission
the problem is that when i submit the form it takes me to a page where the api website confirms the submission with some jibberish xml text

14014284
super	self
the problem is that when we get to step four self still refers to our instance of b so calling super points back to a again

14014304
int	double
this can be achieved easily by rounding the double up cast to int will round them towards 0

14014310
folder	directory
i have placed detours.cpp detours.h detours.lib into detours directory which i temporarily created into hooking folder where my vs visual studio code lies

multiplying	subtract
but multiplying with deltatime you subtract the same amount calculated from the starting value in all of the deltatime time units

14014362
post	get
basically i sort of need to get 5 post of each user

14014365
getter	setter
you need getter and setter to reach variables from other classes

14014368
google-chrome	firefox
behavior in both google-chrome and firefox

14014387
oncreate	setcontentview
2 move the instantiation of the textview s to the oncreate method after the setcontentview call

14014388

use fql to get post from your app

14014388
post	get
this query will get post made in the account of the user by the photos app

14014388
post	get
and replace filter_key with others to get other people s post that the user can view

14014442
int	double
converting to an int truncates the double drops any fraction bit

14014449
devise	rolify
i m not using devise just omniauth and rolify

14014457
factors	matrix
making it a matrix will of course turn a factors into its numeric underpinnings so if you were hoping to have meaningful labels you have shot yourself in the foot by using matrix format

14014460
lxml	elementtree
i would use lxml and the elementtree part to parse very large xml files

14014470
lxml	elementtree
depending upon the format of your data elementtree here here or lxml which supports the elementtree

14014495
jobs	cron
but to let you know oozie is a bit complicated and if and only if you have a lot of jobs to be scheduled monitored maintained then only you shall go for oozie or else just create a bunch of cron jobs if you have say just 2 or 3 jobs to be scheduled periodically

14014507
width	height
it is normally better to use padding since the button will support different text lengths and let the padding control the width and height depending on the text within the button however if you want your buttons to be one size and one size only for example a button with submit and a button with download will be 2 different sizes and if you are displaying these along side each other you may want them to be the same size as one another in this case then a width height set because more ideal

14014507
width	height
by the way the way you shouldn t need to use height 18px or width 0

14014521
post	get
all the other routes using http get and post work fine

14014521
post	get
i know that some browsers don t send http delete only http get and http post and rails puts something in the header to indicate that the request is a delete but it is passbook that is sending the http delete request so i don t know if that has anything to do with the problem

14014614
implements	extends
the closest you can get is to have an interface or abstract class and then use anonymous inner class to implements extends it

14014638
awt	swing
instead subclass and override the paint awt or paintcomponent swing method

14014657
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
you have to use nscalendar and nsdatecomponents for this

14014669
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
this code consistently fails to build in ubuntu 12.04 12.10 linux mint 13 and 14 but it compiles correctly on ubuntu maverick 10.10

14014786
folder	directory
naturally this led me to believe that i could just upload to a different folder on the server copy and rename the file to my uploads directory and unlink the original upload

14014789
getter	setter
and just a quick tip for you is that you can have getter and setter in js like this

14014820
width	height
width height

14014820
width	height
width height

14014832
accessor	properties
you initially were using a method name addobject which is only associated with the unordered accessor pattern and your properties was an indexed properties nsmutablearray

14014845
unsigned	short
if i define a variable in c unsigned short int n 5 that value is stored somewhere in the user s ram in binary in this case it would look something like 0000 0000 0000 0101

14014859
joptionpane	jdialog
and thinking about it more jdialog also reproduces results i think its due to the modality of joptionpane s and jdialog s

14014863
client-side	server-side
since you tagged your question asp.net i m going to assume you want to do this server-side so you are not relying on javascript on the client-side to generate html links

14014879
hide	show
have the all in the html in the first place then hide and show the ones you need

14014979
addition	multiplication
addition is multiplication

14014979
addition	multiplication
swapping q1 q2 yields different results quite neither like addition nor multiplication

14014985
getter	setter
when you use property tags to create getter setter the magic is auto wired for to-one relationships and you only need to addobserver.

14014989
primefaces	omnifaces
i m using omnifaces 1.3 + primefaces 3.4.1 + jboss 7.1.1 final but i just can t redirect the exceptions with the fullajaxexceptionhandler configured on my web.xml when they come by ajax request

14015006
width	height
as i m using border-radius for creating circles setting height width and border-radius of 50 i try to create some kind of grid in javascript where i iterate through each element and get its dimensions

14015033
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it works perfectly on google-chrome opera and safari but it doesn t on firefox

14015033
google-chrome	firefox
screenshots left google-chrome right firefox

14015068
google-chrome	firefox
it looks great in google-chrome exactly as it should but if you look at it in either firefox or ie the custom font face does not work

14015068
ready	each
i looked at many cases on this all ready but i don t see one that relates to my case as i thought i have included all the different necessary files for each browser and have them uploaded to their respected places

14015073
google-chrome	firefox
going the route of programmatically controlling a full desktop machine with a gpu and standard google-chrome firefox instance feels possible while fragile and i really really wouldn t want to go there if there are any software-only solutions

14015094
stdout	fflush
i thought reading from stdin caused stdout to be fflush though.

14015148
portrait	landscape
in the project summary screen i have selected both landscape options and i have deselected portrait options

14015167
google-chrome	safari
the uploaded image can be opened with photoshop but not with safari or google-chrome

14015171

i was finding if i pointed an iis application on my development machine to the actual project directory in which resides the web.config myservice.svc and bin folder necessary for the wcf service application it just wouldn t work and was throwing this error

14015198
serializable	deserialization
for my money it s the best and simplest way to do over the wire xml serializable and deserialization

14015214
width	height
naturally the size of a div expands first by width then by height

14015214
width	height
that is the maximum width of a container must first be utilized before moving on to the height constraint

14015214
width	height
relative averaging is finding the average dimensions of your height width based of the exhisting area of the contianer bounding your content

14015214
width	height
the width and height of the div bounding your content can be detected with javascript

14015214
width	height
your total area is width height so 4000px

14015214
width	height
to acheive the same area with an equal width height you can do something like

14015373
ubuntu	linux
installing rcpp on linux ubuntu 12.04 with r2.15.2

14015422
xsl-fo	xslt
i have an xslt stylesheet that outputs xsl-fo which is used to generate a pdf file

14015442
background-image	background-position
if you want it to stretch for the entire widget use background-image but i m guessing what you probably want is an image that expands in one direction either vertically or horizontally in that case use background-position to fix it to one of the borders of your widget

14015486
many-to-one	one-to-many	many-to-many	many-to-one	many-to-many	one-to-many
what you have is a one-to-many or many-to-many relationship from child to parent not many-to-one since each child can apparently have multiple parents

14015503
put	get
i want to get rid of the first line and put it somewhere where it will get executed only once and then each time i receive a request that needs sql transactions i ll just have to call drivermanager.getconnection ...

14015526
children	parent
across all of the dynamic arrays in the tree there will be n - 1 pointers to children since of the n nodes in the tree n - 1 of them have parent

14015546
int	boolean
i have a list which consists of boolean and i am trying to make a function which takes a list of int and flips the boolean at the corresponding positions

14015565
width	margin
if your goal is to simply prevent the images in #right-side from flowing around #left-side then you ll need to add a margin or padding equal to the width of #right-side to #left-side

14015599
width	height
you cannot add any objects except null into but you can pass just to your function and then do buttonlist.add new button2 xpos ypos width height

14015627
overwrite	preserve
however with the exception that some users may install one or more versions to a different directory just to preserve them while choosing to overwrite most of the time

14015644
disk	ram
if you grab the ram first then your app will be the last left standing when physical memory is exhausted at the same time if you re not actually using all that ram then you may end up limiting the multi-tasking potential of your client s machine or causing unnecessary wasted disk space via a growing page file

14015648
put	get
let s assume that we have on hand an unlimited supply of flies frogs and boxes and let s say that it takes b time to get a box and y time to put a single fly into a box

14015648
put	get
the reason for this is that we need to get n boxes and put one frog into each box hence the first term plus y units of time for each of the flies hence the second term

14015665
bluetooth	usb
the end result is that when you connect a usb or bluetooth keyboard the prompt to set a keyboard layout lists any additional keyboard layouts installed by applications in this case one labelled english uk

14015686
min	max
that basically gets min and max values first from person data or the value supplied

14015706
post	get
however i was unable to get it to run as suggested in the above post

14015753
int	double
while heaps of course are popular for complex objects the priority often is an int of double value

14015754
width	height
elements have a width 15px and height 15px in css so they are visible

14015764
pull	push
the following alternative solution is not recommended because it is example of pull style and is not so flexible elegant and maintainable as the push style solution above however the op insists that he needs such inferior solution

14015775
ssl	https
i am using only http not https ssl is not configured on my server

14015831
post	get
when i post i get this error

14015836
uipagecontrol	uipageviewcontroller
otherwise i think you need to add a uipagecontrol to your uipageviewcontroller and basically tie them together to keep them in sync...but then you do have to do all the tying manually

14015853
std	ostream
the output operator for built-in strings the on taking a as argument isn t a member of std ostream

14015853
std	ostream
this member is the best match when passing any pointer explicitly to a member of std ostream

14015853
int	chars
the chars output function isn t a member function either while the output operators for int are it would print chars value of h

14015880
getter	setter
i prefer properties because i am able to define setter getter and because i like more that syntax

14015883
hash	salt
i use the follwing code to salt and hash passwords

14015896
mp3	ogg
not all browsers support the mp3 or ogg format so both are usually included to insure cross-browser compatibility

14015896
mp3	wav	mp3	ogg	wav	ogg
the wav can also be included and unlike mp3 and ogg it supports every browser minus internet explorer

14015896
google-chrome	safari
mp3 works with internet explorer 9+ google-chrome 6+ and safari 5+

14015896
mp3	wav	mp3	ogg	wav	ogg
so the combination of mp3 and wav or mp3 and ogg would play the html5 audio on virtually every major browser

14015896
mp3	wav	mp3	ogg	wav	ogg
of course it s a bad idea to include wav and ogg as a combo due to the fact that internet explorer requires mp3 as a format

14015902
accessor	properties
at compile-time all that can be guaranteed is that t is a base so the compiler binds the properties accessor to the base version of correctname and this will not change at run-time

14015903
opera	google-chrome
anyways i ve found a solution that works in google-chrome opera mozilla but not ie that is to use the form id tag

14015915
width	height
also i remove the width and height added by the api to the object to be able to style it width css

14015915
width	height
notice i have create the yt.player class with a width and height of 1px

14015934
ssl	https
some pages needs to be viewed over ssl https and others do not

14015948
post	get
even better you could write your backend to accept real-time updates from the foursquare api so that it doesn t have to poll at all -- it will get a post each time you check in and it can store that information to display it on your blog

14015967
int	chars
if it was an array of type int then it would be possible to use the sizeof function but given that each item of my array is a pointer to a chars string and each string could be of different length i don t think i can use this approach

14016043
hide	show
the following snippet fails -- it show the dialog but then pause resume hide it

14016089
serializable	deserialization
now the exception message says that the possible causes are invalid stream or object version change between serializable and deserialization

14016089
serializable	deserialization
since i haven t touched my class between serializable and deserialization i m guessing the problem is with the stream it being invalit or is it something else

14016125
versioning	upgrade
it differs from the versioning number in that it s typically not user facing and doesn t denote any difference features upgrade like a versioning number typically would

google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome internet explorer and firefox with firebug you can hit f12 and go to debug there you can check the scripts that have been loaded as there might have been scripts loaded dynamically

14016312
folder	directory
i have full control over how the files are stored as i receive them so i thought maybe storing them in a folder structure like year month day filename would be best then all i have to do is scan for the directory greater than or equal to the date i want to retrieve using scandir and casting the directory name to int values

14016333
getter	setter
your getter or setter is more than just a trivial assignment

14016352
implements	extends
i think the easiest work-around for this is to implements a custom cache extends memorycache that overrides all methods that interact with the key and calls toupperinvariant when passing it as parameter to the base call

14016377
portrait	landscape
firstviewcontroller is portrait and secondviewcontroller is landscape

14016378
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
you can re-implement the contextmenuevent method of the qgraphicsscene class which will give you access to the scene coordinates as well as the screen coordinates as opposed to qgraphicsview which also works but doesn t have this information

14016381
cvs	svn
if you are using mac nix or other environment with rsync you can pass in the -c argument to ignore svn cvs metadata

upgrade xerces jar files to a newer versioning matching at least the one used the servletcontainer

14016473

int	boolean
mysql doesn t have a native boolean type and uses c-style int for boolean instead

14021913
google-chrome	firefox
the fact that it does work in google-chrome but does not work in firefox puzzles me the most

14021913
google-chrome	firefox
somehow google-chrome knows how to handle this and firefox results in a broken pipe error

14021914

its 10 in octal which is 8 in decimal

14021953
implements	extends
you can extends only one class but you can implements multiple interfaces by comma separately

14021953
implements	extends
it would be more reader friendly to have the extends first before the implements

14021961
implements	extends
or even worst you might beed to declare extends and implements in order to use or

14022026
codeigniter	yii

14022343
rsa	aes
before all this i had to take out some initial set of bytes from my encrypted file and decrypt them using an rsa private key to get this aes key

14022343
rsa	aes
if someone has a link document i can read that properly explains the whole process of using aes to encrypt a file then using rsa on the key and iv to the begining of the encrypted file i will be extremely happy

14022348
addition	multiplication
now if every operation including addition multiplication etc. were written in the form of functions then we would have

14022385
int	double

when p is odd p-1 must be even so you can take n p-1 2 square it and then multiplying the result by n to compensate for the 1 that you subtract from p before squaring

14022611
setinterval	clearinterval
however it s much better to clear the setinterval with clearinterval after you re done with it

14022611
setinterval	settimeout
to answer your question - yes you can change setinterval with settimeout with some minor changes to the code you ve used for setinterval

14022644

bootstrap s input sizes only expand by width whereas the buttons expand by both height and font size

14022661
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
it works fine on google-chrome so i haven t tested it on firefox or opera yet

14022673
setinterval	settimeout
when you use setinterval to execute a function say every 1000 milliseconds which is equal to 1 second the function will be triggered every 1000 milliseconds no matter how long the function takes to execute whereas if you tried to do the same with settimeout if the function was taking say 500 milliseconds to execute your total time gap between execution of functions will be 1500 milliseconds

14022679
setinterval	settimeout
yes you can call the same function recursively using settimeout to get the effect of setinterval

14022679
setinterval	clearinterval
but setinterval function returns a id with which you can call the clearinterval function to stop it whenever needed

14022685

you could add a settimeout inside the setinterval i edited your code

14023067
printf	strlen
no it s not possible but you could use printf on those simple strings and avoid calling strlen every time

14023153
realloc	malloc
thought i d give this a shot top of my head this is a dynamic buffer using malloc and realloc using pointers

the only issue is to add the proper authentication and authorisation layer needed for the centralized server to allow or deny a git push pull clone operation

14023186
versioning	upgrade
if your compiler doesn t produce this code then you may need to upgrade the versioning of compiler to something a bit newer i reported this sort of thing to jan hubicka gcc maintainer for x86-64 at the time ca 2001 and i m sure it s been in gcc for quite some time

14023190
folder	directory
git does not support a -style wildcard so you can either use full paths etc. for to reflect the correct amounts of directory levels or you can simply put .gitignore files containing inside the folder where you want to unignore jar files

14023217
folder	directory
i m not sure how your application loads an excel file but you might have a correct excel file in the temp folder if it automatically tries to load one from current directory this is where your exe is when you execute from the rar file

background-color	font-size
you will need to write a custom method in your theme that takes care of changing the background-color instead of font-size

14023558
for-loop	arrays
your names arrays begins with a length property of 0 and so your first for-loop doesn t run because 0 is not less than 0

14023558
for-loop	arrays
again since nothing was entered into your names arrays your second for-loop again does nothing and doesn t execute document.write because the length property of your arrays is still 0

14023598
superclass	subclassing
depending on what you mean by exclusive foreign keys you might be thinking of vehicles and pieces as two subclassing of some larger superclass call it saleable items

14023598
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
if you use a design pattern called class table inherited you will have three tables one for the superclass and one for each subclassing table

14023602
instances	transient
the purpose of update is to attach a transient instances to a new session

14023612
post	get
but i would like to be sure if the server will get the post info even if the connection was lost window was closed or the user navigated away

14023649
stdout	stderr
you re catching stdout but you re not catching stderr standard error which i think is where that message is coming from

14023649
stdout	stderr
that will put anything from stderr into the same place as stdout

14023672
folder	directory
you should just create a directory structure like the following and drop this directory in the webapps folder of tomcat

14023672
ant	maven
note that it s a good idea to rely on ant gradle or maven to build your app but that eclipse in its enterprise edition supports java ee webapps and can create this structure for you and deploy the app directly from the ide

14023698
gif	png
if i replace with or it works for jpg png jpeg and gif but fails at else statement and does not run for all other file types so a docx would not be returned via file_extension_docx.png

14023698
gif	png
since if i keep it at it has no problem running img and returns thumbnails for all jpeg jpg files but not png and gif which are returned from assets as file_extension_png.png or file_extension_gif.png instead of being returned as image thumbnails via obj.php file

14023727
apache	nginx
i m going to use nginx alongside apache

14023755
post	get
the first is a post request that s fine but then there s a get request which isn t fine

14023889
valgrind	memcheck
i would suggest using valgrind with memcheck tool or any other profiling tool for memory leaks

14023889
free	malloc
malloc new free delete are intercepted

14023895
free	malloc
i very much doubt that anything beyond wrapping malloc and free or new and delete with another function can actually get you anything other than very rough estimates

14023913
post	get
i ve read some post about the mechanics and how to get less gc but i don t think it will help

14023965
getelementsbytagname	createtextnode
then you can use getelementsbytagname createelement createtextnode and appendchild

this works fine in my development environment localhost but when i pushed it up to production i get the following error when trying to post to the pages wall

14023975
jar	war
i have a web application that is packaged as a war file including several jar files

14023975
jar	war
i noticed that when i run mvn install - the only projects that are compiled are those who have changed - then it replaces these jar s in the war file

14023980
versioning	upgrade
i ve just bought the upgrade from versioning 10 to 12

14023995

hide	show
now the problem is i am trying to show or hide some of the options controls on the dialogs on certain conditions

14024112
post	get
no matter is it post or get

14024134
width	height
since the content can vary it has no fixed width or height

14024134
width	height
the div with the image itself as a background image has a specified width and height

14024134
width	height
once again i think the main problem i am having with standard solutions of using floats or absolute positioning is that every div is variable in height and width

14024134
width	height
so it doesn t really work at all without access to all those other files not to mention the mysql database that it obtains the image filename from and which it uses to determine the height and width of the image

14024189
cpython	pypy
if that isn t sufficient a lot of standard python code can be run on the pypy implementation which generally faster than the cpython implementation

14024199
disk	ram
if a program requires more memory that is available as ram the os will start swapping memory sections to disk as it sees fit

14024214

14024259
free	malloc
you can call malloc and free against an mspace

14024270
nexus	artifactory
you don t mention your environment but if it s java look at a maven repository like artifactory or nexus

14024272
client-side	server-side
if you want to reconnect the web page in other words make your browser send another request to server with window.location.reload or some other method standard play.libs.comet.ondisconnected handler is of no use to you - its domain is a server-side not a client-side

14024289
width	height
there is really just one technical problem with tables that i can think of if you have large content inside that cell the browser will wait for all content to load to be able to calculate the width and height of the cell before rendering.

14024340
move	drag
sounds like a bug the drag event is not called after the last move

14024396
lxml	suds
my biggest dissapointment was exe size i had a simple program which used lxml suds and it was 7-8mb big.

14024409
jar	war
the idea is to run mvn package as usual and after all the steps are done a jar utility should be called passing the filepath of the packaged code a jar or a war file as an argument

14024409
jar	war
java -jar utility.jar -filepath path of the new jar war file

14024413
ssl	https
this being said the rfc 6125 guidelines meant to be applicable to any protocol that uses ssl tls are more or less the same as those for https which are defined in rfc 2818 http over tls section 3.1

14024471

pull	push
you pull the generated page make any modification and addition you like including adding new pages and links between the pages then commit and push

14024634

14024665
youtube	vimeo
an iframe for embedding youtube or vimeo video replacing the correct width used in the iframe

14024669
lxml	elementtree

14024705
sudo	passwd
note that there s no passwd - and because the os takes care of the authentication there s no need for one the os ll ask for your sudo passwd though if required

14024739
setcontentview	findviewbyid
that s because if you put above your method that whole statement will then be global and findviewbyid will execute before setcontentview

14024739
oncreate	setcontentview
right after setcontentview in your activity s oncreate method

14024744
oncreate	setcontentview
in or in any method after your oncreate function or after you have called setcontentview basically

14024744
oncreate	setcontentview
if you move the statement outside the method then android tries to look for a view in a layout that is currently null as setcontentview is usually called in oncreate

14024747
setinterval	settimeout
i m not sure if this is a good way to do it but you can use either settimeout or setinterval to increment a variable count and then return that variable when dragging is finished

14024755
viewdidload	viewwillappear
calling this method from viewdidload viewwillappear does nothing for the first time but centers it correctly for the second time the view is loaded

14024755
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i am wondering if it is really not possible to set the region of the mapview in viewdidload viewwillappear so the user does not see a changing of the region

14024760
ada	pascal
i m also considering lots of other alternatives including java object pascal and ada

14024765

the tabbing order is correct where it will go through all the textboxes checkbox etc to the accept and cancel button at the end of the form then cycle back to the beginning of the form

14024875
stdout	stderr
i want to invoke a process from within a haskell program and capture stdout as well as stderr

14024875
stdout	stderr
the problem this way stdout and stderr are captured separately however i want the messages to appear in the right place otherwise i would simply stdout ++ stderr which separates error messages from their stdout counterparts

14024913
google-chrome	firefox
since this was only happening to some reports i compared reports and noticed the reports which i had a line break caused the glitch and for the report not to show in firefox or google-chrome only showing the header of the report

14024916
folder	directory
since the program is in the current directory which is not inside path by default you need to specify the folder you are running it from

mouseover	mouseleave
i want to check mouseover and mouseleave status and execute some function if the mouse is over element or is out

14024963

i get lots of errors as soon as i put in the line

14024976
firefox	safari
trying this on mobile safari and latest version of firefox

14024977
int	double
you could do something similar using a double and d d lf for the format string then multiply by the releveant multiplier to get your fractions into int form 1000 for milliseconds 1000000 for micro 100000000 for nanoseconds etc

14024995
nsstring	nsdata
then i use kiichi takeuchi s base64 library in objective c to compress the nsdata to nsstring

14025072
memcached	apc
for php add an opcode cacher apc memcached eaccelerator etc

14025083
move	drag
however when i click on the label in this case a number i can t get it to raise both drag and drop events for the label and the panel at the same time so nothing can be move

14025106

14025360
onresume	onpause
the solution your looking for is in the parent activity of the glsurfaceview you call glsurfaceview.onpause in the onpause method of the activity and glsurfaceview.onresume in the onresume method of the activity

14025370
portrait	landscape
also changes when the device switches between portrait and landscape

14025373
min	max
specifically the node-validator len or min and max methods should provide the logic you require

14025374
folder	directory
i like and i think that s the default setup layout for most distros to have conf.d and vhosts.d directory with active and available folder

14025399
sorting	grouping
you may discover that the sorting is the tip of an iceberg where several user grouping are getting by with a single report when they could use several custom built reports

i am running this on linux centos 6.3

14025477
pop-up	dialog
i use mostly second method and i used once last one when i implemented some modal pop-up dialog selection

x86	64bit
the problem is that types are erased during compilation and the machine code is almost typeless it does not contains anything else than 8 16 32 64bit integers and 32 64 80 bit floating point numbers in case of x86

14025521

14026462
serializable	deserialization
my guess however is that you might already have an object representation which you are that making into a string by calling text so there might be some unnecessary serializable deserialization going on here

14026468
google-chrome	firefox
you can use google-chrome firefox plugin called firebug

this is exactly the technique we use for phantomjs so that it works headlessly without x11 on linux while still leveraging fontconfig and thus also freetype for text rendering

14027437
innodb	myisam
innodb does not store the number of rows in a table but myisam does

14027448

according to the above malloc 0 seems to be related to accessing memory which has already been free but the content of which has not been changed

14027467
opera	google-chrome
on opera and google-chrome it alerts the greeting as i expected it to

14027467
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
evidently firefox treats the function inside the block scope as a functionexpression while opera and google-chrome treat it as a functiondeclaration

14027499
onkeyup	onkeydown
funnily enough onkeypress seems to return the character code instead of the keycode while onkeyup and onkeydown works as expected so there may be some issues when detecting keycode values

14027512
spaces	delimiter
to put spaces between arguments the comma delimiter is used

14027527
free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	malloc
from the quote it seems that there are implementations of malloc which use malloc 0 as some sort of switch to indicate that future calls to malloc allocate memory in a way that free and probably realloc p 0 won t change the content of the allocate memory when marking it as unused

14027552
mouse	keyboard

sum	floor
now for each bit b j that is set the floor function subtracts out b j sum 1 2 k k 1...j+1

14027759
sum	floor
b f n floor f n -sum b j sum 1 2 k k 1...j+1 for j 0...n-1

14027759
sum	floor
where remainder is sum 1 2 j j 1 ..n+1 and b j-1 0 but this sum is always 0 and 1 it is at most 1-1 2 n+2 and at least 1 2 n+1 so it can be moved out of the floor as -1

14027771
mouseleave	mouseenter
instead hover i would prefer mouseenter and mouseleave

14027818
keydown	keyup
the suggested workaround seems to be recording keydown and keyup events and then assuming the key is down if a keydown event has been recorded and no subsequent keyup

14027818
keydown	keyup
by the way if it matters i also need to be able to detect keyup and keydown events for other keys while all this is going on

instances	transient	persistent	transient
all non-transient instances variables that are not annotated with the transient annotation are persistent

14028263
accessor	properties
when property-based access is used the object relational mapping annotations for the entity class annotate the getter properties accessor 7 and the persistence provider runtime accesses persistent state via the properties accessor methods

14028263
persistent	transient
all properties not annotated with the transient annotation are persistent

14028283
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
to loops over an arrays you can use a simple for-loop

14028283
inherited	properties
this is necessary in situations where you cannot verify that the object does not have inherited properties

14028284
for-loop	arrays
i have created a dictionary and set the name key value data in dictionary and dictionary added in arrays using the for-loop to iterate the data

i try to reference a textview in my java file through findviewbyid int but this seems to return null even after calling setcontentview int with the correct layout file

14028664
addition	multiplication
you would then need to just do integer multiplication followed by constant addition to compensate for rounding errors and some sifting to get the base correct

14028664
integer	fractions
assuming q15.16 format 15 bits for integer 16 bits for the fractions parts you could perform the multiplication like this

14028664
multiplying	addition	multiplying	multiplication	addition	multiplication
with your assumed cpu two loads double precision multiplying addition by constant already in register if you perform many multiplication at once and shift

14028676

14028965
int	double
ret int oneee double two 10

14028965
multiplying	multiplication
multiplying first is probably simpler than using floating point if you only want an integer result and if you know that the multiplication will never overflow

14028966
google-chrome	firefox
works in latest firefox google-chrome and ie down to ie8

14028967
multiplying	multiplication
so if you will multiplying two integers the compiler will use integer multiplication but if you multiplying a float and an integer the compiler will use float multiplication

the most straight forward way to keep the search form uri seo optimized is albeit not like you outline in the first step to switch from the get method to the post method

14034261

14035474
division	modulo
other answers pointed out the most important mistake - you swapped the modulo and the division

at this stage there were two choices upgrade the app to a more recent grails versioning or downgrade the http-builder library to one that includes the json classes explicitly

14037530

i have two tables one table a that is the parent and other table b that is the children 1 n relationship

14037783
children	parent
if i want to delete the children records in the table b when i delete the parent in the table a if i don t use cascade on delete in the data base i would do it in the following way

14037783
children	parent
user a load the parent record in her context then load all the children records in the context mark all as deleted

14037783
children	parent
if the database does not allow to use the id the second user will get an exception when try to add a new children for reference integrity because the parent does not exists

14037783

whether you get landscape or portrait depends on which one you choose in the print settings when you actually print it

css2 sprites are difficult to apply because you are limited to using sprites for non-repeating patterns that has specify width height

14043198
width	height
for isntance i would use a css sprite for an image rollover with a fixed width height and then simply call background-position 0 -10px

14043240
put	get
the third approach in case your only problem is that you get duplicates in the php generated values is to put them in array and then check if the values is new

14043324
portrait	landscape
so in both portrait and landscape the right 30 or so of the screen is just white only on iphone and maybe other small screens as if the width were less than 100

14043464
uiview	calayer
if you do not want to go low-level you could add your image to a uiview as a background color and use the cliptobounds calayer property to make the clipping

14043485
filesystems	ntfs
that said if you had a transactionscope that managed a transaction with sql server as well as say a transactional filesystems such as ntfs the name wouldn t have any meaning to ntfs

google-chrome	firefox
with other browsers the message appear above the accordion i tested it in firefox 17 but with google-chrome half of the message is hidden because of the accordion

14043704
haskell	ocaml
you could of course given the right bindings to the c kernel code write the entire linux utilities suite in lisp haskell ocaml or any other language that has sufficient capabilities most of it is about string handling which the vast majority of languages can do

14043732
google-chrome	firefox
however my parents are too stubborn to switch from ie9 to either google-chrome or firefox so i downloaded ie7pro and installed the script there

14043745
fink	macports
it seems it must be compiled with libstdc++ which would require me to install fink or macports so i could install the latest version of gcc and libstdc++

14043749
width	height
you can set width and height in px and put your image in drawable-nodpi folder to perform no scaling

14043749
width	height
also you can use createbitmap bitmap source int x int y int width int height method to get a part of image that you want

14043799

so when i try to get an image from my web-content folder so i can put it into my excel y get file not found

14043832
apache	nginx
i want to know how to convert this apache htaccess to nginx

14043843

14043890
testng	jmockit
i have testng test case that uses jmockit to mock

14043894
portrait	landscape
my app was in landscape only and when turning off the screen the android screensaver took control it was in portrait mode thus sending an orientationchange that destroys and recreates the activity

14043956
bazaar	git
i ve tried git bazaar and few others i forget and found bazaar has one very very weak point

14044012
factors	matrix
a little warning if the quad transformation matrix is generated by any 3d engine it could contain scaling factors that will mess the normal vector up

14044098
getter	setter
there was issue in setter and getter of action class

14044124
int	double
the 16 digit number is changed to a double by vbscript because neither int nor long can store that number

14044164
puts	gets
i am doing an application on android that gets locations from a webservice and puts it on a map

14044248
google-chrome	firefox
problem is i need to wait until it s loaded to execute the rest of the script which requires event handlers that ie and firefox google-chrome handle differently

14044265
post	put
by the way - the method should be put not post as a param for your form helper

14044384
getter	setter
use a protected setter method instead or data member instead of the non const getter method

14044397
pull	push
this should be possible with source order 2-1-3 and then using push pull to move columns into place

14044421
bash	zsh
bash and zsh though sharing many of the same features have different incompatible syntaxes

14044427

for a 4-byte integer that would be i for signed numbers or i for unsigned numbers

14044493
pull	push
it s a push not a pull

14044500
bash	subshell

profiling	debugging
i tried to unset and re-set the developer team provisioning profiling in the debugging code signing section of the build settings but this didn t solve the issue

14044834
nexus	artifactory
my strongest recommendation is to use a repository manager either nexus or artifactory

14044858
union	distinct
i combine the subqueries using union all and then only do the distinct once on the outer level

14044889
width	height
on your imageview you have the width and height set to

14044889
width	height
you will need to wrap your imageview somehow to make it display properly but give the imageview width height values like

14044911
union	distinct
just union together your selects and put that in an in-line view and put your distinct and order by on the outside

14044911
union	distinct
i used union all since you are going to do a distinct once on the outside anyway

14044920
google-chrome	firefox
i have used a simple script to get a response from a php page but the response header is empty in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

14044922
inherited	subclassing
interface a at the top of the hierarchy should be inherited virtually by all immediate subclassing

14044980
post	get
lines 5-7 some more variables to get the post id data-post to the name of the person who commented comnam and to get the actual comment combody

14045033
google-chrome	firefox
last builds of google-chrome and firefox are supporting this feature

14045078
hash	hmac
assuming a strong key and a good hash function no information about the key should be leaked by an hmac even if the plaintext is known

14045080
disk	ram
using infinispan you could just work with your huge map and have parts of it the ones not recently accessed stored to disk to save ram

14045100
many-to-many	one-to-many
to me this looks like a classical one-to-many or many-to-many association between two tables

14045119
short	base
in short the base application is able to instantly consume plugins that have been altered

14045125
carrierwave	paperclip

14045279
width	height
and have not set a width and height for it the div adjust it s sizes to the sizes of the content

14045279

in your case 0px width and 0px height

14045280
google-chrome	firefox
but ie javascript and javascript for google-chrome firefox etc

14045293

neither if i put code fore saving it in loan in this case i get error saying nullable object must have a value.

14045327
getattr	setattr
this can be done with a combination of getattr and setattr

14045343
highcharts	highstock
also there are commercial products like highcharts highstock but i prefer open source solutions

14045354
getter	setter
my second guess is that i should be avoiding getter and setter and using bundles

14045389
xstream	jibx
you could just as easily use castor xmlbeans jibx and xstream or implement your own marshaller unmarshaller to use spring s oxm faculties

14045401
overwrite	preserve
although it s possible that the secure cookie isn t overwrite by the http request and when the moderator switches back to https the old session cookie is preserve

14045424

under ddms i seleced my device and adb also found it

14045439
apache	nginx	passenger	unicorn
i have a vps and recently moved my server setup from apache passenger to nginx unicorn and added a staging server

14045442
hide	show
if you need to show multiple windows then you can use multiple jdialog and use dispose to hide the dialog

14045446
oncreate	setcontentview
what i can see in your code though is that you are expected to call setcontentview in oncreate not in the constructor

14045492
super	implements	super	self	hide	show
you can use tableview willdisplaycell and tableview heightforrowatindexpath with the cell identifier to show hide static tableview cells but yo must implements heightforrowatindexpath referring to super not to self

14045500
addclass	removeclass
note i ve also tried addclass and removeclass methods

14045619
icmp	udp
this is shown by having one thread send a udp packet with ttl 2 every 5 seconds however no icmp packet was returned

14045619
icmp	udp
my second approach was to put the udp and icmp on the same socket

14045619
icmp	udp
wireshark shows the udp going out as expected with no issues with the creation of the packet checksum etc and also shows the icmp time exceeded packets being returned however again i can t see any icmp traffic coming on my socket apart from again when i test that icmp is working with a simple ping

14045632
put	get
at this point caching should happen automatically every time you put and get using a persistencemanager

14045642

i downloaded the latest gdata module from google and installed it using this line in terminal while in the directory into which i downloaded the gdata folder downloads

14045743
post	put
i can just use the shortcode they provide to reference a specific post page id which accomplishes the goal of only having to put it in once and it being rendered at multiple pages as long as the shortcode is there and properly formatted

14045769
width	height
give a minimum height and width so you can see your image

14045787

i m completely new to opensuse linux and don t have any experience configuring network settings

14045814
post	get
selbie i would post the server code but i think that might get me in trouble with my work

14045814
ready	each
i basically build the sockets for three ports set each of these sockets to listen add them to an fd_set and then loop infinitely making the select call to see if any port is ready to be read from and then looping through all the file descriptors in the returned fd set to see whether a new connection needs to be accepted in which case a new socket for communication is generated and added to the file descriptor set or otherwise to recv the bytes pending on already accepted sockets file descriptors

14045891
put	get
a quick fix would be to put the vars you need in the global scope or get them from response if they are in there

14045893
google-chrome	firefox
you must download util.js too and run downloadurl.html on a webserver util.js loads the xml using xmlhttprequest which doesn t work in google-chrome firefox on local filesystem

14045919
folder	directory
should my dal be in its own solution sitting on equal directory footing with the other solutions that use it or should it just be a free-floating project that sits outside of a solution folder

sorting	filtering
for sorting and filtering i use

14046171
bash	subshell	post	get
since everybody is giving his own personal answer here s my own brew 100 pure bash probably a good candidate for a code-golf and also probably one of the most efficient â no loop no pipe only one subshell see end of post to get rid of it

14046194
cos	sin	cos	sqrt	sin	sqrt
the function phi is not orthogonal to its translates it must change for a function phi # which we only know the fourier transform defined by phi_hat # sqrt 3 2 pi -1 2 4 sin 2 z 2 z 2 1 + 2 cos 2 z 2

however this returns 0 conversations if i put true i get the same result and i have checked db and made sure that there are values with both true and false

14046294

the service uses get we probably should change to post but originally we were told the max url would be 50 characters and i m curious as to what the problem is...just for my own piece of mind

14046352
actionscript	mxml
the actionscript editor doesn t seem to recognise the objects defined in mxml

14046352
actionscript	mxml
i must admit that highlighting of actionscript files which do not contain classes but instead included in mxml as is probably the only weak part of intellij idea code highlighting

14046362
getter	setter
note you need to provide getter and setter for correct work of tableview

14046377
folder	directory
given that the directory structure is well defined and file ordering is semantic img_resources folder will contain images only you should permit access to such resources or even bypass filters altogether to avoid the overhead of passing through the filter chain

14046420
boost	eigen
the code uses boost for the univariate normal and eigen for matrix handling

14046425

14046425
google-chrome	firefox
testing with google-chrome version 23 firefox version 11 linux and firefox version 16 windows and ie9

14046446

for-loop	arrays
i am trying to find duplicated values string in an arrays using for-loop

14046624
for-loop	arrays
note i need to try this only with for-loop - i know how to do it using arrays functions

14046635
for-loop	loops
you are confused about how a python for-loop works - it loops over objects not indices so you are getting the tuples and trying to use them to index the list

14046638
margin	height	width	margin	width	height
i could just give it a margin top left to center it but the .element container is of variable height and width

14046670
children	parent
the does not insert any physical uicomponent instance in the component tree instead it inserts all the content as children of its parent

14046670
children	parent
composite components use implicitly because it basically introduces a namingcontainer component which allows reusing the same composite component multiple times in a parent without the risk to end up with duplicate component id errors caused by the composite s children

14046676

how do i attach the ssl certificate for https protocol from the code-behind instead of attaching it through the hosting interface or on the iis itself the main problem is that i want a different ssl certificate for every site instead grouping them on one certificate which allows maximum of 5 domains and will still say they are the same entity

if you need your grouping chars like then you ll have to use grep sed awk etc as ksh regexps don t support grouping i m almost sure

14046967

14047218
inotifypropertychanged	icommand
this is a class dependencyobject which implements inotifypropertychanged that holds a icommand property as well as the row that will be displayed in the various rows in the listbox

actionscript	mxml
i suppose the main reason behind this construct is that you wish to separate mxml from actionscript code or in more abstract terms separate the view from the logic

14047924

you create a so-called host component class in plain actionscript which contains all of the behavioural code and a skin class in mxml which defines the visual representation of the component

14048964
versioning	upgrade
so i guess the problem wasn t the code or compiler the problem was that the ide 1.0.1 was expecting an older versioning of the avr-gcc and used a deprecated flag for compiling and simply failed since that flag is no longer available on the new compiler so you either have to downgrade the compiler or upgrade the ide and from my perspective upgrading is always the right choice to make

14049220
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox i use firebug and google-chrome has a built-in console

14049220

personally i suggest learning and working within firefox or google-chrome and then checking in ie and other browsers that it works

14049224
gridview	datalist
i have a aspx page where i have a gridview and inside this gridview i added a datalist so for each row i want to have a datalist basically the row contains an image and in the datalist i want to display certain details about the picture for example a pic of a truck and in the datalist i want to display the price year etc.

gridview	datalist
at this point i m display the image in the gridview but the datalist is showing all the rows that are in the table on every row of the grid what i want to to is only display the data that describes the image of the current row

14049224
sqldatasource	datalist
in the selectcommand for the sqldatasource that fills the datalist i m trying to pass where id id parameter and get it from the codebehind page so i can manipulate the data and only display the data that corresponds to the image and not all the data in each row over and over

14049232
uilabel	uitextview
if you want to implement it yourself your best bet is to use a uitextview instead of a uilabel

14049274
post	get
if you still can t get it done on these specific things you could post your respective code snippets where these errors occur

14049336

14049480
inherited	properties
a scope prototypically inherited properties from its parent scope

14049482
ng-switch	ng-include
ng-repeat ng-switch and ng-include can trip you up if you try to bind to a primitive number string boolean in the parent scope from inside the child scope

14049482
ng-switch	ng-view	ng-switch	ng-include	ng-view	ng-include
new angularjs developers often do not realize that ng-repeat ng-switch ng-view ng-include and ng-if all create new child scopes so the problem often shows up when these directives are involved

14049482
inherited	properties
if we try to access a properties defined on the parentscope from the child scope javascript will first look in the child scope not find the properties then look in the inherited scope and find the properties

14049482
ng-switch	ng-controller	ng-switch	ng-include	ng-include	ng-controller
the following create new scopes and inherit prototypically ng-repeat ng-include ng-switch ng-controller directive with scope true directive with transclude true

14049482
inherited	properties
because tpl2.html binds the model to an object properties prototypal inherited kicks in when the ngmodel looks for object myobject -- it finds it in the parent scope

14049482
ng-switch	ng-include
ng-switch scope inheritance works just like ng-include

14049482
inherited	properties
for each item iteration ng-repeat creates a new scope which prototypically inherited from the parent scope but it also assigns the item s value to a new properties on the new child scope

14049482
ng-switch	ng-controller	ng-switch	ng-include	ng-include	ng-controller
nesting controllers using ng-controller results in normal prototypal inheritance just like ng-include and ng-switch so the same techniques apply

14049482
ng-switch	ng-include	inherited	properties
since we have normal prototypal inherited this is like ng-include and ng-switch so be wary of 2-way data binding to parent scope primitives and child scope hiding shadowing of parent scope properties

14049482
ng-switch	ng-controller	ng-switch	ng-include	ng-include	ng-controller
normal prototypal scope inheritance -- ng-include ng-switch ng-controller directive with scope true

14050347

14058482
min	max
for example you could just apply the max min on your section element if you don t need the header to have those rules applied as well

14058493
min	max
the only way to fix it if you re intent on keeping the max and min width properties on the body is by absolutely positioning the footer - not ideal

14058493
min	max
i would suggest you remove the max and min properties and try a different approach altogether

yes you should use g++ to compile c++ instead of gcc but it s probably worth elaborating on the answer since you say you re new to using compilers

sorting	grouping
first and foremost - sorting and grouping should happen in the back-end whenever possible and in this situation it is

14062790
factors	mean
more complex approaches are also possible such as setting the length tolerance based on a factors of the mean edge length for all edges in the triangulation - this would scale the tolerance with the average distribution of the herd

14062794
scrollable	panels
the jvcl has some scrollable panels as well

14062795

on disk i have image with incorrect proportions and height width

14063556
width	height
but for example for stars or callout shapes real size doesn t equal to the shape height width properties

if you look down to the two functions what i want is for if the cur value is not between the min and max for it to change the target variable to 0 so i can use it latter in the program.

14063697
required	placeholder
the method should for you populate placeholder taking care of quotation when required characters encoding etc

14063704
google-chrome	safari

i saw some previous post and explantations on the internet of glorthof but i just don t get it

14064202

14064205
toupper	uppercase	tolower	uppercase	tolower	toupper
i m not a vb.net programmer but according to microsoft you can get the lowercase uppercase value of the text using the string methods toupper or tolower

width	margin
because you have margin which makes the total width more than 100

14069030
post	put
if not then it would be helpful if you post the code you have put inside the div too because you don t have any other mistake in your code and so the problem must be within the div

14069091

and can i disable mailcomposeviewcontroller orientation of landscape because my app only support portrait

14069391
jwindow	jdialog
use transucent jdialog jwindow

width	height
atan2 takes y as first argument so atan2 height width would compute the angle

14069399
width	height
for horizontal or vertical lines width or height and therefore one scaling factor is zero this causes the straight lines without arrowhead

14069465
getter	setter

14069667
ant	maven
first of all i have never used proguard from maven only from ant

14069690
qthread	qobject
of course you cannot run it in main thread of your application as it does not use qt so right starting a qthread moving your qobject to this thread or create these objects in run method and running exec in thread s run method is a correct solution

14069713
tunnel	vpn
the only thing you can do is open a vpn tunnel to your vpn network where the wcf service is hosted for example with cisco vpn client or shrew vpn

14069713
tunnel	vpn	udp	tcp
then you can access your wcf service within the vpn network everything will be sent over the vpn tunnel doesn t matter if http https in the end it s tcp udp

14069735
nsstring	nsobject
it already maps exactly onto an nsdictionary where the first value would be an integer or number second a float or number third an nsstring and 4th would be an nsarray which hold three values which happens to be integers in my example but could be anything at all as long as it s derived from nsobject

14069739
udp	tcp
after they have connected they will receive a sessionkey that they can use the encrypt tcp udp packets send to a secondary server

14069739

prepare	execute
2 â execute this command to prepare magento for upgrade

14069756
versioning	upgrade
this step is necessary even if you upgrade your magento store to 1.5 or 1.6 versioning

14069756
versioning	upgrade
before proceeding with this part of magento upgrade it is very important to see to what versioning magento upgrade scripts will upgrade your store

14069756
versioning	upgrade
it means that your magento will be upgrade to versioning 1.6.0.0

14069756
versioning	upgrade
if it is not what you need you can change upgrade channel to â œstableâ and upgrade your magento to versioning 1.5.1.0

14069771
int	chars
that are int constants enumeration constants chars constants sizeof

14069794

i had to make a datatable with pagination sorting and filtering

14069850
int	chars
something similar to string chars c int count but instead for list of strings

14069866
salt	md5
you could be signing a request using a secret salt +hashing algo of choise md5 will do fine because this way an eavesdropper cannot obtain the api key and forge his own requests

14069939
mojolicious	catalyst
cgi.pm is the granddaddy of them all and works well for smaller projects but i d recommend looking into a proper web application framework such as dancer mojolicious or catalyst there are many others but those are the big three if you re planning to build anything with more than a handful of relatively simple pages and forms

14069962
implements	extends
public class mainactivity extends expandablelistactivity implements

14070013
client-side	server-side

14070027
width	height
i have created a uiscrollview with 5 images and set its width height and size change according to orientation

14070047
pygtk	pygobject
you can use pygobject instead of pygtk and then setting a placeholder is a piece of cake

14070056
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome 23 safari 6 on osx 10.7.5 the font in the other containers gets slightly dimmed during the .rotate-divs transition

14070075
for-loop	loops
but anyway the problem with visual c++ 10.0 the compiler shipped with visual studio 2010 is that it defaults to it can be configured to pre-standard behavior where the scope of a variable declared in a for-loop extended out the block loops was placed in

14070081
setinterval	settimeout
you could try writing an anonymous self-calling function using settimeout instead of setinterval

14070113

onclick	preventdefault
you don t need to leave out the href attribute if you use the preventdefault and stoppropagation javascript functions in the onclick handler

14070196
nsmanagedobjectcontext	nsmanagedobjectmodel
looks like bug appears if you are use new uidocument method instead of old core data template with manual set up of nsmanagedobjectcontext nspersistentstorecoordinator and nsmanagedobjectmodel

14070266
submit	submission
like apple microsoft doesn t charge for distributing free apps you can submit 100 for free and after that it costs 19.99 per submission and they take 30 of the revenue for paid apps

14070269
getter	setter
here you need to refer directly to the super class setter getter

14070269
getter	setter
however if the setter will compile without any problem the getter won t because the compiler will view it as super.name.apply strings can get this method through implicit conversions

14070269
accessor	superclass
change the variable name make it private and write accessor in the superclass see below

14070302
pdfsharp	migradoc
you can use pdfsharp migradoc to edit pdf-files

14070317
lxml	elementtree	pyquery	elementtree	pyquery	lxml
pyquery wraps lxml so you use the elementtree to access attributes

14070400
dbcontext	objectcontext
as for entity framework the objectcontext dbcontext holds the configuration model and acts as the unit of work holding references to all of the known entity instances

14070420
width	height
in a dataview i change on painted -event the width and height of some dom-elements

14070449
implements	extends
thus implements a multi-thread should be made by extends service class directly

14070465
getter	setter
the most surprising is the list is populated there are 4 elements and the following code runs well so the information is in the database setter and getter work

14070467
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
where as any class which extends runtimeexception will be unchecked-exception class

14070469
listview	gridview
this time i want to bind a listview to the selecteditem of a gridview

14070469
listview	gridview
i already suceed with this type of data-binding but now my listview which should show some details about my selected item in my gridview just stays empty

14070493
portrait	landscape
all view controllers in my app are working only in portrait orientation except one which can be portrait or landscape oriented

14070493
portrait	landscape
user change orientation from portrait to landscape

14070493
portrait	landscape
after these actions application remains in landscape orientation and does not change it automatically to portrait

14070515
tinyint	varchar
first of all i highly recommend restructure normalize your table for the rec_type field instead of being varchar to be four tinyint fields as follows

14070530
haskell	ocaml
to me this is far more elegant than any of the solutions written in languages like ocaml haskell and scala but of course it is not type safe

14070532
pop-up	dialog
i have created a modal dialog pop-up in jquery javascript in a visual web part which shows every time the page loads

14070532
pop-up	dialog
now the client requirement is to show the modal dialog pop-up at the start of the month and not show the modal dialog pop-up for that month if the username already exists in the custom list

14070696
sorting	grouping
i want to refresh my datagrid but after refreshing my sorting within the grouping are not correct anymore.

put	get
i am supposed to get the values from the form to put them in a database

14070755
google-chrome	firefox
can i force ie and google-chrome to behave like firefox because in fact this is the behaviour i m looking for

14070784
folder	directory
the custom target dist first sets up the desired structure of the archive in a temporary directory inside the build folder by invoking cmake in command mode with multiple copy_directory commands

14070807
rbac	acl
zend permissions rbac role based acl

14070815
pull	push
as far as i know there s no way to push just the part of the tree where i made my changes so when others make a change to unrelated files in an unrelated part of the tree and i have a changeset that needs to be pushed i have to pull merge and then commit where i supply a message describing their changes changes that have already in theory been described by their commit message s

14070831
disk	ram
when mnesia cannot load the schema from disk at startup it creates an empty one for itself in ram or refuses to start depending on settings

14070872
folder	directory
when you specify an underscore in a folder name that will be treated like a directory seperator so when you specify my_custom it is seaching it this way my custom thats why its unable to find it

14070891
width	height
i need a algorith which calculate the squares width height is same with width

14070897
public	protected
r is either protected or package private that is neither public nor protected nor private and is declared by a class in the same runtime package as d

14070911
google-chrome	firefox
all versions from firefox and google-chrome support it and ie added support in ie10

14071007
int	chars
according to how you use the function i would suggest to replace chars with unsigned int for the return type of countbits in bitman.h

14071007
free	malloc
third side note you don t free your malloc

14071015
ssms	ssdt
i m attempting to make my existing sql server 2008 database compatible with the windows azure platform by using ssdt however i am getting a whole bunch of errors when i build the project due to tvfs and views looking for an external database that sits in the same instance in ssms

14071068
mp3	wav
why can t it be mp3 and wav

14071151
mp3	ogg
mp3 and especially ogg are easy to stream and can contain video audio text

14071176
screens	tablet
when it comes to the tablet try separating some of your activities into fragments and lay them side by side on the bigger screens

14071177
mouse	keyboard
however since the only thing you are doing in your while block is processing gui messages i think your best bet is using amnonblocking mode which will wait for the query to finish thus avoiding the while block but doesn t block the gui it does ignore keyboard and mouse events thought.

14071186
portrait	landscape
otherwise it will go into the portrait mode but then you can t do anything about that because it doesn t support the landscape orientation in the first place

14071213
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome and safari it works well

14071269
post	get
i have read in older post to use http-fox to get all parameters

14071283
maven-invoker-plugin	pom.xml
the pom.xml is part of maven-invoker-plugin configuration

14071330
post	get
however when i make a post the username and user_id values don t get set

14071337

the function receives three arguments the jqxhr in jquery 1.4.x xmlhttprequest object a string describing the type of error that occurred and an optional exception object if one occurred

14071339
put	get
i was experimenting some stuff and noticed that i don t need to put enddraw at all to the bitmaprendertarget in order for it to get the bitmaps needed

14071361
integer	unsigned
i have a uint8 unsigned 8 bit integer coming in from a udp packet

14071402
versioning	upgrade
most likely each upgrade will remain very similar to the previous one but there might be some small changes made to support a new library versioning

14071408
unsigned	short
you could simply parse it into a short or an int which have enough range to hold all the values of an unsigned byte

14071418
folder	directory
have this directory checked out on your build machine and whenever the common project builds it copies the output dll into the dll folder and commits these changes to source control

14071418
folder	directory
an alternative is to version the common dll from the source control revision when it is built and place each version in its own sub directory under the common dll folder

14071459
teamcity	myget
you could host your own nuget feed or use the nuget capabilities of teamcity or a private myget feed

14071466
client-side	server-side
i can obviously add the time difference in seconds as an additional field time_diff 30 or calculate the differences in python client-side but i d like to know if it s possible server-side

14071534
hide	show
i need that when i hover on top item 3 to show its sub menu and hide the active sub-menu

14071547
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
2. google-chrome and safari then made a second request to the web service now that they have the authorization details of the service.whereas firefox and ie did not prefer to make a second ajax request to the service since there was an http 500 error for the pre-flight request

14071547
google-chrome	safari
hence both google-chrome and safari were able to communicate with the service

14071560
put	get
in the last example if you put in input the string ...centotrentatremilione... with the wrong singular milione instead of milioni you get

14071609
profiling	debugging
debugging command and then when the profiling shows you cannot

14071647
qapplication	qframe
i could connect qapplication focuschanged old now and check each new object if it is a child of my qframe but this gets messy

14071722
width	height
the inline width and the height of the canvas define resolution - setting a css style of width defines scale

14071722
width	height
because width and height of elements isn t defined when you export i m struggling to come up with a good way to scale up

14071722
width	height
use css to set the max-width and max-height to be 1024x768 or whatever your original is and then set the regular width and height to be whatever you need proportionately

14071733
post	get
note that to work with serialized arrays you need to use post as the form s transmission method as get has a size limit somewhere around 1024 characters

14071776
carrierwave	minimagick
i am trying to implement image-upload with carrierwave and minimagick

14071776
carrierwave	minimagick
i was able to upload an image with carrierwave but when i implemented minimagick to resize uploaded images it returned this error

14071850
portrait	landscape
some layouts work well in both landscape and portrait orientations but most of them can benefit from adjustments

14071867
put	get
the only way to get it to work reliably is to put your tracing code into another file and compile this file without -finstrument-functions

14071874
getter	setter
note there will never be a case where there is code in the getter setter

14071874
getter	setter
these are simply placeholders for internally-calculated metrics and performance is critical even to the millisecond-level which has me thinking the first is better as it bypasses the getter setter completely

14071896
qtreeview	qabstractitemmodel
what you are looking for is the qtreeview widget which accepts a qabstractitemmodel as its data structure

14071896
qtreeview	qfilesystemmodel
use the setmodel function of qtreeview and pass it your qfilesystemmodel

14071904
getter	setter
the difference is that if at a later point you need to add some logic to the getter setter methods the calling code won t break

14071959
width	height
i have sprite moving around screen but is limited to screen width height this sprite never goes above about 460px goes below the bottom

14071963
getter	setter
i use getter and setter for protected members unless it s read-only in which case a protected readonly will do just fine

14071967
google-chrome	firefox
it also comes with a matrix construction set as of feb 2013 it doesn t work in google-chrome but works in firefox

14071987
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
the java code uses standard objectoutputstream objectinputstream to perform binary serialization but annoyingly performs some readresolve writeresolve work at the base class level resource to customize the serialization process if a resource is named it doesn t serialize it and simply returns a proxy with a name that is used later to fetch the resource out of a hashmap

14071994
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
internet explorer 9 firefox opera google-chrome and safari support the element

14071994
width	height
note always specify an id attribute to be referred to in a script and a width and height attribute to define the size of the canvas

14071997
width	height
what you re looking for is the greatest common factor between the width and the height of the display

14072031
put	get
and if the xml file happens to put all its elements on one line with no whitespace common for machine-generated and -processed xml you will get fewer matches than you expect

14072057
width	height
i had to set the width and height of the div to be the same as the image size within it

14072060
put	get	post	get	post	put
i have tried method types put get post and delete but got the same error

14072071
vbscript	vba
vbscript error trapping does not work the same as excel vba

14072075
width	height
if you use setpreferredsize on a component it fixes both width and height

14072075
width	height
therefore this is no good if i only want a fixed width and to adapt the height as necessary to accommodate the contents into that constrained width

14072075
width	height
in a browser window the string will automatically wrap and the height it requires adapt so that it fits within the available width

14072075
width	height
so if we were to fix the width of the browser the height of the text would remain fluid

14072075
width	height
note that i believed setmaximumsize would do what i wanted - allow me to set a maximum width and set the height to something huge so that it could never go wider than i specify but had plenty of height to grow into

14072075
width	height
i consider having to scroll the large panel sideways to see all of an item to be a bad ui so i want the width to be no wider than the scroll pane s actual displayable area sans scroll bars and thus have the smaller panels adjust their height in order to fit their content - jlabels with html strings - into the available width

14072095
keystore	jks
i m trying to read back an ecprivatekey including certificate chain from a jks keystore as shown in the code below

14072095
keystore	jks
apparently the jks keystore implementation doesn t loop through the list of security providers

14072098
inherited	subclassing
since these subclassing will call they will inherited the code in the base view controller s viewdidload method which should contain your appearance code

14072139
hide	show
i have a toggle javascript in my code which show and hide two different divs when clicking on links in the html code

14072142
background-image	background-color
something like background-image or background-color applied to text

14072206
serializable	deserialization
as an aside i have been doing some reading and i realize that there may be more optimized ways to do deep copies of object through serializable deserialization but i m still interested in this question even if i choose to clone objects using a different approach

14072221

14072415
installation	upgrade
either you stay at egit 2.1 or you upgrade your eclipse installation to juno which can be done without reinstallation

14072434
maven	pom.xml
per maven documentation maven will only look in local and remote repos for a parent pom.xml after it fails to find it locally

14072511
spaces	delimiter

14075743

i m not sure of the exact reason why this works but i believe the shapes are only rendered once control passes out of your code and only once they are rendered do the actualwidth and actualheight properties have a useful value

14077210
actualheight	actualwidth
the transformtovisual method behaves in much the same way as the actualwidth and actualheight properties

put	get
actually the extra code i just added should be put in a method on the foo object to get the data as this clutters up the controller with code that should be model code

width	height
but if the text field wraps the height is going to depend on the width make it narrower and the text field will wrap to more lines so it will consume more height

14078745
width	height
so in order to measure the preferred height for a wrapping text field you have to tell it the width to wrap at

14078745
width	height
for example if you want to compute the height based on a width of 100 you would call

14078745

where you initialize a uitapgesturerecognizer and set its action to labelbutton but because you do not specify a parameter and the method labelbutton is asking for an id argument a tap gesture recognizer is getting passed into the labelbutton method instead of a uibutton which is why it crashes because uitapgesturerecognizer is not able to respond to tag it is not a ui object

14079837
free	malloc
in addition to the other replies you could consider using boehm s conservative garbage collector then you would use gc_malloc instead of malloc and you won t do any free even if when absolutely certain that a memory zone becomes useless and unreachable you could explicitly gc_free it

14079837
free	malloc
so the malloc implementation tries to avoid doing a lot of mmap and munmap syscalls so usually manages the free -d memory zones differently by organizing them so they could be reused by a further malloc without doing any mmap syscall

i have some experience with backbone.js very little with ember.js and a bit more with angular.js

14081950
ember.js	backbone.js

14083240
apache	nginx
if apache and nginx are too heavyweight for you although nginx is pretty much characterized by how lightweight it is for heavy loads and especially if the load you expect is very light then look around for other options

14083282
background-image	background-size
i set a background-image for each parent li then i set an high value for the height of the background-size because the sub-menu has some entries on 2 lines and a high value for the height compensate that

14083286
folder	directory
after unzip the folder i went to tomcat7.0 conf directory and edit the tomcat-users.xml to

14083301
apache	nginx
i sort of doubt that an embedded system that can run centos okay is so resource-starved that it can t run nginx comfortably or even apache which people run on the raspberry pi just fine with appropriate configuration tweaks given reasonable assumptions about how many pages you are actually serving

14083313

it takes a couple of seconds to load on mobile safari vs less than 1 second on desktop google-chrome but this might be due to the fact that it spends time downloading the sound fonts

14083461
g++	gcc
if you want to -static you need to wrap it around libraries that you want to be static and let the other libraries remain dynamic otherwise gcc g++ will try and go down into every library and compile everything statically which may not be possible

14083499
jar	manifest.mf
if you manually add the jars to your jar file then you need to make sure your jar file has a manifest.mf file in it and specify the main class and classpath inside of that

14084251
slideup	slidedown
i m experiencing some problems with jquery s slideup and slidedown functions

14084263
calloc	malloc	realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc
the libc allocators malloc calloc realloc and the c++ allocators new delete are probably using an optimization trick involving not releasing memory back to the os

14084263

14084573
valgrind	memcheck

mouseup	mousedown
so the question is how do i make use of the mousedown and mouseup events from jquery

14084688
portrait	landscape
from my experience if your application is designed to work in both portrait and landscape orientation you need to declare the variable cam as static

14084696
portrait	landscape
you can make the landscape and portrait nib to support your different ui due to orientation

14084719
children	parent
maybe you are looking for something like this it is a double-linked parent knows children and children know parent binary tree

14084725

in other words you want to call mmap once to allocate a large chunk of memory and then use your own user-defined malloc and free calls to manage the memory pool

14084837
put	get
what i don t get is i have the password variable to validate too but it just does not make sense to me to put it under the validation of the username like

14084841
comparator	comparable
what i would do here is make the searchlistinformationclass implement the comparable not comparator interface see the link for more information

14084868
inherited	properties
if you don t want to iterate over inherited properties use hasownproperty

14084885
mouseup	mousedown
yes you can catch both mousedown and mouseup events but you need to use ajax calls to send the information to the server so that you don t do a postback that reloads the page

14084885
mouseup	mousedown
also you don t automatically get a mouseup event that corresponds to each mousedown event

14084939

uiview	calayer
single uiview this approach would require you to create a calayer for each shape and then do your own hit-testing and finger-dragging when the shape is moved

14085136
move	drag
this will perform extremely poorly especially when you are move the shapes during a drag and as you indicate is very complicated to implement well

14086218
pow	sqrt
r is the distance between the two objects sqrt pow x2 - x1 2 + pow y2 - y1 2

14086218

14086549
int	chars
so to convert a number chars into a c language int code like c - 0 is often used

14086555
client-side	server-side
therefore this is likely a client-side problem not a server-side problem

14086556
int	chars
since the numbers are taken as chars from a string it needs to be converted to int if you ll check the ascii table you ll see that 0 is 48 so when you take the chars 4 which is 52 and calculate 4 - 0 you get 52-48 which is 4 as requested

14087263
mp4	webm
ff doesn t support the mp4 file type so you ll need to encode an ogv or a webm

14087304
int	chars
which is natural in the general case since if i now try to write a large int to it might not fit - only has memory allocated for a chars tell me if i m wrong here

14087304
int	chars
i could of course write a simple function to copy the chars array the string literal gives into an int array value for value but there must be a better way

14087823
width	height
my question is how would i go about determining what parameters for height and width

14087823
width	height
i was thinking of using javascript to get the height and width of a similar size div and then use those

children	parent
parent selectors break that design since the renderer cannot know whether it applies to an element until all of the elements children are downloaded from the server

14088183

google-chrome	firefox
to track the issue you should enable preserve logging upon navigation or similar option in your firebug firefox google-chrome console do the test again and see that the error pops in console exactly before you get navigated to addquestion.php

14088468
children	parent
from all of the other threads i have read my understanding is that the errors for project and all of its children models team roles role_skill_relationships should be captured by the parent object

i want to support landscape portrait orientations on my ipad app that uses a storyboard without getting involved into the intricacies of auto layout on ios6+ and auto resizing on ios 5 and earlier since the app will support both ios 5 6 so no autolayout is allowed here what i thought of as a beginning point for the solution was the following

14090485
portrait	landscape
creating two separate storyboards mainstoryboard-portrait mainstoryboard-landscape when the current view controller let s name it firstviewcontroller is in portrait and the user rotates the device to landscape i instantiate a new firstviewcontroller from mainstoryboard-landscape storyboard and vice versa when the user rotates back to portrait

14090497
portrait	landscape
as soon as you ve got two storyboards you ve got a maintenance and consistency headache â if you want the portrait and landscape user experience to be the same

qmainwindow	qwidget
i have a qmainwindow which instantiate a qwidget subclass

14091172

14091233
mp3	wav
im trying to transcode mp3 files into wav so that they can be used in another script

14091238
put	get
like if you have some text called your room number is 0 and this value is hard coded html then you should put it in en.xml file under some tag and get it from the xml file which is requested by the user according to the required lang

14091244
put	get	post	get	post	put
at the moment my database is small and much more likely to be read than written to so keeping all get results in a map and clearing them on post put or delete requests might be an option although i ve not implemented it yet so no idea what the improvement is

14091300
restrict	shared
it is restrict by the shared

14091302
children	parent
nodes in the graph can have multiple children and multiple parent

14091439
getter	setter
when it comes to generating getter and setter symfony is just using the reflectionclass to look if the methods already exist

14091444
octal	decimal
1 why you would assign a int variable using hexidecimal or octal instead of decimal and

14091465
octal	decimal	octal	binary
well the truth is it doesn t matter if you want it on decimal octal or hexadecimal its just a representation and for your information numbers in computers are stored in binary so they are just 0 s and 1 s which you can use also to represent a number

14091469
octal	binary
if you re using it as a bitmask you can use hexa octal or even binary

14091470
put	get
i have put the two sheets into my own workbook and have managed to get almost all the data on both sheets to populate from my own data

14091476
octal	hex
some might choose octal or hex to go along with their program that manipulates that type of data

14091486
hex	binary
bitflags for example in hexadecimal are compact and easily for some values of easily understood since there s a direct correspondence 4 binary digits 1 hex digit - for this reason in general the hexadecimal representation is useful when you are doing bitwise operations masking

14091486
integer	unsigned
also ip addresses each piece of ip in the dotted notation is two hexadecimal digits in the 32-bit integer notation usually in such cases unsigned integers are used to avoid messing with the sign bit

14091486
integer	unsigned
by default integer literals are of type int while hexadecimal literals are of type unsigned int or larger if unsigned int isn t large enough to hold the specified value

14091496
margin	height	width	margin	width	height
the formula for calculating this number was the report s height 842 pixels for a4 format - the left margin s width 20 in my case - the right margin s width 20 in my case

14091505
width	height
i want to set the limit of the width and height of the image when user upload an image using plupload

14091505
width	height
you must upload image with at least width 1000px and height 1000px

14091508
int	chars
the int argument is converted to an unsigned chars and the resulting chars is written

14091510
int	double
i ve been thought there are two types of methods those who return a value and those who don t and this one does but it is not declared as an any type regularly used int double long... it is declared with a class name which in this case would be polica

14091521
ssl	https	hash	md5
i would also recommend to use either ssl connection https or to send the password only hash md5

14091533
int	double
the return type does not have to be a int long or double etc

14091538
superclass	subclassing
say we have a superclass car and two subclassing ford and porsche

14091540
int	double
it is not declared as an any type regularly used int double long... it is declared with a class name

14091540
int	double
there is no difference between int double long etc

14091541
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
in that case you have a uitabbarcontroller with several uinavigationcontroller under it

14091554
implements	extends
i d like to implements endlessadapter from commonsware in my application it is a listfragment with a custom listview and a lazyadapter that extends baseadapter

14091673
apache	nginx
probably the proper way to do this would be to protect your resource through your web server so that it only accepts requests from the ip addresses you wish to allow see deny in apache or deny in nginx

14091694
min	max
min max is the most general formulation since min is equivalent to and and max to or for 0 1

14091694
min	max
if you want to write less code use min max

14091717
swt	windowbuilder
i am currently making a stand alone application not an eclipse plugin using swt and eclipse s windowbuilder and i was testing putting an image in a composite to use it as a way to easily plop images into my composites when i try to draw the image it throws an illegalargumentexception

14091743
inherited	properties
if not then this works if friends will have properties then you are better of having an entity which inherited from user

14091756
debian	linux
for example for python 2.6 in debian gnu linux

14091770
folder	directory
instead recommendation is to put files in a folder outside the tree structure of the site store name in database as something other than original name along with a file path to the hidden directory and serve it using a php file that reads and displays

14091773
google-chrome	firefox
now however while trying to create a new element via createelement i get in both google-chrome and firefox the error that the svg-dom-object does not contain that method

14091824
apache	nginx
i m trying to install nginx on my current cloud cent os server which has apache installed and running

14091824
apache	nginx
my hosting company tells me that nginx and apache can both run on port 80 at the same time so my plan was to transform .htaccess and apache conf of wordpress sites to nginx after installing it via yum

14091824
apache	nginx
i also googled about this and some people suggest using nginx as a reverse proxy and serve static files only but run apache with php because apache has php embedded and would consume less memory even though it doesn t support multiple concurrent requests like nginx

14091827
width	height
this will set the width and height

14091828
post	get
so there s nothing strange there you post login data to secure.meetic.com and you get redirected back to your normal website after login

14091869
apache	nginx
i would use nginx as the web facing server on port 80 and proxy pass to apache which would be running on a different port

14091869
apache	nginx
serving static files with nginx is much more efficient than with apache

14091919
apache	nginx
i m not quite sure what your hosting company means by their comment but you won t be able to run both apache and nginx on port 80

14091919
apache	nginx
probably the best configuration in your current situation would be to put nginx on port 80 and apache on 8000 or similar

14091920
width	margin
note these s will only extend to the end of the viewport if its parent div is at the top level and or no other parent has width padding or margin attached

problem 1 2 the reason for your first and second problem is because when you drag a uipagecontrol into the storyboard you probably put it on your scrollview which makes it a subviews of the scrollview

14092361
uipagecontrol	subviews
and after you add image or other contents to the scroll view the new contents will cover the uipagecontrol and since pagecontrol is a subviews of the scrollview it will scroll with the contents and scroll off screen

14092361
uipagecontrol	subviews
solve 1 2 you should put the uipagecontrol and scrollview in the same level as subviews to the base view of the controller and the uipagecontrol should appear below the uiscrollview in document outline lower in document outline means in the front in view

never rely on redirects on a post or even on a get with sensitive information in the url the initial request before the redirect to https will be sent in clear anyway which defeats the purpose of trying to use https

14092796
post	get
since you seem to be primarily concerned about users coming to this page using old bookmarks post and delete don t matter they ll be using get from a bookmark anyway

14092814

14093989
post	get
i just wanted to get basic post data out in django

14093990
put	get
the way to get around this is to put your data into a buffer and split it by whatever method you use to show the end of that piece of information

if get the same pauses as your original post then suspect your setup

14094017
profiling	debugging
you can debugging what happens at program load time by running dependency walker in profiling mode

14094021
free	malloc
you d probably want to compare malloc and free with operator new and operator delete and their array forms this is how the memory is allocated independent from the construction of objects

14094021
free	malloc
the performance is likely to be very similar and it is quite likely that both approaches end up using the same memory pool the c++ operators may be a thin wrappeer around malloc and free but not the other way around a user can safely implement operator new and operator delete in terms of malloc and free

14094501
range	minimum
i think you can improve the naive approach from o n 2 to o nlogn by using range minimum query to construct the binary tree

14094501
range	minimum
we can then use range minimum query on array b to allow us to find the minimum value of b i for a given range a i b

14094501
range	minimum
this value is given by our range minimum query applied to the range 20+1- 51-1

this is not a question about how to compare two bigdecimal objects - i know that you can use compareto instead of equals to do that since equals is documented as

unlike compareto this method considers two bigdecimal objects equals only if they are equals in value and scale thus 2.0 is not equals to 2.00 when compared by this method

14104551
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
actually the question of throwing illegalargumentexception or nullpointerexception is in my humble view only a holy war for a minority with an incomlete understanding of exception handling in java

14104551
inherited	subclassing	nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
therefore there is no way to create an exception that is truly say both a nullpointerexception and an illegalargumentexception as subclassing can only inherited from one or the other

14104551
illegalargumentexception	runtimeexception
however simply catching runtimeexception in this catch block is out of the question because that risks mapping documented runtimeexception thrown by libery methods used within yours into illegalargumentexception even if they are no caused by argument constraint violations

datediff	difference
you could use datediff date_sub functions to check if both dates results in a difference or a null or a zero

14104783
int	double
next up at the moment you re always filling the arrays with zero because all the array elements are 1 and then you re converting to an int so you get 0 - use rb_float_new to turn a double back into a ruby float

superclass	subclassing
your subclassing location3d would then have set itself as the generic type parameter so that the superclass returns instances of location3d instead of location

14105328
superclass	subclassing
it s also worth noting that if you define your subclassing such that the generic type parameter is a different class type then you could wind up with classcastexception hence you should document that restriction in your superclass for anyone who might want to create their own subclassing

14105350
strtol	strtod
a common method is to read the input as text then convert to the target type using a library function like strtol or strtod

14105350
int	chars

14105350

i want to extract the width and height of the svg file so that i can do some positioning with canvg

14105757
width	height
if a view is sized purely by its internal fixed width and height and positioned purely by its center for example my scale transform will work as i expect

14105757
width	height
in this code i remove the existing constraints on a subview otherview and replace them with those four constraints giving it a fixed width and height and pinning it purely by its center

14105763
int	chars
casting to const chars does not work because then it tries to interpret the int as a pointer

multiplying	add
i tried every other alphabet letter none caused this issue i also tried a couple variations it appears any number after d or e add that many zeros seems like its multiplying

carrierwave	paperclip	carrierwave	fog	paperclip	fog
i am not sure what service provider you are using but you may want to look at fog it works very well for remote storage to many providers and integrates well with paperclip and carrierwave

14105852
width	height
the text has a fixed height and you adjust the width of the text in one of the following ways

14105852
width	height
if you adjust the height so that the width is correct every line in your text will have a different height

14105863
uidatepicker	uipickerview
uidatepicker does have a uipickerview private ivar but since you are not and would not ever be its datasource this is of no concern to you

14105867
inherited	subclassing
1 uidatepicker is not a subclassing of uipicker and as per apple docs does not inherited from uipickerview.

14105898
int	chars
i believe your chars are being sign-extended to the width of an int

14105925
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
i would prefer using a qgraphicsscene and qgraphicsview then i would add a rectangle to the scene which is the common way of doing this kind of drawing stuff

14105936
ubuntu	debian
i haven t found libwmf project website but debian and ubuntu has package libwmf-bin that contains wmf2svg utility

14105958
integer	unsigned
in the c language standard unsigned integer overflow semantics are well defined whereas signed integer overflow causes undefined results

14105958
for-loop	loops
this is of particular note with loops counters since it is common for-loop counters to have values that are always positive it may be tempting to declare the counters as unsigned

14105958
integer	unsigned
here the sub-expression could overflow a 32-bit integer so if i is declared as unsigned the overflow semantics prevent the compiler from using some optimizations that might otherwise have applied such as strength reduction

update january 2 2013 upgraded server backend to use a traditional restful url which seems to make dojo slightly happier but it still is using get instead of put and fails to actually send anything to save

14106062
put	get
i m wondering if my program needs to return certain data before the program is willing to go do the put and thus the problem isn t the get but whatever comes next .

there were many of these back in the days of vrml and x3d just wondering if anyone has developed anything of this sort yet

14106177
installation	downgrade
of those two options it s probably easier to downgrade your jvm where you run tomcat or choose a different one since mac os allows multiple side-by-side jvm installation

14106284
post	get
i have an html form that i m trying to get to post with part of a query string already inplace but it keeps re-writing the url

14106289
arp	icmp
because of this any packets you send out will not know where to send the replies icmp or arp request will therefore not work

14106306
post	get
use the post method rather than the get method

14106405
javassist	cglib
alternatively you can also generate entity classes dynamically using a special library such as cglib asm javassist arch4j

14106413
try-catch	exception-handling
you can wrap the code with try-catch exception-handling handling and decide how to react if such an exception-handling occurs

14106434

i ve put them in a container but i cannot get them side by side like the example below

14106511
awt	swing
instead i implemented also an interception-like approach extended version of yours by evaluating generic keyoard input within certain swing awt forms using these criteria

14106517
fink	macports
if both of them prefer usr local bin and unless you re using macports or fink they do you ve probably got one of them half-overwritten by the other and there s just no way you re going to get this working

14106529

14106544
margin	height
so the math for the p is 50 of 200px 100px content-box height then add 1px border twice plus 16px margin twice based off what you state it is gives a value of 134px

14106563

free	malloc
the libraries supplied as glibc and libstdc++ are not going to say that they will change the internals of malloc free new and delete as new technologies and ideas are invented - some may make things better others may make it worse for a given scenario

14106617
put	get	post	get	post	put
i put up a post before that should have the pieces you would need to get a working example

14106637
implements	extends
after having made all your classes implements or extends gisentity you would write your tree this way

xdebug	xhprof
also xhprof is preferred over xdebug when profiling on production

14106650
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
as you have numbers as keys in your arrays you can loops through your arrays with a for-loop

14106754
multiplying	multiplication
the only thing that s different here is that the elements of your vector are n n matrices so you ll wind up doing o k 2 n log 7 scalar multiplication if you use strassen s algorithm to multiplying n n matrices

14106774
.htaccess	httpd.conf
the setting max_input_vars has a mode of php_ini_perdir so if you don t have access to your php.ini file then you may be able to set it in an .htaccess your httpd.conf file or your .user.ini since php 5.3 file if you have one

14106775
stdout	stderr
the great thing about subprocess is that you can make it collect all the text from stdout and stderr and you can then discard it or return it or log it or display it as you like

14106790
int	double
if you didn t do type conversion from int32 to double octave would truncate the values to int

14106790

getter	setter
the code is a java class with getter and setter

14106841
getter	setter
per this discussion mongoose allows for virtual field names with getter and setter

14106843
for-loop	loops
first of all using a while loops here isn t optimal instead use a for-loop which is designed to loops over iterators like data structures a string is just a sequence of characters

14106863
children	parent
the data has a parent model that has seven has_many children and may have one or more records in each has_many child

14106871

14106919
int	chars
for instance say you have a cpu that only supports 32-bit operations and has 32-bit registers and you write a c function that uses both int 32-bit and chars 8-bit

14106944
submit	submission
i have a form im trying to submit into my mysql database and its submission all the records fine accept the content field in my blog table

14106960

14107357
std	ostream
that is when you output std flush with to an std ostream it just calls the corresponding function the following two statements are equivalent

14107357
std	ostream
now std flush itself is fairly simple all it does is to call std ostream flush you can envision its implementation to look something like this

14107357
std	ostream
the std ostream flush function technically calls std streambuf pubsync on the stream buffer if any which is associated with the stream the stream buffer is responsible for buffering characters and sending characters to the external destination when the used buffer would overflow or when the internal representation should be synced with the external destination when the data is to be flushed

14107357
cout	cin
this may be at the end of writing a file closing a file implicitly flushes the buffer though or immediately before asking for user input note that std cout is automatically flushed when reading from std cin as std cout is std istream tie d to std cin

14107472
width	height	mouseevent	mousedown	mouseevent	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown
clarifies that you should still be able capture the mouseup event even though it is outside the initial control that invoked the mouseevent meaning the mousedown event and that would be from the original control so saying you begin your swipe from control1 and the control1 mouseleftbuttondown event fires then you need to capture the mouse for more information on mouse capture and scenarios where it is useful see mouse support or how to drag and drop objects in ui layout then as you stated you swipe across control2 and when your finger pointer stylus isover control3 you release the mouse then the original captured mouseup event will fire for the control which captured the mouse in this case control1 and using the screen x y location and your controls x y width height properties you should be able to assess over which control the mouse was released

superclass	subclassing
oop works best when you use the polymorphism at its fullest extent and the base class or superclass should have all the necessary virtual functions to access the properties and methods of all subclassing and therefore you should be able to keep a reference to a subclassing using the base class without having to make any cast thereafter

14108676
width	height
never set the layout_height and layout_width of your listview to wrap_content as getview will force your adapter to get some child for measuring the height of the views to be drawn in list view and can cause some unexpected behaviour like returning convertview even the list is not scrolled.always use match_parent or fixed width height

14108676
width	height
if you want to use some layout or view after your list view and question might came in your mind if i set the layout_height to fill_parent the view after list view will not show up as it goes down the screen so its better to put your listview inside a layout.for example linear layout and set the height and width of that layout as of your requirement and make the height and width attribute of your listview to as of your layout like if your layout width is 320 and height is 280 then your listview should have same height and width

14108676
width	height
this will tell getview of exact height and width of views to be rendered and getview won t call again and again some random rows and other problems like returning convert view even before scrolling won t happen i have test this myself unless my listview was inside the linealayout it was also having problems like repeating view call and convert view as putting listview inside linearlayout worked like magic for me. didn t know why

14108676
put	get
but now its solved i know i m not that good at explaining but as i put my whole day to understand so i thought other beginners like me can get help of my experience and i hope now you people will have a little bit understanding of listview framework how it works as it is really messy and tricky so beginners found too much problem understanding it

14108781
for-loop	loops
your answer pretty much covers it but i think a change in your original loops is worth noting as it makes it reasonable to use a normal for-loop when the each function isn t handy for whatever reason

14108781
for-loop	loops
a benefit of the for-loop version imo is the code that does loops is right there so it s nature and behavior is completely transparent while the each function might be defined in a different file written by someone else etc

getter	setter	accessor	ivar
in this case _variablename isn t the accessor it s an ivar that is automatically generated by the compiler and used in the automatically synthesized setter and getter

14113098
accessor	properties
generally it is considered best to use accessor whenever possible self.variablename so that things like key-value observation and bindings work for that properties

14113098
accessor	properties
using dot notation self.variablename calls the accessor methods to set or get that properties and can do a number of different things along the way such as

14113098
accessor	properties
if your object is not meant to be used on multiple threads you can give the nonatomic hint in your properties declaration so that the synthesized accessor skip the locking

14113098
getter	setter
3 custom accessor behavior if you end up writing your own setter and getter any custom stuff that you implement within those

14113098
accessor	ivar
technically accessing the ivar directly is faster than using accessor but there are very few situations in which it will make a significant performance difference and would probably be a case of premature optimization

14113098
ivar	subclassing
in addition if you are accessing ivars directly and end up refactoring your class into categories or subclassing it gets messy because you usually have to declare the ivar as a protected variable

14113098
accessor	properties
generally i try to only access the ivars directly in init dealloc and the properties s accessor

logical operators make only sense with boolean operands bitwise operators work with int types as well

14114179
int	boolean
since c had no boolean type and treats all non-zero int as true the existence of both logical and bitwise operators makes sense there

14114206
maven	pom.xml
so i included java assist in my maven pom.xml file as below

14114942

as alexander farkas suggested i wrapped the video in another div and i set this parent div to go full screen after which i set the height and width of the video to screen.height and screen.width respectively

14117521
width	height
you just need to set the image s container to also have 100 width height

14117521
width	height
an element with 100 width height can only be as large as it s container

14117523
getter	setter
you should not be doing so much inside the getter setter methods

14117523
getter	setter
getter should just return the property and setter should just set it

14117523
getter	setter
calling other getter setter from them is recipe for trouble

but after my work when i tried to host it in iis after publishing it to a local folder i am getting the directory listing missing error

14117623
union	distinct
i don t think you can do much better than 3 union maybe the last 2 can be combined with count distinct

14117696
width	height
you could scale to fit instead or use height instead of width or whatever

14117704
width	height
setmaxheight is not limiting the image height width

14117709
folder	directory
i am trying to generate a target folder in different directory from the maven project folder

14117718
width	height
firstly you can find width and height of image on screen as follows

as you said image is full screen to start with and scalefactor is the total scale applied on the image until max min

14117762

thus when you define int home double double ... you aren t providing an implementation for a home you re creating another function

14117783
int	double
you then have int a home double double ... and int home double double ...

14117783

you either need int a home double double ... or to wrap everything in your .cpp file that s under namespace a in

usually you will only want to do this for dynamic content such as the list items inside a listview or a gridview

14117821

14117821
int	double
you need to send double quoted int values as a string

14117824
for-loop	arrays

the break statements in switch drives me crazy and that label format reminds me of goto

14117860
google-chrome	firefox
it works in google-chrome but not firefox

14117891
width	height
the cause of the above discrepancies is that the orthographic projection is not matching the width and height ratio of the screen thus the x and y coordinates are not the same screen size

14117892
int	chars
case can only have int or chars constants or an expression that evaluates to one of these

if you still want to be able to use ibtool from the command line here s an explanation about xcrun

14118070

if the container has fixed height and width values then limiting the amount of text by character is only fool-proof if you re using a monospaced typeface

14118070
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari

i also looked into the answers to clang linker problem but i do not see how i can get the accepted answer to find the correct location and the symlink answer would have worked except that all of the directory that it is searching exist copying the lib folder from gcc-snapshot to one of the include locations does not seem to help

14118224
clang	llvm
clang -cc1 version 3.3 based upon llvm 3.3svn default target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu

14118266
width	height
the width and height options allow you to add constraints for a constant size

14118283
base	fractions
the reason for splitting the tasks is because if you are repeatedly calling for the same set of base and number and only for different d s then we can cache the number in the new base.for example the following function converts a number a from base 10 to a base b .i am curious how to deal with fractions

14118290
int	double
i changed the return type from double to int since it doesn t make sense to have a fraction in a digit

14118319
folder	directory
i am getting output not present but i can t see the directory created in the name of integrationid under errors folder

14118387
integer	fractions
if m is greater than or equal to 10 -3 but less than 10 7 then it is represented as the integer part of m in decimal form with no leading zeroes followed by . u002e followed by one or more decimal digits representing the fractions part of m

14118387
integer	fractions
the magnitude is then represented as the integer part of a as a single decimal digit followed by . u002e followed by decimal digits representing the fractions part of a followed by the letter e u0045 followed by a representation of n as a decimal integer as produced by the method integer.tostring int

14118414

14118431
jstl	taglib
i am using jstl fmt taglib to show tamil characters

better to make private and provide the getter and setter method hence you can access the value by getter method

14118477
getter	setter
with getter and setter and other variables

14118601
getter	setter
either you can create a public static variable then access that variable or you can create getter setter method to get the value of the data in your second class

listview	gridview
when a gridview listview has an adapter it calls getview when it displays items that are to be in view

14119447

as for the second part of your question i would think that at least some third party crash reporters save the crash data in the app s folder itself judging by the following directory which were empty as the app has not yet crashed on my device

14119452
post	get
once you post that you ll get an array in your post with the index of rows which you can iterate through further

14119571

but things get complicated when you want to organize the display of the nodes with rules such as try to minimize the number of crossing edges display children below their parent etc which all need complex mathematics

14119572
mouse	keyboard
the application was using registerrawinputdevices to get raw mouse and keyboard input and using the flag ridev_capturemouse to stop other applications getting focus

14119580

14119651
stdout	stderr
ps note that this is redirecting stdout and stderr to dev null if you want to capture output then use

14119669

so let s do that using basically 2 is stderr and 1 is stdout so what this means is redirect all stderr messages to stdout

14119777
width	height
second you re setting the width and height attributes of the img tag when in fact you should set these attributes on the container in this case the li

14119780

there exist such a structure that acts like a queue but lets you retrieve min max value in constant time actually not strictly constant it is amortized constant time named min max queue as you could guess

14130250
hash	salt
were this not so hashing a salt password would do nothing or at least much less to protect against a dicitionary attack as similar passwords would result in similar hash

14130335
gif	bmp	gif	png	bmp	png
image names must only contain alphanumeric characters of either case a-z a-z 0-9 and must end with a jpg jpeg png gif or bmp file extension

i already tried various forms of methods to write files in java as printwriter filewriter outputstream and others including adding character encoding parameter utf-8 or iso-8859-1 to some these methods

14130372
spaces	delimiter
you can get around the spaces and newline issue with gnu find and gnu grep maybe others by using 0 delimiter

14130376
cpu	processors
in essence if a cpu intensive problem can be divided in smaller independent tasks then those tasks can be assigned to different processors

14130485
pull	push
i wouldn t use push pull to achieve your basic arrangement

14130491
getter	setter
if you must make it non-final keep it private and only allow access to it through setter methods and getter of course

14130509
equals	gethashcode
i understand overriding the equals method however the gethashcode necessity has eluded me

14130540
equals	gethashcode
the gethashcode is a first check for the more expensive check equals

14130546
for-loop	arrays
then deleted them from the original arrays x using numpy.delete method and convertd the type of remaining values by applying a for-loop that iterates over each value

14130547
tablelayoutpanel	numericupdown
each row is a usercontrol which consists of a tablelayoutpanel labels a swatch control and a numericupdown box

14130558
division	modulo
but there is still division a modulo and therefore effeciency is same as modulo i assume

14130560
packets	multicast
i m trying to send a udp multicast packets to 230.185.192.108 so everyone subscribed will receive

14130561
equals	gethashcode
also whenever you override equals object obj it is good practice to override gethashcode

14130575
udp	tcp
one intention of netty is to present a unified channel abstraction that works more or less the same for connection oriented sockets tcp as for connection less sockets udp regardless of the underlying implementation oio nio or aio

14130580

it has both o 1 min and o 1 max operations

14130617
g++	gcc
as others have pointed out you can use cygwin which includes the gcc and g++ c and c++ compilers

14130628
folder	directory
the idea is that if any files in the bin debug directory are newer than the corresponding .nuspec file found two folder above bin debug then the mainbuild target should execute

14130653
google-chrome	firefox
i have a strange problem on a navigation menu that only appears in firefox works fine in ie7 8 9 10 google-chrome

14130660
folder	directory
the code and the output folder bin7 bin8 ... are placed in the first sub directory

14130678
versioning	upgrade
it explains how versioning numbers and ranges can be utilized in packages.config files to allow for the update-package command to know what are acceptable versioning to upgrade to

14130688
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
works in google-chrome firefox and opera but not in ie8-

14130690

i have this simple hide show input box code but i want to change it so that you don t see all the links at once but instead only the links that have been clicked and the one link after the last one that was clicked so in the beginning only link 1 is show

14130704
awt	swing
question what can i use in swing awt hiearchy in order to have such flexible grid

14130715
dbcontext	objectcontext
i ve never used dbcontext before i always used the default objectcontext in ef 4.

14130746

in eclipse only can test the predefined devices and when i try to put a custom dpi or screen size only the emulator display get scaled

14130769
gtk	gdk
i can t find gdk under gtk like i can find gdk under gtk

14130815
hide	show
basically offset the id s in the call to show so that clicking each link show the next one and don t hide the first

14130815
hide	show
note that t2 etc is now just part of the id and the show function has to expand it to include all elements to show hide

14130815
hide	show
i ve not bothered to include a separate toggle to show hide the inputs and i ve removed the code to hide the links if the user clicks a second time

14130854
for-loop	loops
you can iterate over it by using an iterator with a while loops or for-loop but counting through the indexes or by using the for each construct

14130856
put	get
well if you define rpc as sending commands to a server then any and all http operations are rpc calls - whether you get a resource put a new representation or delete it again - each of them consist of a sending a command verb get put delete etc

14130864
min	max
for a simpler solution than n-grams use only basic statistical tests -- min max and average -- to compare your input a string given by the user with an alphabet a string of all characters in one of the alphabets you are interested

14130918
getter	setter
the definition of that reference is described in step 11.c of es5 10.6 which defines getter and setter for each index of arguments but is limited by both the number of arguments named and the number of arguments passed

14130918
getter	setter
what you want to do is possible with es5 but would mean defining your own arguments object with getter and setter for each index and named argument whether passed a value or not via object.create object.defineproperties or get set -- and i wouldn t consider this simply

14130925
ant	maven	ant	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml
i have an ant buildfile which is referencing a maven pom.xml like so

14130937
dbcontext	objectcontext
i wrote a pretty similar article last year on detect changes performance which you can find here my experience is mostly with dbcontext which wraps objectcontext but i did a bit of a search and found the following

14130940
mouse	keyboard
it is a windows keyboard and mouse automation tool

14130947
children	parent
these variables are storing parent values of a hierarchical list formats and children values of the same hierarchical list

14130947
children	parent
the idea is to populate a dropdown form menu with these formats with parent formats being optgroups containing their children

14130952
keydown	keyup
just add the keydown keyup listener on the document ready function.

14130958
namenode	hdfs
hadoop distributed file system hdfs sounds like overkill to me and the namenode would again be a single point of failure

14130970
hash	salt
this is obviously saved in the database for security reasons you may want to treat it like a password and thus salt and hash it and the next time the user connects with the same browser assuming the old session expired the application receives the random string checks the database and if there s a match the user is authenticated

14130996
hide	show
create multiple iframe elements and show one at a time by using on-page tabs links buttons simple onclick action to reveal one iframe and hide the rest

14131006
realloc	calloc
you probably want a realloc or a calloc in that line

14131048
google-chrome	firefox
when i load the page in google-chrome firefox etc it works fine

14131051
post	get
this is the part that doesn t feel quite right but it was the cleanest way i could come up with to get back out of an item s view model in order to apply additional logic and do the post

14131109
hide	show
so you don t have to hide all controls one by one you can just hide a panel and show another one

14131127
qstring	qbytearray
i m having issues with qbytearray and qstring

14131138
hide	show
this allows you to design and use it just like a form but works as a single control which you can show or hide as needed

14131176
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome however the cookie is not obeyed

14131176
google-chrome	firefox
i ve looked at both firefox and google-chrome browsers and cannot see anywhere where cookies are turned off

14131176
google-chrome	firefox
same story - works in ie doesn t work in google-chrome or firefox

14131176
google-chrome	firefox
so i have to believe this is a fault with my google-chrome firefox

14131229
apache	nginx
then i got assigned a project to move to nginx from apache

14131269
width	height
for example to adjust width height dynamically you can do something like this

14131269
width	height
_publisher.view setframe cgrectmake left top width height

14131281
jtextfield	jtable
i need press some buttons not being focused in a jtextfield and on that basis add some position to the jtable

14131309
hash	salt
for better safety store it salt and hash in db

14131320
google-chrome	firefox
you can give your dynamically loaded script a name so that it shows in the google-chrome firefox javascript debugger

14131376
spaces	delimiter
the input text file has spaces and tabs but the fields are delimiter by tabs

14131406
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
safari firefox and opera

14131456
scikit-learn	nltk
if you are worried about memory then do look into scikit-learn since equivalent models can use significantly less memory than nltk

14131466
for-loop	arrays
using explode and a for-loop you change the arrays into a multi demintional arrays to be used in the above steps

14131475
for-loop	loops
i don t think you can use a foreach loops for what you need but you can just use a for-loop

14131478
portrait	landscape
the root view controller is in portrait mode but the app behaves like it would be in landscape mode meaning the notification center can be accessed from the side and so on

14131488
pthreads	fork
however the java.lang.thread class as well as pthreads pthreads upon which java threads are often based are suboptimal vehicles for supporting fork join programs

14131497
cimg	libpng
i am using cimg combined with libpng in visual studio 2010 to display png images

14131537
for-loop	arrays
if you on the other hand have multiple resources you can always add the semaphores to your arrays using a for-loop

14131543
for-loop	arrays
or using for-loop this approach will work perfectly fine if your arrays of semaphore instances is much longer

14131578
width	height
then you can resize it to whatever width height you like then assign that to the maintexture

14131624
google-chrome	safari
the menu icons appears correctly on all browsers including mobile google-chrome but not on mobile safari where just the links appear

14131636
google-chrome	firefox
everything is working fine with ie google-chrome and firefox

14131664
factors	matrix
for a push_back function to not be prohibitively expensive it must increase the matrix s capacity by some factors when it runs out of space as you have done

14131668
width	height
wait for fade-out before changing width and height to zero to avoid user interaction

14131673
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
note the auto rotation only works correctly when uiviewcontroller are used correctly like for example a stack in uinavigationcontroller

14131718
width	height
it takes into consideration the difference between the original height width and the displayed height width

14131741
post	get
a user visits the site which uses the following method to pull post from the db that get beautifully rendered in the browser

14131756
websphere	ibm
ibm websphere application server 6.0.2.43

14131771
width	font-size
conclusion there is a bug in firefox that miscalculates the width of an element if its first-letter has a font-size set

14131783
post	get
the only other way besides what you ve already mentioned is to construct your view class from the same elements that createview does and then change the get and post methods to populate self.object there

14131828
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
instead you actually want to have the uitabbarcontroller embedded within a uinavigationcontroller

14131851
folder	directory
hazarding a guess asp.net monitors the directory and any changes in the bin folder cause the application to unload after current processing has completed

14131945
popover	tooltip
i cannot use the existing tooltip that is native to highcharts because i want my user to interact with the content inside the popover which you cannot efficiently do with the highcharts tooltip such as clicking on a link

14131972
put	get
for the sake of this example i m just going to get the car from the original collection in step 1 by using the selected position and put that into the intent no need to create a separate bundle for that

14132002
setinterval	clearinterval
you can use clearinterval to stop the timer started by setinterval and correct the typo html.lenght to html.length

14132010
hash	md5
you don t need to create an md5 hash of the filename just use the filename as the key for the dict

14132030
setinterval	settimeout
you can handle this a couple of different ways but based on your question stop the setinterval somehow let s switch the implementation to a settimeout and also refactor the code in to a function we can recall

14132039
folder	directory
if all else fails since xcode projects compile into a flat directory tree you could try removing the folder indicator from the #include from systemconfiguration systemconfiguration.h to systemconfiguration.h from the files where the .h is called

14132049
svg	vml
the main structure is html css the connections can be svg canvas vml

14132052
solaris	aix
i ve multiple major programs that port between linux and hp-ux or aix or solaris or mac os x with no changes to the embedded sql code

14132070
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i tested it succesfully with all these browsers firefox 17.0.1 ie 8.0 safari 5.0.3 google-chrome 23.0.1271.97

14132092
libreoffice	uno
one solution is to use the unoconv tool which relies on the uno bindings for openoffice libreoffice

14132094
folder	directory
this uses the user.home system property as the root directory and creates the output directory in a folder named after the project

14132097
google-chrome	firefox
for some reason this works perfectly in firefox google-chrome and ie7 but does not work in ie 8 9

14132104
.htaccess	httpd.conf
for php this includes whatever the interpreter is running under so in apache for example you can use setenv var value in .htaccess or httpd.conf to set those environment variables up for php

14132116
opera	safari
i used to use twitter bootstrap and my code used to work fine on all browsers except opera mini and safari until i checked with responsinator and realized i was not wrong

14132123
put	get
however this is becoming increasingly rare as c compilers get better and better and producing efficient code and most platforms put restrictions on some of the low-level type of software that is often the type of software that benefits most from being written in assembler

14132158
getter	setter
first as of xcode 4.4 there is no longer a need to synthesize unless you change both the setter and getter method either when the property is declared in the interface or implementation

14132168
margin	height
note that apple uses the term target area and not button size. on ipad standard toolbar buttons have a height of 30pt with a 7pt margin on top and bottom

14132209
post	get
what im stuck on is that usually at least in html php you would have a post get and a url to point it all to

14132232
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
also i know md5 is no good anymore but idc about that right now i ll be switching to sha-2 once all my functionallity is done and i ll salt and hash it at a later point

14132258
post	get
i am guessing it s because i am trying to mix starling events and flash events but i need to use starling and i need to use urlloader to post get data from remote source

14132265
width	height
this will create a link titled share page which opens the current url in a new window with a height of 570 and width of 520

14132281
opera	firefox
the prefix for firefox and other mozilla browsers is -moz- webkit is -webkit- opera is -o- and ie is -ms-

14132343
post	get
this is a faux-continuation of my queries here http 303 seeother get works post fails i m posting another question because the other deals primarily with http redirections and does not address what i now believe to be the underlying problem

14132343
post	get
if i post to this resource i get mixed results depending on the source of the request

14132343
post	get
however i did notice that wireshark was not recognizing the responses to a post request as http which is something it would do for the responses to a get request

14132343
chunked	transfer-encoding	post	get
the get and post responses are both coming back to the client with the header transfer-encoding chunked

14132343
post	get
i m noticing that the get response looks like it should but the post response seems to be missing that last chunk

14132360
subclass	abstract-class
if at class level this means this class cannot be directly instantiated and therefore you must subclass it such an abstract-class can however bear static factory methods returning subclasses of itself

14132489
setinterval	settimeout
i want to run user provided javascript on site but before doing so i need to algorithmically check if provided javascript source follows set of rules not using eval function not using settimeout setinterval functions etc.

14132532
oncreate	recreate
i isolated the problem a little and recreate it by creating a new android application project with only one line of my code in the main class in the oncreate method

14132532
libs	buildpath
i tried adding the jdk jar files manually to the libs folder and mark add to buildpath - didn t work

14132533
x86	64bit
maybe i686 32-bit x86 x86_64 64bit x86 some others and also noarch package is not arch dependent will work on any arch

14132537
arraylist	linkedhashmap
use a linkedhashmap and an arraylist for each values

14132576
dictionary	map
try this one-liner dictionary map reversed table.items

14132648
super	self
yes self will be retained super is a call on self with a different method lookup pathway

14132648
super	self
first as said above super is a call on self there is no such thing as a super object so it would be sufficient to get the imp for the method in the superclass and call it on self

14132648
super	self
as said above super calls the method on self so it still finds the method based on the class of the current object

14132653
shadowing	named
you have named your module new which is shadowing with an import in matplolib.cbook which is causing you to try to imort pyplot while you are importing pyplot which aparently blows up exactly why is above my paygrade

14132664
cos	sqrt
for example the user might enter in x 2 - y 2 cos x + y log x - sqrt y etc

14132664
cos	sqrt
the program makes use of both infix binary operations + - etc. and unary operations cos sqrt etc.

14132664
cos	sqrt	cos	exp
for example cos x sqrt x + y and log exp y - x all fit this format since they are unary operations with some expression as their operand

14132664
cos	sin
however strings such as sin x cos y and 1 + log x do not follow this format

14132664
cos	sin
the latter prevents a string such as sin x + cos y from matching

14132667
children	parent
it should remove the parent s files but this removed the children files in the folder

14132708
superclass	subclassing
i have a item as superclass and there are two subclassing under it

14132737
gridview	sqldatasource
i have gridview which uses this sqldatasource as datasource

14132768
google-chrome	safari
in ie safari and google-chrome you can do the following

14132779
children	parent
this makes the parent fit its children s content

14132862
google-chrome	firefox
also this issue occurs only mozilla firefox not when i use google-chrome

14132891
oncreate	setcontentview
you need to add something like this in oncreate after setcontentview

14132901
width	height
it is impossible to read some layout related css styles from javascript percent-based width and height margins set to auto etc. so the safe thing to do is to defer this change to individual site owners

14132935
post	get
you could try and post the values to the domino login form as opposed to placing them in the address bar which forms a get request

14132944
width	height
so i provided a width and height for it

14132994
vim	emacs
knowing either vim or emacs is definitely a good thing

14133007
switching	screens
i m having a problem with the layout spacing of my buttons when i switching between the iphone 5 4 screens size

14133036
direct3d	gdi
i guess it is using direct3d to get screenshots of applications instead of using gdi as i m using

consider adding a different column then like identifier or key or something to make it less ambiguous if that s the case

14164194
rss	feed
i am pulling in rss feed using the drupal 7 feed and contained in the description field along with the content of the feed are images

14164194
rss	feed
i d like to extract these on the fly during the import of the rss feed so i can use the images native in drupal

14164213
fadein	fadeout
thank you for pointing out to me that the jquery methods fadein and fadeout crossfade

14164246
width	height
since you are applying a rotation the width and height will likely be different after the rotation

14164246
width	height
just keep in mind that width and height are calculated based on the bounds of an object

14164246
width	height
by rotation the object you likely change the bounds of the object and therefore the width and height

14164274
std	ostream
we re talking c++ so let s assume you start off with a bool or std vector bool or a std bitset and end up with a std string or some kind of std ostream - whatever your solution prefers

14164310
entity-relationship	diagram
the alternative is to show an entity-relationship diagram with two relationships either side of the junction table but this seems redundant

14164310
entity-relationship	diagram
i am leaning toward not showing the junction table in the entity-relationship diagram

14164343
gridview	rowdatabound
i have a basic asp.net page with a gridview object and i have written a rowdatabound event to change the row colors based on a condition

14164350
lxml	beautifulsoup
edit don t use this for html work use the lxml library it s python based and much faster than beautifulsoup

14164350
goose	boilerpipe
2 readability library content is passable slower on average than goose but faster than boilerpipe

14164473
mdpi	hdpi
i have provided appropriate sizes for ldpi mdpi hdpi and xhdpi

14164473
screens	tablet
i m not satisfied because the problem still exists on tablet screens

14164477
width	height
the width and height propperties should be the image s size ones

14164489
for-loop	loops
for the second loops you can always use matirx over for-loop

14164491
width	height
p class toc_dept a href xxx img src xxx width 112 height 36 alt forum border 0 a p

14164491
width	height
p class toc_dept a href xxx img src xxx width 112 height 36 alt from the hill border 0 a p

14164507
realloc	malloc
allocate the block using malloc not new and then use realloc

14164507
free	realloc
realloc knows how much free space is available after the block for expansion

14164523
background-image	background-position	background-image	background-color	background-repeat	background-position	background-repeat	background-image
background background-color background-image background-repeat background-attachment background-position

14164530
ssl	https
but make sure you host this on a https url since ebay only accepts these function through a secure connection ssl

14164596
info.plist	ipa
if you unzip an ipa created with air and look at its info.plist you ll see a key named ctnamespaceuri with a string value of or 3.3 3.4...

14164598
free	realloc
the first option also implies copying if realloc finds that there is not enough free space after the block

14164598
realloc	malloc
even if you used malloc for allocating the array which is the only correct option to use realloc at all.

14164629
portrait	landscape
otherwise i seem to get an inconsistent state portrait aspect ratio display in landscape mode

14164642
daemons	systemd
in other words does the fwrite call crosses the file systemd boundary to the vm subsystem if yes then page daemons should at sometime be invoked which will flush the contents to the file

14164672
uinavigationcontroller	uipageviewcontroller
normally a design like you mentioned would be built using a built in controller like uinavigationcontroller or uipageviewcontroller or maybe using a scrollview

14164709
division	modulo
i m going to assume you already have some sort of bignum division modulo function to work with because implementing such a thing is a complete nightmare

14164830
g++	gcc
i get a link error with gcc g++ gnu gcc

14164931
hide	show
probably ngswitch is the right aproach but if you want to hide or show inline content just using filter is the way to go

14164967
int	chars
i know that the file contains records which consist of a header with 20 int 20 real numbers and 80 chars then another n real numbers

14165016
width	height
secondly if your div no longer contains an image within it it will collapse to a width and height of 0 cause there s nothing to define its dimensions

14165060
google-chrome	firefox
you ll notice that the bottom right corner of the div containing the form is shifted in google-chrome from where it is in firefox

14165077
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
this is the power of sl notification system inotifypropertychanged and inotifycollectionchanged interfaces

14165080
maven	pom.xml
provides additional optional and provided dependency configurations for gradle along with maven pom.xml generation support

14165084
hash	md5
looks for e-mail in the input field and pushes e-mail to md5 hash and generates a url of a gravatar which is then embedded into a class via fadein

14165114
width	height
in your header.php file go ahead and replace line 68 with this code remove the width and height attributes

14165114
width	height
your now using flexible height and width so you can crop however you wish

14165114
width	height
you can change those height and width values to whatever you wish for defaults

14165128
folder	directory
i want to save an image from the drawable directory to the download folder in the phone

14165129
uninstall	downgrade
downgrade to java 1.6 uninstall macports as well

14165178
width	height
just set the width and height of your flash to 100

14165183
floating-point	fractions
this is happening because certain fractions cannot be accurately represented in binary - i suggest reading what every computer scientist should know about floating-point arithmetic

14165215
mouseleave	mouseenter
you could also just subscribe to the lineshape s mouseenter and mouseleave events too

14165217
g++	gcc
g++ gcc uses different libs for this 2 flags because g++ main.cpp -wl -t -lgmp is different from g++ main.cpp -wl -t -lgmpxx and only the last one works

14165224
viewdidload	viewdidappear
i referenced this function to set the correct popover size in the viewdidload and viewdidappear functions for each vc in the chain of vcs displayed in my popovercontroller

14165229
int	double
floating point numbers double float aren t accurate instead use -200 and 200 as an int

14165249
google-chrome	firefox
this is happening across all major browsers ie google-chrome firefox

14165274
width	height
afaik there is no option to link the height to the width like how you would do in most image editing software

14165274
width	height
that gets the screen bounds and then calculate the windows width and height based on your requirement for 16 9

14165274
width	height
you can get the height and width of the screen from screen.primaryscreen.bounds

14165289
int	chars
the problem is that x is an int which you then compare to a chars literal

14165289
int	chars
this works well when using old c-style standard i o which uses int instead of chars but doesn t work in c++ where the types are distinct

14165314
int	chars
you declare x as an int yet you enter the chars literal n

14165314
int	chars
if you want to read a chars then read a chars same for int

14165314
int	chars
that is not a comparison it is an assignment and the chars n when converted to an int will always evaluate to true so your loop never ends

14165314
int	chars
x is an int and the integral value of the chars literal n is 110

14165337
stdout	stderr
to create an error warning or message that will appear in the error list window simply log a message to stdout or stderr in the following format from a script initiated by a pre- or post-build event

14165346
ng-show	ng-hide
ng-show and ng-hide of course

14165351
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox can handle the un-encoded # and render the page correctly

14165370
equals	gethashcode
distinct relies on the objects all implementing iequatable and or having sensible implementations of gethashcode and equals

14165390
maven	m2e
ideally i would like to do this using m2e without needing the maven command line interface

14165400
pop-up	dialog
i am only seeing pop-up dialog from xlcalert in xlautoadd and xlautoremove

14165455
armadillo	eigen
it also lets armadillo chose what method to use for the eigen decomposition and as david hinted this is something quicker than a full-blown svd see the armadillo docs

14165500
width	height
when scaling you need to modify both the width and the height of the target

14165517
stdout	stderr
now my problem is the following i would like to capture whatever is going through stdout and or stderr of that process and redirect it to system.out asynchronously

14165521
pull	push
when you want to code next execute a git pull command to get the latest repo changes and then work and git push your changes back to the repo

14165543
folder	directory
looking at the folder with a command prompt there appears to be 2 directory 1 named

14165556
google-chrome	firefox
i found a solution that works in the latest versions of google-chrome and firefox and ie 8 and 9

14165590
hide	show
each time i hide show an element it gives a different font size

14165590
hide	show
it s only happening when i show and hide more that one element on the show all area

14165632
post	get
if i look at it in fiddler the collection only post once and doesn t enumerate the collection so i get

14165695
ienumerable	ilist
the problem is not with the ienumerable or the ilist it the way you are rendering the collection in your view

14165699
for-loop	loops
when i run a shader with no for loops on a 1280x1280 image i get a total of 202 mb allocated and when i run it with for loops i get 230 mb allocated regardless of what happens inside the for-loop

14165709
wav	aiff
once you have that working you could replace the harsh click with a sound you get from a wav or aiff or a short tone or whatever

14165713
entity-relationship	diagram
when doing a simpler entity-relationship diagram it really just depends on who your audience is

14165748
jar	war
an executable jar file has a different structure from what a war file has so i don t think that you re going to be successful in trying to create an executable war file

14165748
jar	war
a benefit of using maven is that you could have two different targets - one to build the war file and one to build the executable jar file from the same project

14165784
jar	war
i have maven nexus local repository on run time i download fetch jar war file from maven repo and copy it to tomcat

14165784
jar	war
i am using following url to to download jar war file

14165784
jar	war
when i pass param v 1.2.4 i can download the specific version of war if i want latest version i found that v latest will return latest version of jar war file in the repo

14165784
jar	war
also if latest jar is snapshot other then release jar war v latest only support release version

14165807
for-loop	arrays
you delete your arrays in the for-loop in each iteration

14165846
width	height
in the large player page set the vid with larger width and height perimeters

14165893
for-loop	while-loop
i want to ask whether it is possible to use for-loop or while-loop together with splinter and lettuce bbd test

14165928
google-chrome	firefox
this code works fine for internet explorer firefox and google-chrome

14165934
cobertura	jenkins
i have installed the jenkins for cobertura and i m now trying to get the junit running to work with cobertura to properly instrument the classes and generate the coverage file

14165937
put	get
in practice if the type you want is nsstringpboardtype you will get away with it with every version of os x so far with probably every program in the universe because it just doesn t make sense to put text on the clipboard and not make it available in that format

14165982
rss	feed
i followed a simple tutorial to read rss feed from a given url into a listview

14165982
rss	feed
i have added the internet permission and the code is error free in eclipse but it will not show any rss feed when launched on a device or emulator

14165982
rss	feed
i can t make the code anymore simpler and the feed i am using is stable feed from www.nba.com though i have tested it on several rss feed and with still no feed showing

14166018
cobertura	jenkins
the jenkins cobertura plugin merely processes and displays your code coverage results

14166075
folder	directory
remove your saved svn infos login etc. from netbeans folder in your user profile directory make a backup before

14166105
google-chrome	firefox
this code works in firefox and ie but not in google-chrome

14166154
pop-up	dialog
i m trying to click ok on the dialog that pop-up

14166154
pop-up	dialog
none of them seem to find the dialog window that pop-up

14166161
django-haystack	sphinx
could you explain how search engines like sphinx django-haystack etc fit in to a web framework

14166206
getter	setter
we need to do this because apparently calling any setter will also eventually call the field s getter as well resulting in us applying too many timezone translations

14166361
put	get
however you can simply get the string as a parameter and put it into a list

14166367
rsa	aes
i m trying to encrypt a file with aes cbc the key must be random and encrypted with rsa

14166372
keystore	jks
my only thought would be to implement your own provider that could either proxy keyfactory request to a bouncycastle provider and the rest to another one that knows about jks or proxy all requests to bouncycastle with the exception of the keystore request

14166410
rsa	aes
you can not use a rsa key with a aes cipher.

14166412
width	height
what i want is to have a div with a height of 410px and a width of 756px to be centered on the screen

14166412
post	put
for example maybe i want to put a login page in there or a blog post or anything

14166467
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
one other thing to note is that this only seem to be an issue with ie9 when i test the site in firefox google-chrome or safari things work as expected

14166489
int	boolean
you d have to pad the result yourself if the strings are of different length and optionally convert the array of boolean values to a list of int if that is required

14166493
width	height
hello i am making a jigsaw puzzle application and for that i have 16 made smaller bitmaps out of a large scaled bitmap with height width 240

14166509
hash	md5
i would calculate a hash of the filename on insertion md5 and then sort using that

14166512
children	parent
so while there is no protocol for a child informing the parent there is however a published api by which parent controllers inform children that they have been moved removed

14166537
ord	chr
additionally you may consider using chr and ord in your code

14166562
.htaccess	httpd.conf
as explained in documentation this directive may only be set per directory scope which means via .htaccess httpd.conf or .user.ini since php 5.3

14166589
for-loop	arrays
then iterate over that arrays with a for-loop

14166591
bower	npm
i have a node angular project that uses npm for backend dependency management and bower for frontend dependency management

14166591
bower	npm
i also tried to use the bower and npm apis but couldn t make that work either.

14166650
min	max
now that you have found your relevant rect get two other random values with the bounds being the min and max of x for the first value and y for the second value coordinates of your determined rectangle those rectangles were saved after the user drew those blobs rectangles in the first place

14166684
client-side	server-side
this is intended to be used to include and process a server-side script before the main file not necessarily for prepending client-side content script

14166702
centos	linux
i am trying to setup gitlist on centos linux with gitolite in case that matters -- i have relaxed the permissions on the repo directories managed by gitolite

14166716
scipy	pysal
this can be done very easily with pysal which using scipy s kdtree under the hood

14166718
integer	unsigned
â 3.9.1 4 unsigned integers declared unsigned shall obey the laws of arithmetic modulo 2 n where n is the number of bits in the value representation of that particular size of integer

14166753
put	get
i realize that this isn t strictly a programming question but it s extremely difficult to put together phrase that will get even a few sensible search results

14166798
prepare	execute
there s no theoretical reason why prepare execute should be slower and tired of the constant criticisms the mysql pdo php developers have worked extra hard to make them faster in an attempt to get us all to shut up

14166798
prepare	execute
but it s just as often noted that there s a performance penalty if the statement has to be prepare each time it s execute

14166811
prepare	pdostatement
if you create a pdostatement object through pdo prepare or pdo query and invoke an error on the statement handle pdo errorinfo will not reflect the error from the statement handle

14166826
portrait	landscape
i only have portrait view so i don t need any code for landscape

14166846
multiplying	add
then multiplying the vector by 2 and add it to the position of the player and that gives you a point on the other side of the obstacle assuming it is a rectangle

14166852
width	height
if you re already able to correctly stack and position your images my guess would be to try setting the css property overflow hidden on your containing div and to define a specific width and height for the div

14166895
stdout	stderr
you can get the stdout stderr the real status code better error handling etc

14166911
rss	feed
the error looks like it s getting an rss feed instead of some other format

14166911
rss	feed
your url has rssall in it so it makes sense that you re getting an rss feed

14166915
switching	screens
one of them has scroll when i switching between them the navbar movees a bit because in the screens pop out the scroll

14166948
uilabel	uibutton
i tried doing uibutton s initwithcustomview on the uiview with uilabel but crashes

14166950
concurrenthashmap	blockingqueue
as msandiford commented use the lock-free concurrenthashmap and a blockingqueue

14166969
width	height
i am trying to set the height and width of images but no value of height and width is changing the image size

14166997
jerkson	jackson
the jerkson project wraps jackson but appears to be abandoned

14166997
serializable	deserialization
i ve switched to jackson s scala module for serializable and deserialization to native scala data structures

14166998
nsurl	nsstring
streamurl is an nsstring - not a nsurl

14167010
rss	feed
i ve got a file with the rss feed from a website and i d like to know if i had some sort of way to properly display that in my jeditorpane

14167013
google-chrome	firefox
can you suggest any tools apart from the google-chrome dev tools a lot of the tools mentioned on google for firefox are not compatible with the latest version eg leak monitor for firefox

14167028
width	height
that s the same case for each site with centered fixed width content with pages of different height depending on resolutions of individual visitors 1024x600 vs

14167041
google-chrome	firefox
tested in firefox and google-chrome

14167042
width	height
you may want to set a width and a height to it

14167055
melt	reshape
input table after transformed with the melt function in the package reshape

14167070
opera	firefox
i m doing a website for a client and for some strange reason when loading the page in ie firefox opera the stylesheet doesn t load properly

14167070
google-chrome	safari
when loading the site in webkit google-chrome safari mobile google-chrome mobile safari the page loads fine

14167072
accessor	properties
i really prefer reading properties files to a list of properties accessor

14167088
glut	lwjgl
i am using lwjgl so i cant use any glut functions like glutpassivemotionfunc

14167090
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i ve generated a ics-file via my php script which allows me to download a .ics-file in safari 6.0.2 but in google-chrome 23.0.1271.101 and firefox 17.0.1 i get an error message

14167098
prepare	execute
for the equal results between query prepare - i have only one idea - pdo uses prepare execute for all queries even those without bindings

14167111
pull	push
once it is hooked up azure will pull and deploy each time you push a commit to the master branch in the repository

14167199
post	get
this blog post steps through using some luke features perhaps it will help you get going with it

14167222
google-chrome	firefox
it displays well in firefox and google-chrome but the table gets stick on the left edge of the internet explorer 9 but it should be on the right

14167228
onmouseover	onclick
i do this because for some reason when the link open from the mainpage none of the functions work when attached to a onclick or onmouseover button

14167252
rss	feed
it might be easiest to create a class to represent individual entries in the rss feed

14167258
bash	zsh
i assume your shell is bash zsh ksh

14167265
affinity	processors
i can handle processors affinity in gcc using the gomp_cpu_affinity variable

14167277
width	height
just resize the width of the window and you ll notice the height of the containers do not update

14167280
debian	linux
if i go to the server debian 6 32bit on linode linux 3.5.2-linode45 and run bundle exec gem install libv8 -v 3.11.8.9 it fails with

14167303
listview	gridview
i feel like your itemssource should be set on your gridview an not on your listview

14167339
range	minimum
i tried to use a macro to set the maximum and minimum to range but excel 2010 didnt seem to allow that

14167351
children	parent	width	height
this will even take care of many elements that are the children of the same parent even if they break row a ul containing 100 li elements when only 10 fit on one row or when the li width is static but the page width is not on resize they ll clear onto new lines when the window is shrunk or float back to the one above if expanding the width then their height will fix to suit the tallest per pseudo row

14167354
capistrano	bundler
i am pretty sure bundler capistrano will install all of the

14167354
capistrano	bundler
since gem isolation is present by default when using bundler capistrano there s no reason to put your environments in separate gemsets

14167419
width	margin
find the element you want to center set a width and set margin 0 auto on it

14167478
hide	show
after you show the li s you want to search the list of show ones and hide any children that do not meet the contains selector criteria

14167513
alertdialog	datepickerdialog
there are four types of android dialog boxes based on the class types as alertdialog progress dialog datepickerdialog timepickerdialog

14167536
dbcontext	objectcontext
where efcontextprovider used to create the t your objectcontext dbcontext as follows

14167574
cos	sin
i have no ready-made algorithm for you but you could use a pre-computed sin or cos table and match the data range to the display size in order to work with integers

14167595
put	get
to get rid of it put the network code in an asynctask

14167630
width	height
i then assign width and height to it as my main object moves

14167640
for-loop	loops
what this does is create a new function for each execution of loops and each time the function has it s own reference to i - instead of looking back to the for-loop s definition value of i it has it s own local parameter to refer to

14167644
google-chrome	firefox
it appears correctly on firefox and google-chrome on the desktop and google-chrome on my nexus7

14167661
width	height
if the image is placed at the left of your screen or exactly in the center width or height or at the right side of the screen you can calculate its leftx rightx etc.

14167661
width	height
now you have an example of calculating the width and height of the image and it s position.

14167662
folder	directory
since the downloaded files are of the process directory i created folder in order to have the correct path

14167675
getter	setter
we could somehow signal that for a objects the c attribute is really equivalent to b.c for getter setter and deleter if we like

14167693
children	parent
parent has many children

14167704
multiplying	add
it does just one multiplying and one add per character in the string

14167705
getter	setter
there s the decorator syntax for creating properties then there are full blown custom-defined descriptors but since the setter getter pseudo-private pattern is actively discouraged in python and the python community there isn t really a widely distributed or commonly used way to do what you are looking for

14167715
hash	salt
in addition to the hash it s common for a password field to contain the salt needed to reconstruct it as well

14167720
uiview	subviews
you could as well make sure that this new uiview is the first subviews of the most underlying view object

14167747
for-loop	loops
that means that the value of i will be the value at the end of your loops not what you want it to be from the middle of your for-loop

14167780
portrait	landscape
i am currently working on an app that will work in both a landscape and portrait layout

14167780
portrait	landscape
i am having some trouble dealing with rotating the ads when the orientation changes from portrait to landscape

14167780
hide	show
and show hide each depending on the orientation but that sounded stupid when i thought about it

14167816
hide	show
it s generally better to use .show and hide instead of using .css directly unless you have some reason to do so the default display of the element is different than what you want it to be when it s show

14167844
jlabel	jtextpane
i want to put my stopwatch to jtextpane in jpanel but it doesn t appear i don t know if i can put objetct from class extends jlabel in class extends jpanel

14167865
for-loop	loops
your while loops can access invalid data here as you are incrementing again after your previous check in the for-loop as well as for every skipped letter

viewdidappear	viewwillappear
i have also tried to add this in a viewwillappear and viewdidappear without success

14167903
datediff	difference
datediff returns the difference in days divide it by 30 to get it in 30-day periods and feed it all to floor to round it to an integer

14167903
postgresql	mysql
however mysql doesn t have anything like postgresql s generate_series so you d have to deal with it in your application or try this clever hack

14167947
int	double
let s say i have a function in c++ that can return either a pointer to either an int string or double

14167949
hide	show
if you show and hide the actionbar multiple times maybe you have noticed that the first showing is not animated

14167949
hide	show
in a way we let the actionbar be show but then hide it immediately

14167957
portrait	landscape
i have the user put the device in a flat position landscape position and then portrait position and when the user puts the device in those positions at the appropriate time the app emits a sound to confirm the position

14167986
rss	feed
below code works to pull data from an rss feed using php curl however i can t seem to figure out how to get the image url from the description variable

14167998
post	get
this is strange as i can make a post request not a get

14168036
getter	setter
in general there shouldn t be a performance difference if the getter and setter are defined inline within the class

14168051
switching	screens
i want to achieve a carousel like effect switching pages and was thinking about using something like bootstrap or ink and use the provided layout so that i can have each column to behave as a different screens

14168059
onresume	onpause
i just added the appropriate code to unbind onpause and ondestroy and bind again onresume

14168065
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i tried viewwillappear and it was the same as viewdidload

14168086
nswindow	nsbox
i ve been trying to understand the docs for nswindow nsview nsbox nscollection in order to make the best choice for my project but i think i m missing some things

14168086
move	drag
with the nsbox locations are flexible and i see that i can drag the box and move the whole group if i ever have to

14168099
int	boolean
this boolean is getting cast into an int as this is the return type of the function

14168099
int	boolean
this is probably a trivial example but i would suggest that if the function test is truly a boolean then it should return bool type and not an int

14168134
filesystems	fat
in a fat filesystems there is a file allocation table near the beginning of the drive that maps hard drive addresses to files

14168289
hide	show
when i hide the div containing the ol and show it back the numbers get updated and show the correct values

14168354
for-loop	arrays
if each of the mc s is different then either you create a mc class for each of them giving them a name which end up in a ascending number then using a for-loop you put them in an arrays like so

14168374
rss	feed
i m trying to pull data from the fever public api to get a list of subscribed rss feed

14168376
google-chrome	firefox
i couldn t really replace selenium so i took a wild guess and replaced firefox with google-chrome to run my test

14168386
ssl	https
what you ve described as solution called using client certificates for https communication or mutual ssl - server presents its certificate with domain and client presents certificate somehow identifying itself

14168391
width	height
when defining all sides on position absolute in some wrapper with height and width

14168391
margin	height	width	margin	width	height
it somehow behaves as a stretched container filling up the relative wrapper with in this case a margin of 25px on left and right side also allowing overflow auto when the inner content exceeds height or width more information on this little css hack

14168427
pull	push
fetch them git remote update see pull push from multiple remote locations

14168470
memcpy	strncpy
the peripheral name alwasy starts in the same column - but can have different lengths so i suppose i could use memcpy or strncpy and use strchr ot get the position of the space

14168526
versioning	upgrade
if you do install express as part of vs2010 you can always perform the upgrade both edition and versioning from sql server 2008 express to sql server 2012 bi edition

14168541
namedtuple	dictionary
for read-only data namedtuple is a good choice you can access value by field name and it s more memory-efficient than a dictionary

14168544
for-loop	arrays
so the for-loop will never end continuing on to i 5+ which throws an error because your arrays is not that big

14168572
int	chars
use int to read int not chars

14168577
udp	tcp
the programs return a large chunk of text that i only assume is standard format for tcp udp data

14168602
freemarker	velocity
if you re just doing a web interface you probably need to have a good idea how servlets work but then move very quickly to a templating language like jsp which is closely tied to the servlet model or maybe something like freemarker or velocity

14168607
button	checkbox
here the button name is y and lbox is the listbox where i have added checkbox dynamically.the button y is also added through dynamically to the listbox

14168617
hex	binary
i know wireshark will parse the packets so you can easily tell apart the different parts of the packet and can switch between hex binary and text representations of the data but those don t help if the data isn t meant to be easily readable

14168653
width	height
i am doing some calculations and drawing based on the width height of my jpanel 640x480 but when i output the actual position of my mouse i notice that it has actual bounds of 622x441

14168699
ng-switch	ng-include
i try to not use this inside of a function defined on scope as it becomes confusing which scope is being affected especially considering that ng-repeat ng-include ng-switch and directives can all create their own child scopes

14168731
folder	directory
i want to create a folder in its home directory

14168740
width	height
one way to compensate for the lost mouse area would be to add the difference to the initial size so when you create the jpanel instead of setting the width and height to 640x480 make it 638x519

14168792
button	checkbox
note menu items in the icon menu from the options menu cannot display a checkbox or radio button

14168802

14168844
cloudant	couchdb
the cto of cloudant told me they have already merged quite a bit of code into the apache couchdb project

14168873
width	height
but i am specifying height and width in dp for xml of row for implementing that

14168873
width	height
sine i am specifying height width each row is not fitting exactly the screen and also not for all type of screen resolution

14168879
oncreate	onstart
in your code you check if the service is bound and call the send data method in oncreate but don t bind to the service until onstart so your first block of code will never trigger since you are never bound at that point

14168881
put	get
now put break points on each and every method and debug it to get the exact point where you application is getting crashed and then you will be able to find the solution

14168903
width	height
note if you use pack make sure to set the jpanel s preferred size by using panel.setpreferredsize width height

14168938
width	height
the code replaces the padding and max height coding of this answer and replaces it with the actual width and height of the displayed image using getwidth and getheight

14168938
width	height
and uses the screen width and height to calculate its position

14168988
folder	directory
although you should put your files in the xampp directory and not the htdocs directory so your files should be c xampp tssapp public this would stop people from visiting htdocs which is a public folder and getting access to your application

14168998
maven	m2e
use eclipse maven integration m2e

14169037
int	chars
and i made the most conservative assumptions about the size of chars and int for your compiler settings they may quite possibly be higher

14169049
clutter	gjs
if we could use the library with clutter and gjs it would really attract developers due the easy of use of st and shell libraries

14169062
temp	tmp
you could move the files to a temp folder then erase the folder make a new fand move the folder with the name of the old one and move the fotos back erase tmp folder

14169123
google-chrome	firefox
i run the code in google-chrome or firefox when the exception happens the line number of exception occur

14169130
pull	push
basically i have a bare repository created with git init --bare which is shared on network so that other developers could also push to it so that we have our projects versioned locally but not sure which command should i run amongst above three or if there is some other to track that central repo eg we push our changes from all projets to that central bare repo and pull fetch from it too

14169143
google-chrome	firefox
temporary comment out the try and catch then step through with the google-chrome or firefox javascript debugging tools

14169173
hash	hmac
indeed a hash algorithm is exactly what you need for hmac

14169178

put	get
when i try to insert record in child table and when i put id which not exist in parent table in foreign key column then also that row get inserted

14169214
g++	gcc
you can disassemble it using -s flag with gcc g++

14169244
squash	branch
personally my approach is similar to your with a few more branch and some squash of commits when they go back to master

14169317
min	max
the byte version makes a bit of sense returning what looks like a normalized depending on min and max decibel values intensity spectrum with 0 being no component of the audio at a specific frequency bin and 255 being the max

14169317
minimum	max
-891 shows up corresponding to silence so it s somehow the minimum value while i m guessing 0 is equivalent to the max value

14169325
debian	linux
i have a sbc small board computer to be precise it is ts-7500 running debian linux 2.6.24 and a couple of c programs running inside it

14169378
gridbaglayout	boxlayout
boxlayout or gridbaglayout

14169434
ubuntu	debian
this error only showing on live server it is working fine on localhost and also working on apache 2.2.22 ubuntu but not on apache 2.2.16 debian

14169437
updatepanel	scriptmanager
so in order to use the updatepanel or any other ajax controls we must have to use the scriptmanager control at the beginning

14169451
coalesce	isnull
using isnull instead of coalesce as i believe it will be very slightly faster

14169451
coalesce	isnull
regarding isnull vs coalesce -

14169515
int	chars
the exception says that there s a mismatch in the data types while dealing with the field values for example assigning chars to int

14169518
memset	malloc	memset	calloc	calloc	malloc
but at larger sizes f zeros m n starts to use malloc + memset while g zeros m 0 zeros 0 n keeps using calloc

14169519
implements	extends
it defined a new class with no name that extends or implements the named class or interface and includes the overriden method s in the new class definition

14169541
updatepanel	scriptmanager
the asp.net ajax updatepanel updateprogress and timer controls require a scriptmanager control to support partial-page rendering

14169586
int	double
but sine_ptr is double and trying to show it as int is undefined

14169591
multiplying	add
that is you can add two bits together by xor-ing them together and you can multiplying two bits together by anding them

14169591
addition	multiplication
it turns out that the behavior of xor and and matches many properties of normal multiplication and addition - multiplication and addition are commutative and associative and multiplication distributes over addition for example

14169593
mp3	ogg
i suggest using node-lame to decode the mp3 stream to raw pcm data then encode that stream into an ogg stream using node-ogg and then serve that to the clients

14169632
folder	directory
however my directory is in the desktop c folder so i should not have to type the full path yet when i type

14169646
post	get
the servlet functions with url get and jquery post but i can t sort the headers out in my arduino code

14169654
datediff	difference
you should select start date time 2011-01-01 in this example and then use datediff function to get time difference in hours between start date and createon

14169686
width	height
how much ever width height you want

14169704
soundpool	audiotrack
try using soundpool instead of audiotrack

14169719
mouse	keyboard
i m new to c++ programming and am trying to make a small reporting tool that will detect when the mouse and keyboard haven t been touched over a period of time

14169719
mouse	keyboard
when i booted in to windows today i was unable to move the mouse or input anything with the keyboard

14169722
width	height
i don t need that blank white space so if the width is resized i need the height to automatically resize just like that image

14169780
removeclass	fadeout	addclass	removeclass	fadein	fadeout	fadein	removeclass	fadein	addclass
to shorten your js you can use fadein and fadeout for the fades addclass and removeclass for class management and you only need one click event listener as you can assign it to all the links

14169791
fadein	fadeout
try using the jquery fadeout and fadein functions and to find the elements that do not have the events class use a css not selector not .events

14169823
width	height
the div will automatically adjust its width and height

14169828
folder	directory
additionally there is no current directory under my application folder

14169848
width	height
when i get the width and height of the bufferedimage the values are correct

14169875
ratingbar	textview
i have a problem with a listview that i made that has a ratingbar and a textview element.its a very simple program that is meant to displays the list and stores the value of the stars that the user enters into the ratingbar

14169906
min	max
the y variable is of size 1x91 double min 240 and max 240

14169968
min	max
example if you want to return a value from 1 2 3 4 5 you should chose min 1 and max 5

14170012
versioning	upgrade
even if it happens to be the case for a particular program and a particular versioning of gcc it could well change when for example you upgrade your compiler

14170078
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the following code submits correctly in ie safari google-chrome on mac and windows firefox in mac but in firefox 17.01 on windows 7 the submitform function is never called

14170127
cpu	affinity
whether cpu affinity is going to help by localizing the threads to a subset of cores thus minimizing cache sharing misses

14170210
bmp	png
when using request library for scraping i can save pics png bmp etc

14170223
margin	height	box-sizing	margin	width	margin	width	height
this states that whatever padding border margin you add to you element does count outside it so for example the element is of 200px width and 100px height if you add padding say 5px than the width and height will be 205px and 105px respectively so inorder to workaround with this you need to use css3 box-sizing property but as still it is css3 property and if ie is the main thing you want to supprt i suggest you to resize the elements according to your needs

14170253
textview	imageview
the layout of the adapter consists of an imageview a button a gridview and a couple of textview

14170255
ggplot2	lattice
with ggplot2 lattice also you can combine data sources and subsetting for each layer

14170261
onmouseover	onclick
there s a hack where you can onclick on an item and it would then click on the input type file element which would be invisible using javascript jquery but it didn t work when i changed the item to onmouseover or another event

14170291
int	boolean
int and other javascript primitives like floats and boolean are assigned by value

14170292
jlabel	jlayeredpane
as per your comment i would rather use glasspane and add jlabel to glasspane for this as opposed too jlayeredpane

14170329
hide	show
i have a uilabel that can be tapped by the user to hide or show it set up like this

14170329
hide	show
however if i set the alpha value to 0.0f the label no longer accepts taps so even if the user can hide the label she can t show it anymore

14170341
uitableview	nsindexpath
- uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

14170355
mousemove	mouseleave	mousemove	mouseenter	mouseleave	mouseenter
so mousemove mouseenter mouseleave shakeme pushme smileme .

14170376
pull	push
3 whether we want a push or pull based model

14170398
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i tried executing the program in google-chrome firefox and opera javascript is enabled

14170411
mdpi	hdpi
in hdpi it doesn t shows while in ldpi and mdpi it shows

14170412
hide	show
make the gesture recognizer s action just hide or show the label

14170466
folder	directory
now i will hold my hands up here and say that i m only just getting used to using a shell to execute commands and only just getting used to the files directory folder layouts within a mac so it s completely possible that i ve messed up something simple here

14170514
google-chrome	firefox
so it will play on google-chrome and maybe on idevices but not on firefox etc

14170549
mef	prism
i have deployed my wpf browser application that is using prism with mef on iis 7

14170569
hide	show
toggle show hide on one button

14170575
realloc	calloc
but don t forget you must also wrap around calloc and realloc probably

14170593
post	put
i think this quote is not really about uuids but about using put which is idempotent instead of post

14170616
integer	fractions
format the integer and fractions parts as a string in i n d or i n d format as appropriate

14170640
folder	directory
transfer the image to the localhost htdocs folder then store directory path using varchar datatype not sure if its possible but i have done something similar in asp.net

14170645
public	protected
marking a method as protected instead of private means it is expected to be used by third party code so some sort of contract needs to be defined and tested as happens with normal interfaces defined by public methods which are open both for inheritance and composition

14170647
children	parent
i have some children that need to communicate with the parent separately from the other children

14170652
calloc	malloc
malloc calloc are libc wrappers around the os real call for allocating memory and i have no clue of what that might be on osx and they keep internal buffers to avoid too frequent system calls

14170680
button	checkbox
i have a listview with 1 checkbox and 2 button i set checkbox visible and both button gone

14170683
width	height
you need to scale the image down to consume less memory look at this answer to see how scale it down the proper way also when you need to know the width and the height of image without loading it to memory use this code

14170684
public	protected
the same happens regardless of constructor modifier public protected private or parameters type primitive or reference

14170790
folder	directory
many deployment tools like capistrano which works via ssh copy new files into a new folder then symlink the current directory to the new folder if and when the whole upload and update process is finished

14170807
google-chrome	firefox
tested on both google-chrome and firefox

14170808
inline	inlining
gcc starting with -o2 will inline some functions if their body is available even if they aren t declared inline even more functions are eligible for inlining with -o3

14170827
backtracking	greedy
when placed inside a look-behind however it stops behaving greedy and backtracking the look-behind will look for the smallest possible match which means that 0 characters will be tried with no backtracking

14170857
dropbox	skydrive	box	skydrive
we have implemented code that allow users to transfer files between our web server and their box as well as skydrive dropbox google drive accounts

14170880
affinity	processors
if you use strict affinity then a particular thread must run on that processors or set of processors

14170939
hide	show
if the length of the form elements matches the # of occurences of the default value then we hide the show button

14170977
multiplying	add
first i choose 2 different big prime numbers 5-6 digits should do and multiplying them and add 1

14171009
width	height
however setting the maxwidth property of the infowindow should be a value above 247px so that whenever your content takes more than that width the height would increase

14171054
http	spdy
assuming java i like cometd www.cometd.org as a mechanism for messaging which sits on top of protocols like http websocket or even spdy or whatever new protocol comes down the pike

14171054
google-chrome	firefox	http	spdy
if you are on google-chrome or firefox then you ll get spdy and when http 2.0 lands which is based on spdy you ll be able to update cometd and get that for free

14171087
width	height
where x and y are the x and y position in the raster and w and h stand for width and height

14171116
post	get
now when i post data to the service i get the following exception

14171187
min	max
min or max lookup is what a heap is optimized for o 1 and this is why it is used

14171207
uiview	calayer
the part of the view that i want to render can t be predetermined meaning i can t set up the view hierarchy for the small section to be it s own uiview and therefore calayer

14171207
uiview	calayer
what if i create a category on uiview or calayer that adds a method along the lines of

14171221
width	height
one problem we re probably going to run into is that when we start from the top and do a beziercurveto the bottom of the ellipse with the corners of the rectangle of the same width and height as the control points the ellipses width is going to be smaller than the rectangle

14171221
width	height
put together a visualization where you can play with the width and height and see the drawn ellipse

14171330
post	get
user still send values by post get and they are stored in db

14171334
google-chrome	firefox
both 1 and 2 works fine in the real browsers like firefox or google-chrome through jquery

14171337
width	margin
most likely it is padding or margin on the button element or maybe width

14171363
findwindow	showwindow
for hide console window i m using winapi findwindow showwindow is not problem

14171433
lxml	html5lib	lxml	beautifulsoup	html5lib	beautifulsoup
beautifulsoup can re-use different parser backends including lxml and html5lib the latter python 2 only so it ll give you more flexibility

14171465
pull	push
gitlab is reachable on http i can push pull data via git to the server

14171499
rss	feed
so i can t make rss feed

14171563

i have next to no knowledge of working with flash to play videos except the odd embed in wordpress and i was glad to find video.js to sort all that out for me

14171563
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine on google-chrome firefox and even ie7+8

14171570

create an xml file inside your project s res menu directory not in in res folder

14171618
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in google-chrome ie and firefox

14171698

for button i have kept height ad width as word_wrap

14171723
put	get
i get the tags from req.body and put all of them within an array

14171765
filesystems	ntfs
i am trying to compile my java project form an ubuntu 10.4 installation on an ntfs filesystems of my laptop configured to normally start in win xp

14171807
stringbuilder	stringwriter
you d better use a stringbuilder or stringwriter

14171830
ienumerable	iqueryable
the real benefit is when you are using iqueryable implementations linq-to-sql because for example the where for ienumerable is defined as

14171830
ienumerable	iqueryable
when the iqueryable behaviour is undesireable one can call the asenumerable to force the ienumerable behaviour

14171837
cabal-dev	hackage
1 well part of the mess is because the hackage page doesn t show all dependencies for cabal-dev only those for ghc-pkg-6_8-compat namely base and cabal so it isn t obvious that cabal-dev-0.9.1 doesn t work with ghc-7.6

14171862
folder	directory
i have tried to place my public folder every where in web-inf directory outside but still nothing

14171872
google-chrome	safari
the demo will run in safari and google-chrome only

14171880
post	put
i ve put a simple echo statement in the controller but am getting a console error in the browser - post 404 not found

14171920
setinterval	clearinterval
all i need is to keep the output from setinterval that should be the input for clearinterval

14171926
rss	feed
i m in the process of parsing the rss feed from a tumblr blog onto my website

14171926
rss	feed
where blogurl is the url of the rss feed in question

14171926
rss	feed
all of the code guides and previous questions i ve seen focus on iterating through multiple repeated items in an rss feed which of course makes sense since that s what you re supposed to do with rss feed but i m just trying to confirm the selected feed is the right type of feed that is expected

14171953
post	get
in particular formvalue key string returns get and post parameters

14171969
post	get
2 since the method looks like should receive a post variable and not a get one you need to fetch it the right way

14172031
sorting	grouping
the prefix command bysort does the sorting required and ensures that this is all done separately within the grouping defined by group_id

14172043
put	get
only put that url in your stack unless by some bizarre chance you get yet another 307 back.

14172044
ready	each
ideally the associated url pattern would append each match to a python list ready to be handled in the view

14172072
folder	directory
it seems that some files or directory in this folder is accesed at this time by other thread application or even your code

14172074
free	malloc
therefore you must deal with the memory that you allocate for these arrays manually by calling malloc 1 and free

14172075
client-side	server-side
but note that when you are using javascript it is running on the client-side on the browser and not on the server-side

getter	setter
in my opinion calling getter and setter is slower than direct access to a field

14172664
getter	setter
use private class variables and public getter and setter which will provide you encapsulation

14172667
getter	setter
getter and setter especially the simplest forms will just be inlined by the jit compiler and thus remove the method call overhead

14172684
post	get
see this post to get started

14172742
ssl	https
finally i would say there is one major difference between the two servers the new server has an ssl where the first does not so the new mail connection is going from https to http but i dont know if that would have anything to do with it

14172743
getter	setter
as someone has already pointed out in the comments your object is technically a pojo already however you have specifically asked about getter and setter which are more akin to javabeans

14172743
getter	setter
there are a number of reasons i can think of for using getter and setter

14172743
getter	setter
getter setter methods allow you to change the underlying data type without breaking the public interface of your class which makes it and your application more robust and resilient to changes

14172743
getter	setter
you can set a breakpoint in your getter and setter so that you can debug your code when the values are obtained or changed

14172743
getter	setter
whilst the advantages are clear this does not mean that getter and setter are a silver bullet

14172743
getter	setter
this answer to a very similar question looks at some considerations in detail when designing a class that has getter and setter

14172743
getter	setter
also be careful that you are not just wrapping all of your fields in getter and setter as this is really missing the point of encapsulation

14172743
getter	setter
this answer provides a good summary of the reasons for choosing a pojo over a javabean style object with getter and setter

14172746
realloc	qsort
one about realloc and one about sorting with qsort

14172945
box-sizing	border-box
many browsers still do not support box-sizing border-box so for now it would be better to steer clear of it otherwise you ll have inconsistent results

14172945
box-sizing	border-box
removing the box-sizing border-box and making your container 336px wide will center your images alternatively wrapping the images in an inner container with the following css would also do the trick

14173441
integer	unsigned
the ntohl function converts the unsigned integer netlong from network byte order to host byte order

14173460
integer	unsigned
is a casting to a 32-bit unsigned integer pointer the part and then the preceeding is the dereference operator on that pointer

14173475
subtraction	addition
note the subtraction instead of addition

14173495
integer	unsigned
will turn that into a pointer to an unsinged 32 bit integer the before that will dereference this to get the actual value an unsigned 32bit integer and finally ntohl will convert that into a native 32bit integer for the platform which presumably means that the original storing format is in network order

14173499
hex	binary
if you want to transform binary information like encrypted text to a string use hex or base64 encoding

14173806
calloc	malloc	realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc
there is a vitally important requirement to non- null pointers that you pass to realloc they must themselves come from a call to malloc calloc or realloc otherwise the behavior is undefined

14173806
int	chars
if you allocate a chunk of memory sufficient to store an int and then realloc for a chars you will always get back the same pointer because sizeof chars is less than or equal to the sizeof int

14173821
google-chrome	firefox
the sites display correctly in all versions of ie 7+ and google-chrome and firefox 16 or earlier

14173860

you could pass realloc an int pointer to an allocated space of sizeof chars bytes 1 byte but you d be in danger of invoking undefined behaviour

14173860
free	realloc
there could be exceptions but not for someone asking this question there is no safe way to use that pointer except by passing it to free or realloc

cos itself seems to be consistently a tick 0 01 better than sin but the case distinction to reconstruct the sign has an extra test

14175641

as there is no way to get the views used for the tabs i think you will have to extends the leftnavbarlibrary by implements some methods either to set a view.onfocuschangelistener to the listitemviews the leftnavbar uses a listview for the tabs or to get the listitemviews itself and then set the listener

also just as a note i would use a more rest based syntax if you are using webapi for example use methods get post put ect on your controller rather than named methods

14177362

now that i have shifted to node.js and express i can use the same syntax in the name attribute and i get a nice object fruit in the request objects body property using the bodyparser middelware

14177500
put	get
another option i came up with was to put the email data in the _session array so after submitting the page and the user is on the redirected page it would send an ajax request off to another page which would get the session data and send the email then send a response back to the page the user was on and tell them the email was sent

14177538
versioning	upgrade
i used to just change grails versioning in application.properties file and run grailsw wrapper to upgrade wrapper

serializable	deserialization
the best would be to create both a serializable and deserialization method

14177941
rspec	capybara
rspec capybara can t tell you where it occurred because the test framework only tests what you actually see on the page and that is exactly what you see as you confirmed when you ran save_and_open_page

14177982

f x1 x2 sin x1 cos x2

14178141

the problem is that correctnumber 3 is an integer so you can t get 0.666 or any fractions to multiply by 100 which what i believe is you want

14178160
put	get
edit if you want to put the modules in different places you can easily get it working

14178177

uicollectionview	uitableview
i ve worked with uicollectionview and uitableview but i ve never worked with uiscrollview before which is what i think i should be using to display a potentially long vertical list of user comments from an array

14178567
uicollectionview	uitableview
if you are using an array of comments it sounds logical to use a uitableview or uicollectionview as otherwise you would need to manager view creation and release by yourself

your controllersln has string attributes which are called str1 and str2.also their getter and setter must be created by eclipse automaticly

14178650
portrait	landscape
here is the situation - my client has a pdf document in two versions portrait and landscape layout

14178663
getter	setter
since the syntax defines a closure as a property groovy adds a getter and setter getfoo and setfoo so the closures are discovered by finding properties and calling the getter to check if the return type is a closure

depending on the width height of your button you may also dig into the css style defaults for the grids to ensure that the grid pager area has enough room to display this larger buttons

14179030
cloudant	couchbase	cloudant	couchdb	couchbase	couchdb
we ended up going with bigcouch in the cloud a fork of couchdb from cloudant that is stable and then for the time being we re using couchbase mobile

14179030
couchbase	couchdb
so we re going with bigcouch in the cloud instead of regular couchdb for clustering support and then couchbase mobile on the mobile devices

14179056
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
safari google-chrome opera and firefox do support it with the prefix however but note that the prefix -moz- for firefox -webkit- for webkit-based browsers like google-chrome and safari and -o- for opera is mandatory for the code to function or to be recognized at all

14179070
width	height
i m trying to use css to set the width and height of a td

14179070
width	height
the height works fine the width is ignored

14179113
scheme	prolog
swi-prolog has a built in html generation scheme that s based on the slightly different idea of defining the dom for the document as a prolog data structure and generating the html from that you can insert chunks of html if you have them already

14179119
getter	setter	defineproperty	getter	defineproperty	setter
you could always wrap o with your own setter getter if the defineproperty doesn t do the job for you

if i drag the scroll bar up and down then the cursor will not move but the view of the emacs will change according to the scroll bar pos

14179166
width	height
layout must take all available height width navigation and content columns take all available space and scroll on overflow footer should stick to bottom

14179170
oncreate	ondestroy
well lets say that i have a service that plays your music like google music my service works perfectly but if the user exit the app pressing back button or removing it from recents my service call ondestroy wait 5secs and calls oncreate again

14179241
width	margin
then you set a background to the #wrapper and give a width and margin 0 auto to #content to center it

14179276
post	get
look at the get post codex

14179293
post	get
i ve dealt with api s before and know how to submit and parse results but the other api s provided simple post get examples in their documentation thus opening it up to almost every situation regardless of language or platform

14179293
post	get
as i m wanting to try and keep things as cross-platform as possible to potentially compile an os x version at a future date and feel confident in dealing with post and get already how would i go about translating this curl command into something i could use with indy for example

14179309
keydown	keyup
i then added a keyup and keydown event handler these will keep track of what keys are currently being pushed by using an array

14179350
getter	setter
to improve the readability of my code i have been generating core data classes for my entities so i can access them using getter and setter i personally use the dot notation rather than setvalue forkey

14179382
folder	directory
i googled for libpath and went to linker general additional library directory and added the folder containing dlllibname.dll and it still wouldn t work

14179451
onclick	onchange
it would appear that the correct implementation should use onchange instead of onclick for the checkbox

14179486
folder	directory
copy the file jquery-1.8.3.min.js you just downloaded somewhere into your web project directory folder

14179487
implements	extends
the google+ starter project implements the oauth flow first by extends abstractauthorizationcodeservlet in com.google.api.sample.oauth2authorizationcodeservlet

post	get
in fact the only image size options i get when i try to add media to a post are thumbnail 100x100 and full size 3260x988

14179569
width	height
from my research it doesn t appear that dynamic width height re-sizing of child elements relative to the parent in order to maintain maximum visibility of child elements is possible without some javascript

14179569
width	height
that s assuming the parent width and height are not dynamic of course

14179593
for-loop	arrays
then go through the resulting arrays using a for-loop doing the following if the word is not contained in the set of keys of a dictionary add it to the dictionary storing its count in this case 1

14179604
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
mogelbrod i used your code above and it worked perfectly on google-chrome tried it on firefox and safari did not work

14179604
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
tested on google-chrome win mac safari win mac firefox win and ie8

14179604
firefox	safari
by the way the issue of the span.click event i encountered on firefox and safari could be solved by using the triggerhtmlevent function above i haven t tried it though

14179612
rar	zip
as determined from the comments is_zipfile is returning false because the file really isn t a zip fileâ it s a rar file in disguise

14179612
rar	zip
winrar is able to deal with both zip and rar files so it can open the file regardless of its actual extension but programs that only deal in zip files can t open it

14179613
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
i m deploying an app to amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk using the api

14179625
children	parent
now the last piece you probably need to know is that i have a touchcontroller protocol set up that can have touchdelegates set up in all the children that point to the parent so that any touches that they receive get forwarded to the container vc and they are all forwarding properly so that s not it and the animations wouldn t work at all if that was the case .

14179659
inherited	subclassing
this also makes the inherited easier because you don t need to call a constructor on it in your subclassing

14179666
nodejitsu	heroku
in short set up your app as if you were going to deploy on heroku or nodejitsu

14179671
accessor	properties
i m attempting to set a private field of an array of ints from outside the class through a public properties accessor

this is work fine in ubuntu but unfortunately it is not work in centos the problem is that the terminal window closed immediately

14179721
next	except
the algorithm itself though does not care what game you are playing except that you need to be able to determine what the next positions are in the game and you need to be able to tell if the current position is a victory position

14179742
margin	height
also there is an inconsistent delay between the resetting of the border background and the start of the animation that resets the top margin and the height of .step

14179756
int	chars
this approach needlessly avoids casting a string to int or float and then failing by using a simple check for the first chars

14179769
submit	submission
the type of the tag is submit so submission its containing form is its default behavior

14179769
firefox	safari
on the other hand i wrote a tiny php script below and tried it out with both firefox and safari at the moment my only conveniently available browsers and it only writes a single log entry per click on the button

14179769
firefox	safari
at least in the cases of firefox safari and ie their implementers foresaw the possibility that both an event and a method call might compete to submit the same form and took steps albeit different ones -- pretty much running the gamut to ensure that only one of them would succeed

14179784
hash	md5
self.h.md5 outputs md5 hash in hex format and is 32byte

14179824
post	get
your code is vulnerable to sql injection you need to escape all get and post and the better approach will be using prepared statement

14179844
portrait	landscape
each time the device changes position a new test is performed for a total of three tests flat landscape and portrait tests

14179907
fadein	fadeout
however fadein and fadeout are a good solution for what you re doing

14184752

the ivar that is used for a properties which is gotten and set by the automatically synthesized properties accessor methods is named the ivar s name is the properties s name prefixed with an underscore

14184752
accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
however almost always--if it wasn t your code is ambiguous your intent was for your ivar delegate to be the thing that your properties s accessor would get and set

14184752
accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
if instead you would prefer that your properties s accessor set and get your ivar delegate you can add an synthesize directive to your class implementation to tell the compiler to do just this

14184752
accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
the line tells the compiler to use the ivar delegate the right hand of the assignment in the accessor for the properties delegate the left hand side of the assignment

14184752
accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
this works because a properties with a manual synthesize which does not explicitly specify the ivar to be gotten and set by its accessor such as synthesize delegate

now when i try to save the newly created myuserdetails entity it says there is transient instances of codemst i am not updating the entity but may be blazeds while it deserializes the newly created myuserdetail it is instantiating the referenced codemst entity with null values this may be causing the issue but same code was working before upgrade

layout_weight decides how the parent element space is divided between it s children

14185556
int	chars

post	get
i ve seen post where some have used row 0 column_name or variations of that but i can t seem to get anything like that working

14185580
base-class	derived-class
a derived class which does not re-implement ifoo.bar could call the base-class implementation via ifoo this .bar but if the derived class re-implements ifoo.bar as it would have to in order to change its behavior the aforementioned call would go to the derived-class re-implementation rather than the base-class implementation

14185627
octal	hex
your fundamental problem is that r will signal an error condition as soon as it sees a single back-slash before any character other than a few lower-case letters backslashes themselves quotes or some conventions for entering octal hex or unicode sequences

14185637
implements	extends
i suggest that it extends jcomponent implements paintcomponent and be added using a layoutmanager etc

filesystems	fat
the fat filesystems however does not keep the lines so clear cut

14185638
filesystems	fat
the file allocation table fat itself blurs the lines of the file meta-data and filesystems meta-data

14185638
filesystems	fat
that is the fat entries identify both the cluster number of the where the next cluster of file or directory data can be found as well as indicating to the filesystems whether the cluster identified by the index into the fat is available or not

qunit	sinon
i think the problem has to do with sinon restoring the method at the end of the test function even though qunit is still waiting for start to indicate the test is complete

14186368
uiview	subviews
you re trying to add a subviews to something that isn t a uiview - in your display method s context self refers to an object of type fraction

14186368
inherited	properties
if fraction doesn t have a uiview properties called view and doesn t inherited from one that does such as uiviewcontroller there is no reason for it to recognise what you re trying to do there

14186414
width	height
as an instance if the width is 320 the adequate height is

14186416
put	get
later on i found that even if i temporarily skirt around these needs and get the midnight function to fire from the timer when i m in the main vc it s not resetting the values such as my uilabel...even though that section of code is firing due to an alert i put there

convert text - column with spaces as a delimiter

14186638
next	except
the function rs232_addcommand is similar to begininvoke except that it doesn t fire the next command until all timer and paint events are done and also makes sure the former rs232 async code has completed

14186678
portrait	landscape
what i m trying to do is displaying a set of images in a grid like fashion but with different sizes as for images in landscape or portrait position this excludes using the nscollectionview because the item prototype s size can only be set once.

14186724
hide	show
toggle the text show and hide and move your backgroundposition y axis

14186778
prepare	execute
why not use prepare statements plus you need to execute you query before you count it

14186799
put	get
but every time i try to use it in even the easiest way i get black box sometimes white - depends on the texture i put him

14186837
centroid	convex
given the location of vertices of a convex polyhedron 3d i need to calculate the centroid and volume of the polyhedron

14186863
hide	show
i know another way that i can achieve the result i want but then i need to write two functions to show and two functions to hide for all the menu options that are supposed to have submenus and it is just messy and ugh

14186869
google-chrome	firefox
now this works absolutely fine in google-chrome but not in firefox

14186883
libstdc++	libc++
libstdc++ seems to work for older builds of opencv libc++ correct for newer builds

14186954
superclass	subclassing
you might well argue that it would make sense to be able to override the base method with a subclassing method which is more general with a parameter which is a superclass of the original parameter type or with a return type which is a subclassing of the original return type but .net doesn t allow either of these anyway

14186967
expression-blend	silverlight
i am using sketchflow c# silverlight expression-blend 4

14187063
google-chrome	firefox
the solution to this problem was to use firefox instead of google-chrome

14187078
textview	imageview
each item in the list contains an imageview two textview a button and one numberpicker widget

14187108
allocator	stl
in code i work on i use explicit destructor call in allocator i have implementation of simple allocator that uses placement new to return memory blocks to stl containers

14187154
hide	show
however as others have expressed a better solution would be to clean up the code a bit and show hide the respective states vs generating them on the fly

14187189
min	max
the variables min and max are relegated to the global closure so that price can be filtered in any event callback

14187233
apache	nginx
however i just got my first internship doing rails and one of my seniors is talking about apache and nginx and i m not sure how they fit in the picture since i thought apps consisted of only rails + cloud app platform

14187240
portrait	landscape
for some reason i keep on getting a green border at the bottom or on the right side depending on whether it s a landscape or portrait photo

14187242
median	max	min	median	min	max
you may also use median mean max min sort etc

14187280
firefox	safari
for internet explorer one could install chrome-frame but i haven t seen something similar for firefox and safari

14187290
min	max
it can drag up and down by dragging the menu text area menu image or some inner div and the div comes down or up with max and min limits as its dragged

14187321
width	height
so my idea is that i should somehow get the grid column width in my image loading class and adjust the imageview height dynamically there to match the width

14187394
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
one way of copying file is reading from fileinputstream and writing same data to fileoutputstream to another directory

14187394
folder	directory
2 a whole directory folder of images lets say from c importimages

14187399

it consists in multiplying the vector to be transformed by a sequence of 1 s and -1 s which is equivalent to the multiplication by exp -j n pi and thus to a shift in the conjugate domain

14187491
free	malloc
the best way to achieve a malloc d which is free d by the draining of the autorelease pool is to add a file which is built without arc using -fno-objc-arc as ughoavgfhw describes in his answer

14187514
passenger	webrick	passenger	unicorn	unicorn	webrick
in production you have your rails server often things like unicorn passenger which takes the place of webrick

14187514
apache	nginx
in a lot of production setups another server such as apache or nginx is also used and is the server that the user connects to when they go to your application

14187514
apache	nginx
for instance requests to static files css images javascript etc that are storted on the server might just be processed directly by apache or nginx since it does a fantastic and fast job of sending static assets back to the client

14187514
apache	nginx	passenger	unicorn	post	get
other requests such as get me a list of all blog post get passed onto the rails server unicorn passenger etc who in turn do the required work and send the response to apache nginx who send it back to the client

14187524
post	get
i can see in the javascript that the plugin is asking browsers to do a post for xmlhttprequest but after looking at my apache logs it appears as though chrome is performing a get for links that do not contain

14187542
put	get
the project i m currently working on uses storyboards and so i don t have the ability to put the scrollview on the workspace and get my size and arrangement right

i already tried iterating over all myviewcontroller s view subviews except the touch tracking uiview and sending them touchesbegan withevent touchesmoved withevent etc

14187622
width	height
resolved with a matrix and the height width of my screen

14187627
super	self
instead of super xpathselector self there should be super cssselector self

14187628
post	get
most likely your express routes only specify get and or post methods

14187628
post	get
this means you ve only defined a route handler for post s to some api method and requests using any other method like get or options will return a 404

14187630
sudo	passwd
i think that your unicorn start command is running as sudo and needing a passwd sudoless passwd isn t setup

14187646
g++	gcc
however in the linking stage xcode always runs gcc on the .o file instead of g++ and becos of this it results in error

14187646
g++	gcc
i don t know how to make xcode to run g++ instead of gcc to link the object file

14187779
stderr	fflush	stdout	stderr	stdout	fflush
the client doesn t fflush it s socket after writing a piece of work command to execute to it because non-default channels not stdin stdout stderr are fully buffered by default for performance reasons

14187783
width	height
while i have a couple shaders in place and i m able to load them without any issues i m thinking that what i need to do is render an invisible quad which conforms to the dimensions width height of the image itself and then pass the pixel data to opengl

14187797
children	parent
the key is the id and all the children s parentid items will be set to the same as the parent s id

it handles schema versioning creation upgrade etc.

14187902
versioning	upgrade
assuming you have postgis versioning 2 available on your system upgrade your datbase and tables

14187953
width	height
given the width canvaswidth and the height canvasheight of the canvas you can calculate position of each node

14187955
integer	unsigned
in a similar thread someone mentioned implementing unsigned integer 32 for java should fix the difference

14188006
superclass	subclassing
when the superclass has only constructors with args you need to explicitly make an call to your superclass s constructor from your subclassing like below

14188068
mp4	h.264
i m trying to create a little android app that plays a http live streaming hls video encoded in h.264 mp4

14188078
integer	unsigned
you see dibs treat a 32 bit unsigned integer als a compound color structure

14188114
inherited	subclassing
there are many classes that inherited datapacket and thus when i receive a json-string from wherever i need to be able to deserialize the subpacket into the correct subclassing

14188121
gif	png
it sounds horrible but it worked out ok for me - my 8 frame 8kb gif turned into 8 png images totaling 11kb and i got the bonus of 8bit transparency so i don t have to worry about the background color

14188121
google-chrome	firefox
it s a bit of a hack job but it works on everything i ve tested on android 2.2 2.3 4.0 ios6 firefox ie google-chrome and if you re only doing it on one ajax loader that you ll then use everywhere it seems ok

width	height
when the view resizes i d like my image view to resize but maintain a 3 2 width height ratio

14188194
return-value-optimization	nrvo
of course strictly the first calls the move constructor but is a prime candidate for some return-value-optimization nrvo action and the third does not so if x is immovable very odd... the third case is legal but the first is not and the first may be more expensive

14188200
laravel	yii
i wouldn t normally jump on an old thread but as it just popped up on google in the first position i would suggest to anyone finding this thread today to look into yii and laravel

14188201
jlist	jtable
send list of available files in a selected folder to client and list those files using jtable or jlist

14188240

opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i see the ads display in every browser but firefox ie google-chrome opera safari

14188325
pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	hash	hash	salt
i totally agree with this concept except that i can t seem to find a way of securely storing a user login in a local cookie or session since the salt + pbkdf2 hash combination is done randomly for each time

14188329
width	height
this explicitly sets the height to 100 and the width to height ratio to 3 2

14188342
int	boolean
the -- will convert the boolean into their int equivalents

14188344
htmlcleaner	jsoup
i have tried a few different variations of these approaches htmlparser plus the java dom parser and jsoup plus jaxen but the combination that worked best is htmlcleaner plus the java dom parser

14188345
hash	salt
the salt of a hash function in general is something that you compute based on a rule

14188345
hash	salt
this way you don t have to store the salt anywhere and the salt for each hash value is different

14188363
keyevent	actionevent
i ve looked at getid tested to see if the actionevent was a keyevent it is not

14188380
x86	64bit
visual studio 2012 seems to always call the 32-bit version of cl.exe located at programfiles x86 microsoft visual studio 11.0 vc bin x86_amd64 instead of the 64bit one located at programfiles x86 microsoft visual studio 11.0 vc bin amd64

14188391
next	except
making this true in practice would require modifying quickhull s recursion algorithm so while the next vertex is always calculated except for after the last vertex is added or no points remain for that section vertices are actually added to the convex hull in the order that maximizes the increase to the polyhedrons volume likely by order of most distant to least distant

14188391
centroid	convex
you could also look at the various approximate convex hull algorithms but the method i outlined above should work well for volume centroid approximation with ability to determine error

14188413
post	get
it seems you may have to modify will_paginate source code to get the page index to work like you intended to see this so post

14188450
nsurlconnection	nsjsonserialization
here is a great start for using nsurlconnection and then you should look up nsjsonserialization or xml parsing to handle the data

14188455
interpolation	splines
though you may lose some precision i feel like it should be possible to use cubic splines interpolation to estimate the curve between each point

14188455
interpolation	splines
splines interpolation

14188483
post	get
now you can just do a get request on 631951716 feed which will help you get the post of that user which of course you can see as a non friend

14188496
flask	django
you can use getlist which is similar to django s getlist but for some reason isn t mentioned in the flask documentation

14188561
capistrano	bundler
i m using capistrano and bundler and don t have write access to usr local.

14188577
background-repeat	background-size
in that case you may want to set background-size cover and background-repeat no-repeat so the entire image fills the whole scree without repeating

14188581
post	get
uploading images should be done via a post request and not a get request like you have done

14188581
post	get
so you could change the request to post and let people know what error messages you get

14188587
margin	height
i expect the 434 difference between the 270 subview height and 704 to be balanced between the top and bottom margin

14188588
background-image	background-color
set background-image to none and background-color to whatever color you want

14188592
portrait	landscape
when the app launches it displays in portrait mode and when - after flipping through some of the pages say to june - you change the rotation it reloads in landscape mode showing two pages but starting with january

14188602
aim	instant
i think that you can manage it when you reimplement done wizard method just in the instant when you will save your forms data to the database depends of your final aim but if you are usind a wizard likely you are seeking that the data be saved at the end of the wizard

14188609
put	get	width	height
alright so i need help on how to put html elements specifically and in a certain order and place so even if say canvas 2 s width or height get changed it still stays in the same layer order and to keep all of these elements in the same place on a html document div 1 over canvas 2 over canvas 3 over div 4 over div 5 over div 6 etc.

14188632
put	get
if you put an addeventlistener command you need to add a removeeventlistener command so you don t get a 1009 error

14188642
google-chrome	safari
ie tends to get all the bad press but what about version 1 of google-chrome or version 3 of safari etc.

14188663
serializable	deserialization
the only way i can think off the top of my head is to make two dummy objects for deserialization serializable purposes only

14188665
hash	salt
the reason you want to hash your user s password with random salt is not to secure the logon process but to secure your password table

14188665
hash	salt
if an attacker steals your password table and each password is not hash with unique salt it will be easy for him her to figure out many of the passwords

14188665
hash	salt
always hash your user s password with a unique salt

14188665
hash	salt
it s fine to store this salt with the hash password

14188665
hash	salt
hash the session s id with the salt

14188683
hash	salt
hash is stored on server as part of user authentication when the plaintext password is sent to the server the computed salt per user is stored in a secure database and added to the password and the crypto result computed based on password + hash

14188692
versioning	upgrade
however the earlier versioning of beanshell may have been doing some implicit conversion to an empty string that somehow is broken after upgrade

14188727
udp	tcp
the application has the job of drawing a graphical scene to a window on a form in real-time based on data it receives over various udp and tcp sockets

14188727
udp	tcp
each udp and tcp connection uses its own thread these threads each modify various objects in memory which in turn modify the graphical display

14188752
post	put
my form is setup to use a post method but is using put automatically

14188768

once it has forked all the children and heard hello back from each it proceeds to wait for all of them to say ready

14188773
joptionpane	jspinner
so if the jspinner allowed values 1-50 and i had increased the jspinner from 20 to 21 it goes all the way to 50 while the joptionpane is open

14188795
public	protected
perhaps instead put the inner class in the protected section and make its interfaces public

14188803
width	height
to do that perform a morphological closing with a 7x7 square about 1 of the minimum between the width and the height of the input image

14188847
google-chrome	firefox
script is running fine with ie and google-chrome but with firefox i get after 60sec timeout error for the if statement

14188866
width	height
i think you would need to edit the source code for viewpager and swap out all x y and width height logic

14188912
google-chrome	firefox
because jquery ui is triggering the focus event on click line 10956 of it loses the selection in google-chrome firefox seems to work

14188936
inherited	properties
in order to pass usable data you will need to create your own class that inherited from eventargs and then add your properties to this

14188981
next	except
in other words it would work exactly like the line above except starting with the current element rather than the next one

14188987
ready	each
for each socket ready to be read

14189004
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the given css is working fine in firefox google-chrome safari but i am having problem hacking it for ie

unsigned	short	int	chars
linker error undefined reference to cpassivesocket listen unsigned chars const short int

14189061
for-loop	loops
the first element in a for-loop is executed once right as loops is entered therefore it is often used to declare the iteration variable for loops as i did here

14189101
g++	gcc
behind the scenes dev-c++ uses the mingw gnu gcc compiler it invokes a command similar to g++ file1.cpp file2.cpp .

14189123
width	height
width 296 height 395

14189123
width	height
width 296 height 395 header false colorscheme light border_color 23ffffff

14189201
hide	show
they simply show hide a div and position it absolutely over top the page

14189226
iboutlet	ibaction
however you lose all ibaction iboutlet connections when you do this they don t carry over their links to and from the old storyboard they just go so you have to rewire them each time

14189239
int	chars
this is assuming you are trying to reinterpret your chars array as an int

14189244
sorting	grouping
in the text box properties interactive sorting window change the grouping selection to the userid grouping assuming that is the most-detailed grouping providing the rows in your example

14189249

14189380
maven	pom.xml
i had mentioned the dependency libraries in the pom.xml file also the library system path exists also but during the compilation using maven clean install -e -x it throws error saying the package does not exists

14189386
client-side	server-side
to completely end a users session you need to destroy both the server-side information the client-side cookie and generate a new session identifier

14189389
int	chars
if you are using a clustered index on your primary key which is the default for some rdbm s sorting for chars is completely different than sorting an int

14189393
multiplying	addition	multiplying	multiplication	addition	multiplication
and since int multiplying is always equivalent to repeated addition the results must also be the same for re-ordered multiplication

14189411
hash	md5
after doing some research i have found that phpbb no longer md5 hash their passwords and now does some type of custom hashing algorithm

14189412
integer	unsigned
since fixed bit length two s complement integer arithmetic is homomorphic to modulo arithmetic for the same unsigned bit length the distributive property holds when using two s complement arithmetic

14189428
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
but the twist is that it needs to work on all browsers google-chrome safari ie opera and firefox

14189467
hash	salt
phpbb stores an encryption salt that is used to hash the passwords find the salt and you can use it in your new app or use it to loop through your passwords and create new passwords using a different encryption when you write your own system if you like

14189492

post	get
the request verb which is usually something like get or post but can be many other things as well

14189493
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd
however the behavior you are probably very used to in any common apache nginx lighttpd web server setup is that the path supplied by the client must match a physical path in your document root directory

14189540
min	max
if use heapq should use - to translate max to min

opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i need this working in all major browsers ie google-chrome firefox firefox opera

14189603
128bit	64bit
this naive implementation requires me to multiply many times so 32-bit integers become 64bit integers and then 128bit etc

14189603
integer	fractions
luckily the integer part of all the square roots i m interested in is at most 6 needing only 3 bits so i have a lot of bits available to represent the fractions part for an approximation

14189603
int	double
so while a 53-bit precision double is sufficient to store an accurate enough approximation for a square root it is not sufficient to store the result after multiplication by a 32-bit int as that requires a minimum of 67-bits of precision to minimize error

14189603
128bit	64bit
using a fixed-point representation in a 64bit integer say q16.48 for c and a 32-bit integer b i plan to use multi-word arithmetic with 96 or 128bit numbers to do the comparison without enough error to throw off the results

14189643
width	height
that technique requires the element to have a fixed width and height

14189643
width	height
you are not setting the width and height

14189643
width	height
based on your border and margins to center it the width would need to be 190 pixels and the height would need to be 90 pixels

14189643
text-align	height	width	height	width	text-align
using line-height and text-align in combination with a fixed width and height makes the text and border centered

polymorphism	specialization
herman might have coined a term for something like template specialization which generates types objects which are mutually unrelated not-polymorphic or monomorphic from the template which is a polymorphism structure

14189674
dbcontext	objectcontext
if you re using the entity framework it s much simpler to just update the local objects and let the dbcontext objectcontext handle the change tracking for you

14189674
dbcontext	objectcontext
however if the life of the dbcontext is only for the unit of work that s being performed then each subsequent call with the dbcontext should bring in the latest data as you ll be using a new instance of the dbcontext objectcontext

14189681
background-color	transparency
and then i realized that background-color transparency was making error

14189685

yesterday i encountered a problem when using font-face with a really large font-size 200px one of my div rendered differently in firefox and google-chrome

14189753
google-chrome	firefox
after doing some research i learned that it was due to firefox and google-chrome calculated line-height differently and a specified line-height could solve my problem

14189804
int	chars
to do this you can cast the chars to an int

14189819

gdi	directwrite
and if you re on windows which i assume is the case given the described behavior then turning off hardware-accelerated rendering also turns off directwrite rendering of text and uses gdi instead

14190186
gdi	directwrite
but directwrite and gdi end up with different font metrics for the same text for one thing directwrite can do subpixel glyph positioning and gdi cannot

you can t make a get or post request to another domain unless you use jsonp a server proxy or you have control over the other domain

14190482
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
a bigint implementation in this case is not actually so bad since you only need to implement multiplication addition subtraction and comparison

14190482
int	double
edit regarding the use of double suggested by thomas and nemo s comment on that it s actually very easy to find an approximation using 32 bit int well within 2 -53 of sqrt 2 by using the continued fractions representation

lwjgl	jogl
what about jogl or lwjgl .their apis are 1 1 to c++ glut.if you use the fixed pipeline you also have glu lib with all you need inside.i didn t work with jogl seriously because i didn t like the way it manages contexts and windows but i did do commercial projects with lwjgl and can tell this lib is fantastic.also you can use it for mobile development

14192124
glut	lwjgl	lwjgl	jogl
first it seems like jogl has got glut class which takes care mostly of primitives creation.also i found this lib which is a partial port of c++ glut.but in fact i don t understand your reason behind seeking glut c++ like lib.jogl and lwjgl both supply you with input handling context and window creation which are built in features.and in java you will not probably be able to unify context and windows creation under single roof because android and windows java environments do it differently.of course you can always roll your own class which will underneath take care of context windows setup based on the platform but i think it is like re-inventing the wheel

14196752
hex	binary
not really an answer but i suspect that the original question is confused on the distinction between hex and binary

14196752
octal	binary
since binary is not very compact octal was invented

14196752
octal	binary
in octal the 00001010 binary value would be 012

14196752
octal	hex
but most computer words are some multiple of 8 bits and octal does not evenly represent multiples of 8 bits so hex hexadecimal was invented

14196752
int	chars
in fact chars already have a numerical internal representation -- it s simply a matter of extracting the individual chars and optionally casting it to an int type and note that casting does not change the value just the type of variable it can be stored in

14196752
int	chars
the individual nsstring chars already are int only of the unichar type

14196759
mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown
using javascript add mousedown mousemove and mouseup events on your image

implements	extends
could i go down the road of having a base panel class that adds the buttons and each extends class then implements the different functionality or is there a better way to do it

14196858
implements	extends
you certainly can throw objects that extends not implements the error class

14196866

google-chrome	firefox
please use some debug tool for example in google-chrome use f12- network tab or use firefox firebug to see the request formed from the browser in this case you are putting form parameters into the view name even adding some strange space symbol in quotes after the parameters in your client js - it does not seem to be right

those are server-side and this function is client-side javascript

14197200
hide	show
unlike the tooltip_class32 windows which are long-lived and just hide show themselves as needed these shadow windows are a more elusive creature they are only created for as long as needed so you d have to refresh spy++ while there s a tooltip or popup menu or other window using the shadow present - and that s tricky since most tooltips and menus will disappear as soon as you move the mouse to switch to spy++

14197200
titlebar	window
finally note that these shadows are a completely different thing than the shadows that you see when one app window is on top of another above another since vista this type of shadow is part of aero glass mode and handled by the same desktop composition manager that adds the glass titlebar effect and it doesn t use or need helper windows to implement the shadows.

inherited	properties
the standards state that the top right bottom left css properties aren t inherited

14198647
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox	inherited	properties
but from what i can see i tested firefox google-chrome ie10 and opera the implementations do inherited these properties

14198694
inherited	properties
to take this further you could likely create a base class with a clone method that uses reflection to copy properties values and have your entities inherited from it

14198698
inherited	properties
they inherited the top and left properties because you explicitly do so

14198698
inherited	properties
without these two lines these properties would not be inherited implicitly inline with the specification

14198715
pull	push
when using push pull it will talk to the upstream subversion repo

14198749
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox but does not work in either ie or google-chrome

14198763
google-chrome	safari
the demo is using webkit prefixes only so sorry you ll have to check it out on google-chrome or safari etc

14198766

udp	tcp
tcp is way better then udp for that

14199053

it would be better to just embed an service advertisement in the broadcast udp stream and then have each client see the advertisement and connect to the tcp host with no extra configuration on the endpoints

14199053

is there an standard way or better example code of advertising a tcp service via udp

the synchronous post request just submits to exactly that url which thus get reflected as-is in browser s address bar

14199414
min	max
you might be able to use the following which replaces the two selects in the select list with min p.date and max p.date

14199426
textview	imageview
there can be other ways also like that whole view could be a viewgroup either a linearlayout or a relativelayout and there could be multiple textview s and imageview s inside that

14199468
.htaccess	httpd.conf
a simple rule like that could be in your .htaccess or httpd.conf

14199489

14199603
post	get
2. if the data to send exceeds what get can handle you can post the data using a form and an iframe

14199603
post	get
since the post can not return any data yo must use the get method to get the response which corresponds to that key

14199603
post	get
because the post is asynchronous your get should poll the server until the server responds with success which dependent on the server having received a post with the corresponding key

14199640
youtube	vimeo
i am creating a video player which relies on loading both the vimeo and youtube playlist apis through ajax

14199640

once all vimeo videos are loaded and all youtube videos are loaded and have their creation dates i need to sort them using jquery

14199640

14199663
width	height
i need to make jcomponent s width to be 300 or less but height should be variable depending on content of jcomponent

14199663
width	height
i tried to find the way to affect only preferred width and leave height to be default but i failed to find that way

14199689
atexit	main
one possibility i m considering is making one big class which is the application - meaning all cleanup would happen either in its destructor or in the destructor of one of its members - then allocating one of these big objects on the heap in main setting a global pointer to point to it and using atexit to register a handler which simply deletes the object via the global pointer

14199728
mouse	trackpad
inside an event tap i need to distinguish the scroll event that comes from a magic mouse to that which comes from a trackpad

14199780
youtube	vimeo
i am not familiar with youtube s api nor vimeo but maybe they have a ready done or loaded event that you can listen two then in the handler that you set you set the two flags so that if both are true then you execute something like this

14199806
slideup	slidedown
if you want your slidedown to be faster 200 than your slideup 600 you could lookup the current display property

14199847
src	attr
a better way of changing the src is to use the attr method

portrait	landscape	width	height
here 400 is the new width in case image is in portrait mode or new height in case image is in landscape mode

14199884

14200121
post	get
your javascript is not sending any data and is using a get request not a post

filewriter	bufferedwriter
i have a simple program that needs to write a few lines of string to a file using filewriter and bufferedwriter

14200511

width	height
note for math geeks and other pedants the arctangent would normally take the height divided by the width not the other way around

14200601
int	double
i dont think there is a way to restrict a generic type to only string int and double but you could use as string int and double all implement comparable

14200612
post	get
i ve read some blog post eg recomending to set hibernate.jdbc.batch_size configuration property to higher values in order to get better performance at processing batches of inserts updates

14200622
int	chars
in an associative array if you change a key it can break it since the hashes don t match up - you could get two entries in the tree where there should be only one and other tough to find bugs hence in newer d versions if you try int chars it will complain that the key must be immutable

14200632
int	double
i don t know of anyway you can return a string or an int or a double etc

your put and post methods should take a parameter representing request body

14200756
min	max
1 you can explicitly set an extent with and scale the min and max values as you scale the height

14200756
min	max
in other words if you double the height of your chart double the min and max in your extent as well

14200808
prng	random
the code that follows uses the prng pseudo random number generator random class to generate password characters for the initial temporary password instead of the much more cryptographically secure rngcryptoserviceprovider as it should have used

14200827
range	max	range	min	min	max
cubism uses the extent option to set the min and max values of the horizon chart not the range of the scale

14200827
min	max
if you don t explicitly set an extent it will just use the min and max values in your data which may not give you the color bands you want

14200993
hex	binary
i d also suggest not using biginteger as a way of converting binary to hex

the preferred most secure hashing method supported by phpass is the openbsd-style blowfish-based bcrypt also supported with our public domain crypt_blowfish package for c applications and known in php as crypt_blowfish with a fallback to bsdi-style extended des-based hash known in php as crypt_ext_des and a last resort fallback to md5-based salt and variable iteration count password hash implemented in phpass itself also referred to as portable hash

14201202

14201260
public	protected
if one can imagine a realistic scenario where a derived class might benefit from being able to access the member and cannot imagine a scenario where the base class might benefit from changing its behavior then the member should be protected assuming of course that it shouldn t be public

14201291
google-chrome	firefox

put	get	post	get	post	put
however you may want strong recommendation to do so to use different http methods like get post put and delete to better represent the operation

14201514
width	height
imagine a website with an iframe set to width 0 and height 0 src

14201514

in that case the operation should be surrounded in a try-catch exception-handling block that catches the exception-handling rolls back the transaction and rethrows

14201955
try-catch	exception-handling
any exception-handling that you can proceed through normally should be handled with a nested try-catch or the condition should be checked for prior to the operation that could fail in that way

ie8 not firefox or google-chrome has a gripe with the following function

14202097
google-chrome	firefox
note i ve tested this in google-chrome firefox and ie 9 and it basically works in all three but ie may have weird delay timing different from the other two which may make stops to flip syncing in all three browsers impossible

14202122

implements	extends
using balusc s suggestion of implements collection i can now hide my primefaces p datatable using not empty operator on my datamodel that extends javax.faces.model.listdatamodel

another option probably simpler option would be to have 2 submit buttons and show and hide them depending on how the user intends to pay

14202213
getter	setter
i also bind selecteditem to a property called selecteditem that should has a public getter and setter

14202213

fflush	gets
that way on each loop the output gets fflush as the php is running on the server and the new output is neatly placed over top of the previous output

14202288
post	get
this is generally too long to transfer using the get method however one would think that the post method would allow for such large variables to be be passed on

14202288
post	get
however most answers come down to use the post method instead of the get method to transfer the data.

14202288
post	get
since i am not using the get method but rather the post method like many people suggested in other threads about this problem i m not sure why the uri is involved here and is seemingly causing a problem

14202344
for-loop	loops
i would replace the outer for-loop with a while loops as henry suggests with the terminating condition being that the last r is to the left of the first w

post	get
by doing some reflection on the dynamically generated proxy classes thanks to the information i found in this post i saw that the get of my relationship properties was being overridden to do lazy loading but the set was not being overriden at all so of course nothing was happening until detectchanges was called and detectchanges was using the compare to snapshot method of detecting changes

14202660
public	protected
all properties must have public protected

14202660

it s way faster on ie but other major browsers firefox google-chrome safari and opera perform better when using a container and then appending it fragment or div

14203293
hide	show
the smoother looking solution would be using ajax to use a listener to see when a user clicks a field a java value is set as that field and using a similar if then show method on the java-script variable to hide the fields that contain that value in the other forms

14203349
client-side	server-side

14204917
ubuntu	linux
linux ubuntu 10

14204948
unsigned	short
the essential difference is that short is signed char is unsigned

14204948
unsigned	short	16-bit	64bit	int	chars
the integral types are byte short int and long whose values are 8-bit 16-bit 32-bit and 64bit signed two s-complement int respectively and chars whose values are 16-bit unsigned int representing utf-16 code units

14204976
int	double
for whatever reason there is no overload of sqlfunctions.stringconvert that takes int so you have to cast to double

14204991
width	height
somewhere in updatemodelwithtime i would expect you to set plus half of its height or width respectively

14205041
post	put
i have made a game using java my game is a state based game so it extends statebasedgame i want to put the game on a website which will require me to make it an applet unless there is another way so it must also extend japplet after trying to extend multiple class s and reading online i had no luck and read on a forum post that it is not possible to have multiple extends

14205068
implements	extends
typically if you want to extends from more than 1 source you would use interfaces and implements from multiple sources

14205089
width	height
using css-generated content you re creating a box around around the content of nothing but this element still adheres to the box model sort of so it can get things like height width position etc

14205392
int	chars
not quite so meaningless is that int types chars short int long etc. are exact by fiat

14205392
int	double
as far as i can tell an implementation could get away with making float a synonym for int double a synonym for long and long double a synonym for long long

14205395
cvs	svn
i accidentally checked in code which was stored in cvs to svn without removing the cvs folder

14205405

idictionary	icollection
does a normal dictionary do this or would the idictionary have the complete complement of dictionary features without the need for icollection

14205624
minimum	max
slight change to the previous answer since you want a minimum of 4 characters and a max of 30 you may want to use this

14205626
disk	ram
more memory will allow your system to cache disk pages in ram which dramatically speeds up reads because it treats your ram as a sort of disk but ram is 20 to 50 times faster than a hard disk

scatter	graphing
at the moment we re listening to events via backbone scatter graphing falls into a larger application so we have access to the element node that was the current target via e.currenttarget

14205940

my problem is i move it from portrait to landscape then all controls align perfectly except the scroll view

14206136
portrait	landscape
the width of simulator is 900 in portrait mode and in landscape mode its 1024.so my scrollview has its scroll at 900 width even in landscape mode

14206136
portrait	landscape
scroll view is at the end of portrait 900 and almost 2 3 at landscape 900 again

14206136

hide	show
edit i have found this link that explains how to show and hide a map fragment and i have tried using getview .setvisibility but i get the same result

finally write down an arduino app that keeps reading statuses from that service and database of course using another endpoint method in which case you just need to pass your arduino id and it will return a response of all of the different pin status so you can read process them from your arduino for example since json library is heavy and slow on arduino im passing my return values back from the server to the arduino using simple csv values i.e pin status ..... i have some code for making http get post on arduino you just need the ethernet shield i could bring you the code if you are interested

int	chars
so charenum can either be converted to chars or any integral promotion of chars such as int

width	height
it s a similarly bad idea in some cases to set the height and width to smaller than 1px by 1px

14206608
awt	swing
other languages have other abstractions java could use swing or awt or any other ui library which offer different ways to draw forms

14206612

if you want to put the build to an iphone you might have to get a distribution profile and add the other device in that and then send the ipa file so that the tester can put it their device

i don t just want the height and width of an image but actually the resolution that determines the output quality of an image

mouseup	mousedown
the only one i could find was either a mousedown mouseup click is a combination of these

14206890
mouseup	mousedown
using mousedown or mouseup i then get the event to properly register a middle click in firefox

14206894
width	height
rectangle2d takes four parameters x y width and height

14206894
width	height
in you code you are passing the top left and bottom right corners of your grid this means the width height of your cup is actually wider by x pixels and y pixels higher

14206907
for-loop	loops
i do no understand why this for-loop will not loops

14206958
python-daemon	daemons

rtp	rtsp
essentially an rtsp conversation occurs between the client and server describe setup play which will contain the information a .sdp file for an rtp broadcast would have

width	height
you need to set your document and body to 100 width height

14207113
width	height
if you do float them you won t be able to get away with having two 50 divs with padding or margins padding and margins are in addition to the width height of the div

14207136
int	chars
you can do this by creating a string with the correct number of numerical chars then parse it into an int

equals	tostring
when you access the instance using object you can only access object methods like tostring equals etc which is obviously very limiting

14207407
client-side	server-side
i was under the impression that since javascript is client-side and php is server-side that it is impossible to call php from javascript

14207408
width	height
so for your code here you can just make a dialog set its content to your custom content set its gravity width and height to the values you have here and set its windowanimations field to your style defining the animations

14207424
ssl	https
https is enabled configured outside of your servicestack service web application layer so servicestack itself doesn t require any special attention when enabling ssl

you will have to take care of the iframe dimensions width x height dynamically in js to give the user a seamless experience window resize etc

14207443
inline	inlining
it would probably get categorized as simply inlining the log call and the inline code happening to be...nothing.

14207464
stdout	stderr
if you need to keep stderr and stdout separate try proc_open

14207484
width	height
also accessing width and height or the other properties with the same info is also slow so copy them to a local variable if you want to use them in a loop instead of say the 720 and 1280 in your example.

in my template file i m trying to access a data file via a jquery ajax method but get the following error message post static jsonfile http 1.1 404 41

14207707
width	margin
which means that by putting 90 width on the body will cause the 5 of the margin to be 5 out of 90 instead of the expected 100 which causes the bug. - same applies to padding

14207710
width	height
the trick here is to leave the browser figure out the width and height of the outer element

14207710
width	height
to reduce the height and width to 90

14207731
children	parent
on a jsp-site the parent and the children are displayed

disk	ram
now when you talk about virtual memory as far as swapping to and from a disk that is a trick often employed by operating systems to give the illusion of having more ram

14208141
disk	ram
the operating system through the virtual tables used by the hardware manages which memory chunks are tied to physical ram and are allowed to complete as is by the hardware or are marked as not available in some way causing an exception to the operating system upon inspection the operating system determines that this is a valid address for this application but the data behind this address has been swapped to disk

14223674
pecl	pear
seeing as that pear pecl was the most standard way to install php add-ons i was focussing on getting that to work however seeing this i think i ll have to refer to using the package command

to figure out what the max min values should be on a graph an easy way is to take the difference between the minimum and maximum values count the number of grid lines you will have default for google is 5 round up to the nearest significant digit of your biggest number and use those as your grid line dividers

14229829
min	max
first you need to figure out the ratio of negative values to the total difference in min and max values

14231549
getter	setter
i find the standard getter setter to be needlessly verbose sometimes but there are ways around this

14231549
getter	setter
for example you can use a getter or setter which is the same name as the fields and you can create operation methods which are more concise than accessing the fields directly

14231551

my first thought is rather than to run the code in oncreate which is what i assume you re doing to place the code in onstart but onresume may also be appropriate - have a read of the docs and it should become apparent which one is best to use for your application

14231919

in practice however will convert the signed chars to a signed int but the will discard any set bits in the more significant bytes

14235132
int	chars
the value is converted to an unsigned chars before it is promoted to an int or the compiler might promote to int then coerce to unsigned chars then promote the unsigned chars back to int and the unsigned value is used in the operations

14235159
multiplying	add
multiplying the first integer with 100 and add the second integer to it

14235163
children	parent
the mediator pattern would provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem but it seems more oriented towards mediating communication between colleagues while in my use-case i need to mediate between parent and child applications where children are unaware of each other

14235189
unsigned	short	int	chars
the chars type is something of an anomaly in that it is not the same as either signed chars or unsigned chars unlike the other int types - short int long etc - which are implicitly signed unless explicitly declared unsigned

14235191

select that and you ll get basic getter and setter for the instance variables

14235382
inherited	properties
that means that all scopes are automatically inherited all properties of scope where they re located

14235388
integer	unsigned
as someone already explained in a previous answer to your question on the same topic any small integer type be it signed or unsigned will get promoted to the type int whenever used in an expression

14235388
int	chars
because these bits will be preserved upon promotion from signed chars to int

14235402
int	chars
the data type chars is supposed to hold a chars hence the name so it s not really an int type to hold an int number to be used in calculations

14235402
int	chars
of course a chars is in reality an int of some kind but of which kind is implementation dependent the c standard does not force any specific kind

14235402
int	chars
so if you want to use the chars type for int values also used in calculations always use signed chars or unsigned chars explicitly and only use just chars when you are really dealing with chars or when it makes absolutely no difference for your code if chars is signed or unsigned

14235402
int	chars
according to the rules of type promotion chars in your case signed is promoted to int and unsigned chars is also promoted to int

14235412
google-chrome	safari
browse only in a webkit based browser google-chrome safari to get the debugging option

14235446

it s probably easier rather than disabling the buttons which could be confusing to a user just to rotate the camera view into landscape when it s opened and prevent any rotations to portrait

14236245
portrait	landscape
meaning somehow change the browser to support media query orientation landscape or portrait

14236245

the difference is the first time you call tolist it converts the iqueryable which is just a definition of a query to a list of ienumerable querying the database

14241288
ienumerable	iqueryable
when performed on iqueryable will result in a db call the exception being when it finds cached results that it can reuse and calls on the ienumerable object in your case lstcostcenter will operate in-memory

14241288
ienumerable	iqueryable
to get more predictable results then call tolist on the iqueryable first and make all further calls on the ienumerable

mouse	keyboard
in the case of buttons arrow keys move the keyboard focus from one button to the next to facilitate navigating through the window and interacting with the widgets without a mouse

14242393
qmainwindow	qpushbutton
as hank suggested in a comment you can force the qpushbutton to not accept keyboard focus by calling its setfocuspolicy qt nofocus but that will only work in the particular case where the push buttons were the only ones in your qmainwindow that could steal focus

superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
the subclassing will inherited the superclass s implementation of the iterator interface which it is free to override

14243462
maven	pom.xml
take care that -f is used to say to maven to use another pom.xml or module directory and it takes the pom.xml in it than the one in the current directory

14243462
maven	pom.xml
thus unlike -pl where maven considers all modules in your project and then build only a subpart of them -f only build what is referenced by this project module pom.xml

to achieve this in practice might be tricky but on linux with glibc they have an official way to add custom hooks to malloc realloc and free

14243892
free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	malloc
so basically i imagine you could build a modified glibc with hooks that log each allocation request via malloc realloc and free calls

14243931
wordpress	joomla
i am only a joomla wordpress guy but i figured i would take a stab at it

14243947
jquery	anythingslider
i found this interesting and i m working on improving my jquery so i ve added a possibly refined slightly different approach which should work reliably even for most reasonable changes to the anythingslider plus i had it mostly written yesterday but forgot to post it and didn t want it to go to waste if it s possibly helpful to anyone

14243951
client-side	server-side
since ember is a client-side framework i would say you need two adapters server-side and client-side

14243951
client-side	server-side
one possibility would be to use the webdis package as a server-side adapter and then tweak the json rest client-side adapter provided in ember data to comply with the webdis rest-like protocol

int	chars
you can set on your read step or via options but then the column will be a chars rather than int

14244273
int	chars
in other words instead of simply generating an int and a chars as a static variable on the data segment each time the dostuff class generates foo then it s generated on the heap i think rather than the data segment and further the frombyte buf method is pushed to the stack and then the transaction class calls itself recursively on the data segment again a static variable .

14244273
int	chars
can it get over the recursive variable call the frombyte method returns a transaction object and that s ok in the int chars form any comment

int	chars
another improvement prototypes make it possible to have functions with parameters of type float and of int types narrower than int the 3 chars types and the two short types

14244319
int	double
without a prototype float is promoted to double and narrow int types are promoted to int or to unsigned int

14244357

14246010

14246202
uisegmentedcontrol	uibutton
i thought the problem was that you used a normal uibutton instead of a uisegmentedcontrol but the problem seems to really be that you shouldn t be using the sender argument at all

uisegmentedcontrol	uibutton
i take it that you have one uisegmentedcontrol for the user to select something and one uibutton for them to tap when they re done with their selection

14246217
post	put
because there is no post.id in your form cakephp sends a put request instead of a post request to create or put a new row into your database the first time

14246217
post	put
this will include the id of the given post since it s in your find result and hence the second time you submit it it has an id and therefor sends a post request instead of a put request

14246217
post	put
this should pass along the id and hence trigger a post request rather than a put request and make your submission pass at once

14247255
disk	ram
it might be an idea to store the passphrase into ram like on a ram disk or inside a dedicated memory

14247255
disk	ram
but again if you cannot detect that an attacker is on your system it s meaningless whether the passphrase is inside ram or on magnetic disk - it can be read

it is assumed that an int can hold more values than a chars or at least more values that the system s narrow multibyte encoding uses and getchar returns a special constant eof when there it failed to read more data

14247839

for example it would be perfectly fine if both a chars and an int were 32 bits wide on a given platform as long as say the narrow stream could only return units with values in the range -128 128 and you could use -200 as eof

free	memcpy	free	malloc	memcpy	malloc
if you mean the mathematical kind you may find that storing the array in space malloced in the heap and resized by doing a new larger malloc followed by a memcpy and a free of the old malloced area may be faster than using std containers

14248900
put	get
i m trying to get two different numbers from two different text files put them into one variable and compare it to the mysql array

14248903
integer	fractions
then it s a simple matter of adding the integer number of days to that date then multiplying the fractions part by 86400 to get seconds and doing the arithmetic to determine the hour minute and second

14248906
innodb	myisam
this is false at least for myisam innodb tables which is what 99.999 of people out there use

and create a rule in your apache config to use that ini file for that page request only

14249038
int	boolean
i need to pass on the value that is set by a uiswitch so since it is a boolean i was thinking it would return an int hence the i in my code below

superclass	subclassing
when your superclass has an args constructor and doesn t have a no-args constructor you have to explicitly invoke it using a super args call from subclassing constructor

14249127
superclass	subclassing
all subclassing constructors have to explicitly call superclass constructors via super t if zero argument superclass constructor is not available

14249162
post	get
i m trying to get a flash message atop the next page but only after an http post from my form not on refresh or get

14249200
google-chrome	firefox
the chart renders perfectly in firefox and google-chrome

14249216
put	get
there is no direct way to get html element as image and then you can easily put it into canvas

14249218
width	height
if you specific an available width explicitly you get the correct height

14249218
width	height
the width is correctly calculated in both cases but the height is only correctly calculated if you provide that double parameter

14249230
cpu	processors
for instance an intel cpu like ivy bridge processors there are multiple data prefetchers such as prefetching to l1 l2 or l3 cache

14249246
getter	setter
now you want to couple these variables with getter setter methods as this is what java puts emphasis on as opposed to referncing public variables directly such as c++

14249251
min	max
going by the proposed answers it appears that min data or max data is the fastest way to achieve what i want

14249285
post	get
a totally different approach is to get a count of matching tags on a post and compare that to the count of tags on the stream

14249335
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the form works fine in ie safari and google-chrome but doesn t work in firefox v18.0

14249338
post	get
if not how can i get a reference to the id for the post on the timeline

14249350
folder	directory
then navigate one directory up to and type ls -la so i can see your permissions on the actual .ssh folder

14249360
width	height
obviously the buffer height and width will be larger but does the 1080p camera capture more pixels because possibly of a wider camera field of vision and so there is no enhancement to the quality or is the 1080p camera working within the same field of vision of the 720p camera and it is simply capturing more pixels per inch and so even if i don t output the buffer to an image i should expect more grain detail from my frame buffer

14249363
folder	directory
you can just add folder to views called application create your file in that directory

14249381
ssd	sata
if you are dealing with an sata attached ssd similar considerations apply

14249467
put	get
well i tried to use os.mkdir as well as os.mkdirall but no matter what value i put into the second parameter i get a locked out folder with no permissions

14249504
min	max
heapq provides only a min-heapâ that is you can pop the min value in o log n time but not the max value

14249504
skip-lists	tree	skip-lists	queue
but if you want symmetric performance for a double-ended priority queue you can t actually do any better than a balanced tree or a skip-lists

14249504
skip-lists	tree
so search pypi and the activestate recipes for balanced tree red-black tree avl tree skip-lists etc. and you ll find things like bintrees and skip-lists which should all work

14249523
post	get
1 - get windows sdk from luis post above

14249523
folder	directory
4 - change directory to mrjdb7 s folder

14249595
boost	stl
i have used the boost ptr_vector container as i understand the stl containers can be more problematic for this sort of thing

14249601
stringr	stringi
or perhaps str_locate_all from package stringr which is a wrapper for gregexpr stringi stri_locate_all as of stringr version 1.0

14249627
width	height
for each of these grids we calculate where the grid intersections would lie by dividing the maximum width of the points by the number of columns minus 1 and the maximum height of the points by the number of rows minus 1

14249648
post	get
i am trying to get an access token and using the following url to post the http request and receiving

14249649
google-chrome	firefox
internet explorer has the preferred behavior but google-chrome and firefox

14249736
hide	show
could also hide all the divs on click and then show only the associated one

14249843
post	put
you can t add content-type to the default request headers because you can only set content-type when you are sending some content using a put or a post

14249878
sorting	filtering
if you want to use isotope s sorting filtering functions you will need to set the failure_limit of lazyload and trigger the event with isotope s onlayout callback

14249888
stderr	fflush	stdout	stderr	stdout	fflush
both stdout and stderr will not be displayed if i don t fflush these buffers

14249904
for-loop	loops
while the enhanced for-loop is really nothing more than syntactic sugar for iterators it still follows the same principles as other loops would - it has to have a set to operate with before it can do anything else

14249938
portrait	landscape
ipad layout scales up when rotating from portrait to landscape

14249979
post	get
alternatively you could use get as opposed to post and also if there is only going to be text and no special symbols or characters which actually require encoding then maybe you could use a different content-type that correctly identifies the type of content that you are sending.

14250018
client-side	server-side
whatever it is your middle tier server-side language that s executing the database query is surely better suited to creating the tree structure than client-side javascript

14250019
button	checkbox
2 from this dialog box they select check dates and using the select button in the dialog box a post request is made to a controller action which based on the selected checkbox calculates a few form fields and returns the partial view

14250024
put	get
the easiest way without css to get this vertically is to put each image in a table row

14250113
int	double
if the type returned from the method is a wrapper like int or double then using .equals should fix the problem

14250141
firefox	safari
if you check the above fiddle in firefox ie or safari you ll see that the guy in the bright hoody looks sharp and clear

14250261
realloc	malloc
in my initial pass i used malloc to create room for the first byte bytes and then subsequently realloc whenever i needed to append another byte handful of bytes...it works but it feels like this approach will needlessly hammer away at the os and likely result in shifting bytes around in memory over and over

14250269
notepad++	sublimetext
i use utf-8 for default encoding for new created file in both notepad++ and sublimetext 2

14250277

int	boolean
in some cases in javascript int work more efficiently than boolean values

14250500
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in ie and google-chrome but in firefox jquery won t select anything unless i change the xslt output to html which messes up other things

14250556
post	get

this will allow it to pop-up like a dialog but give you more flexibility and easier to manipulate imho

14250583
google-chrome	safari
however mobile safari and google-chrome on my ipad ios 6.0.1 shows a black rectangle with the same width as the page

14250627
margin	height
less obviously you also need a required minimum height too so that in landscape it will know not to satisfy the lower priority request to make the top margin 300

14250627
margin	height
you could for example use obviously replace my bottom margin of 5 with whatever makes sense for you but adjust the minimum height of the tableview accordingly

14250627
margin	height
yes i know you asked how to do this with visual format language but if you use constraintwithitem you don t have to specify the minimum table height but rather you can just set the top margin like so

14250627
portrait	landscape
clearly the trick is how to determine the multiplier and constant so that you get 300 pt in portrait and 175 pt in landscape

14250636
superclass	subclassing
subclassing implicitly call even default constructor present in superclass which is non parameterised

14250661
fadein	fadeout
when i scroll either up or down i want to fadeout a div and when the scroll has stopped fadein the same div

14250693

14250804
folder	directory
the adventure.app is in the main directory with the files folder

14250836
freebsd	linux
the fix for freebsd would be similar although for some reason they decided to go with the linux convention of copy all the stuff from include files into the valgrind source rather than the darwin convention of just include the system header files

14250887
implements	extends
i switched places of implements with extends then only the implements worked and the extends didn t seem visible

14250887
implements	extends
edit also if i try to implements something else while leaving the extends there it suggests me to implements the methods but if i implements valuechangelistener it doesn t suggest me to implements anything but if you then remove the extends and leave just implements valuechangelistener it then suggest to implements it s methods again

put	get
the real restriction in rest is that for a modifiable resource that you get you can also turn around and put the same representation back to change its state

14253490

post	get
a lot of people have accepted the practice that a get with too long or too complex a query string query strings don t handle nested data easily can be sent as a post instead with the complex long data represented in the body of the request

14254114
post	get
like automatic retries because get is idempotent but if you can live with that it might be easier to just accept processing really long or complicated queries with post

14254114
post	get
so you could get with with filters represented in the body like post but you d be rolling the dice.

14254126
post	get
the requestmapping process either get or post sent data

14254180

width	height
first you have to set limits for height and width so sometimes you end up images with a smaller area because they are very wide or tall

14255461
width	height
what i mean by that is that the image can change a lot in width without changing the height a lot

14255461
width	height
in my real life application these are called from a configuration file. max_w and max_h are pretty self explanatory as the maximum height and width of the images

14255461
width	height
in order to calculate them it s necessary to define areas for two different instances of the aspect ratios where the ratio is width height

14255461
width	height
for example when the ratio is 1 width height you might want the area to be 8000 pixels 2 and when the ratio is 2 width 2 height the area could be 12000 pixels 2

14261408
octal	hex
it s a little tricky as you will be converting groups of 4 bits to groups of 3 bits - you ll probably want to work with 12 bits at a time 3 hex digits to 4 octal digits and you ll then have to deal with any remaining bits separately

14261408
octal	hex
to convert 5274 octal to hex

14261424
simplecursoradapter	spinner
currently i am using a simplecursoradapter and calling changecursor whenever i change the search conditions based on the previously selected spinner

the problem here is that my uiview master does not layout it s subviews automatically when the device rotates and the springs struts layout method used to position the image and interior uiview was inefficient

14261683
nexus	artifactory
use a dependency management system like ivy and a local maven repository like nexus or artifactory to manage it

pygtk	pygobject
i use glade to design the interface quickly uses pygobject not pygtk those are the main problems

as strange as it sounds the datagridcolumn class inherited directly from dependencyobject so you can t use bindings on its properties it has no setbinding method

14261879

14261981
implements	extends
these workarounds were of the following form extends the root layout to implements checkable

14261981
implements	extends
to do a nice background to a list item prior to honeycomb you would do something like the above for state_checked and you also need to extends your topmost view to implements the checkable interface

14261985
maven	m2e
seems your eclipse in doing something with m2e the maven plugin maybe try to remove the plugin from eclipse installation first

14262034

nexus	artifactory
if you have a preferred central repo or if you are using a company maven proxy like nexus or artifactory you can set it in the user settings.xml

14262166

nsdata	nserror
ios6 s social framework handler block parameters are nsdata responsedata nshttpurlresponse urlresponse nserror error

post	get
if you re doing something complicated this could get out of hand but if it s just a list of the most recent post or something i think it would be fine

14262331
ant	maven
there are many things still to learn like using packages using the environment variable classpath to set the classpath instead of using the -classpath command line argument adding your jdk bin directory to your path adding more than one entry to the classpath creating shell scripts to make rebuilding and rerunning your program easier using ides for development and maven ant for building making your own jars .

14262331
post	get
this post is not meant to indicate best practices but rather to get you up and running quickly

14262345
post	get
if a get request can be constructed that redirects through oauth and then automatically post as the authenticated user then you likely have a major csrf hole on your hands

14262368

the form is very long so in some sections i have fields that show hide using jquery depending on the yes or no selections for a previous input

14262390

with php you can if you wish then do an explode post ... to get all values etc...

14262416

start by doing your calculations for min + max and defining a height for both

14262416
min	max
after that take all your other values and decide what their heights will be some percentage of your min max

14262425
versioning	upgrade
the main difference being that the cluster doesn t go down as a whole and the clients can still access the upgrade server with the non-hotfixed versioning

14262433
pandas	pytables
reading links about pandas and pytables it seems that appending a new column could be a problem

14262466
button	checkbox
basically this recreates agreement checkbox and as side effect the new checkbox don t have event listeners that disable the place order button

14262473
countif	named
and i would use countif in the vba to find the most frequent objects by their named

14262477
dictionary	map
as for search engines they read the output from your code so it doesn t really make a lot of difference which method you use to perform the translations but ideally you may want to keep the urls restful so whether you re including php dictionary calling the database or using gettext or changing your mind from one to another later you ll be able to map the language to the url with something like so you can change how the program works without changing the urls

14262484
post	get
if you have to connect to a database make sure you are using pdo or mysqli - especially if you are getting any input for your queries from get or post

14262512
wordpress	joomla
note i m not using anything like wordpress or joomla etc. it s all custom coded by myself

free	malloc
here i don t have to malloc or free anything

i have tried to change the tick on the x-axis following a few other post ex1 ex2 but i couldn t get it work

14262537
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
i ve recently been testing the performance of the for-loop vs the foreach loops in c# and i ve noticed that for summing an arrays of ints into a long the foreach loops may come out actually faster

14262552
filtering	grouping
which works ok for a single layer of recursion but then models related to membership such as grouping are not subject to the filtering

14262569
maven	pom.xml
you have a maven build file pom.xml then it s pretty easy do a mvn eclipse eclipse on the pom.xml file

14262575
for-loop	loops
also you should keep the code that is inside of your for-loop but get rid of loops itself

14262586
width	height
also the height and width on the badge widget has constraints that likely would end up causing the badge to not render depending on how the width height were calculated in a responsive layout

14262591
post	get
and that s besides the point that after it times out the first time it starts to work as expected where i can post and get responses immediately

14262623
printf	strcpy	memcpy	strcpy
there are 2 alternative approaches i came across which basically alter standard c functions like memcpy strcpy printf etc. since i assume these functions to be part of the binary with high probability

14262708
textview	imageview
for the adapter i strongly recoomend to use a viewholder which contains the textview and imageview references for each list-element-view

14262751
matplotlib	scipy
i installed python 2.7 so that i could get numpy scipy and matplotlib down the road but i found that all the scripts on my desktop defaulted to python 2.7

14262753
cpu	processors
now the target language for general-use compilers are assembler languages for various processors but there s nothing to prohibit a compiler back end to produce code in some other language for as long as said target language is at least as flexible as a general cpu assembler

14262769
puts	gets
it does not matter what instance puts a value in or gets it out they all share the same storage

14262776
unix	bsd
the csh shell originated on bsd unix so it s not surprising that csh is an indirect symlink to bin bsd-csh

14262776
ubuntu	debian
should tell you what version you have -- though the version number of the debian ubuntu package isn t likely to be more useful than the information you already have

14262794
post	get
but from what i can see on the winhttpclient site it has a _b_str class so you can convert to bytes - it doesn t say if that s via utf-8 but if all else fails you can use widechartomultibyte with cp_utf8 codepage to get a suitable byte buffer to post

14262813
solaris	aix
the following will work on aix linux solaris ksh

14262865
ubuntu	openbsd
if you re using ubuntu then your csh is the openbsd version with a few patches

14262868
opensuse	linux
i ve decided to bring up a gsm modem for my linux machine opensuse 12.1 64-bit on vmware so that i can use it as the sms gateway

14262889
implements	extends
as for testing purposes the only difference for unit testing is really that you need to extends rather than implements and not forget to override the methods you need

14262889
mockito	jmock
or use a mocking library such as mockito or jmock or...

14262900
wordpress	joomla
first you have a cms cms stands for content management system like above you have stated wordpress and joomla

14262903
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
in 1 you are assigning a destinationviewcontroller type uiviewcontroller to an object of type uitabbarcontroller

14262903
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
this is compiler-legal uitabbarcontroller inherits from uiviewcontroller so they are both of type uiviewcontroller but it doesn t reflect really what is going on

14262903
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
your segue will be to the uiviewcontroller or it s uinavigationcontroller

14262907
richfaces	icefaces
using richfaces -myfaces - icefaces - primfaces - etc--

14262916

14262949
versioning	upgrade
you can either use 3.1.10 or upgrade sass-rails and coffee-rails to a 3.2 versioning but you d also have to update your app for rails 3.2

14262959
google-chrome	firefox
so we didn t really figure out the root problem or why the ajax.beginform post wouldn t replace the partial view in google-chrome and firefox but got it working with this approach

14262962
webmock	vcr
we came across the same very similar problem with both fakeweb and webmock when using the vcr gem

14262971
installation	upgrade
the freedom to choose interactive or unattended un installation and the ability to handle dependencies and upgrade are enough to make it the best option

14262991
width	height
for example creates an editable text box annotation with its lower left corner at the point x y a width w and a height h specified in normalized figure units

14263060
subtract	add
i tried everything and after a couple of hours i noticed that when i remove the ticks and add just 2.0f it works but i don t know why since the conditional for the up key looks exactly the same except it adds instead of subtract

14263078
google-chrome	firefox
i have a google map on my site it works well on firefox or google-chrome but on ie7 it just displays a grey box you can check it on this url

14263095
width	height
it is important that the width of the image appears before the height

14263103
screens	tablet
i want these button should come at a center of screens either its is mobile or tablet

14263114
int	boolean
properties keys are string properties values can be a string int array boolean map etc

14263153
installshield	orca
in which case your best bet would be to use a third party tool like installshield or wise or orca where you can customize the install and install third party components like sql server personal oracle personal or mysql database or crystal report components

14263155
config	ini
the shirowebmodule provides a config method that mimics the ini syntax

14263155
config	ini
so the equivalent of your ini config would be

14263172
post	get
npapi has no way to get the post data for a post request in a page so the only stuff like that you can get is through javascript

14263211
getter	setter	public	protected
what i ve done in similar situations before is to declare the setter getter private or protected and then have public transient getter to perform the desired calculation

14263234
prepare	execute
just loop the bind_param and execute you only need to do the prepare once

14263235
getter	setter
you don t need an interface to do what you want as long as the getter and setter for r are public

14263235
getter	setter
that is the idea of getter and setter

14263292
hash	salt
if you re generating per-record salt you have to store the salt along with the hash password

14263292
hash	salt
if your server s been hacked then it doesn t matter which database the hash salt userna mes are spread across - they re going out the door

14263341
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu and debian place this as separate package because it is only needed if you want to build the packages yourself

14263345
urllib	httplib
i tried looking may be not hard enough at urllib2 urllib httplib to see if i could just send this file as the entire request i don t want to deal with parsing the file etc.

14263371
folder	directory
the actual images are on a separate drive rather than part of the solution so we access these by creating the folder structure in the solution excluding this from the build and creating a virtual directory under the relevant root in iis

14263382
vbscript	jscript
you may open a message box in the end of your batch file using wsh with a simple vbscript or jscript

14263437

14263451
openni	kinect
so i m beginning a project with a friend using the xbox kinect and as we both use macs we needed a good library so we went with openni because of it s apis

14263486
dictionary	map
otherwise use a dictionary to map category types to dispatch methods instead

14263523
width	border-box
the only way round this to some extent i can see is the fiddle above where you can hide the overflow but then the padding still acts as visible space for the image to flow into and so replacing with a solid border works instead and then adding border-box to make it 200px if that s the width you need

14263679
filtering	grouping
but if before filtering data i have a grid with 20 rows in grouping of 10 2 pages and the data that i want filtering be in the second page the grid doesnâ t show

14263716
width	height
so the texture width and height must be one of 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 neither 480 nor 800 are on that list ...

14263764
nsxmlparser	nsurlconnection
if you go with option 2 you ll probably need nsurlconnection nsxmlparser or a third party xml parsing library and to download the images i would recomend sdwebimage again

14263767
post	put
i have considered either adding these fields to the models exposed by my api or expecting a request header containing the user id on all put post delete requests

14263776
hash	hmac
its more likely that the cookie is protected with an hash message authentication code or hmac

14263784
client-side	server-side
the good thing with this approach is that you could use the same localization library both server-side and client-side without any modification

14263811

14263977
mp4	h.264

14264007
min	max
i ve really simple query to get min and max values it looks like

14264013
noexcept	throw
aside if your hash function cannot throw then it s quite important to give it a noexcept exception-specification otherwise the hash table needs to store every element s hash code alongside the element itself which increases memory usage and affects performance so that container operations that must not throw do not have to recalculate the hash code

14264019
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
everything works fine in firefox but when i m using safari google-chrome the submit button will not move back into the outer container

14264070
gridview	formview
the idea was proposed to put a gridview inside of the formview that lists all of the records for that form and a user can just select view or edit on that record and it will navigate directly to that record and put it into the proper mode

14264072
getter	setter
setxxx and getxxx are more than conventions - the names are also recognized as getter and setter methods by java beans

for my purposes it s not the actual minimum that i want i just want it to return one number whether it be min max variance standard deviation or any other mathematical equation that gives me one scalar value

14264476
spaces	delimiter
if you want to reuse specific box-shadow values either use the box-shadow mixin with a spaces delimiter list or create your own custom box-shadow mixin

14264775
acs	adfs
the ip-sts you federate with sp does not have to be adfs - it can be anything that supports the ws-federation protocol openam pingidentity azure acs

14264775
iwa	adfs
the reason that you would choose adfs over iwa is that both authenticate against ad but only adfs adds sso and federation functionality

there you should handle get post parameters

14265697

14265942
client-side	server-side
there is either server-side or both client-side and server-side

14265942
client-side	server-side
client-side will also be more responsive than server-side because there s no request-response but that s really only a perceived performance issue for high-latency connections

14265947
background-repeat	background-position	width	height
since the anchor tag has a set width and height with overflow hidden set the anchor tag s background image to the image that it s absolutely positioned over or any image you ve already included but set the background-position to positive pixel values larger than the anchor s width and height and background-repeat to no-repeat

14265947
background-repeat	background-position
if you don t want to worry about setting the background-position don t have control over the size of any dynamically generated images and or aren t concerned about saving bandwidth you could also create and use a small 1x1 clear transparent image set background-repeat if necessary

the issue is that branding sharepoint is a very different skill than building a general site modifying joomla wordpress etc

14266420
qapplication	qcoreapplication	fflush	gets
in my automated qt tests i generally skip the use of qapplication exec in favour of using qcoreapplication haspendingevents and qcoreapplication processevents - this lets you do some prep work fflush the event queue so qt gets a chance to actually show your window do some more work let qt handle any additional events that this has thrown up etc

i know that it s defined in the memory header and can t figure out how to get it to see it no matter where i put the include

14266637

express	node.js
you are looking for express which runs on top of node.js

14266645

the serializable deserialization is all done within the sessioninfo object and you get the benefit of type safe data

14266769
zoo	xts
i want to read this file into a zoo or xts object in r

hide	show
rather than defining new custom classes or using jquery s show and hide methods i d actually advise a third option

14266876

14267023
post	get
webapi doesn t like complex types in a get request as well as it supports url-encoded content in post data in a particular way only

14267023
post	get
as for differentiating between get and post that s quite simple - webapi knows which method you used when sending the request and then it looks for a method name starting with get post or decorated with the httpget post attribute

14267057
post	get
if anyone wants to improve on this and get an exact answer that works do so i still check this post

14267070

14267488
next	except
it looks like your class contains arrays of size zero that shouldn t even be allowed except as the very last data member i have no clue how the compiler allowed you to have two of them and you are writing beyond the boundaries of these arrays which overwrites the next member the metadata of the vertices_ vector

14267510
mongodb	dbref
there is nothing special about the dbref except that it comes pre-bundled with the mongodb driver for most if not all languages as a helper to allow you to query the other row in your application

where the contents of the iframe are built up on the fly and also have their height and width set manually

particularly of use to you will be the widthpixels and heightpixels attributes of this which return the raw pixel height and width for the device

14267928
mdpi	hdpi
i don t agree with answer by michael allen because the resulting resolutions for ldpi mdpi hdpi and xdpi doesn t satisfy the 3 4 6 8 scaling ratios for alternative bitmaps mentioned in the google docs here under alternative drawables

14267928
mdpi	hdpi
now to follow the 3 4 6 8 scaling ratios for alternative drawables sizes for ldpi hdpi and xhdpi we need to derive the unit values from mdpi

14267928
mdpi	hdpi
divide by 4 because scaling ratio for mdpi is 4 scaling ratios for ldpi hdpi and xhdpi are 3 6 and 8 respectively

14269524
hide	show
i have a grid that i created using the jqgrid php api and the choose columns add-on to show hide columns

14269529
for-loop	loops
what the code is supposed to do is run the three for loops and breaks the innermost for-loop if a certain condition happens

14269580
free	malloc
i see a malloc but i don t see a corresponding free

14269580
free	malloc
typically we d expect to see any malloc performed in the _init function and the corresponding free to be in the _deinit function

14269666
for-loop	arrays
weatherdesc and weathericonurl are provided as arrays so you can access by item inside a for-loop

14269667
selecteditem	selectedindex
the symptoms of the bug are that selectionchanged doesn t fire selectedindex selecteditem aren t reliable and that back navigation into a page with panorama resets the panorama selected item

thus they cannot be just copied over and used on vanilla openwrt which ships with uclibc instead of eglibc which seems binary-compatible with gnu libc

14270214
width	height
you should be passing x y width height

14270230
floating-point	integer
in the 1.7.0 development branch it seems they ve changed the implicit casting rule to the more strict same_kind rule which forbids among other things casts between floating-point and integer formats

14270401
google-chrome	firefox
if you want the code to work in both google-chrome and firefox you d have to do something like

14270427
accessor	properties
we are advised not to add behaviour to accessor methods of dependency properties wrappers because they can be bypassed by a direct call to get setvalue

14270431
min	max
in the meantime what you can do is to get the min and max values of each chart that you re creating and then take the max and min of the max min for all charts combined

14270431
min	max
using those max min values you can manually set the min max for each chart with some nice rounding

14270431
min	max
this is similar to how google determines max min values sometimes if you have say -6.2 and 3.1 as values it will use 3.1 for gridlines even though it is an odd number to use

14270435
ostringstream	std
std ostringstream oss

14270445
scipy	scikit-learn
scikit-learn is built on numpy and scipy and so both are dependencies

14270497
sorting	grouping
it is very handy viewing all logs combined and sorting by time or even grouping by occurrence

14270535
google-chrome	safari
well no one replied and this works just fine in safari so it has to be a google-chrome v23.0 bug

14270535
fadein	fadeout
what i did to work around the ghosting of the drag-dropped divs is to fadein fadeout the origin div and that seems to take care of it

14270540
serializable	deserialization
instead they generate il on the fly in memory and use it during subsequent serializable episodes to do serializable and deserialization all within the appdomain they re operating in

14270575
for-loop	loops
you also don t need the for-loop inside the while loops

14270601
folder	directory
i added usr include ni to the â œheader search pathsâ and added libopenni.dylib to the framework folder as well as putting it in the project s directory

14270631
put	get	public	protected	inherited	subclassing
basically as far as i know when you create a base class with a public protected and private section and variables functions in each the public and protected sections will get inherited into the appropriate section of the subclassing defined by class subclassing private base which will take all public and protected members of base and put them into public changing the word private to public puts them all in public and changing it to protected puts them all into protected

14270639
superclass	subclassing
drop is the superclass colordrop and speeddrop are subclassing that extend the superclass

14270652
getter	setter
add additional properties as you see fit and add getter s and setter s for them

14270667
mouseover	mouseout
i registered inline mouseover and mouseout event on the tr element when you mouseover it and then the hover class was added to it

14270675
trie	tree
one possibility would be to use something like a patricia trie to store the data instead of a std map which normally uses a red-black tree

14270678
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome ie9+ the event will fire a series of events including loadstart progress durationchange etc.

14270715
put	get
for my question anyway the relevant part is the last bit of the code where i put a condition ssaying if branch_id is not zero get some array data and if it is return an empty array.the i merged the array together with then query result

14270738
width	height
i m creating a web app that is a fixed window no browser scrolling main page focus doesn t need to be scrolled and for items that do need it they have scrollable divs so there is specific ratio of the width height

14270738
width	height
while most responsive designs focus on just the width i need to make sure both width and height play a role

14270738
width	height
if the ratio is greater than 16 9 or 1.78 16 8 or 2 i will need the height of my outer container to match that of the browser window and for the width of my outer container to then be based upon that height height 1.78

14270738
width	height
therefore i would need to use the width in this case and then use that to base the height width 1.78

14270790
range	minimum
due to the practical limitation of implementation the language defines the minimum range of values that should be held by that type and all valid values in that range must be represented without ambiguity on all known architectures

14270858
put	get
i ve therefore put in the forward declarations to make the code compile but i now get this compiler warning

14270862
button	checkbox
there s 3 text fields 2 radio button and two checkbox

14270889
lxml	libxslt	lxml	libxml2	libxml2	libxslt

14270890
prepare	execute
i am trying to create multiple tables upto 20 via java.sql prepare statement batch execute

14270905
pull	push
regarding continuous deployment i also submitted pull request there which introduce automatic deployments for github projects for now it simply triggers deploy task when somebody push to the master branch

14270947
viewdidload	viewwillappear
if i try to launch v3 from v2 s viewdidload or viewwillappear method i get an error attempt to present whose view is not in the window hierarchy

14270952
min	max
i haven t found anywhere that explains how google determines its max and min axis values sometimes they are very weird

14270952
min	max
the easiest way to handle issues like this is to write a function to determine your own max min axis values

14270972
post	get
if not you really need to post more of your code to get a reasonable answer

14270980
put	get	public	protected	inherited	subclassing
basically as far as i know when you create a base class with a public protected and private section and variables functions in each the public and protected sections will get inherited into the appropriate section of the subclassing defined by class subclassing private base which will take all public and private members of base and put them into public changing the word private to public puts them all in public and changing it to protected puts them all into protected

14270980
public	protected
furthermore there are 3 kinds of inheritance for classes private which is the default protected and public

14270980
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
each of them changes the access level of a class properties and methods when inherited by a subclassing

14270980
public	protected
if we order the access levels in this manner public protected private from the least protected to the most protected then we can define the inheritance modifiers as raising the access levels of the inherited class fields to at least the level they designate in the derived class ie

14270980
public	protected
public fields become protected public level is raised to protected

14271071
superclass	subclassing
since objective-c is duck-typed this isn t as serious an issue as it would be in another language but basically if someone creates an object of your b subclassing and passes it to code that expects the a superclass that code might set the property with an x instead of a y

14271093
installation	upgrade	migrate	upgrade
i saw this in an old wordpress installation i was trying to migrate and upgrade

14271110
public	protected
then all public members of base class are public in derived class protected members are protected and private members are inaccessible

14271110
public	protected
they are inaccessible and not non-existent because there can be some member functions in protected and public sections in base class which access the private members of base class

14271110
public	protected
thus we need all those private members of base which are accessed by public and protected member functions of base for their functionality

14271110
public	protected
note every private member has to be accessed directly or indirectly through another private member function which in turn is called by a public protected member function by a public protected meber function else it has no use

14271110
public	protected
so we know till now that a private member variable of base class has its use in derived class for the functionality of its public protected member functions

14271110
public	protected
for public inheritance it means that all the accessible members of base class that is the public and protected members can not be at a level more permissive than public

14271110
public	protected
since public is the most permissive level public and protected members remain public

14271110
public	protected
thus the level of each base class member in derived class is the lesser of their level in derived class and the type of inheritance public protected private

14271110
public	protected
for them private and protected members are inaccessible but they do exist and can be accessed by the public member functions

14271164
action-filter	onactionexecuting
then onactionexecuting or onactionexecuting in a base controller or via action-filter you can add your data to whichever place you prefer to

14271210
for-loop	arrays
it seems i should be using publish on each image in the for-loop and then using process to put them as elements in the arrays

14271247
rubygems	bundler
usr lib rubygems 1.8 gems bundler-1.2.1 lib bundler rubygems_integration.rb 157 in require

i have n rectangles each of a random size random width height

14271264
put	get
i am trying to put an inset box shadow on a google calender and cannot seem to get it to show up unless the z-index is a negative

14271328
put	get
i would put my personal medical history in here but the impact of contravening privacy laws may push it up to humiliating if people find out or financial if you get sued or prosecuted

14271352
button	checkbox
this means that you can create three button or 3 radio selection boxes or two checkbox and a button or whatever that will run javascript when checked

14271358
hide	show
because as you hide the parent div it wouldn t show the inner div

14271407
pop-up	dialog
i could then emulate the waiting behavior of dialogbox dialogboxparam outside the main thread by waiting on an event that was signaled when the user clicked tapped a button on my xaml dialog pop-up

14271453
client-side	server-side
bind the client-side growl component to a server-side instance of the same component

14271486
subclass	abstract-class
my food package contains one abstract-class fruit and another subclass of class fruit as apple

14271486
folder	directory
when i run the program i can see the following folder inside the build class directory

14271493
cells	tablecell
i have a table view each cells is a custom tablecell view have a subview the subview use coretext draw text

14271536
min	max
if you are looking to apply min max sum or prod these functions already exist as

14271555
width	height
though in datagridcellstyle i have defined cell value as width and height as 50

14271555
width	height
but when i load datagrid with 9 rows its height is showing 452 instead of 450 9 50 and in the same way width also showing more than that

14271566
datamapper	activerecord
the app server can preferably rails or any other popular one which fully supports mvc framework using activerecord or datamapper design patterns

14271663
backgrounding	multitasking
ios multitasking backgrounding tasks

14271789
folder	directory
i d like to take the files in the specified folder and move them up one directory so that the file structure looks like this

14271795
portrait	landscape
the lcd is portrait 320x480 and i need to run the screen in landscape orientation 480x320

14271805
rss	feed
i have an rss feed that i m parsing

14271808
for-loop	loops
prior to each loops so in each for-loop the if statement conditions are never true hence the variables second third etc

14271855
width	height
use this to get height and width

14271874
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
also if you use a browser like firefox + firebug safari google-chrome or even ie8+ you could test such an operation as quickly as hitting f12

14271890
free	malloc
if the size gets too large you can use malloc instead of course but you have to make sure you free the space too

14271978
int	double
main.progressbar.setvalue int i+1 double images.size 100

14271978
int	double
what this ll do is it ll ensure that i+1 is being divided by a decimal capable data-type which ll return the more inclusive data type double in this case and then it ll divide a double by an int which ll be no problem because it ll still return a double because it s more inclusive

14271993
spaces	delimiter
other rows are blank with only a first actual entry but followed by 3 tab delimiter single spaces

14272011
put	get	post	get	post	put
get is an http methods like put post delete

14272053
wxpython	pyqt
i came across a few sites saying libraries in python will serve the purpose. wxpython tkinter pyqt

14272061
google-chrome	firefox
the example below works in google-chrome but not in firefox or ie

14272069
for-loop	arrays
to your inner for-loop this will continue filling the arrays from the beginning of the word

14272072
inherited	subclassing
any classes that you do not want to have inherited that implementation should directly subclassing mybaseclass rather than myclass

14272093
post	put
i can say that your form tag needs to submit to the correct action with an expected method likely post or put

14272093
post	get
an atypical but possibly quick change would be to allow both get and post requests

14272154
hide	show
keep in mind the first page load will put an item into your history array so depending on where you check to see if you should show or hide your history button you ll compare the length of your history array to either 0 or 1

14272198
for-loop	arrays
when you set up your arrays and your for-loop try to check if you are still in bounds of your string with a size or length function of your container

14272219
folder	directory
i have a parent directory inside which there are multiple project folder

14272251
google-chrome	firefox
firefox has a text-only zoom feature unlike google-chrome that lacks this feature

14272274
post	get
note that i need to retrieve only the result from get default1 to show it as a result at post default1

14272321
post	get
so you can pass this id to update action like or via post method then you can get this id in your update action then fetch data for this id

14272321
post	get
assuming you have get id via post

14272352
prepare	execute
and when i try to execute query like that i get a syntax error it s a prepare statement

14272358
portrait	landscape
also for tablet you can save image in the res-port-large or res-port-xlarge and res-land-large or res-land-xlarge for portrait and landscape respectively

14272358
folder	directory
create below folder in root directory of the project

14272375
for-loop	loops
i have the same for-loop concept here too so loops runs 5lac times

14272407
width	height
you have to specify the height and width in the element attributes or css because it s not going to download the video file header at all until you start playing

14272407
width	height
set the video to position absolute and height and width both to 100

14272417
width	height
right now this works in updating the text after you are finished resizing the #img1 div but i would prefer if the pixel height and width could be shown and updated as you are dragging the jquery resizable handle

14272428
getter	setter	accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
approach by default when you synthesize the getter and setter accessor methods it is assumed that the properties and ivar have the same name

14272428
getter	setter
this can make it confusing at first glance as to when you are using the getter setter methods and when you are accessing the ivar directly

14272453
getter	setter
so i have chosen jaxb parser.for my requirement i could not create getter setter for all xml tags

14272490
getter	setter
jackson renowned for its json processor also has xml parsing support and it does a great job of reflection so that it does the parsing even when there are no getter and setter

affinity	processors
if i set my processors affinity for my process like so

14287680
cpu	affinity
while it would be highly unfeasible to create a test that would exercise every possible code path in tpl you can certainly setup a test that would benefit from many available cores set the affinity mask to 1 cpu and observe through task manager that the affinity never changes and cpu utilization is never more than 1 n where n is the # of cores present

14287680
cpu	affinity
you could also expand that test to have an affinity of m cores and observe that cpu utilization m n

cpu	affinity
on a side note it is seldom a good idea to explicitly set the cpu affinity

curb	libcurl
i ran system commands of libcurl in 20+ concurrent threads and it was 10 x fasters than running curb in 20+ concurrent threads

14287924
google-chrome	firefox
i believe it requires firefox but might have been ported to google-chrome as well

14287931
width	text-align
and if you want css-solution for unknown width block centering you can use inline-block and text-align center

getter	setter
i am working on some legacy code created by someone in love with spaghetti code that has over 150 getter and over 150 setter

14287947
vb.net	vb6
it exists to help vb6 programmers move to vb.net coding vb6 strongly encouraged using the form s type name

14287967
subtract	add
the instruction set might have some simple instructions like add subtract as long as the cpu performs the bit accurate instruction you should not care about the implementation

14287973
multiplying	add
for example a multiplying by a large constant is probably shortest using the multiplying instruction but could be slower or faster than several shift and add operations depending on the underlying implementation

14287980
preorder	inorder
a book i m reading claims that one way to check whether a binary tree b is a subtree of a binary tree a is to build the inorder and preorder strings strings that represent the inorder and preorder traversal of each tree of both trees and check whether inorder_b is a substring of inorder_a and preorder_b is a substring of preorder_a

14287980
preorder	inorder
note that it claims that you have to check substring match on both the inorder and preorder strings

14288002
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
as other things are being used in the category i suggest that you subclass uinavigationbar instead and thus subclass uinavigationcontroller replacing the navigationbar property with the subclass uinavigationbar

14288002
getter	setter
properties work the same in the .h method but differently with the setter and getter methods when it comes to categories

14288036
google-chrome	firefox
use the built in tools or available plugins for any browser out there like firebug for firefox or google-chrome s developer tools

14288036
post	get
each have a network tab that you can use to see all get post requests and responses to any type of resource

14288041
onresume	onpause
now what s curious is that if i put the app in the background and then re-open it so onpause and onresume are called the ui that loads is refreshed properly with old view artifacts removed

14288054
portrait	landscape
as you can see i ve set .item1 to portrait dimensions and .item2 to landscape dimensions

14288066
google-chrome	firefox
it led me to some testing the results are obviously the same on google-chrome console and firefox s firebug

14288131
width	height
attributes inside html tags - basically anything that adds any sort of styling like height color font width border etc

14288142
jquery	bpopup
i am using bpopup plugin for jquery and all is working fine except clicking

14288144
google-chrome	firefox
if you were to open the page in firefox and go to file - print preview i bet it would look very similar to what you are seeing in google-chrome

14288146
post	get
i want to get and display post which have this category

14288152
width	height
it s not good enough set the width to be the height and vice versa when in landscape i need the right values

14288152
portrait	landscape
if i hold my device in landscape mode when launching it is correct but if i make it landscape then lay the ipad flat down leaving the dashboard as landscape and then launch it then the landscape-splash shows up but that code think it s in portrait

14288194
ggplot2	lattice
please only base r solutions no ggplot2 no lattice

14288203
google-chrome	firefox
also if you just want to see how things interact developer tools on the browser comes in really handy if u r on windows linux using firefox or google-chrome u can try ctrl+f12

14288226
versioning	upgrade
i guess you are using lower versioning of java you need to either upgrade your java versioning to 7 or remove string from switch and use supported types

14288235
public	protected
i understand the differences of const readonly static const as well as public protected and private while i seldom see protected is used in c#

14288235
getter	setter	public	protected
should them be public const or public readonly or private constant or private readonly and use public getter setter for subclass to use or should them be defined as protected

14288283
apache	nginx
just install another webserver like apache nginx

14288326
put	get
so use urllib urllib2 or requests or heck even scrapy to request a web page learn how to put together the url to a google search or the php get request of a lyrics website

14288350
portrait	landscape
1- when a device is face up or down the device reverts to the last orientation prior to it being face up or down since those 2 orientations do not tell you necessarily on their own whether the device is portrait or landscape

14288350
viewdidload	viewwillappear
2- when viewdidload is called the bounds have not been set so you need to put any calls that pertain to the orientation in viewwillappear or viewdidlayoutsubviews

14288354
getter	setter
you don t necessarily need to create getter setter methods at class-creation time

14288363
hide	show
as i understand you want to show b when cursor on a or b and hide b when cursor leaves a and b

14288363
hide	show
also probably you can put b inside a and show hide it with just css

14288365
post	get
it is also possible to use the post method instead of get to pass a value

14288377
ready	each
what i m trying to figure out is how to make each set of workerprogram.exe launched at the same time tell or signal or i can t figure out the proper term the launcherprogram.exe that each process has completed the initialization step and is ready to begin

button	checkbox
i am using this example as a guide to build a checkbox button set

14288391
opengl-es	glreadpixels
this is related to opengl-es 2.0 glreadpixels with float or half_float textures

14288392
children	parent
if you have a tree data structure where each node owns its children those child pointers would be smart pointers -- but then if you want to hold a pointer to your parent it d be a raw pointer because it s not managing the lifetime of what it points to

14288469
awt	swing
but i would suggest you take a look at painting in awt and swing before you delve to much further this will give you a deeper understanding of how painting works

14288471
versioning	upgrade
your code is right but the string support for switch-case constructs were introduced in java7 jdk1.7 so your error means that you have an older java versioning and you have to upgrade it

14288508
fuzzy	stemming
oracle s text indexing supports fuzzy matching and stemming which is a start but consider these names

14288575

according to the linux man page i should be able to raise the singal test for the eintr value in the thread that is doing the sem_wait but that seems to be missing in freebsd

14288582
vlan	packets
my problem is that after setting of this type of packets on socket when i try to receive some packets i can t read the vlan id from the packets of course from the header of the packets the vlan_tci is ever 0

14288582
vlan	packets
my simple project is based on these functions all called by the function createsocket then there is a simple method that is reading packets on the socket and there i try to get informations on vlan id there there is also the relative part used before with the tpacket_v1

14288675
getter	setter
i got this private variable let say _var int and it has a setter and getter

14288689
x86	64bit
are you writing code that is super-portable or will it only run on 32- and 64bit x86 windows for example

14288689
int	double
the other end just need to conver the text back to strings int floats double whatever you need

14288740
folder	directory
i would copy that swc to your project directory under your libs folder if you have one and then point to it in the actionscript build path section under library path in your project properties

14288758
width	height
however when i change the width or height parameters the images are not scalled proportionally

14288768
sidekiq	god
try using god to monitor sidekiq

14288822
google-chrome	firefox
the images do not display in google-chrome firefox or ie

14288822
google-chrome	firefox
in both google-chrome and firefox the buttons are still there and usable but the images are not

14288829
robocopy	xcopy
xcopy or robocopy

14288857
folder	directory
a zip file folder would have sfgao_stream sfgao_droptarget along with sfgao_folder so if you can read the shell item as stream then it probably isn t a directory

14288860
nswindow	nspanel
if you don t want the semi-transparency you could change nspanel in ib under custom class from nspanel to nswindow

14288901
put	get
i put together an implementation of iprocesshostpreloadclient that will fire off a real request to the application in order to get all the machinery running

if you want to write a game that sits on a computer desktop laptop as an application and runs on it then your options are swing awt or eclipse swt

14288915
awt	swing
in that case you need to look into javascript or swing awt

hide	show
when i hide then show a tab it appears last rather than first

14288958
int	boolean
public boolean oneditoraction textview v int actionid keyevent event

hide	show
i use 2 divs div1 is startpage div2 menu if they mouseover a image div1 hide and div2 comes up and show the menu

14288980
hide	show
i created a notificationview for the purpose defined its content property and provided two handlers to show and hide the view

14288987
prepare	execute
i would prefer using a prepare and execute functions so the variables are kept seperately

14289010
width	height
what i m seeing is a jagged shaky jittery movement which i assume might be because decimal values for left top width height not lining up well enough to keep it centered always

14289010
width	height
edit i ve begun to think maybe if i could write an easing function that would increase the width height by 2 every time the left top decreases by 1 to make it stay center all the time but i m not sure how to go about that in jquery

14289011
int	boolean
here in the algorithm for checkednodes and visitednodes i use sets they - with int indexes - can be easily implemented by arrays of boolean or something similar

14289082
google-chrome	firefox
this happens because we re using an http 301 permanent redirect which browsers like google-chrome and firefox will cache by default

14289173
getter	setter
below is an example of how one can use setter getter in actionscript

14289173
getter	setter
some developers prefer this approach because it s more obvious that explicitly calling a function suggests additional programmation while traditional actionscript setter and getter do not

14289303
typedef	struct
struct can be subclassed and can contain methods virtual functions enumerations typedef sub-structs and more

14289316
writetofile	nsdata
if you want to write the pdf you need to get the nsdata object representing the pdf create a path to the file then use the nsdata writetofile options error method to save the data to the file

14289354
min	max
so this string min 300px and max 600px min 800px

14289354
min	max
would end up as min 320px and max 620px min 820px

14289410
google-chrome	firefox
using .val works fine in firefox and ie to get the field s value number or letter but in google-chrome not so much

14289428
min	max
since you stated you want the sizable border but not allow it to be resized you can set the min and max size as well

14289466
children	parent
you can use id s for the parent and match the children with the id if you plan on changing names a lot

14289522
emacs	sublimetext	emacs	textmate	textmate	sublimetext	textmate	bbedit

public	protected
the class exposes a protected or even public method to fire it directly but that doesn t happen usually in the .net classes

14289608
children	parent
since only an actor can create its children the parent actors would have to respond to messages for creating their child actors either other parent actors or leaf actors somehow coming up with a way to select which actor subclass to instantiate for the leaf actors

14289641
post	put
this is for people who view this post - i wound up going with the solution i initially put together in the jsfiddle that used a simple javascript to mimic fixed x

14289650
macports	homebrew
i don t see either macports or homebrew mentioned in other answers here but since i do see them mentioned elsewhere on stack overflow for related questions i ll add my own us 0.02 that many folks seem to consider macports as not only a package manager for packages in general as of today they list 16311 packages ports 2931 matching python albeit only for macs but also as a decent maybe better package manager for python packages modules

14289676
put	get
this what i used but the code of if statements and nested if statements get very long in code number but it can be easier to debug if you put nice commenting in

14289680
min	max
essentially you build a tree of max and min levels where the nodes each have a branching factor equal to the number of possible actions at each turn 4 in your case

14289795
width	height
my next step is adding the height and width to each instatiation of the object this is where i have a problem wrapping my head around the object concept

14289795
width	height
i have a little function that is getting the natural height and width of the referencing thumbnail

14289800
setinterval	settimeout
constant checks - like using in setinterval or settimeout but this would be unnecessary processing and you will never get instant append unless you will perform processing-heavy checks all the time

14289809
post	get
i want to get the public post from user only

when someone clicks the class changes and show to the user but i d also like the to hide when the is clicked for the second time

14289870
glfw	glew
edit if it is useful to know i am using glfw and glew

14289963
for-loop	loops
the error occurs because you define response in the for-loop but if loops doesn t run that variable is never set

14289979
wxpython	pygtk
keep in mind my python script is very simple and does not use any libraries like pygtk or wxpython

14289986
textmate	sublimetext
according to textmate and sublimetext aren t doing the right thing

14290002
xslt	schematron
you have to either move to xsd 1.1 the only freely available processor that i know of is xerces and that is in beta status or augment your xsd 1.0 model with schematron the latter being xslt 1.0 2.0 based you have options galore

14290104
mpmath	sympy
sympy uses mpmath and gmpy behind the scenes

14290115
implements	extends
you need to define members as because even thought dvd implements extends comparable does not implements extends - this is called covariance contravariance and is not supported in java

14290151
button	checkbox
the problem is in fact that adding focusable elements like checkbox or button disables the ability to click the overall list item and their focusability has to be disabled

14290176
bash	tcsh
other linux builds might use bash so simply replace tcsh with bash and you should be fine

14290197
listview	gridview
you could make them custom buttons in a tablelayout or use a gridview and incorporate it like a listview

14290208
range	minimum
i made four functions xminwall etc. so you can plot on the wall at the x y range minimum maximum walls

udp	tcp
i m wanting to write in a small tcp server or udp or namedpipe doesn t really matter where i can have a debug application...so basically the service runs all the time and has this listener server tcp or otherwise and is always writing debug messages to the server if i need to debug the server i should be able to connect to it using a tcp client or whatever protocol and read any debug messages or anything where i would typically use console.writeline message

14290277
width	height
the trick is in using the window.screen object which returns availwidth availheight availleft and availtop values as well as width and height

14290311
hide	show
instead of click use the touch events which have down and up and a lot of other stuff and for the darkening and lightening i would use a semi opaque colored box that you show hide depending on the situation

14290329
ontouchevent	ondraw
for example you can extend a view and add touch event positions to a path in ontouchevent motionevent event method of your view.then you have to generate random positions correspond to newest touch event and add their to other instances of path.finally in ondraw method of your view draw all paths.i hope this snippet help you to understand my idea

14290341
put	get
i m not sure what you re using to get that right-click functionality unless its built into a particular browser but either way the answer is no unless you are going to generate a new file on your server to put as a glass-pane over the canvas for right-click purposes

14290376
post	get
finally this post shows how to use the extrafont-package so that you get better looking fonts rendered in your output

14290459
jquery	simplemodal
i was working on a jquery simplemodal

14290459
width	height
so what i cannot achieve is if i am setting a width and height to that modal and if the users browser screen resolution changes ctrl + or ctrl - the size of the modal will varies

14290508
uiview	subviews
you need to create your own uiview with a text field and buttons that you can add as a subviews over and on top of anything else in the view that s currently visible

14290522
oncreate	ondestroy	onresume	onpause
remove it from manifest and try to register it using registerreceiver broadcastreceiver myreceiver intentfilter filter in your oncreate or onresume and when you want to unregister it use unregisterreceiver broadcastreceiver myreceiver in your onpause or ondestroy

pointer-to-member	non-type
while a pointer-to-member to a member of a base can be converted to a pointer-to-member to the a derived type for the particular case of a non-type non-template template parameter that conversion is not allowed

14290534
queue	fifo
update replaysubject replays the first x it is not a fifo queue it is a first x list

14290566
sorting	filtering
in that case the optimizer is likely to perform better using the index on columna and sorting the 1000 result rows rather than reading the whole 1 000 000 row table in the order of the index on columnb and columnc and selecting the 1 in a 1000 rows that satisfy the filtering condition

14290569
strcpy	strncpy
notice the routine is strncpy not strcpy

14290589
background-position	background-size
css3 background-size and some background-position center trickery

14290593
post	get
this sounds similar to this post and it looks like you might get close with something like this

14290654
width	height
set the x and y values to the position you need you can calculate this position by figuring out the stage width and height and dividing by 2 along with the width and height of the swf.

14290696
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i ve checked in up-to-date versions of google-chrome safari and firefox on mac os x 10.7.5

14290697
dbcontext	objectcontext
the compiledquery probably worked in the past because entity framework versions prior to 4.1 created an object derived from objectcontext instead of dbcontext for you to manage your entities

14290751
put	get
the time complexity of operations like get put is o logn

14290796
put	get
i think hashmap is perfectly fine for your case since the time complexity for both put and get operations is o 1

14290855
width	height
also try adding a float left to the .slider_blog_img class and removing the set width and height for now

14290860
client-side	server-side
dbas want you to believe that just because a complex query can be done with a sql statement that it should like how server-siders think all client-side should be done with server-side or how client-siders think layouts should be done with client-side instead of css

14290881
stdout	stderr
to prefix both stdout and stderr

14290965
implements	extends
you need to implements your customarrayadapter by extends any adapter class

14290965
hide	show
from that you have to check using any flag whether it was saved entry or not if yes then show your first textview otherwise just empty hide your textview

14290965
implements	extends
now you have to implements getview whichever you adapter extends it

14291020

codeigniter	cakephp
we ve decided to use cakephp for a login system and frontend database ui because of all the automagic when adhering to its strict conventions i know codeigniter and with codeigniter you can extend the system controller in system core controller.php to handle authentication

vim	emacs
i have recently started using emacs after using vim for a long time now like many others out there and i personally feel that vim movement keys and text objects are one of the best things an editor can have

14291335
width	height
so the problem i m having is that i have multiple div s all with the same class applied to them text i have not set a width or a height to these div s and am allowing them to auto-size to the text that is in them which is of course of varying width

14291439

its very simple for automatic tasks in linux based servers we used cron jobs

14291507
gif	png
a problem i have come across is that you usually provide specific formats that the user can use i.e jpg png jpeg gif etc

14291507
gif	png
problem is that suppose you have a profile picture some may upload a jpeg some png and some gif

14291514
dlsym	dlopen
but using dlopen of a .so then dlsym is much simpler because dlopen is doing the relocation after having mmap -ed segments from t.so see below

14291530
width	height
in fact i also tested isotope without using the width and height attributes like this

14291530
width	height
it seems that the width and height in the css do override the image properties and before the images get loaded the browser does not know how much space to allocate and then even after the images load the spacing is still wrong at least with isotope

14291530
width	height
or at least this should be documented that one needs to use the inline style for the width and height of the image rather than the properties

14291544
dictionary	map
the above dictionary object is a map category_id - product_count

14291567
post	get

packets	pcap	solaris	bsd
what s probably happening is that you re running on a platform where the timeout behaves the way it does with bpf bsd os x solaris or windows with winpcap wherein the underlying packets capture mechanism that pcap is using does not deliver packets immediately but buffers up a batch of packets and delivers them to pcap either when the buffer fills up or when the timeout expires and -1 is either being interpreted as no timeout or a very long timeout

cout can only process types it knows about string chars int etc

14300639

14300782
min	max
aabb axis aligned bounding box its sides correspond to the min max x y coords of the rotated image

14300804

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
if you would take a minute to look at it in firefox what you will see is exactly what i intended but if you look at it in google-chrome or safari it does not work correctly but displays the same strange errors in both - omitted animations timing way off

14300879
google-chrome	safari
also google-chrome safari and ie show an image missing on left of screen but there is nothing that should be there

14300906

it doesn t affect only 64bit os s i just verified on both x86 and x64 windows 7 pro

14301071
post	get
when i read book regarding the life cycle of servlet it says that it first calls the service method then the service method calls another method to handle specific http request get or post .but when i try this out i find that the doget or dopost method are firstly called before the service method being called

14301087
webstorm	aptana
you should try aptana or webstorm the second one is not free but worth the required value

14301087
express	node.js
webstorm has a default node.js and express project available

14301150
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
i understand that using a bufferedreader wrapping a filereader is going to be significantly slower than using a bufferedinputstream wrapping a fileinputstream because the raw bytes have to be converted to characters

14301152
spaces	delimiter

14301491
for-loop	loops
the intent of this code is much clearer but the intent would be clearest using a for-loop the standard way initializing the same variable in the initialization which the condition of loops depends on and which is changed at the end of each loops

14301491
std	ostream
it has to do with using inserting using into std cout into std ostream in general

14301491
std	ostream
it has to do with formatting double output using std ostream precision

14301491
std	ostream
this cannot be achieved in any obvious way by using std ostream precision

14301496
put	get
so you put the reliability to create new instances to a single central factory class and you get code such as

14301564
hide	show
home.php show 5 entries but show only 1 entry by same users hide the others

14301572
apache	nginx
if the only reason you re using apache is to serve the initial page i would suggest the nginx in that case because it is more lightweight but i haven t tested it by myself

leiningen	ring
i have looked more thoroughly at how ring and leiningen work together and it seems that the simplest way for you to get what you want is as follows

14301756
mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown
the weird part is that the mouseup mousedown and mousemove events of the outermost button don t even trigger iff the imagesource of the image isn t null an image is loaded

14301775
mouseevent	keyevent
i use keyevent listener mouseevent listener for all keys on keyboard

14301777
put	get
and your last argument is depth type...not array...so it should be -1 if watermark and roi are of the same depth or you put the depth value you want to put...if you note in the docs the final value is a saturated value ...that is if it exceeds 255 its being pulled down to 255...so no wonder if you subtract you wont get the two exact value

14301783
mouse	keyboard
i ve tried autoit and sikuli but it seems that mouse clicks and keyboard send type commands are somehow ignored

14301785
google-chrome	firefox
intended browsers modern firefox google-chrome

14301817
post	get
when you submit an html form it usually sends form s data to the server using either get or post data html headers

14301817

14301950
move	drag
you ll have to resize move your existing fields and field headings to make space click on them to show resize handles then drag the new field from the field explorer to the details section in the space created

14302171
vim	emacs
i m using the wonderful evil package for vim bindings in emacs

14302209
vim	emacs
so i was exploring vim and came across the evil package for emacs

14302209
vim	emacs
so i definitely recommend any emacs pinky or thumb sufferers to try evil-mode and learn the vim bindings

14302511
width	height
and please note that the width and height arguments of your tobitmapimage method are currently unused

14302533
apache	nginx
most likely the reason why this works on your local machine but not in your productive environment is that .htaccess is supported by apache while nginx does not bother wasting i o and cpu time parsing this files

14302537
textarea	textbox
main problem is that it is not showing the value of the textarea and the select box which i manually updated through phpmyadmin but it shows the ones in the textbox just fine

14302545
google-chrome	safari
html5 video is not widely supported enough yet in my opinion but can play most formats in the most modern browsers google-chrome safari

14302551
width	height
one method divide x y by the screen width and height resulting in a float from 0.0 to 1.0 and then multiply those 2 factors to 2nd device s screen width and height

14302581
boost	stl
or find one that already exists and extend it i d start looking into the stl or boost for an existing matrix class

inside the root directory i also have created scraper folder which has a couple of files inside it

14302696
superclass	subclassing
i have build a subclassing from a class in java that has private methods which i want to access in the subclassing i cannot change or edit the superclass

14302819
vmware	virtualbox
it is not clear to me then how this differs from any other x86 virtual machine technology such as qemu virtualbox vmware or virtual pc which would be cycle accurate by virtue of actually directly running instructions on the hardware as well as running at core speeds

14302885
portrait	landscape
use android screenorientatin portrait or landscape it will force the app to run in the mode you specify

14302935

14302946
avd	galaxy
i m trying to create a galaxy s2 avd to test an application that doesn t render well on that phone

14302973
width	height
if you would like to have a flexible layout with columns so that there is only one one small screens two on bigger ones and three in maximum you will also have to use floats combined with min- max- width height

14302997
width	margin
this code simply draws a margin whos width is pre-defined in the values folder and then colors it with a pre-defined color from colors.xml

14303016
google-chrome	firefox
it works the way it should in firefox and google-chrome but not in internet explorer where the chart simply does not show up at all

14303024
inherited	subclassing
also note that annotations are not inherited to subclassing

14303064
gridview	detailsview
this part of the code allows me to show order details in gridview when data bound with detailsview

14303101
hide	show
call your controller s action with ajax...show a loading image before ajax call...and hide the loading image in oncomplete event of ajax function...and also show appropriate success and error message

14303118
getter	setter
this is mediated access via the setter getter

14303118
getter	setter	accessor	properties
a properties encapsulates declaration of instance variables and creation of default getter and setter so you do not need to make a separate variable declaration and you only need to make your own accessor if you need to change the default behaviour

14303127
put	get
note however that you have to put some type annotation for get in order to force the polymorphic type otherwise the inferred type is

14303128
put	get
for instance when i put in my hand written soapxml some invalid parameters i get a 500 error back with xml explaining the problem if i set everything correctly i get a 200 ok with an xml body following the header

14303137
width	height
when the system asks the video for it s width x height it is returning 640x480 when it should be returning 852x480

14303137
width	height
either way i have circumvented it by adding what i know the video s width and height is to my code

14303142
width	height
but to make it look really pretty i set the width height and it s position as well as the buffer size and set all the menus to have it all fit perfectly in the window.

14303182
google-chrome	firefox
i checked your site in firefox and google-chrome

14303185
maven	pom.xml
more explicitely as nwinler said when you release maven try to commit the modified pom.xml

14303258
hash	md5
a good idea that would also ensure better-than-crc message integrity is to send back an md5 or other hash of the incoming message

14303265
post	get
i have created an app and with the help of app id app secret code i can get the access token and then get the post by the user successfully with the following url

14303322
google-chrome	firefox
i have the same issue with firefox and google-chrome

14303338
getter	setter
outside of getter setter inits and deallocs use the self

14303341
int	double
when you pass an int argument but use a printf specifier for double remember that a float is converted to a double in this situation then most c implementations pass the int argument according to their usual rules for passing a int argument to a variadic function a function that accepts diverse argument types but the printf routine interprets the machine state as if it were passed a double argument as described below

14303341
floating-point	integer
many modern platforms specify that integer arguments under a certain size are passed in general registers floating-point arguments are passed in floating-point registers and other arguments are passed on the stack

14303341
int	double
if this platform pushes both arguments onto the stack then printf finds the bits for your int but it interprets those bits as if they were a double

14303341
int	double
this results in printf printing a value determined by your int but it bears no obvious relationship to your int because the bits have entirely different meanings in the encodings for int and for double

14303341
int	double
if this platform puts an int argument in one place but a double argument in another place then printf finds some bits that have nothing at all to do with your int argument

14303341
int	double
you can also get a mix with printf looking for eight bytes of a double by taking four bytes of the int you passed along with four bytes of whatever else was nearby

14303364
getter	setter
the comment just has getter ans setter

14303416
mouseup	mousedown
to improve your user experience slowness you should paint on mousedown mouseup events

14303488
button	checkbox
it has child classes button checkbox list

14303490
bluestacks	android-emulator
i could ignore the bluestacks problem of course but it seems popular and i use it as a development android-emulator

14303490
mp4	webm
would it ignore the webm movie since it can t play it and play the mp4 movie instead or would it fall over saying it didn t recognise the type

14303525
onchange	onblur
you have lots of events over p inputtext where you can make your call onblur onchange .

14303535
try-catch	exception-handling
what i understood from the documentation is that you can execute your desired method and if it has an exception-handling the exceptionmanager handles it and it does not need any try-catch block

14303606
button	checkbox
i have a list of students with checkbox along them so that the user can select checkbox and after clicking on the remove button those are removed from the list meaning i insert them in a different table

14303608
union	distinct
you can use union clause union will check for duplicates and only distinct rows will be returned

14303700
portrait	landscape
i would like the loading vc has the same bg image as launch but because it is a universal app i can t set a simple uiimage imagenamed default.png because it can running on iphone or ipad and if ipad can be launched in portrait or landscape iphone apps always start in portrait

14303710
background-color	transparency
i just want to override the background-color from white to transparency

14303745
rss	feed
i am parsing rss feed with php into a mysql database

14303747
pascal	delphi
you don t mention your compiler but in active versions of pascal delphi or fpc if you have the rectangles in a trect named rect you can simply do

14303749
portrait	landscape
there is no suffix for portrait and landscape

14303785
put	get
then you can put some png resources a blue a yellow and a red and at runtime get correct bitmap write the text on the bitmap by code and then set as the custom-marker with the frombitmap bitmap image method

14303798
zfcuser	bjyauthorize
probably the most fitting ones here would be zf-commons zfcuser and bjyoungblood bjyauthorize

14303807
swt	swing	awt	swing
it s hard to program a swt awt swing bridge on your own

14303850
versioning	upgrade
i have one managed item which is upgrade to premium versioning

14303851
zlib	libpng	zlib	libharu	libpng	libharu
this resulted me to rebuild those three libraries zlib libpng and libharu more than time times for the last four days

14303875
int	chars
the specific reason that you have to pay close attention to byte-order when handling ipv4 address and port numbers is that the structures sockaddr_in and in_addr have data members with int types larger than chars and whose contents are required to be in network byte order

14304039
hash	salt
use salt to make your hash more secure safe password hashing and

14304039
hash	salt
secure hash and salt for php passwords

14304129
pull	push
the github notifications api does not provide a way to work with notifications in a push model so the best you can do is pull them every so often with cron

14304172
post	get
your form tag ends before select box so move it below select box and you should get your post values related to chosen upload dir

14304193
quad	uniform
pass- 2 set screen quad and attach the texture from the previous pass as sampler uniform

14304193
post	put
for the glow there are many ways of doing it.for example you can draw the silhouette of the planet in the first pass give it color fill of your glow and then bluring it using smoothstep .then in post -process pass you put it under the main planet texture

14304217
setinterval	settimeout
thus the setinterval and settimeout timings are affected when you switch the current tab if you re using google chrome you can see the memory usage of each tab by pressing shift+esc

14304224
getter	setter
and technically that s not a getter that s a setter

14304224
getter	setter	mutators	getter	mutators	setter
what i mean is if it mutates state you ve got a mutators setter rather than accessor getter even if you name it following the get convention and return some stuff

14304314
devise	cancan	devise	rolify	rolify	cancan
the project also uses devise cancan and rolify for user handling

14304346
implements	extends
i ll assume you implements a custom authentication provider with a custom securityfactoryinterface implementation that extends from symfony bundle securitybundle dependencyinjection security factory abstractfactory

14304346
post	get
finally when your authentication provider handles logins make sure you request the remember me feature by having an http get or post parameter named _remember_me with value 1 in the http request

14304361
rvm	bundler
rvm is great and i have been using gemsets but after reading a few blog posts i have decided use switch to rbenv and use bundler to manage my gems exclusively as outlined in ruby rogues episode 45

14304416
hide	show
you also have to handle the show hide of it when there is or isn t an iad available and the resize of the content view to make room for displaying the subview

14304432

when focusing on one edittext the keyboard show up and hide some stuff

14304472
width	height
and also why the point is store height width so that is - y x

14304483
folder	directory
well if you know that your private folder will be one directory level above you can do something like this

14304483
folder	directory
if the root folder will be more than one level above in the directory structure you can always do this

14304516
apache	nginx
i m using nginx as a load balancer behind which are the apache application servers

14304518
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it displays fine in firefox safari and google-chrome

14304525
width	height
of course you ll have to adjust the x y width and height of the image and mask as they will then be in user co-ordinates rather than bounding box co-ordinates

14304542
hide	fadeout	hide	show	fadein	fadeout	fadein	hide
use show and hide instead of fadein and fadeout to see if it works

14305852
prepare	execute
use prepare statement when execute sql queries using sqlalchemy.sql.expression.text method

14305892
client-side	server-side
in both cases there will be a trace of the error in the postgresql error log unless you ve muted it there too but that s a separate problem that is generally solved by using a server-side insert with error trapping in procedural code rather than client-side

14305947
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox

14306353
post	get
this will return the post then if you ve setup the table relationships correctly you can also query for the dependent data or just get all comments with that id separately

14306420
rss	feed
that xml looks very much like an rss or atom feed or an extract from one

14306420
rss	feed
your sample doesn t indicate that but if your echo is giving you the whole content including img tags etc then that is what is happening and your question is similar to trying to parse only the images from an rss feed - you need to grab the whole description content and parse it as a document of its own

14306487
getter	setter
it is immutable all of its properties only have getter not setter

14306498
google-chrome	firefox
as other people have said firebug is a great extension for firefox and google-chrome i think the standard console embedded in the browser is sufficient

14306539
min	max
from max to min would be

14306558
mp3	flac
edit i haven t tested this particular case but if you were transcoding from flac to a 192kbps cbr mp3 i would imagine there are only a limit set of possibilities that would occur if you were sending a slightly inaccurate content-length off by less than a 1000 bits

14306565
post	get
all tutorials for the get and post methods included the use of form action which to my understanding requires user interaction

14306578

folder	directory
unfortunately this doesn t seem to work on mac os 10.7.5 and the working directory just gets reset to the folder that the application is in

14306926
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu is a complete operating system that uses the linux kernel

14306926

14306952
uilabel	nsstring
anyway prepareforsegue can set this new property and the viewdidload of the destination controller should then use that nsstring property to populate the text property of the uilabel

14306968
put	get
if you put your objects in an array which i think is a much better choice than giving them all names you can use the filter method to get a new array of items matching a criterion

14306971
width	margin
another way i could think of which is better is to add a left margin to your #inner-page div as soon as the .fixed class is applied equivalent to the width of your left sidebar

14306986

and the thing which is really wierd to me is that it doesn t give any errors it just puts all the widgets inside the main application frame instead of the toplevel that gets created

14328367
int	double
the above program on liveworkspace prints double although the second operand is an int

14328367
int	double
this is because the result of the ternary operator is the common type between the second and third operand which in this case is int and double

14328386
nsbutton	nscolorpanel
was asked to post source code so here s the relevant bits from my nsbutton subclass note uses the picker popover mentioned above rather than nscolorpanel directly

14328907
nsxmlparser	nsurlconnection
when using nsxmlparser i ve also achieved a similar effect by wrapping my nsurlconnection in a nsinputstream and thus i can call initwithstream and enjoy nsxmlparser with a small memory footprint that sax parsers enable

14329033
google-chrome	firefox
when i test this with a desktop browser firefox or google-chrome it works just fine

14329045
int	double
the reason that your first program seems to work and your second doesn t is that for your particular hardware the size of a float is the same as int while an int doesn t have enough room for all the bits in a double

14329049
nsstring	nsdata
the supported object are the property list objects nsstring nsnumber nsdate nsdata nsarray and nsdictionary

14329055
width	height
the chart will default to the width and height of the containing element see google visualization documentation for default values of height width

14329055
width	height
the second is to not define the actual size of the element and instead set the height width of the chart to 500px each manually by adding those to your options

14329084
opera	firefox
that page only shows the -webkit- and -moz- prefixes and claims that ie 10+ firefox 16+ and opera 12.1+ can read the prefix free version

14329144
opera	firefox
all other browsers either moved with prefix-free properties like firefox or opera or never used them like ie

14329209
portrait	landscape
lock on a contentpanel or canvas so when the orientation changed from portrait to landscape it stays and doesn t change size

14329238
int	chars
i see a mov sbl instruction being used by x86 to convert a signed chars to a signed int but why does it convert in the way it does now

14329247
mouse	keyboard
this is never a good idea anything that will block the edt will stop amongst other things repaint requests and stop the edt from processing mouse and keyboard events.

14329256
portrait	landscape
and i find it confusing am i supposed to use 3 of these media queries or just one that covers landscape and portrait

14329269
for-loop	loops

i also created a directory in this folder with the name documents

14329329
lseek	posix
the posix specs for lseek state that you are allowed to set the position beyond the end of the file

14329340
children	parent
my thought is that it should give a less jittery effect if the footer contains a bunch of elements as well as not fussing with any children of the footer that are sized relative to the parent

14329356
dictionary	map
i want to map a dictionary object to a dynamic object so that the key is the property on the object and the value of the dictionary is the value of property in dynamic object

14329360
put	get
however this is not true for other types of streams as they may hold separate pointers for the put and get positions

14329362
postgresql	mysql
why don t you change your db from postgresql to mysql and see if the problem still occurs

14329393
x86	64bit
in 64bit x86 32-bit operations automatically zero-fills the upper 32-bit so to extend a 32-bit value to 64bit the compiler will add an movslq to extend the 32-bit number to 64bit

14329393
16-bit	64bit
there is also movswl and movswq to extend 16-bit registers to 32 and 64bit respectively

14329394
put	get
also next to each let s put a feedback box next to each textbox and get rid of those annoying alert popups

google-chrome	firefox
to detect title changes use mutationobservers a new html5 feature that is implemented in both google-chrome and firefox the two main userscripts browsers

14329756
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
easy way tested on ie7+ firefox google-chrome safari would be this

14329778
inherited	subclassing
by process of deduction it seems fair to assume that any subclassing of simplexmlelement would also inherited its unique boolean-casting capability

14329778
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
truthy is a subclassing of simplexmlelement so we should be able to test if its special boolean-casting properties was inherited

14329778
inherited	properties
indeed the boolean-casting properties afforded to simplexmlelement is inherited by truthy

14329778
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
as you can see trying to set a properties on our subclassing immediately breaks the utility we get from the inherited boolean-casting

14329852
google-chrome	firefox
the page works in firefox google-chrome and safarie

14329859
postgresql	mysql
however depending on your usage patterns and how close you stuck to the django-like api any of the standard datastores postgresql cleardb mysql would be about the same amount of effort to switch over to from a code perspective

14330006
getter	setter
the problem is the user of the domain entity shouldn t access through those getter setter

14330006
getter	setter
repository is creating and accessing through impl so that it have access to the getter setter

14330006
getter	setter
however your application logic is facing the interface only and you are not implementing your logic using setter getter which is the anti-pattern

14330006
getter	setter
however if you think you can rely on the self-reputation you can simplify the story by having both the business-logic-related methods and setter getter directly in impl omitting the interface

14330006
getter	setter
and during your implementation you should know that you should only use the business methods of entity not getter setter during your business logic implementation

tried to test next code but sadly looks like not supported in google-chrome and firefox

14330038
post	get
if these tables are readonly you don t need to be able to post them back to the server you could probably get away with throwing your model data into an array of idictionary objects

14330055
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari

filesystems	fat
if you want to be able to use partitions on that disk or maybe a fat filesystems take away even more usable bytes

14330253
cpu	processors
which explain how to calculate cpu usage for a single processors

14330253
cpu	processors
the 6th from last number you get from is processors d cpu number last executed on on ubuntu 12.04 at least

14330253
cpu	processors
to extend to multiple processors you could sample the cpu usage over a period and very roughly

14330253
cpu	processors
then use these proportions to split the cpu usage between the processors

14330333
int	double
in other words the double seems to be converted to int first

14330350
int	double
i too had to do the same thing but i noticed double are converted to int and using fmod returns a double

14330354
hash	md5
write md5 and sha1 hash len 262

14330354
hash	md5
write md5 and sha1 hash len 16

14330357
int	boolean
for example you could use a boolean 2d array to track the coordinates upon which a player has already fired and an int array to represent the positions of various ships by giving each ship type a unique int value 0 for open ocean 1 for destroyer 2 for carrier etc.

14330468
unsigned	short
i utilized an unsigned short and did n 64000

14330468
cos	sin
so what ever the cos ## and sin ## where closest to i rounded to that index

14330468
cos	sin
i also tried to use as little extra data as possible so this wouldn t be some cluttered table with 720 float values for cos and sin

14330468
cos	sin
so the accuracy in comparison to the c++ cos sin operations is 99.99998 through 100

14330468
cos	sin
below is the table used to calculate the cos sin values

14330468
cos	sin
below is the actual code that does the cos sin calculations

14330468
cos	sin
cos sin method

14330468
cos	sin
so to summarize the above performing both cos ### and sin ### with my strategy allows roughly 220 000 000 executions per second

14330468
cos	sin
this is fairly quick and utilizes very little memory so it s a great substitute to math cos sin functions normally found in c++

14330499
mouseleave	mouseenter
and then use the context object in your mouseenter and mouseleave handler functions

14330525

for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
when the 2d does not get populated as it does not enter loops hence bottom for-loop which prints the 2d values prints only 0 because arrays itself does not get initialized

14337409
folder	directory
now the problem is this it does show the icons when a directory at first-level is clicked but when i click the folder in any directory ie

14337457
width	height
and a width and height that is less than the size of the element s contents doesn t work very well when tags all need explicit height and widths or where layouts due to lack of float support and erratic treatment of s by necessity need to be based on tables most of the time

14337457
gmail	hotmail
assume we re making a newsletter where we can t predict what clients our customers will be using so we have to support popular mainstream email clients outlook gmail yahoo hotmail thunderbird ios osx android.

14337473
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
i want to removed the checked checkbox when clicking the dropdown and check a checkbox on the dropdownlistfor

14337481
hash	md5
thus you would better hash the urls say with md5 and create a unique index on the field containing the url s hash and of course use it in the where condition

14337493
versioning	upgrade
i suggest upgrade your node and driver to the latest versioning and try again

14337517
int	chars	int	double
there is no difference to write and read int double float chars etc

14337551
int	double
if the default value of string were the empty string i would not have to test and i would feel it to be more consistent with the other value types like int or double for example

14337554
sorting	filtering
you can try sorting and filtering the store

14337561
int	double
value types like int or double for example

14337720
postgresql	mysql
mysql will do the job very well and even postgresql

14337720
postgresql	mysql
both postgresql and mysql run on windows as well so you dont have to install linux though i would suggest that you invest the time in linux as i have it is well worth the effort and the peace of mind you get is good

14337720
postgresql	mysql
there is one major sticking point for you if you switch over to mysql postgresql that the current rda replication technology you have will not be supported by these databases and you will need to look at how to implement this probably from scratch

14337742
post	get
the trick is to check whether any value has been passed as part of the post get data

14337747
hide	show
islightdismissenabled effectively means show this popup but once it loses focus hide it

14337748
hide	show
if you want to hide it from your activity the most common case you ll have to call view.setvisibility view.gone and view.setvisibility view.visible to show it again

14337764

14337910
implements	extends
i ended up extends quartzjobbean and also implements statefuljob

14337936
restrict	shared
otherwise you need to restrict the visibility of shared pages with rules on your server

14337967
getter	setter
just in case someone wants to see my contentdto interactionsdto and rulesdto it follows this structure above with getter and setter and constructors of supper class created

14338033
for-loop	arrays
you are loosing many features of an arrays for instance can t go through all categories in for-loop

14338137
post	get
if you get stuck with the implementation you might want to post that as a separate more specific question

14338167
width	height
and specify your height and width

14338208
queue	fifo
if there is a parent child process relation so the parent starts a child process you might consider a pipe fifo or shared memory or a message queue or any other form of ipc

14338336
int	chars
or having the int cast to a chars before comparing

14338372
width	height
as for css no you cannot detect the width and height of your viewport using css

14338388
udp	tcp
i plan to use tcp udp and web socket instead of http for client-server communication.but i have an issue what socket type should i use for large data transmitted from client to server

14338398
put	get
i suggest you get the outputted json and put into jsonlint.com

14338435
implements	extends
client all callbacks extends a abstract callback where you implements the onfailur

14338436
tapestry	struts
and then you can choose java ee or spring or play or struts or tapestry

14338436
ant	maven
and then you can use ant or maven or gradle to build it

14338477
portrait	landscape	width	height
however if you want to redesign your layout or make adjustments based on wether the screen is in landscape width is larger than height or portrait height is larger than width mode you can definitely use css media queries

14338541
ggplot2	plotrix
i d like to plot side by side a plotrix graphic and a ggplot2 graphic

14338553
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
first of all segues don t apply only with a uinavigationcontroller any uiviewcontroller is able to perform a segue

14338553
portrait	landscape
the apple documentation also say that you ll have to restrict supported orientation of each uiviewcontroller you ll use to handle orientation you ll have to restrict portrait to portrait only and landscape to landscape only

14338553
portrait	landscape
it basically describe how to design your view hierarchy using two view controllers displaying the same content one for landscape and one for portrait embedded in a navigations controller

14338559
post	get
i m able to view the page and click on all pages and post but when i try to go to the backend i get

14338566
folder	directory
this assumes that when you try to go to folder blahblah there isn t a directory or file blahblah and that you want to route it through your index.php

14338573
portrait	landscape
after researching i found that the crash was due to the uiimagepickercontroller always being displayed in portrait mode even when the interface orientation is landscape

14338591
width	height
the is the number of pixels that fall into bin i so it can be any integer ranging from 0 to the size of the input image width height

14338613
layoutparams	viewgroup
the main difference between the two inflate methods is the second parameter the viewgroup parameter and its use in setting the proper layoutparams for the root view of the inflated layout file

14338613
width	height
this is important because the layoutparams keep various layout attributes of the view like width height positioning rules etc and are required so the parent of that view can properly show the view

14338613
width	height
in the first case the root of the inflated layout file r.layout.childitemlayout will not have any layoutparams set on it the inflate method didn t assign any because the second parameter is null and it doesn t know which type of layoutparams to generate so your fixed width height values are lost

14338613
width	height
this method in the particular case of a horizontal linearlayout will return an instance of layoutparams where the width height will be set to wrap_content

14338613
layoutparams	viewgroup
in the second case the inflate method sees that you suggested the linearlayout mainlayout as the viewgroup used for generating the layoutparams

14338613
width	height
this means that the fixed values that you used for the width height retrieved from the layout file can be stored in a proper instance of the layoutparams

14338626
hash	md5
you are creating an md5 hash instead of using the functions of your library

14338649
put	get
however i think this should get you started because of what i said it should work on just about any version of word that has vba i put this code inside a new module called newmacro -- if you use office 2010 the macros are accessible via the view ribbon on the far right macros panel just right of the window panel

14338666
implements	extends
client all callbacks extends a abstract callback where you implements the onfailur

14338690
hash	salt
keep a table of username and encrypted passwords in your database encrypted at least salt hash

14338696
width	height
the scroll event is only triggered on elements like window frame iframe and ones that have overflow scroll|auto and their content must be greater then the available width height

14338710
mp4	webm
in order to fix this situation it should be enough to move webm as the first format so chrome will pick it up instead of mp4 ie will skip to mp4 so it will work too

14338732
udp	tcp
actually we use the std map to store sockets information we did encapsulation based on the socket file description to include some other necessary information such as ip address port socket type tcp or udp etc

14338741
implements	extends
client all callbacks extends a abstract callback where you implements the onfailur

14338753
post	get
i tend towards single action multiple methods along with an interceptor that differentiates between get and post requests

14338753
post	get
the interceptor returns a known result for get requests input and allows normal processing for post results normal action invocation

14338753
post	get
using the convention plugin makes this less interesting although doing it automatically is kind of pleasant once you know the app s get post secret you never have to think about it again

14338773
width	margin
it is the width of the element plus the 5px margins on the elements plus the fact that the larger size element is increasing its margin to 10px

14338784
gridview	sqldatasource
obs i get the content of my gridview from my database using a sqldatasource inside the aspx page

14338821
min	max
functions can be invoked from a select statement - user defined functions like yours act the same way as the built-in functions like min and max

14338828
implements	extends
the fact that you are extends abstractlist means that you are indirectly implements list

14338858
width	height
there is the kaa media libraries which provide a height and width in the metadata package i will say i ve never used them though but they look like they should give you the information you need

14338866
toggleclass	slidetoggle
when i click on either of these i want to use slidetoggle and toggleclass to prevent the other box from closing allowing the user to see the content within both box and the ability to collapse both

14338874
google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to do the same thing as asked in this question here the only signification difference being the use of mozilla firefox instead of google-chrome chromium

14338887
g++	gcc
gcc 4.7.0 g++ -c -std c++11 gives

14338893
hide	show
i have the following js script for a show hide toggle

14338893
hide	show
as the title says the show event is working while the hide is not

14338907
int	boolean
anyway how can i use a boolean or int value coming from my data source to select either one of the options above

14338927
getter	setter
while testing this property i get coverage for the getter but not the setter

14339007
width	height
it uses the container s width and height to calculate if it needs to truncate and add ellipsis

14339012
hide	show
your current code first tries to hide the element 50 times and eventually show it at the end unconditionally

14339022
public	protected
mixing private and public protected methods of the same name causes

14339066
int	chars	int	boolean	int	double
these are byte short int long float double boolean chars and of course references

14339142
google-chrome	firefox
i am using the mailto method which opens my mail application on mac however when i set gmail as my default mail application in browsers settings eg google-chrome and firefox it will open gmail in the same window as the page on which the link was clicked

14339150
for-loop	arrays
to solve it i replaced this function for a for-loop which searches the arrays string .

14339165
maven	m2e
i have a very strange problem with snapshot dependencies in maven + eclipse m2e

14339169
put	get
1 check here to make sure you are using the put get extras correctly as i don t see the code where you are adding data the intent

14339214
for-loop	loops
so in the while loops take stri store it in list 0 and then continue the for-loop get the next stri and store it in a new index of list 1 while keeping list 0 and so on until all templatefield stri is completed

14339219
textview	imageview
progressbar is a view like textview imageview button etc.. which can be used in your layout to show some progress

14339255
portrait	landscape
at runtime the program evaluate the function and pass in the good case portrait or landscape but the layout used is still the one for portrait mode fragment_library.xml .

on change i want to hide the selectbox insert a small loader image for 250 ms and then show the selectbox with the selected option

14339299
hide	show
if i select completed in row1 hide the select only in row1 insert the loader image and then show the selectbox with completed as selected add attribute selected selected to the option

14339300
short	base
that can be done using the base jquery function or for short

14339346
sorting	filtering
backbone would handle sorting and filtering the lists plus the editing of the lists

14339404
bash	zsh
i assume your shell is bash zsh ksh and i assume the blank lines in your sample input should not be there

14339418
put	get
if you just put the three queries into the stored procedure you should get three result sets

14339432
concave	convex
i don t have any links to algorithms to solve this problem but i think a better approach than building the convex polygons up a triangle at a time might be to first merge the triangles into the largest simple polygons they can be concave but without holes you can and then splitting these large polygons down into their convex constituents

14339434
hide	show
if i understand your problem correctly it s because you re using .select to hide and show the select

14339493
accessor	properties
make your backing fields private - that s why you ve got the public properties accessor for

14339535
min	max
i ve tried everything union date_sub curdate interval 1 month min price max date etc etc

14339557
coalesce	isnull
coalesce is similar to isnull and would usually be recommended except for a few odd situations - for one it s part of standard sql useful if you ever have to work against other rdbmses for another it can accept multiple arguments and returns the first non- null one

14339582
portrait	landscape
if you zoom in a tiny bit you can then scroll alright and if you move to a portrait view rather than a landscape view it is fine but it will not scroll on a landscape view on an android

14339609
folder	directory
when make test is run i would like the makefile to search through the vendors directory for any folder named tests and perform unit testing accordingly

debian	linux
as a matter of practicality the following program succeeds on many pthreads implementations freebsd8 i386 and debian gnu linux amd64 but fails on one of interest to me debian kfreebsd9 amd64

14339741
width	height
use this method to calculate height and width of string

14339801
getter	setter
rather than provide getter and setter or make those members public it seemed to make sense that my test class simply inherit from the class it is testing so that it can directly access those private members

14339805
button	checkbox
i would like to simulate radio button behaviour using checkbox this says

14339860
jtable	jdatechooser
i m try to add toedter s jdatechooser in a column of a jtable

14339911
cat	tee

14339945
firefox	safari
the menu displays fine in firefox and ie but safari places the menu s text too low

14340002
filtering	grouping
you could add multiple effects in one filtering however if you want to stack the filtering up first grouping the object and then apply the other filtering to your object

14340098
button	checkbox
this way the checkbox group behaves like a radio button group

14340114
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
if you were to instead put them inside an observablecollection the default implementation of inotifycollectionchanged - the collection variant of inotifypropertychanged you can do other neat tricks

14340128
getter	setter
when declaring a property you are declaring the setter getter for a instance variable

14340128
getter	setter
if you want to have the setter and getter defined you need to synthesize them

14340128
getter	setter
i ve watched some videos recently that say properties can be used for other instance methods besides setter getter

14340142

you can replace the show with fadein timeout and the hide with fadeout timeout

14340324
button	checkbox
if user clicked two checkbox then button name save is active else this button is not active

14340331
getter	setter
when declaring a property you are declaring the setter getter for a instance variable

14340331
getter	setter
no you are declaring a getter and possibly a setter of a property

14340331
getter	setter
if you want to have the setter and getter defined you need to synthesize them

14340331
getter	setter
the property line itself declares the setter and getter

14340331
getter	setter
if you want to have the setter and getter implemented for you that is called synthesize but you no longer need to do this manually

14340331
getter	setter
the complier will automatically create a getter and setter for any property that you declare but do not implement unless you explicitly ask it not to using dynamic

14340345
uilabel	uibutton
for example it can be an uibutton or an uilabel

14340345
uilabel	uibutton
but there is an issue between properties that display text for an uibutton and for an uilabel

14340345
uilabel	uibutton
for an uibutton we set text using settitle method but for an uilabel we using another one named settext

14340354
strcpy	strncpy	memcpy	strncpy	memcpy	strcpy
i tried using memcpy strcpy and strncpy and they all ended up having that set of strange characters in the end of the string

14340355
sorting	filtering
with only 4 distinct values int and string will perform very similarly for filtering queries sorting and even range queries

14340410
mouseout	mouseleave
mouseleave will happen only when you leave whole .rating and will not be fired if you move from element to element inside .rating like mouseout does

14340414

i decided to post my solution i might even get some feedback

14340442
post	get
i managed to get my solution all wrapped up into one filter call so thought i d post it

14340473
post	put
when constructing you re entity you have the option to specify the content being used for the post or put operation for certain entities

14340473

14340627
int	chars
for instance payroll number is 6 chars long 145674 i want to be able to generate maybe 9-10 chars long int number from this number and use it on other systems

14340636

you re calling usleep with a double value while it s specified to take an unsigned int of type useconds_t with limited range

14340678
innodb	myisam
i read many articles about comparisons of myisam and innodb from performance point of view and i decided to use myisam for reading data and innodb for writing data

14340682
comparator	comparable
since the two constraints are not equivalent marking comparable types with the comparator constraint is a bit misleading since it would make it impossible to distinguish between the two using reflection

14340703

it is pretty easy to test the hack above and if you don t get a chance i should have time later tonight to try it out and post an addendum

14342759
post	get
i doubt will reconstruct the model from modelstate i imaging it just getting the user attempted values and validation errors so as the model collection is not initialized at this point get and you are not passing the collection from the post it will just render the model initial state that s why it works well with flat models but not with collections like in this case

14342759

so you must find a way to pass that collection or the hole model from post to the get action and the option is tempdata

14346129
post	put
both the post and put requests are successful i.e

integer	unsigned
if the destination type is unsigned the resulting value is the least unsigned integer congruent to the source integer modulo 2 n where n is the number of bits used to represent the unsigned type

14346544
integer	unsigned
so when you multiplied those two int s you were really multiplying two unsigned integers ignoring the overflow and viewing the result as a signed integer

14346579
width	height
width 132 height 123

14346579
width	height
ideally i would like to have a .htaccess file within the images directory which removes the query string width 132 height 123 from all of the images located in the sub-directories

14347177
min	max
i d like to set up a validation rule that enforces that the max field is greater than the min

14347177
min	max
this would be invoked whenever the max or the min fields values are changed

14347177
min	max
but it s a bit more complicated because this only applies when the max field is changed not the min

14347177
min	max
so that i can just have a min and max class and call something like

14347177
min	max
which min the max field is paired with

14347177
min	max
however i have not really worked on this much - i am looking for the logic to basically link sets of min and max fields the way i described

14347177
min	max
and i don t know if this is the best way to do this - as i mentioned i d love to be able to do this generically so that i don t have to refer to the min and max fields by id

interestingly quicksort performs more comparisons on average than mergesort - 1.44 n lg n expected for quicksort versus n lg n for mergesort

14349085
quicksort	mergesort
if all that mattered were comparisons mergesort would be strongly preferable to quicksort

mergesort	heapsort
heapsort on the other hand doesn t have very good locality it jumps around all over an array though most mergesort implementations have reasonably locality

14349085

all the images have the same width but different height

14349164
tar	gunzip

the event handler functions themselves simply replace the dot part of the id with info to form the correct new one then show or hide the element as appropriate

14349220

post	get
i have a form that post a single value but i cant seem to get it to the controller

14349249
hash	md5
the difference being that you cannot unhash a a hash string in theory md5 is weak because this was proven false

14349249
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
you could also just hash the md5 value they give you and use a salt with some modern strong hashing algorithm

14349249
hash	md5
this means that if anyone gets your table they will have to unhash your hash then unhash the md5

14349268
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
you will see in firefox google-chrome safari etc

14349292

instead of dynamically adding a scriptmanager if none exists on the page simply do the opposite add a scriptmanager to your ascx and get rid of it if there s one already on the page

14349296
innodb	myisam
the disadvantage of that design is that you are paying an enormous replication penalty on write which includes both innodb s supposed read penalty and myisam s supposed write penalty for probably quite a small performance benefit on read

14349319
google-chrome	firefox
on firefox it works great but it does not work in google-chrome and halts all the javascript

14349324
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu s terminal uses case-sensitive auto-completion as i suppose would be expected for linux

it can be done and works well with firefox and google-chrome as far as i know

14349452
postgresql	mysql
i ported my application from mysql to postgresql

14349490
button	checkbox
the alternative way you described having the click bound to a function is relevant for a button stateless not for a checkbox which has a state of its own true or false

14349577
button	checkbox
that is to say without having to do trial and error or specify magic number values if the panel is 50x50 pixels and the checkbox is 10 pixels high then the button should be 40 pixels high

14349657
firefox	safari
i seriously doubt the later it does however manage to play in firefox 18 and safari 602

mouse	keyboard
i d like to write some sort of macro that would map keyboard presses with mouse locations so that i could type the letters on my keyboard and have the mouse go click on the corresponding on-screen keyboard letters

14349940
goto	break
you can break out of the loop after the first matching line by using goto

14349940
spaces	delimiter
without that option the for f would break each line into tokens delimiter by spaces or tab characters

14349948
google-chrome	firefox
my latest website a wordpress twentyeleven child theme looks great on my pc in google-chrome firefox etc but when i look at it on my ipad all the images display as boxes with grey borders images in the header footer and posts don t display

14349991
pull	push
this way all you have is the top level repo with the one submodule in it and you just push and pull from these 2 places

14349995
implements	extends
as a side effect of this implementation choice you can extends or implements them like any other interface

14350027
drawrect	layoutsubviews
in searching for the solution to this problem i have found some suggestions that layoutsubviews or drawrect needs to be called in order for the view to refresh and adopt the changes to uiappearence

14350097
stdout	stderr
festival may output it s text on stderr instead of stdout

14350172

right now i m using nunit and moq

14350278

cat	tee
i would expect tee to copy stdin to the named pipe and dev null and then cat to copy the contents of the named pipe to stdout

post	get
however what i don t want is someone sniffing my traffic back and forth from app to service and figuring out how to get post data from using my app and service then setting up their own app website to display this data using my bandwidth to make them money

14350298
post	get
so if someone does the same get post in their own application they would get the same records back thus using my stuff

14350309
for-loop	loops
okay after all that here is my crack at changing your specific code with the options of changing the iterator each time from using a while loops to using a for-loop with range

14350332
folder	directory
from the error php can t auto load the class plugin_accesscheck i m guessing you have a plugin directory in your lib folder with a php file called accesscheck.php

14350333
jar	manifest.mf
our laptops having netbeans installed even if we weren t building directly from netbeans were using the copylibs to build the jar file which added the needed line to the manifest.mf file

i am porting an ant script to maven and i am stuck on transforming my web.xml

14350395
libxml2	libxslt
if you re really missing libxml2 libxslt then

14350412
ng-show	ng-class
the faq mentions ng-repeat ng-show and ng-class but i get the sense there are plenty more

14350432
post	put
i read on another so post which i unfortunately cannot find right now that the cause of your glitch may be newlines in the html which ie very helpfully thinks are typographic spaces that you want to put into the text

14350437
viewdidload	viewwillappear
but even if viewwillappear will work i would suggest moving your code to viewdidload for the following reason

14350460
oncreate	ondestroy
registering registerreceiver is done in the oncreate method and unregisterreceiver is called in the ondestroy method so it shoud be valid

14350471
folder	directory
but i need to run it from the home directory on my server which is taking forever at least 5 minutes so far. it seems it would be faster if i could narrow the search to not all php files but only php files in themes folder

14350538
folder	directory
which will add the files to the my_images folder in the current directory

14350556
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
the user enters a number chooses whether they wish to add subtract multiplying or divide

14350556

14350622
gif	png
let s say there is a shell script that will minify any give image files png gif jpeg etc

folder	directory
if you only need to process one directory you could as easily write the line starting with zip_command as with the folder name in os x unix style this time

14350636
post	get
the best thing i can get from all the other post is manually detecting the soft keyboard and moving the view up the difference

14350646
min	max
instead you should be using min and max attributes

14350646
min	max
it didn t render the max nor the min attribute altogether

14350646
min	max
in the meanwhile you can work this around by providing a custom renderer like this which basically adds the min and max attributes to the list of pass thru attributes

14350681
loops	while-loop
if you just want to wrap your code in a bash looping construct and are willing to hit ctrl-c to terminate loops rather than do something more fancy then you can wrap your code in a while-loop

14350742
button	checkbox
the issue is after i select from a checkbox list in dialog box 1 and hit updatepage button my model gets updated just fine

14350745

14350788
ksort	usort
i ve tried ksort and some various usort functions

google-chrome	safari
the weird thing is that examining the cookies in google-chrome and safari all i ve tested thus far show them expiring on browser close and with the session respectively

14351009

the problem with this is that the windows coordinate system is always in portrait regardless of the devices orientation hence you re finding the width and height the wrong way round

14351038

i m trying to break up a shell command that contains both pipes | and the or symbols || represented as characters in an array with strtok except well the or command could also be two pipes next to each other

for the horizontal flip you should add a new method since you have to specify the width no the height

14351076
button	checkbox

14351084
stdout	stderr

14351103

children	parent
actually since we made sort upon parent_id on the query all the children for given parent make single continuous list so could be better to remove populated parent from the dictionary after we populated last child after parent_id got new value and caching previously found parent otherwise in another local variable instead of making yet another search through the dictionary

14358217
children	parent
after each new item added to the menu this collection should be searched if there are pending children to extract from it and move into the newly created parent

mouseout	mouseleave
difference is that mouseout will happen even if mouse goes to a child element and mouseleave does not happen if you move from an element to its child

14359125
int	chars	int	boolean
although scala language does not have primitives the resulting bytecode uses them for types like int float chars and boolean

14359129

14360195
uiview	caanimation
while the uiview and caanimation transition methods do indeed work their respective framerates on different ios devices vary so wildly that i didn t think implementing them was the best solution

14360355
multiplying	addition
or if it s better to multiplying them a 100 100 reference would become a 10 000 ref and thus a 105 95 reference would have less because its not the same result even though it has same score with addition

14360378
gif	bmp	gif	png	bmp	png
as the tif png and gif all have transparent backgrounds i think that the jpg bmp images are being drawn correctly however as alpha isn t supported in these file formats having a black output makes sense as the transparency would be interpreted as nothing black

folder	dir
the folder is located in the installation dir of my game

14360406
put	get
if you want to get really funky you could put all that in a class and let it decide what conversion to run

14360426

int	boolean
since you have typed your named query return type eclipselink should be smart enough to auto-convert int to boolean for you

14360726
google-chrome	firefox
the rings turn centered perfect in ie and firefox but in google-chrome the rotation looks off by 1-2pixels

14360734
google-chrome	firefox
as for why it s exceeding its container that s probably due to default padding margins being different between firefox google-chrome and ie

14360755
nunit	mstest
here s an example it s mstest but i guess it won t be a hell lot of a pain to port to nunit - all you need is to rename a couple of attributes

2 if i attach a jquery onchange event then it will get fired twice in firefox but not google-chrome or ie

14361286

i d rather avoid installation that also force me to upgrade apache

lodash	underscore.js
es5-shim natively supports amd unlike underscore.js and lodash doesn t add extra copies of things your browser probably already provides

14361790
lodash	underscore.js
when ie8 and other older browsers die out you can simply remove the es5-shim dependency without having to port code like you would with lodash or underscore.js

14361817

where ever you have called calloc and stored the return value you need to call free on that value when you re finished with it

14361953

my idea is that you take the user-input date and create a searchstring in the form yyyy-mm-dd using the techniques to get the year month day that i showed in my other post

14362496
google-chrome	firefox
i created a test for local file handling but can t get the file type to return any contents in google-chrome or firefox

14362496
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome gives no error and acts like there was never a call to the filereader and firefox gives a strange error

14362506

by the way this approach works with any web-databound control repeater gridview etc.

14362688
hash	md5
my friend challenged me to figure out what encoding he used and only gave me the hint md5 its not just an md5 hash but i m still only learning about encryption to which i eventually lost but he still won t tell me what he used

14362707
width	height
it might also be advisable to set the width and height attributes of the foreignobject using code similar to what you re using to determine whether the text is too long so that the text flows correctly

14362742
google-chrome	firefox
i have both firefox firebug and google-chrome inspector available to me

14362806
perforce	svn
if it s for simplicity of synchronizing you may want to look at some sort of source control like svn perforce git

14362827
next	except
accessing ui elements is never easy but except that it s completely unreliable way to access your data as the way control is injected into the visualtree may be changed so your code will fail on next update

14362830
google-chrome	firefox
i thought that the cors header and setting the domain and path in the cookie would allow the sub domain web application access to the cookie but the browsers google-chrome 21.0.1180.89 firefox 17.0.1 don t seem to supply the cookie

14362842
getter	setter	tostring	getter
in my case javabean object is an object having only two properties foo and fruit and getter setter and tostring methods something like this

onmousedown	onmouseup
i assume that i ll have to somehow tie in to onmousedown onmouseup and set a timer threshold but i m struggling to get something like this working

14363072
width	height
that means your height and width variables are holding the wrong values when you define out and try to loop over the values on input

14363123
x86	64bit
note using jdk 7u11 and jdk 6u38 64bit version on an x86 machine

14363126
dumpsys	adb
the right way to determine whether your wakelock -releasing code works is to use adb shell dumpsys power before and after the release to see if your wakelock is released

14363140
google-chrome	safari
i ve tried on the very latest versions of google-chrome for windows 7 and safari for mac

14363150
stdout	stderr
the only issue is that libfcgi replaces stdout and stderr with special fcgi file descriptors and git is not aware of these

14363150
stdout	stderr
i want to be able to capture the output of the git program stdout stderr in the parent process so i can send it to the server

14363187
hide	show
the first scenario show you how to check the app s receipt to see if the app is in trial mode or if it has been purchased which would allow you to show hide the ads appropriately

14363199
put	get
if i put a string inside a textbox in xaml that expects an integer i get the message

14363219
int	boolean
the moral of this example is if integervariable is an int or any other data type that is not a boolean then it is best practice to have a logical comparison

14363225
put	get
but i reckon i ll get it working eventually now that you put me on the right track

14363247
filesystems	ntfs
next re-name your war file to root.war note that this is case-sensitive even on filesystems that normally ignore case like ntfs and put it into catalina_base webapps which is probably where it was anyway

14363273
post	get
the usercontroller creates a createuserviewmodel as the model for the get request and expects a createusercommand for the post request

email	dkim
it s totally client task to properly sign email before sending with dk dkim

14363280
median	minimum
however if you switch your sorted ds to a skip list balanced bst - you are going to get o logn insertion deletion and o 1 minimum maximum median size with caching

14363280
median	max
first note that the median moves one element to the right for each high elements you insert in here high means the current max

14363285
width	height
i don t know of a way to specify a max height without also specifying a max width

14363299
vertica	infobright
i was attracted to luciddb since the feature set seems perfect and i cannot commit to the cost of a commercial solution like infobright or vertica until the project has shown value

14363372
public	protected
second getdoc if it is only intended for derived classes should be protected not public

14363401
portrait	landscape
if i set it with points say 250 points above the bottom in landscape view then when it ends up 250 points above the bottom in portrait view it looks weird and too far down

14363401
portrait	landscape
but if i set it 400 points above the bottom in portrait view then in landscape view it looks weird and too high up

14363413
width	height
what i want to do is add another image b on top of it with a different width and height say nwidth and nheight and transform the points from image a to correspond to points on image b

14363432
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
the results are the same in firefox 18.0 safari 6.0.2 and opera 12.12

14363443
width	height
rapheal doesn t have setters for width and height on the paper object so calling them is not affecting the dom but just setting some properties on the paper object

14363443
width	height
passing in the width and height params in the constructor will affect the svg tag in the dom

14363443
width	height
if you want to change the paper s width and height after constrcution you can set the style properties of the svg tag like so

14363448
post	get
to get it this post is quite clear get http variable jsf

requestfactory	gwt
gwt requestfactory performance suggestions

14363539
folder	directory
i added a directory to svn then i accidentally deleted the .svn folder within

14363553
post	get
using post was then much easier read less code and this might have caused the myth that get is bad in jsf

14363557
for-loop	arrays
in this way you reduce all to some simple for-loop on some arrays which passes parameters to binded callbacks

14363574
portrait	landscape
i built the entire application in portrait mode and have of course realized that things look screwy when in landscape

14363574
portrait	landscape
my only other thought is to make duplicate views one for portrait and one for landscape

14363589
inherited	properties
array instances inherited properties from the array prototype object and their class internal properties value is array

14363624
imagemagick	vips
this test will crash if vips is compiled with imagemagick support because imagemagick crashes when called from libeio

14363645
google-chrome	firefox
edit happens in firefox but not google-chrome

14363696
src	attr
you get the alt attribute using also the attr method and alt as parameter just like you are already doing with src

14363707
versioning	upgrade
i cannot upgrade the qt versioning easily

14363735
put	get
the class form-inline doesn t cut it because the labels don t line up and the class form-horizontal hasn t worked because i can t get the class help-block to put the help text on the right

14363757
getter	setter
that s a big no-no especially since if any mapping is done on such classes those getter and setter will be called outside of their wpf binding context and hell breaks lose

14363777
hash	md5
it will eliminate duplicate streams which have the same hash md5

14363791
int	chars
this is my function so far i want to be able to read a file containing int and chars like x and b etc and return a list of only the int

14363795
width	height
now i want to check its coordinates or center point or frame x y width height

14363795
fadein	fadeout
i want its actual position and size when viewcontroller loaded so when user click on image view it will fadeout by zoom-in towards users and will disappear and when user tap on reset button it fadein and zoom-in back to original form reverse to the previous animation

14363797
aggregate-functions	sum
essentially you need to use the sum and count aggregate-functions and declare every other column to be returned as part of the group by clause

14363805

i was not able to get the solutions from the post to work so i removed load_and_authorize_resource from my controllers and i am now checking manually if the user is authorized to complete the action

14363819
public	protected
then you are doing extra typing to get the same effect as offering a public protected member directly

14363861
hide	show
to fix it you can hide the element in jquery and than show hide or toggle should work fine

14363879
width	height
if the svg element does not have any width and height attributes then the width height should be calculated according to the css specs as pointed out by robert longson

14363879
width	height
you can find out the proper width height using getbbox

14363915
rank	max
where you would need rank is if you wanted the value of cl2 on the row where cl1 is max

14363941
integer	unsigned
for that first exception the most likely explanation is that it s caused by the warning or error raised by mysql when an attempt is made to store a negative value into an unsigned integer datatype

14363959
mdpi	hdpi
as far as understand there are size and density categories named as small normal large and xlarge and ldpi mdpi hdpi xhdpi

14363967
pop-up	dialog
add this line before startactivity if you don t want the pop-up dialog

14363996
hide	show
the main trouble you are having -- i think -- is that you need to find a way to select the correct element to show hide

14364014
innodb	myisam
you only have to update data relevant to a single user rather than updating the entire table and if you re using innodb tables the update queries will use row-level locking rather than table-level locking you get with myisam

14364067
folder	directory
as actionbarsherlock project i m using the head of the git repository i copied the library directory pasted it in the same folder as my parent project and rename it according to groupid - artifactid - version

14364086

int	double
i have no idea what you mean by type bounds but in your example 23 is an int 23.23 is a double and an int is automatically convertible to a double

14364543
bash	subshell
as in bash the parts after a | are run in a subshell variable would only be changed in that subshell and it s new value lost when returing to the present shell

14364611
int	double
then candidates for types would be int and double

width	height
in order for the background to be visible the cell has to be populated with something like text or have a width and a height set otherwise it s collapsed and the background cannot be seen

14364754
width	height
in other words it should consume the entire height of the dock bar + a fixed width this is being docked on the left - exactly as explorer lays out its folder tree on the left

14364754
width	height
hence in cfiletreebar calcfixedlayout it responds with height based on getparent - getwindowrect rect and a width of 250pix

14364812
width	height
about that i expect the maximum width and height of the total tree to be a function of the total depth but i could easily be mistaken.

14364813
hide	show
i am not sure of this but you should place your 2 images in the same position on the screen and then show the one you need and hide the one you don t need

the handle move to the top of the sortable element and when you drag it to the top where the short line of text is it will snap into place but you cannot get it to sort to the bottom

14365082
move	drag
solutions would be to either make your entire content area a sortable handle or perhaps move your handles out to the left of the content making that the sortable area only and drag only the handles not the content then allow the the content area to update upon a new sort

getter	setter
i ve seen issues with various soap client applications like you describe when the original class that is being serialized into the soap response is a direct object reference and does not use a getter setter property

14385156
getter	setter
instead make sure the objects use a public getter setter method and the problem when the objects should be deserialized on the client appearing to not happen may very well go away

14385166
clang	icc
on the c side of things i ll be compiling with gcc clang or maybe icc

14385218
subtract	add
also there s the question of what to do when you add or subtract a month or year to from a date and the month that it moves to doesn t include that day so add accepts allowdayoverflow in order to control that which wouldn t be necessary with smaller units

14385218
subtract	add
unlike add roll accepts all of the units in the type rather than just months and years but that s because it s doing a different operation from + and so adding or subtract a duration won t work as that already adds or subtract

14385248
dateadd	datepart
you can round logdate using dateadd and datepart and then group by that

maven allows plugins executions to be put inside pom.xml profiles which can be activated by properties

14385797

each breeze entitymanager stores a single copy of each entity by key so memory use should not expand unless you are retrieving more entities or using more than one entitymanager.

14385830
stateless	stateful
as long as you use a stateful knowledge session what you are probably doing because the stateless one has no fireallrules method the wm will not forget all the inserted facts

google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and ie9 this works fine but in google-chrome does not obey the following css

14386502
accessor	properties
if you are only defining one accessor you cannot use automatic properties

14386502
accessor	properties
note that you can define a private set accessor on an automatic properties if you want the properties to be read-only from code outside of the class but read-write from inside the class.

14386502
getter	setter
automatic properties declare a getter and setter but do not provide an implementation

14386511
width	height
the basic approach would be to allocate a memory buffer a c array of 4 rgba ã width ã height bytes pass that to cgbitmapcontextcreate draw your source image into the context using cgcontextdrawimage and then operate directly on the buffer the pixel values

14386512
google-chrome	safari

14386702
width	height
svg_area.setattribute viewbox 0.5 0.5 + width + + height

14386703
for-loop	loops
if you want to use a counter in a loops a for-loop is typically more appropriate

14386729

google-chrome	firefox
now using the following test script below works fine in google-chrome and firefox but returns the evttarget to be undefined in ie when i try to alert it

14386750
width	height
the algorithm requires the width height of the imageview to scale down

14386750
width	height
the problem i have is that when my custom pageradapter method is executed the width height of the imageview is not yet known getwidth getheight return 0 so it does not work

14386755
width	height
svg_area.setattribute viewbox 0.5 0.5 + width + + height

marionette	icanhaz.js
i m migrating a backbone basic app to marionette and i would like to use icanhaz.js as a template system based on mustache

14386895
int	double
for example to tell weight is double not int or string

14386925
getter	setter
don t think that there is an api which tells you whether a method is a getter or a setter

14386926
free	malloc
there are some platform-specific functions you can use to perform certain types of queries like working set size but those probably won t be helpful because sometimes memory which has been properly free d is still considered to be allocated by the os because the malloc implementation might keep the free memory around in a pool

14386955
bash	zsh
you can do this entirely within the shell in zsh and i think in recent versions of bash

14386958
hide	show
but even if it doesn t its possible to hide show the animated progress bar at 100 to indicate its loading something

14386958
hide	show
if you load stuff that is not using ajax you can also throw the ajaxstart event to trigger your component to hide and show

14386966
pop-up	dialog
humorously when the exception dialog pop-up it states if there is a handler for this exception the program may be safely continued. which is true if your app has no need for userprincipal.current but calling it again after this exception causes the exception to rethrow so i d question their safely continued assertion there

14386981
post	get
the post part works fine i get the links ids etc

14386991
client-side	server-side
in convention you can use knockout view-model is as client-side and mvc view-model is as server-side

14387070
width	height
from what i ve read around the forums an atlas is a large rectangular region of image data where the width and height have to be powers of 2 although they don t have to be equal you can have a 512x1024 if you want

14387088
chown	chgrp
i created a directory var www html mysql-bak and did chgrp and chown to make the owning user mysql and the owning group mysql

14387139
disk	ram
if i could tell when windows was about to move things to ram i might be able to fix the issue by updating the recordsets to disk with a sql update command just before the move and setting a boolen variable to remind the program to reopen the connections and recordset when the application user returns to the program

after installation i tried running the command browserify entry.js -o entrybrowserfied.js in the same folder as entry.js but the command doesn t generate a javascript file in the same directory as entry.js and doesn t produce any console output either

14387221

if you have some kind of resize algorithm that is triggered by certain url parameters use this solution and pass the width and height as you desire maybe with one of the above-mentioned libraries

14387233

sorting	filtering	implements	extends
hence i have implements a class that extends listdataprovider for use with a celltable that supports client-side excel-like column filtering and sorting

14387342
sorting	filtering
it depends on implementing a the following columnaccessor interface to provide a symbolic name for for each column in the celltable to provide access to column-level data for sorting and filtering a comparator for the column for sorting and display label for the header

14387348

google-chrome and firefox work like a charm but ie just play the video with no fullscreen option

14387522
direct3d	direct2d
this allows you to configure the multisampling antialiasing settings of the direct3d device directly and then meshes play along just fine in fact i think you d just always tell direct2d to use aliased rendering

14387578
post	get
i want to get a list of all the likes for a given post

14387578
post	get
the problem i am having is that there isn t a timestamp field that i can use to page with and some post have way more than 5000 likes 5000 being the most records you can get at one time

google-chrome	firefox
our offline app works great in firefox but over the past month or two it s had various problems in all recent version of google-chrome and chromium

14387820
rspec	capybara
if you install rspec-steps note currently not compatible with rspec newer than 2.9 you can replace describe with steps and rspec and capybara will preserve state between the examples allowing you to build a longer story

14387866
cos	sin
you swap sin and cos twice

14387905
submit	submission
run any actions that may influence form submission before submission the form then only submit the form once these complete

for this one i m simply using a time in the show and hide functions but fadein fadeout might work for you as well

14387952
nerdtree	netrw
nerdtree and netrw are already covered

14387952
nerdtree	netrw
before trying nerdtree i d suggest you try your hands on netrw as it comes with vim by default and offers a much wider range of features than nerdtree

14387952
netrw	fuzzyfinder	ctrlp	fuzzyfinder	ctrlp	netrw	nerdtree	ctrlp	nerdtree	fuzzyfinder	nerdtree	netrw	vim	textmate
somewhere between vim s default commands and netrw nerdtree you can find a bunch of fuzzy and less fuzzy file openers more or less modeled after a feature introduced in textmate a while ago fuzzyfinder lustyexplorer command-t ctrlp and many other variations on the same theme

14388046

14388082
hide	show
hide current element and show the next one

14388107
post	put
technically you could use put to alter an existing record but you need to know the record exists already so it s easier just to always use post

14388107
post	get
to be strict you could use the get link to pre-populate a form which you can use js or a confirmation submit button the user could press on the page to trigger a post request to your service

14388202
width	height
i need to implement a pinterest style column layout where each panel pin can have a different height but all panels pins have the same width

children	parent
also your relationship is not onetoone because a single parent can have many children

14388285
post	get
that pattern is called post redirect get

14388285
post	get
all business logic should be inside post method and after you invoke that you can redirect to get where you prepare your view

in google-chrome and safari it seems fine

14388391
google-chrome	firefox
the range that i am getting is very different between firefox and google-chrome

14388424
put	get
just make sure you don t put that in the constructor else you ll get an infinite loop

14388530
inherited	properties
normally you have one class that inherited from configurationsection which then has a properties that is of a type that inherited from configurationelementcollection which then returns elements of a collection of a type that inherited from configurationelement

14388538
width	height
as a part of this program i need a way to change screen resolution height and width for the directx device

14388542

obviously width and height are not so easy they may vary too

14388547
opencart	vqmod
i am writing vqmod xml to edit config.php in opencart i wrote below xml and saved it inside xml folder

14388568
prawn	pdfkit
after trying prawn and pdfkit i found that the problem with at least getting it to work at all had to do with wkhtmltopdf on mac os 10.7 but now the problem is that it completely ignores any styles i add targeting the pdf the print media type and any special templates

alright so i am trying to make my background be a gradient that is always 100 width and height and it works except for the fact that nothing will show up on top of it

14388699
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
z should be of type string not object but if you want to look at each item in the arrays and you want for use a for each loops rather than a for-loop

14388707
udp	tcp
a tcp udp connection is identified by a tuple of five values

14388707
udp	tcp
for udp sockets the data is usually sent pretty soon if not immediately but for tcp sockets there can be a relatively long delay between adding data to the send buffer and having the tcp implementation really send that data

14388707
udp	tcp
this cannot work at least not for tcp connections udp connections are no real connections anyway

14388707
freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	netbsd
freebsd openbsd netbsd

14388707
unix	bsd	pthreads	fork
at its core macos is simply a bsd-style unix named darwin based on a rather late fork of the bsd code bsd 4.3 which was then later on even re-synchronized with the at that time current freebsd 5 code base for the mac os 10.3 release so that apple could gain full pthreads compliance macos is pthreads certified

14388707
bsd	xnu
despite having a microkernel at its core mach the rest of the kernel xnu is basically just a bsd kernel and that s why macos offers the same options as bsd and they also behave the same way as in bsd

14388707
tvos	ios
ios watchos tvos

14388707
tvos	ios
watchos and tvos are ios forks that are stripped down even further especially watchos

14388707
udp	tcp
additionally the kernel performs some special magic for so_reuseport sockets that isn t found in other operating systems for udp sockets it tries to distribute datagrams evenly for tcp listening sockets it tries to distribute incoming connect requests those accepted by calling accept evenly across all the sockets that share the same address and port combination

14388707
solaris	sunos
solaris is the successor of sunos

14388707
sunos	bsd	solaris	bsd	solaris	sunos
sunos was originally based on a fork of bsd sunos 5 and later was based on a fork of svr4 however svr4 is a merge of bsd system v and xenix so up to some degree solaris is also a bsd fork and a rather early one

14388707

folder	directory
put your pyramid and mako folder in a directory named framework in your app directory

14388806

post	get
the same happens if the programmer is waiting for a get request and you actually post it

14390308
post	get
however there is a php var called request which will work with get and post

integer	unsigned
it is an unsigned type just like i was guessing and is guaranteed to be an integer type that s big enough to hold the size of any possible object in memory

since you want a logical shift you need to switch to using an unsigned integer

when you use x86 platform the code emitted by jit is always a 32bit code also on 64bit systems

14397694

in doubt i think is better to use x86 platform unless you have very specific requirements for 64bit systems

the html output of the suggests that you re mixing primefaces with icefaces

14397939

richfaces has in essence nothing which primefaces doesn t already offer

14397959

14398225
int	chars
for example if a column of int type the store procedure could generate numbers between 1 to 10000 or for a column of varchar type the store procedure could generate string of random chosen chars with a fixed length say 10

14398264
union	distinct
depending on the query ef will generate either union all with distinct or just union so your explicit distinct is not necessary

14398286

14398347
fancybox	supersized
i am using wp supersized and easy fancybox wordpress plugins

14398435
width	height
this is caused by the positioning of the arrows in your example-link the left-arrow hover is working when mouse is about 150px below the left arrow you should give it a width and height in px so the hover acts only when you are really hovering the box

14398488
children	parent
i have passed hours and days to find why php share the memory between my forked children and i figured that if the parent set a var in a function before forking then the function will always return the same result in the children

why don t you define a method with double as parameter type and later you can call it for int values as well

14398899
put	get
to get around this i attempted to put an if statement in to not display if there is no link

14398940
int	double
as r has no signed unsigned types you will have to cast your unsigned int to an int or double

14398940
integer	unsigned
or create a new r type to implement unsigned integer at the r level

14398951
submit	submission
we are submission an app to the app store and trying to figure out if we should submit for ios 5.0 or ios 6.x

versioning	upgrade
all armv7 devices can be upgrade to ios 5 so itâ s good to set that as the minimum versioning supported

14399041
versioning	upgrade
you can always update later to ios 6 when most of your user have upgrade to the versioning

14399051
width	height
the resolution of a canvas is determined by the width and height properties of the html tag

14399051
width	height
when you use css to change the width or height with which the canvas is rendered it is first drawn in the internal resolution and then scaled accordingly for display in the browser

14399062
for-loop	loops
remove the for-loop just put the while loops and do what ever you want to

14399446
flask	cherrypy
i agree with bryan about cherrypy also you can try flask

14399462
children	parent	getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
so if you want to restrict getelementbyid to search children of a specific element instead of searching the entire document in the same way one can do getelementsbytagname using a specific element as the parent you ll need to add your own proto-type to all elements but ie does not support prototyping on htmlelement or write your own function

14399526
mouseover	mouseout
i simplified your jquery a little bit and used mouseover and mouseout instead of hover

14399606
post	get
post method use httprequest and we can get parameter from htppresponse

14399629
stdout	stderr
then the locale encoding is used for stdin stdout stderr but also in test.txt which is not very well-behaved you don t want the encoding of a file to depend on the way you logged in

14399727
listview	gridview
and here is my home activty class which uses the endlesslisnter for gridview but you can use this for listview also

14399730
erd	diagram
i want to know how to design erd diagram of two different databases that have a very strong logical connection between them

14399762

14399778
post	get
make a post and change your get to post

14399806
inherited	subclassing
it can create problems if you already have a complex inherited structure especially if your class already has subclassing or intend to have one in future

14399813
sorting	filtering
the sorting and filtering all appears to happen client side and i ve searched the devexpess documentation and inspected the client side grid object and cannot find the information i need

14399813
sorting	filtering
the only option i have left is to use additional form controls external to the grid to control the sorting and filtering

14399813
sorting	filtering
i d really rather not do this as my client is very keen on the built-in sorting and filtering functionality

14399831
hive	hdfs
i got everything to work fine hdfs mapred zookeeper hbase hive etc

14399835
width	height
but if i ll change width height in onmeasure problem will remain - i m using layoutparams.wrap_content so textview just change it s size according to values provided in setmeasureddimensions

14399838
portrait	landscape

14399923
pop-up	dialog
in my js view-code i am using a jquery ui dialog component to render a pop-up

14399929
getter	setter
i have lots of classes and some of them have public variables some have private variables with setter and getter methods and same have both types

14399941
createfile	getlasterror
there is no guarantee that getlasterror will survive whatever the jvm is doing between your native call to createfile and your native call to getlasterror

14399941
createfile	getlasterror
therefore you should immediately call getlasterror after createfile and save the value in a thread local slot of your own

14399960
getter	setter
providing getter and setter for them breaks that encapsulation but it s still better than public data members because there s only once access point to that data

14399960
getter	setter
as much as possible ban getter setter and make properties private

14399978
getter	setter
public variables are usually discouraged and the better form is to make all variables private and access them with getter and setter

14399978
getter	setter
modern ides like eclipse and others help you doing this by providing features like implement getter and setter and encapsulate field which replaces all direct acccesses of variables with the corresponding getter and setter calls

14399986
getter	setter
further getter and setter and a constructor with initialised the version to current_version is needed
