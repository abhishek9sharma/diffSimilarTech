11520215
vim	emacs
there are definitely some advantages using external editors however emacs is ten million times better than vim

11520215
vim	emacs
stick with xcode for most stuff but when you need the power of emacs or possibly vim bulk repetitive editor macros is my main reason just edit the file using show in finder and open with or just by switching to your editor navigating to the file from there

11520215
vim	emacs
for plain code i d stick with xcode it s code completion is based on more knowledge of the code so beat s emacs or vim s hands down

it was clear from the beginning that the problem is in jni i cross checked the native code and found that i was using memset and memcpy in jni with wrong number of bytes

11520660
setinterval	settimeout
fwiw it s actually better to use settimeout instead of setinterval and then re-start the timer each time around

11520693
portrait	landscape
for example you need to choose an appropriate preview size now that it s in portrait not landscape

11520701

11521160
domcontentloaded	onreadystatechange
there might be some problem with domcontentloaded event as none version of ie afaik does recognizes it and developers are obligated to use onreadystatechange instead

11521160
domcontentloaded	onreadystatechange
but doesn t changed onreadystatechange into domcontentloaded

11521160
domcontentloaded	onreadystatechange
i can t use above line in window.addeventlistener part because this will rewrite domcontentloaded into onreadystatechange event even for other browsers and fail there as they use domcontentloaded

11521160
google-chrome	firefox	domcontentloaded	onreadystatechange
or maybe i m wrong because as i just tested neither domcontentloaded nor onreadystatechange is being fired in my ie 8 first one fires correctly in firefox google-chrome

11521166
floating-point	integer
... from an integer type ... to a floating-point type except where the source is a constant expression and the actual value after conversion will fit into the target type and will produce the original value when converted back to the original type

11521274
rss	feed
you mist keep in mind that there are both atom and rss feed

11521283
getter	setter
note that i changed your setmycheckboxvalue to mycheckboxvalue because the setter method is automatically detected by jsf if you correctly define your variable foo with the getter getfoo and the setter setfoo ...

11521293
domcontentloaded	addeventlistener
with this in mind you can pretty much work on the assumption that if addeventlistener is supported so is domcontentloaded

11521293
opera	safari
unless someone lands on your page using opera 8 or safari 3.0 probably unlikely

11521302
rss	feed
the rss feed was already in the script

11521360
setinterval	settimeout
the reason is settimeout and setinterval do not guarantee that your code will execute after the specified delay

11521360
setinterval	settimeout
the above delta timer is better than setinterval method 1 makes use of settimeout method 2 but also corrects itself starts the timer using a function method 3 and doesn t pollute the scope with a special clockstart function method 4

11521408
public	protected
as you are saying that there is no accessbile due to protection level you need to work on the access modifier of form from protected to public so that it can be accessible

11521411

anyway you will mostly need to use hide show functions to reach something like that

11521411
hide	show
also check this site - it will show you some info about show hide functions

stdout	stderr
if by daemon process you mean the file descriptors of stdin stdout and stderr are not connected to any tty or pts then yes

11521482
stdout	stderr
so just opening something for stdin stdout and stderr should work

11521482
stdout	stderr
however you should have tried it yourself first firefox here opens perfectly with stdin stdout and stderr redirected to dev null

11521495
uiview	calayer
the layer used by the uiview must be a custom calayer that implements those messages

11521534
getter	setter
for smaller projects that i ve built i shared my entities they were just simple dtos serializable data buckets with getter and setter across the layers and didn t care too much about this

11521554
hide	show
by default the from view will be added and the to view will be removed from the super view but if you know that they will flip back you can add the uiviewanimationoptionshowhidetransitionviews to instead have the views only show and hide when they transition

11521568
google-chrome	firefox
i tried firefox 14 and google-chrome 18

11521632

you need to run xcode-select to tell xcodebuild and xcrun which xcode you want to use

11521753
boost	allocator
what about allocator the memory before reverting it this way you only have one allocator call and should hopefully get a nice performance boost

11521762

solution is to just use the formatting flags on std ostringstream

11521780
width	height
however i specify a minimum height and width for the user control

11521840
uiviewcontroller	uipageviewcontroller
maybe i just don t understand your question but uipageviewcontroller takes an array of uiviewcontroller subclasses

11521852
setinterval	settimeout
use settimeout instead of setinterval

11521863
activemq	rabbitmq
you should utilize load balancing where possible if you could make some process asynchronous then do it - using something like activemq or rabbitmq this will stop ui hangs

11521886

the table1.filter filters the data in tdataset not in btrieve pervasive

11522136
put	get
to get this to work as above you d need to put the following in your .ssh config file

11522151
ember.js	backbone.js
it doesn t have to be angularjs but i picked it because it feels more natural to me than either knockout ember.js or backbone.js

11522203

1 look at the documentation for getchar and you will see it returns an int so there is enough room to store a chars s value

11522227

i need this image to fit to width height i specified i don t care about the original size of an image that s why i set preserveaspectratio to none

11522263

it supports sorting out of the box and also grouping can be done

11522279
width	height
this means that when the dom loads the width and height will be 0

11522279
width	height
only after the images themselves finish loading will the element have a width and height appropriately set

11522322
onresume	onpause
you can set up a counter increment it in activity s onresume and decrement on onpause

11522348
sorting	grouping
just perform all the sorting grouping counting server side and provide your client with all the data already processed and ready to show

11522370

x86	mips
a cross compiler would allow you to compile on a host machine x86 in your case for a target machine mips in your case

11522533
x86	mips
so you would be able to generate mips binaries from your x86 machine

11522536
opera	firefox
it now works on firefox opera and ie9 as well

11522536

it is working perfectly in google-chrome but fails in firefox with the errors not well-formed and request method get not supported

11522688
google-chrome	firefox
my question is now how do i get .post or .ajax to return a string in firefox they already do so in google-chrome

11522705
for-loop	loops
line in to the program and remove the for-loop add while loops for thet

11522742
min	max
simply check their distance to min and max and if the result values are larger than the maximum difference for two adjacent values pick them

11522743
int	chars
regarding your second question getc returns an int which if it s not eof can be interpreted as a chars or a byte depending on if you read text or binary data

11522746
ubuntu	linux
installing wkhtmltopdf on ubuntu linux machine

11522746

ubuntu	linux
i m using opencv via python on linux ubuntu 12.04 and i have a logitech c920 from which i d like to grab images

11522787
portrait	landscape
but all other directions rotate perfectly landscape and the other portrait when the camera on botton and home button on top

11522794
width	height
when you set the width it will automatically set the height to the correct value of the width height ratio

11522798
implements	extends
so that only one activity will implements that sliding menu functionality and all other activities extends that activity will have that implementation

11522870
post	put
you should put the functionality in the controller you post the ajax call too

11522882
mouseout	mouseleave
thanks to another resource i was able to solve the problem by using the mouseleave event instead of mouseout

11522907
google-chrome	firefox
that little black line protrudes out from behind my dropdown menu and in firefox the word resources will appear underneath home but it ie and google-chrome the menu looks as it should except for that little black line that sticks out

11522936
width	height
i have a container with a small fixed height and a width of 100

11522946
put	get	post	get	post	put
a restful api has to use either get post put or delete request methods

11522983

hash	md5
email hash is the crc32 and md5 hash of the email address combined

11523009

long answer you can target landscape and portrait orientations with media queries and can alter your design for each circumstance

11523016
viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
so maybe you want to use that value after viewdidload maybe in viewwillappear or viewdidappear or adjust it manually by substract the height of bars

11523058
cobertura	emma
it seems like both cobertura and emma are outdated now

11523072
getter	setter
if i didn t miss something you have to create an entity with some properties getter setter and so on in order to make it persist into a db

11523072
post	put
when you render and post a form you bind it with your entity and with constraints of course and use all the concepts defined above to put all together

11523151
width	height
i ve tried binding the width and height of the path s to the contentpresenters width and height but no dice

11523151
width	height
note that in the image above the text fits in the width and height of the path however when i add text or remove text from the contentpresenter it does not resize

11523152
addclass	removeclass
i know that there is a jquery function to addclass and removeclass

11523160
post	get
what i mean is that as long that it is a valid url it will work and you ll be able to get the parameters via get or post

11523160
post	get
in order to post data about foo you might call as a post request and now the rest fw know that since its a post request it will call the method responsible for handling post and not the one for handling get

11523160
put	get	post	get	post	put
so although you have the same url it really matters if its a get post put delete request

11523169
width	height
to find the screen width and height then you can scale the image using

11523253
for-loop	arrays
the first uses the for-loop with the second doing the same but not using the arrays s length property just for interest

11523296
post	get
found out the issue john doe s post in this question helped to get to the answer - javascript load order

11523305
min	max
variables which do not participate in active constraints can be set at either min value or max value 0 or 1 as per your description depending on whether their coefficients in the objective function are positive or negative assuming you are minimizing your objective function

11523307
actualheight	actualwidth
i d suggest binding the path property to the actualwidth actualheight of the contentpresenter using a converter to calculate the path.data

11523307
width	height
since two properties are needed height and width you ll need an imultivalueconverter or you ll need to pass the entire contentpresenter into your binding like this

11523318
margin	height	width	margin	width	height
what i have done before is set the top margin of the element to -1000 and the position to absolute the get the width and height after that setting the top margin right

11523337
implements	extends
instead of extends class it can also implements any interface

11523397
width	height
which is correct since the cgsize is defined as width height

11523432
for-loop	loops
i have a for-loop in a while loops

11523433
width	height
i fixed the problem by setting the height and width of the dialog to the same of the iframe

11523434
put	get
i create some object objcake and put it into both maps so each map has a reference to objcake and when i make some changes to objcake whichever map i access it from i get correct state of my object

11523451
range	max	range	min	min	max
if you want the full range of doubles you could set min max to -double.max_value and double.max_value respectively.

11523473
int	boolean
this should be completely safe from malicious code unlike eval but the object that it is able to read are must be simple objects strings int floats none and boolean or lists tuples dictionaries composed entirely of strings int floats none and boolean

11523495
dbcontext	objectcontext
and i expect context to be object of objectcontext or dbcontext

11523514
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
if you serialize the container and deserialize it back the references should be what you were expecting because the objectinputstream and objectoutputstream keep references to them while serializing deserializing your object graph

11523522
post	get
2 post 1 session you get a no session bound to the current context -error

11523532
getter	setter
if your business objects entities are anemic i mean if they donâ t have business logic just getter and setter then you will prefer soa

11523569
int	chars
however when i entered a chars it goes into an infinite loop displaying the previous int value entered

11523671
dictionary	map
i would recommend a map object which is different from the dictionary to allow get and co as message names

11523681
int	double
the range of double exceeds that of both int and long which is why the return type of math.round double is double

11523711
ant	emma
publishesr and subscribers of main classes are getting executed .currently working in code coverage part using the tool emma .i have created the build file using ant script and created the targets for emma at present m facing issue as mentioned below

mp3	wav	mp3	flv
it works for mp3 wav avi flv but still no go for 3gp mp4 mov m4v

11523734
width	height
this actually creates a view with the right height and width a scrollview with a list of those has exactly the expected length and scrollbars but they are empty black even though the xml layout contains a lot of textviews

11523787
onclick	onfocus
well you could add your function to onclick or onfocus attribute and check if the user hasnt changed anything it should do the trick

11523791
draggable	droppable
you should also read docs on droppable and draggable

11523855
abstract-class	superclass
this way you can spare abstract-class with a cost of defining a rigid superclass so you would be unable to have different superclass for the square

11523888
google-chrome	firefox
in my tests firefox google-chrome the placeholer shows grey text

11523972
multiplying	multiplication
for matlab multiplying an array by a scalar applies the multiplication to each element of the array

11523981
int	chars
if i ll enter a non numeric chars or a string instead of an int it ll give me type violation error

if you look at the default embed link for the video the width height is 500 281 which differs by a factor of about 1.78

your width height ratio is 2.15

but logging in the first way three inputs only google-chrome and firefox ask

11528380
put	get
to get around that use the extern keyword to tell the compiler this name will be declared somewhere else and then put the real declaration in an implementation file

11528380
put	get
it doesn t appear that _x is a function but if it were and if you were silly enough to put the function definition in a header file then you d again get an error if that file were imported into more than one implementation file

11528775
put	get
sc0tt is correct that you probably want to use however that might not be good enough to get what you want since your frames will likely resize themselves depending on what you put in them unless you do myframe.grid_propagate false

11528809
nswindowcontroller	nsviewcontroller
add an iboutlet to your nswindowcontroller or nsviewcontroller that is bound to the nsarraycontroller

11528812

if your selected is a result of a filtered view e.result will be an ienumerable of anonymous type so getting the information will most likely require using an iqueryable and a viewmodel object

11528819
stdout	stderr
you may also want to consider redirecting stdout and stderr to a file or dev null to prevent nohup from writing output to a file

11528825
equals	gethashcode
the rule for implementing gethashcode is that any two objects that are equals must generate the same hash code

int	boolean
this implementation uses the bitarray class to take your boolean array in groups of 32 treats them as bits and computes the hash code of the resulting 32-bit int

11528845
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox etc

11528845
google-chrome	firefox
which makes the client firefox google-chrome etc produce an alert box

11528876
serializable	deserialization
both filename field and method getfilename have the correct property name of filename and setfilename has a different one filename1 in this case jackson will look for a filename1 attribute in json at the point of deserialization and will create a attribute called filename1 at the point of serializable

11528890
pop-up	dialog
instead of built-in javascript dialog box pop-up - that are ugly and impossible to customize with css - i would recommend using jquery dialog box controls

11528913
inherited	properties
if you re saying this because there s additional functionality in class a that doesn t apply to class c then i would hoist out the properties part of the class compositionally so you have a b c containing aprops bprops and cprops respectively and give the properties classes a proper inherited relationship

11528933
width	height
32px height by width would be much larger obviously

make sure to put all 8 icons in a sprite so you only load 1 image and use the proper background position to get the correct image for each icon and their hover state

11529361
cpu	processors
nowadays with cache-based pipelined branch-predictive hardware your cpu will be pipelined well into the next loop iteration speculatively executing the loop code again by the time you detect the i end exit condition at which point the processors will throw out that final speculatively-executed set of results

11530561
public	protected
what is the difference between a public abstract class with a public constructor and a public class with a protected constructor

11530561
public	protected
wouldn t having a protected constructor in a public class signify that instantiation of this class is not possible this is the only constructor we have

11530565
folder	directory
however when i try to expand one of the virtual directory the other works fine to see sub folder iis manager becomes unresponsive almost immediately

i would do a public abstract class with a protected constructor

11530626
public	protected
a public abstract class with a protected or internal constructor conveys how you want calling code to use it

11530661
subclass	abstract-class
but dictionary is an abstract-class and its only known subclass in the standard lib is hashtable which the api various ide s complain about because it s obsolete.

the tested file is a 2-page pdf where the first page is in portrait a4 and the second page is in landscape a4 format

11530715
for-loop	arrays
instead of just assigning the old pointer to the new one do a for-loop on the number of elements in the arrays and assign each one to the new copy

11530734
clang	llvm
with gcc and compatible compilers perhaps clang llvm you might use __builtin_return_address and related builtins

11530734

11531004
maven	pom.xml
finally i understand that maven might provide a solution since netbeans can use maven-based projects where the maven pom.xml is the project file and one doesn t have to deal with other ide-specific artefacts however there is enough maven fud on the web i don t cite sources as i don t want to sidetrack the discussion that i don t feel comfortable using it for a major undertaking without any significant prior exposure to it

yacc	bison
there are lots of parser-generators in the wild yacc bison antlr javacc which will help you focus on coding just grammar rules for your dsl

11531181
yacc	bison
still you have to spend effort bending your conceptual grammar to limitations of the particular parser generator lalr 1 ll k ... antlr bison yacc will help you build trees

as free ing the malloc ed memory - in this small sample program you don t need to worry about it because the system will free the memory after your program exits but in general you should try to free whatever you ve allocated so as to avoid memory leaks in larger programs

11538751
free	malloc
if your program made more use of dynamically-allocated memory then either the calls to malloc free would trigger a crash because your structure overwrote the heap s linking metadata or other parts of the program writing to their own malloc ed data would overwrite your structure

i am totally totally clueless when it comes to powershell but after downloading an enormous torrent full of subdirectories publisher.title.author.year essentially each containing one or more zip files which when unzipped each contained a part of a multi-file rar arhive and finally once assembled that contained a uselessly named pdf file.

11545765
ready	each
so i came up with this rough and ready script to recurse into each subdirectory unzip the zips into that directory then assemble the rar files and extract the pdf into that directory then rename the pdf with the directory name and move it up a directory so by the end i ended up with the base directory full of meaningfully named pdf files.

11545784

jena	dotnetrdf
as a developer on both dotnetrdf and jena i personally dislike the notion of jena.net besides the fact that there is likely to be some degree of performance hit involved in running ported code there is the fact that jena is very non .net in it s design in many ways - naming conventions design patterns static factories everywhere

11545826
jena	dotnetrdf
if there are specific features of jena that you d like to see in dotnetrdf i d be much more interested in just writing native .net implementations of those features using jena codebase as a guide

11546024
vb.net	vb6
a typical vb6 standalone application would map to a vb.net winforms application and once you get to that point the coding differences you ll come across will highlight how much better the object orientation of the .net world is than vb6 - you ll get true implementation inheritance all most of the other goodies of oo

11546054

this method is presumably what the django docs on widgets are referring to when it says the widget handles the rendering of the html and the extraction of data from a get post dictionary that corresponds to the widget. there s nothing further on this point in the docs but you can see how it works from the code for the built-in widgets

11547571

free	realloc
is it necessary to free memory before using realloc again for a pointer variable

11548883
free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	malloc
it should also be mentioned that realloc s capabilities also cover malloc s and free s functionality given the appropriate argument values

11548883
realloc	malloc
what you are doing in the second cycle of your code is essentially using realloc in pure malloc mode

11548890
free	realloc
the specific usefulness of realloc is that you don t need to free before using it it exists to grow memory that has already been allocated

11548890
realloc	malloc
when passed a null pointer realloc behaves as malloc

11548890
free	malloc
if you re using free before calling it you might as well be using malloc

11548901
realloc	malloc
realloc null n is the same as malloc n so the second case is semantically equivalent to

11548901
free	realloc
it should be noted that realloc will return null if the allocation fails -- but if you passed it a non- null pointer then that allocation will not have been free

11548943

for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
i wouldn t see a big difference between using a standard for-loop and a for in loops for an arrays although as a point of clarity i d tend to used the standard notation unless i was using something like a .each function which would take care of it for me

stdout	stderr
i d basically like to have a listener be fired every time a line is written to stdout or stderr to synchronously write file lines to an array or something

11567912

note this solution will return the children of sets of certain lengths not the parent element as you have asked

11567933
gridview	sqldatasource
the gridview i have is bounded by an sqldatasource

11567940

could you give me some advice or maybe like i said before there is an easier way to generate simple entity-relationship diagram from database

11568687
hide	show
i know i could achieve this effect by creating all of the fields before hand and then simply using css to show hide each one but this is a lot of repetitive code

11568692
postgresql	mysql
if you want to switch from say mysql to postgresql you will find things extremely difficult without using migrations

11568707
innodb	myisam
ok so it seems changing the storage engine on the database table from innodb to myisam solved the issue

integer	unsigned
please note that you might prefer using unsigned long integer long integer to receive the value

11568800
mp3	aiff	mp3	wav	mp3	ogg	wav	aiff	wav	ogg	aiff	ogg
mp3 and ogg will probably give you similar performance so first identify how mp3 compares to uncompressed audio such as wav or aiff

11568800
mp3	ogg
if mp3 ogg is better try different compression ratios and sample rates to see which goes faster

11568800
mp3	wav	mp3	ogg	wav	ogg
with wav files you can try lowering the sample rate you can do this with mp3 ogg as well

11568822

11568922
sharepoint	spsite
i started off by using web services to read the listitems from a certain list which worked to a certain extent. i couldn t do any more testing because it was immediately recommendeded that i stop using that method and instead try to use sharepoint s own services like by using microsoft.sharepoint and the respective .dll in my project. i found plenty of tutorials on how to go about doing this online but i keep getting hung up on one part namely the spsite portion

11568996
post	get
however whenever i call the page or search methods that normally work on my post collection i get a method does not exist error

some rest apis use query strings for filtering pagination and sorting but since rest isn t a strict standard i d recommend checking some rest apis out there such as github and stackoverflow and see what could work well for your use case

11569114
folder	directory
i have a small program which iterates recursively through each file and folder under a target directory checking the names for specific characters

11569114
folder	directory
when the top level and all subordinate directory are folder which the user has read access everything works fine again

11569114
folder	directory
the issue lies with directory where the user has read access to the top level but does not for some child folder deeper within

11569127
google-chrome	firefox
but it does not with firefox nor google-chrome

you should check out another thread that contrasts the capabilities of nunit and mstest

11569208
pull	push
what i found at the end was that the way i shall use nested arrays is with push and pull

11569213

but once you have a dependency listed in either of the pom.xml files parent or child then maven should be able to have all the dependencies in the classpath whereby it is able to deploy all the dependencies

11569644
int	chars
i had a thought that i could be sneaky and read the file as a formatted file byte-by-byte or 4 bytes by 4 bytes really into a chars array and then convert the contents of the chars into int and floats via the transfer function or the dreaded equivalence statement

11569653
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly in firefox and google-chrome and opera

11569661
hide	show
other idea one liner replaces your code if hide and show are existing methods contained by this.window

11569692
int	chars
if the int promotion would promote the unsigned chars s to unsigned int s and that could produce wrong results because before the modulus by w a modulus by uint_max + 1 is performed due to unsigned arithmetic

11569719
symfony	silex
i m really new to silex and symfony

11569719
post	get
i would like to create a page that just dumps the post get array to give me an idea how to pass around get post variables

11569828
switching	screens
when the specific screens is visible it should count down - when switching to another screens the countdown obviously must not be updated

11569848
superclass	subclassing
the subclassing method s return type r2 may be different from superclass

11569848
superclass	subclassing
subclassing can return type may be a subtype of superclass return type

11569875
request-uri	url
but if the data are long since the data are passed as part of the url i will get request-uri too large error

11569876
post	get
so i should work with params in index action and just get post by slug in show action checking whether date is corect is an option

11569893
superclass	subclassing
you re breaking the liskov principle everything a superclass can do a subclassing must be able to do

11569903
superclass	subclassing
what this means is that a method in a subclassing may return an object whose type is a subclassing of the type returned by the method with the same signature in the superclass

11570026
submit	submission
to the form when submission otherwise it will still submit as a normal form without using ajax and reload the page

11570049
int	chars
curiously you are assigning an int value back to the schtax chars column which you were previously expecting to be a decimal value as a formatted string

11570073
min	max
the biggest difference in max min over these values over a certain period say 1 60th of a second will be the volume of that frame

11570073
min	max
the max min amplitudes measured do not correspond to a specific decibels value of say 50 or 120

11570173

try resumable.js it s a javascript library that supports chunking but only in google-chrome and firefox

11570272
maven	pom.xml
i understand that pom.xml true is a recent grails 2.1.0 feature and it should be possible to integrate grails into a maven build while still managing dependencies in buildconfig.groovy

post	put
now what i need to do is change the method so that i can do a put for an update and a post for a create new

but if i do domain.com calgary test.php that folder is not reading properly because it thinks that the files are in calgary even though it s a virtual directory

11570366

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i thought it might be a browser issue but i cant view the images from firefox google-chrome or safari

my solution was to set the width and height of the canvas element in the html

11570505
bmp	png
about bitmaps i wrote my own bitmap class to convert a png to a bmp because the bitmapfactory and co didn t work for me

11570526
apache	nginx
you can create custom controller to serve that files and use send_file mentod in it with disposition inline also you may be interested to x_sendfile_header setting to serwe that files with apache nginx which is faster

11570573

you have put the post parts in the fbdidlogin method

11570574

11570724
free	malloc
i want to understand how does memory leak checkers identify if a free has been called for a given malloc

11570738
public	protected
if your method is part of the public interface of a class either public or protected then you cannot trust the parameters that you are receiving and therefore you should validate them

11570742
nsmenu	nspopupbutton
you edit the nsmenu that s attached to the nspopupbutton as follows

11570756
free	malloc
so look for free that is called with the same argument which was returned by malloc previously

you can use the rdtsc read timestamp counter instruction on x86 to get the 64bit cpu timestamp into edx eax

11570791

11570901
draggable	droppable
can this be done while still leaning on the jquery draggable droppable resizable classes or am i better off rewriting the whole thing

11570913
onclick	preventdefault
the preventdefault stops the normla event propogation so left clicking the link will use your onclick method without sacrificing the valuable info stored in the href

11570916
for-loop	loops
if it does go in codeaddresses does that mean i can get rid of the for-loop because codeaddresses is triggered from a loops and gets run during each iteration

11570954
min	max
here is a simple method that will generate a color based on the relative position of a value between min and max

11570954
min	max
values closer to min will be greener while values closer to max will be redder

11570954
min	max
to use this method generate your list of values and calculate the min and max values

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
this is happening in all browsers that i ve tested ie6+ firefox google-chrome safari

11571012
geocoding	geocode
the best strategy is to geocode the addresses offline using the geocoding web service store the coordinates in your database then use them to display the markers this will reduce the time to load your page since the geocode is subject to rate limits and quotas

11571072
stdout	stderr
redirecting stderr to stdout works because stdout is already pointing at the pipe

11571072
stdout	stderr
less s stdout and stderr both presumably started out pointed at the terminal so in this case has no effect

11571072
stdout	stderr
and cmd1 and cmd3 s stderr and cmd3 s stdout - the terminal

11571072
stdout	stderr
if you use the bash-specific pipe things get stranger because each of the pipeline s stdout redirects still occur first but the stderr redirect actually comes last

11571072
stdout	stderr
first stdout of f goes to the pipe next stdout of f is redirected to dev null and finally stderr is redirected to stdout dev null still

11571078

11571184
textarea	textbox
the text in textbox is not set with a textnode like for textarea but with the value attribute

11571216
range	minimum
for example i used a srtm in ca whose elevation range is from 136 to 737 but when i use numpy to get the maximum and minimum values the array value range is from -3.40 to 737 and it appears lots of negative values

11571257
multiplying	add
instead add the padding then multiplying by the row and column

11571326
google-chrome	safari
you can set the article to position absolute set its overflow to hidden however this won t work in google-chrome safari but there is a fix for it css masks

11571395
ggplot2	aesthetics
the ggplot2 way to do this is to always put data in a data frame and map the aesthetics

11571410
put	get
i don t quite get how this helps your problem plus it seems to put the concerns in the wrong place the model should ideally have nothing to do with the dom

11571435
serializable	deserialization
i understand how to create a modelbinder to handle the deserialization from the uri but not the serializable part

11571463

11571482
rss	feed
it sounds like you have a bad rss feed perhaps one that claims to be utf-8 but is actually encoded differently like iso8859-1

11571513

static methods of the same name defined in a subclassing can hide the superclass method but they do not override them

hash	md5
if you don t want to go with this method because you don t want a 2nd column you could just md5 hash the id or some other hashing method

11571761

11572113
google-chrome	safari
i have no idea why google-chrome dev tools web inspector s computed style shows 11px as the font-size also applies to any webkit browser including safari

a chars enclosed in single quotes is just the same as the int representing it in the collating sequence in ascii implementation a means exactly the same as 97

11572177
int	chars
because an int is always large enough to hold several chars some implementations of c compilers allow multiple chars in a chars constant as well as a string constant which means that writing abc instead of abc may well go undetected

11572317
getter	setter

you theoretically could write a setter but for a getter you would need to specify a key that you want to retrieve

11583700
google-chrome	firefox
however in google-chrome firefox and ie9 it works fine

11583709
realloc	malloc
instead of repeated calls to realloc you could do a first loop across arr to determine the total length then call malloc just the once

11583715
getter	setter
it is possible to do so with the setter but highly unrecommended and is completely impossible with the getter as it takes no parameter to determine what to get

11583715
getter	setter
for the setter you would have to pass a with a single pair but it goes against what you would expect the getter setter to usually do and completely stops you setting the entire dictionary

11583718
post	get
see this previous so post to get an idea of how to do it

m2e	pom.xml	maven	m2e	maven	pom.xml
however i ve had this issue a few times now and each time the problem is that there is some section of the pom.xml that maven accepts but m2e barfs on

11583855
maven	pom.xml
just keep running maven - update configuration after each pom.xml edit until it works as it should

11583919
width	height
additionally you could also set the height width or the padding of the anchor or li element to adjust to the dimensions of your images

post	get
if there is a way to get the post shrink to fit font size from excel then i can populate the powerpoint and change the font size but i only know how to get the font size of a cell which is not updated to reflect shrink to fit

11583997
post	get
as you seem to be pretty comfortable with diving in to the code and running in debug mode one avenue to try is to capture the defective post url and post data and attempting the update via a browser based rest client like simple rest client or poster and observing if you get the same error message in the wsapi response

11584000
strlen	strcpy
with this you can remove the overhead of iterations in strcpy and strlen functions

11584007
put	get
if i just manually put it in the libs armeabi-v7a directory it does not get packaged when i build

11584043

i ve looked into multiple post but i still didn t get it

11584045
isotope	masonry
it solved a similar problem like masonry or isotope

11584071
put	get
put more intelligence into your code and you won t have to rely on the non-technical user to get things exactly right

11584083
afnetworking	sdwebimage
as you can see this is non-trivial and i d suggest you using an existing uiimageview category such as those available as part of sdwebimage or afnetworking

11584098
gtk	wnck
i have read gtk set active window but i want to do it without installation of wnck also gtk.windows.present dont work for me

for-loop	arrays
i want to create a single dimensional arrays in matlab inside for-loop please help with below code

11584160
for-loop	arrays
what i actually did was to create a string arrays of search terms and then using a for-loop i create as many different text fields as i need

11584185
post	get
that block will only prevent post requests from hosts other than 127.0.0.1 and you will get a 403 forbidden response

11584210
uitableview	nsindexpath
i will recommend you to overload the method - cgfloat tableview uitableview tableview heightforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath instead

11584218
google-chrome	firefox
whereas at least in a modern browser like google-chrome or firefox console.log also accepts multiple arguments so that this would produce imho superior output

11584225
vb.net	vb6	vb6	vba
dms has production front ends for many languages both modern and legacy including visual basic in its variety of dialects vb6 vba essentially the same as vb6 and vb.net

11584225
vb6	vba
this is pretty hard for legacy languages vb especially the older dialects because such languages are generally poorly documented vb6 and vba especially so

11584308
google-chrome	firefox
works in firefox google-chrome and even ie6

11584344
width	height
also do not set fixed width and height if you want them to be managed automatically

11584355
for-loop	arrays
edit if you are trying to find a single item of an arrays that matches some criteria i would suggest just using a regular for-loop

11584365
int	chars
as shown in for bar bar int m chars n initialize base using m and n works fine

11584397
int	chars
the code relies on a regular expression to find all sequences of hex digits converting them to int and casting the resultant value to a chars

11584417
width	height
your problem seems to be that you are sizing your scrollviewer to fit landscape mode the height of your control is 768px while the width is 1353px

11584448
pop-up	dialog
but when i execute the part that is suppose to create a pop-up dialog box giving the user the option to save run cancel for any type of download nothing happens

11584454
int	chars
we access the each pixel value and cast using unsigned chars pointer to get int value

11584457

i ve managed to work around this problem by directly changing directory with chdir to the folder where the .exe is located then chdir ing back to my original working directory

11584504
hex	binary
after some fight i finally got it...i just need to convert the binary to hex and then back to binary.

11584504
hex	binary
two notes to convert a binary to hex you can use string.unpack which will return an array

11584504
hex	binary
to convert an hex to binary you first need to build it as an array anystringhere and then pack it back to binary using array.pack

11584538
memcached	apc
i ve read an article about distributed hash tables and seems it s possible to implement such a thing like memcached with apc

11584538
memcached	apc
as you know apc is much more faster than memcached if we re fetching keys from a single server

pull	push
if you clone using the https address then that will be saved as the remote location for your repository and will be where git tries to push and pull from

11584797
pull	push
not much except that if you don t want to log-in to github in order to push and pull then you want to be using the ssh address so that you can authenticate with your public key

give div a fixed height and width and overflow hidden

11584905
filtering	grouping
i suggest you add a filtering before the grouping that removes records with nulls and also potentially bad records

11584939
folder	directory
you may drop your css folder under the content directory in the root of your mvc project

11584944
hbase	hypertable
as a result one group founded hypertable a c++ implementation and the other group started working on hbase in java

11584959
children	parent
in your case it seems that there is not a clear view flow hierarchy your parent view holds a view that can change but your parent view does not come before or go after your first and second children views so let s start making our transitions

11584959
children	parent
you can get your first and second viewcontrollers by instantiating your two children view controllers in your parent view controller as such

11584962

getter	setter
it represents current state of the object doesn t actually do anything when invoked other than report that state and generally getter setter in .net are properties

11584990
accessor	properties
this would be particularly true if the method returned void of course which isn t the case here so this could be considered a borderline issue and not even a question in languages which don t have properties but just use accessor methods which under the hood is what a properties does

11585057
width	height
maybe you can try box-sizing if you mixing width height with padding border

11585057
width	height
it ll force the browser to take the width height value

11585124
put	get
obviously you d need a recursive query to get the sub-categories from all levels but it should be fairly efficient provided you put an index on parent_id

keydown	keyup
also in the following code i ve added sanity checks to try and ensure that the keyup keydown will only happen and therefore only trigger a change event when the select option s selected option can actually change

11585315
toolbar	tabs
dock a toolbar to the bottom of this container and fill the items array with different tabs

11585315
toolbar	tabs
in your controller add control properties to your config object for each of the tabs in the toolbar and listen for the tab tap event

11585331
google-chrome	firefox
use firebug on firefox or just right click and chose inspect element on google-chrome to see in which css file properties are defined

11585363
margin	height	width	margin	width	height
as a rule of thumb if you want good browser compatibility don t put width and margin padding left or right in the same element same with height and margin padding top bottom

11585363
width	margin
try putting a container like a around #menu_option and put the width there and leave the margin in the internal element just to see if it makes it any better

11585424
superclass	subclassing
i now realise that although in my case it works fine it is somewhat dangerous since subclassing methods are called on an object that has currently only been constructed as a superclass object something that may be overlooked when new classes that extend superclass are added in the future

11585485
children	parent
there are also different types of trees -- i am going to assume that you are using a normal old tree any number of children no more than one parent one root node

beginning with android 3.2 api level 13 the screen size also changes when the device switches between portrait and landscape orientation

11585586
portrait	landscape
it views upside-down only in landscape mode and not in portrait and in landscape from version 2.2 if i remember correctly

11585586

11585791
width	height
when the form loads it displays the size of the form s width and height in each textbox

11585791

i used the code below so you can set the size you want and then it applys it to the form s size but still haven t figured out how to automatically detect the form s width and height when it s resized

11585849
punctuation	words
it will parse the sentences into words and punctuation

11585849
punctuation	words
the words will be entered into a dictionary and the punctuation into a list

11585849
punctuation	words
each entry in the dictionary and list will have a count of the number of times the words or punctuation appears in the original text

11585851
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie because ie does not support the input form attribute

11585863

a much better solution though would be to use something like hudson jenkins teamcity or some other free cheap build server

11585866
webkit	gecko
i have an svg file that was generated by illustrator that i have modified slightly so that i can use it as a mask on both webkit and gecko

11585909
width	height
here is the code as you can see the image will maintain its aspect ratio since i used the width 100 but other elements have their own size width and height which cannot be in percent

11585909
width	height
so ideally i like to set the width height top and left position of those elements when resizing the window keeping their aspect ration correctly

11585920
children	parent
each qobject maintains a parent pointer and a list of its children which it deletes when it gets deleted

11585920

for this reason and to avoid bloat from #1 the qt datatypes qstring qhash etc. aren t qobject

put	get
what you have to do is do a request to the php page if you are going to use this on a real app and not for an exercise you ll have to put the page somewhere publicly and get the data for processing

mouse	keyboard
however if i then move the mouse out of the item the input field reverts to whatever the user had typed losing the selection previously made via the keyboard

11586401
put	get
i get the feeling that the problem with your attempt is likely to be the order of the rules a missing rewritecond on the redirect rewriterule and or that you didn t put a l flag in the redirect rewriterule - but the above regexes make me happier than yours do because they are a little more specific about what they match

11586430
ggplot2	lattice
my experience has been that people coming to ggplot2 or lattice graphics fundamentally misunderstand the purpose of faceting or trellising in lattice

i don t particularly like mysql triggers because the syntax isn t that great and they don t do as much as they do in other databases like postgresql or oracle

11586600
for-loop	loops
assuming that you want the object to be defined as its final value when loops exits don t delete the object explicitly at the end of the for-loop do so at the beginning of loops like this

int	double
the int above and below both those quantities are precisely representable as float but the nearest double to each of them has a fractional part of precisely 0.5

11586688
int	double
because converting such double values between 2 23 and 2 24 with a fractions of precisely 0.5 to float will round to the nearest even int

11586701
for-loop	loops
you can use a for-loop to loops over the json and print out the information you need

11586731
post	get
the users u_id is logged with a timestamp in a separate table and a flag the flag is tripped when the users finishes a video spends x amount of time viewing a blog post or image specifically thus allowing the view to get incremented once again

now you can define div s width height and vertical-align

11587100
dictionary	map
the idea of the json object is the same as a dictionary map where you have keys and values assigned to those keys so what you want to construct would be something like this

11587167
flac	ogg
the flac-to-ogg mapping page has a fairly thorough explanation of why it s desirable to use ogg encapsulation in many cases instead of streaming native flac

11587167
flac	ogg
the alternative is to treat native flac frames as ogg packets and accept the transport redundancy

11587167
flac	ogg
see the complete page for more information but the upshot is that while usable for streaming native flac isn t well-suited to more complex setups and the cost of ogg encapsulation is quite low

11587167
flac	ogg
if native flac works fine for your specific needs you can go ahead and use it but ogg will ultimately give you more flexibility

11587175
width	height
update in reply to comment in that case you can set other properties like the width and height to 0px and the over-flow to hidden so that the divs don t occupy any space on screen

11587217
post	put
however the record already exists on the server and since i fetched it and the model instance has an id property i thought that backbone should do a put instead of a post

11587231
getter	setter
ecmascript allows us to define getter or setter as following

11587232
hide	show
show or hide them by using

11587298
getter	setter
also note that the new ecma standards ecmascript5 mentions object.defineproperty as the way to define properties with getter setter

11587339
post	get
this works for both get and post

11587341
ssl	https
so network solutions redirects https queries behind a firewall or some such nonsense so there is no way to detect an ssl connection on the server side

11587371
post	get
the problem is in order to use post get request i ll need to send the data to another link

11587382
bash	zsh
the tilde is part of a shell expansion like in bash csh zsh etc

for example if you want a gap of 5 generate the first number between min and max add 5 to it and generate the next number between that and max

11587474
range	max
a little extra code to wrap around to the beginning of the range if you pass max and you re good to go

11587678
gson	jackson
there are lots of different libraries out there for doing this for instance jackson or gson

11587681
addclass	removeclass
use addclass removeclass and hasclass

11587687
int	boolean
the language itself is fairly simple as it only has int and boolean

11587687
int	boolean
the number of int or boolean pushed poped by a command never changes so the commands have fixed arity

11587687
int	boolean
however there s also commands like storeiftrue which will only store a value from the int stack to the flat int array at some index the index also from the int stack if the top value of the boolean stack is true

11587687
int	boolean
so i need access to the boolean stack and the int stack simultaneously for some of the commands

11587740
put	get
had to put loggingin interceptors in to get to that

11587764
int	boolean
so the ves cannot see the difference between a boolean and an int on the stack internally the ves treats boolean as 32-bit int so it is not possible to use the execution stack to simulate both your boolean and int stacks

11587764
int	boolean
you could do the same treat boolean as int and non-zero int as boolean true

11587786
getter	setter
i tried to set up getter and setter

11587832
post	put
check how the first instance of the model has an id and it tries to do the put but the other post

11587892
int	double
it is highly likely that the high-order word is between 0 and 0x4000000 0 and a billion - most int and memory addresses will be in this range which means you end up with a double between approximately 0 and 2

11587932
versioning	upgrade
save switching to pdo for after the launch and the next minor versioning upgrade so that you have more time for testing

11587985
width	height
i have the device in lanscape mode but the window frame returns a swapped value of width and height

11587999
oncreate	findviewbyid

11588026
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
however i think this only works in google-chrome maybe opera or safari not sure and also appears to be deprecated

11588078
udp	tcp
i was using udp to send receive data but i now want to switch to tcp to avoid packet loss

11588078

i did not export jar from the project as eclipse creates main.class and files inside the bin directory of the project folder which i think should be part of classpath

11588426
post	get
i sawe a link from laviak on a post from here ... but i can t get it to work

11588446
post	get
once i do get this thing up and running i ll do what i can to post the code and hopefully help others who are having similar issues

then i would like from here to use an ibaction outlet as so but xcode does not recognize my getter setter method in my custom class when using this code

11588468
post	get
-- i can just feel how many negative points i m going to get from this post xc--

11588513
fadein	hide
or if you don t want to hide it with css just call hide before calling fadein

11588551
mouseover	mouseout
the problem i am facing is that when they move the cursor from the image to the div which now covers the bottom portion of the image it triggers the mouseout as it is a separate element from the image and then a new mouseover event in quick succession because the div disappears when it detects that the cursor is no longer over the image meaning the div appears and disappears quickly over and over again

11588554
int	boolean
i admit this looks a bit complicated but all that s really doing is checking that the age is not at least 1 year and otherwise subtracting the years and then using a conditional test which that returns a boolean we interpret as an int 1 or 0 to adjust the difference back by 1 year when the current month and day are prior to the month and day of the birthday.

11588569
mouseover	mouseout
attach the mouseover mouseout events to the wrapper and they will trigger when you re expecting them to

11588580
folder	directory
you can do this by creating a src main webapp meta-inf context.xml i m assuming you re using the standard maven directory structure - if not then the meta-inf folder should be a sibling of your web-inf directory

content div size is width 1076px height 475px

11588641
sorting	filtering
i ended up removing as much as possible the sqlite cache loading up what i needed and sorting filtering it using my own routines

11588641
sorting	filtering
this makes my database small enough to use less as a database and more as an indexing service which works well for loading the info into memory and sorting filtering

11588641
sorting	filtering
instead it s better to do the sorting filtering yourself though i will admit that s a lot work

11588682
mp4	webm	vorbis	webm
the practical solution probably is to provide two versions h264 in a mp4 container and what is usually called webm vp8 video and vorbis audio in a specific matroska container

11588693
multiplying	division
but determining the digit and the carry by division is much more concise and for the larger factors also much more efficient when multiplying a digit by 100 the result is on average 450 requiring 45 subtractions but two divisions are sufficient for all factors

11588699

verilog	vhdl
in certain respects systemc deliberately mimics the hardware description languages vhdl and verilog but is more aptly described as a system-level modeling language

11588906
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
it only happens and only occasionally if i start the subprocess after some other things such as string manipulation opening communicating closing a socket with an objectinputstream objectoutputstream and reading from a small file

11588941

onclick	onchange
select boxes you can either use onclick or onchange preferrably onchange

11589080
hash	salt
salt could be false mcrypt_create_iv returns false on error unlikely because of the hash output differences you mentioned above but worth checking

11589080
hex	binary
you could try converting the database column types to varbinary and using a string to binary or hex decoder before adding to your prepare

11589080
hash	salt
a salt and a hash are generally considered to be fixed-with bit fields often expressed in hex format for convenience

11589111

qmenubar	qwidget
currently i have created a mywidget which derives from qwidget and contains a qtablewidget + a qmenubar

11589133
int	chars
the first two are int that i will declare to a variable and the next 2 are chars that i need to either assign to a string or a chars so i can print them out later

11589133
int	chars
i know how to get the int but my main problem with reading the chars is that i am not sure how to and there is a possibility that ones of the chars can be a or just a space

11589161
spaces	delimiter
it would make sense that attempting to use next to read a spaces character would not work as it is the default delimiter character

11589243
for-loop	loops
if you can find such an event you could loops through the items by an indexed for-loop and having all items there would know what the length would be meaning you don t have to hardcode that value

11589249
qmenubar	qwidget
since both qtablewidget and qmenubar inherit from qwidget i strongly recommend not using double inheritance

11589262
glfw	glew
everything else requiring glfw and glew in the program is working fine and when i replace gluint and glint with unsigned int and int then the program runs

11589273
folder	directory
for example i could create a directory with the time-stamp appended to the directory name tmp_123142345 and delete this folder after i m done writing the zip file to the stream

11589288
backgrounding	multitasking

11589546
entity-relationship	diagram
for me when building an application that uses a backend database an entity-relationship diagram is pretty crucial

11589546
entity-relationship	diagram
do some tutorials on how to examine a problem domain create an entity-relationship diagram and build a set of related tables based on the diagram

11589546
many-to-many	one-to-many
to begin with you might think members and family could be in one table but then you discover that creates a lot of duplication so you separate that out into family and member table with a one-to-many relationship but then you realise that through marriage for instance people can belong to more than one family and you need to create a many-to-many relationship

11589594

11589715
children	parent
if you set your #maincontainer div to position relative and your #leftcolumn div to position absolute you can then set both top and bottom on #leftcolumn so it always assumes the height of its parent #maincontainer even though #maincontiner s height is being set by its children #contentcolumn in this case

11589717
hide	show
i have also tried the mouseeneter and mouseleave function with show and hide and the toggle function

11589717
hide	show
i can get it to hide on mouse over and show on mouse exit although it does flicker while the mouse is inside the div

11589722
hide	show
the main difference between using opacity and between using hide show is that the element will still occupy space in your page when setting the opacity which is why it can still receive events but when you hide it it will no longer occupy any space in the page which is why it doesn t receive any mouse events

11589733
for-loop	while-loop
when i run the debugging one ellipse is drawn on the canvas and no more - i have already tried a for-loop and a while-loop to set an arbitrary amount of ellipses to be drawn on each timer tick but that didn t work

11589746
nsoperation	nsblockoperation
that s because nsblockoperation does not override the default behavior of nsoperation that specifies it is not a concurrent operation

11589770

11590034
cpu	processors
gpu code works best when all oarsmen processors cores threads are pulling in the same direction - uniform execution on separate data while database indexing might see some benefit by using a gpu approach it certainly won t be as big of a performance improvement over cpu baseline as something better suited to the gpu execution model constraints - like signal processing

11590045
stdout	stderr
and in the meantime there s a c source code library that will do all this for you redirecting stdout or stderr

11590045
stdout	stderr
on top of that it makes it trivial to create new streams that look and behave the same as stdout and stderr where you can redirect these new streams to multiple locations as well

11590536
versioning	upgrade
also unlike previous versioning of gcm and c2dm google itself does not refresh the registration itself now once you have the registration id from the initial registration you are good to go except for one case you do still need to re-register when the user upgrade to a new versioning this case is also handled in the example in the link above

advantage we can use the method geta in the abstract-class and implement methods with it in a without implementing them in each subclass

11592635
subclass	abstract-class
workaround 2 simulate the abstract field by forcing the subclass to give the abstract-class a value

11592635
subclass	abstract-class
advantage we can use the field a in the abstract-class and implement methods with it in a without implementing them in each subclass

11592686

a few getter and setter is not a big deal and i doubt that many use cases would have more than just a few abstract fields

11592890
getter	setter	defineproperty	getter	defineproperty	setter
i personally think that having getter setter literal syntax would be a nice opt-in feature for coffeescript now that defineproperty is part of the ecmascript standard

11592890

the need for getter setter in javascript can be questionable but you re not forced to use them just because they exist

11593455
implements	extends
it seems that there is little need for a distinct keyword interface when from my point of view as a developer the compiler spits out exactly the same thing which in human-speak is you cannot utilise this until you derive via implements or extends a new class which implements its methods

11593457
for-loop	loops
you have a for-loop inside your while reader loops

xfce	gnome
after having used the python solution above for over a year it was found to occasionally create zombie processes and or too many instances of xdg-screensaver so after digging around i found a simpler alternative which is gnome-specific but works for me even in a non-gnome de xfce since the core gnome libraries are required by many gtk-based apps even if you don t have a gnome desktop

postgresql	mysql
for a project where most queries on the database will include requirements like within an polygon i have come to think about choosing postgresql with postgis instead of mysql which i have previously mainly used

11593607
ada	pascal
one reason that the distinction between process and procedure may be confusing is that most implementations of common languages including ada pascal and c are designed in such a way that the interpretation of any recursive procedure consumes an amount of memory that grows with the number of procedure calls even when the process described is in principle iterative

11593614
backtracking	greedy
use a greedy quantifier until end of line and backtracking searching for an optional with

11593876
subtract	add
that immediately means that pointer conversion across the polymorphic non-polymorphic boundary is no longer conceptual the compiler has to add or subtract some offset

11593876
subtract	add
having to add or subtract some offset when converting pointer values along the hierarchy is not unusual the compiler has to do it all the time when dealing with multiple-inheritance hierarchies

11593876
subtraction	addition
the addition subtraction effect will also be revealed in a pointer conversion

interbase	firebird
apart from rdb database which is simply a table that is guaraneed to only contain one record in firebird and interbase and possibly current_date obvious meaning this should be quite standard sql although far from all databases support with recursive required for the myresultset tmp_payment is not recursive and some may have different ways to subtract one date from another

int	chars
you re trying to pass a list of int s to a function that takes a list of chars s

11595164
instances	transient
but then i have an issue because when requesting two of the same entity from active record at the same time both instances refer to the same object they can t have different transient data

11595204
width	height
the second line sets the frame of the button which is where it should be located on the screen and the button s height and width

11595236
put	get
if it is because you need to load alot of images you could get all the images on your site and put it in a single file and always get that file but with different background positions

11595246

11595380
keydown	keyup
for example in windows if you hold down a key you ll see a keydown and or keypressed repeatedly as the key repeats and a single keyup once the key is released

11595380
keydown	keyup
also as mentioned in the comments if the focus switches while a key is down you might only see a keyup or keydown

11595380
keydown	keyup
the key state was already that way before the focus switch and windows probably won t tell you about it. and dead keys ones that don t generate a character on their own won t trigger a keypressed at all though they do typically trigger keyup and keydown

11595380
keydown	keyup
so don t assume that every keyup will match a keydown or vice versa or that keypressed appears before keyup

goto	break
goto is required to break out of the 2nd loop once the next area is found

11595638
hide	show
in extjs 4.1.x you can use the toggleall function of the line series to show hide all of the series elements markers lines etc.

11595638
hide	show
it is pretty easy if you have the series field name that you want to show hide

11595638
hide	show
you can simply iterate through the series of the chart and check if the series field is the one you want then call toggleall on it with a boolean parameter to either show or hide it

11595638
hide	show
for example if myfield is the series field name that you want to show hide and mychart is a reference to your chart

11595643
typedef	struct
the name cell is simply the name of a typedef that refers to this unnamed struct

11595647
typedef	struct
you need to provide the tag for your struct not only a typedef

11595647
typedef	struct
without the tag you are typedef -ing a tagless struct

11595674
dictionary	map
it is an object in javascript no real arrays it s just the indices are a numeric names for the properties of the object dictionary hash map

11595681

bitwise-and	modulo
bitwise-and in place of modulo

11595914
bitwise-and	modulo
i have replaced two of the modulo operations in the wikipedia algorithm with bitwise-and operations

11595914
division	modulo
performing a modulo calculation requires division

11595914
subtract	add	division	subtract
on such cpus division is an arduous process involving repetitive looping bit shifting and add subtract operations that is very slow

11595914
bitwise-and	modulo
it turns out that the modulo of powers of two can be alternately achieved using a bitwise-and operation see wikipedia modulo - performance issues

11595914
bitwise-and	modulo
many optimizing compilers will convert such modulo operations to bitwise-and for you but less advanced compilers for smaller and less popular cpus may not

11595914
bitwise-and	modulo	addition	modulo
in addition to using bitwise-and to replace modulo operations you may note two additional disputes between the wikipedia algorithm and the optimized expression

11595914
division	modulo
this speeds up program execution greatly especially since it avoids the division necessary for the 100th year test the modulo 25 operation

11595922
post	get
i ve tried both post and get and have monitored the requests with firebug

if you have remove the codebehind ... declaration from global.asax and change the inherited ... declaration to reference the correct namespace and classname as it is defined in global.asax.cs file

11596430
many-to-many	one-to-many
the error could occur for the one-to-many relationship between person and location you apparently have in your model in addition to the many-to-many relationship

11596430
many-to-many	one-to-many
since every many-to-many relationship is an independent association no foreign key property in the model my guess is that the error is not related to your many-to-many relationship but to the one-to-many

11596441
client-side	server-side
while in python it is mostly a matter of style whether to catch the exception or to validate the input in other languages it might not be the case as sometimes exceptions are much slower to process than checking for a condition in web development is customary to also additionally to check the input server-side which you should always do validate the input client-side with javascript as this saves time to the user and cpu to the provider eliminating a request response cycle

width	height
the outer div has a set height and width as well as relative position

11596450
width	height
the inner div also has a set height and width

11596450
width	height
from what i understand padding will be derived based on the parent s height and width

11596450
width	height
my question is why has this been implemented in such a way and whether there is a way for me to reference parent s height instead of parent s width for top and bottom padding

11596461
width	height
this defines how margins and borders are treated in terms of the box width and height

11596461
width	margin
in quirks mode the margin and borders are inside the box so the width is the entire space the box takes up whereas in standards mode the margins and borders are added outside the box so the space the box takes up in total is the width plus the margin and border on either side

11596461
box-sizing	border-box
this is actually the perfect solution for you all you need to do is simply put box-sizing border-box

11596786
passenger	thin
i followed this tutorial but changed it to use passenger and thin with nginx

11596796
accessor	properties
one important factor to note is i removed the mustinherit attribute accessor on the race.base class and no runtime exception was thrown when the get statement of the properties type was retrieving racetype.notset

11596796
inherited	properties
another note overloading the properties type in the inherited classes while still adding new instances of the inherited objects to the custombindingsource will not throw a runtime exception but instead returns racetypes.notset

11596898
std	ostream
changing all uses of stream in the signature back to std ostream will not make it any better so i assume that the new function declaration syntax is playing a major role here â â even though gcc claims to support it since 4.4

11596898
std	ostream
a way to make this work would be great too although using std ostream only works well enough for my current application

11596905
onresume	onpause
i know this has something to do with life cycles of the activity but i m not sure what to do with the onpause and onresume functions

11596915

11597184
hide	show
show hide is functional in ie9 though transitions are missing gradient fade is emulated using an additional element

11597193
mouse	keyboard
i understand this is to help protect against keyboard loggers the password memorable data provides traditional password security but the drop-down numeric lists provides keylogger protection because the digits is randomised and selected with the mouse keyloggers generally don t log mouse movements

11597193
hash	salt
however one would assume that the website in question merely concatenates the two passwords together before going through the password match implementation hopefully using salt hash but even if they weren t concatenated it s obvious that the number of combinations assuming alphabetical passwords only of 16 char passwords 26 16 is identical to two 8-char passwords 26 8 26 8 26 8+8

11597198
inherited	subclassing
the difference is that it won t be inherited by subclassing of myclass

use vao or even better vbo to draw the object

11597241
onresume	onpause
i would highly recommend you to refer the link below to understand android activity lifecycle.also note general pattern of game is to save the state of game in the onpause method and then retrieve the the saved state of your game in your onresume method

11597271
coffeescript	livescript
i have this valid coffeescript and wish to convert it to livescript

11597274

ironruby	ironpython
i ve been playing with a c# app that hosts ironpython ironruby and hopefully powershell

11597333
ironruby	ironpython
since ironpython and ironruby were completely built on the dlr the api for using them is pretty much identical

11597376
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade to the latest versioning and now everything works fine

11597441
google-chrome	firefox
and i experience the same problem in both firefox and google-chrome

11597460
super	self
since this example only has single inheritance super example self .__init__ parent is exactly the same as qtgui.qdialog.__init__ self parent

11597460
super	self
the former uses super to get a version of self that calles qtgui.qdialog s methods instead of example s so that self is automatically included while the latter directly calls the function qtgui.qdialog.__init__ and explicitly passes the self and parent arguments

11597460
qdialog	qwidget
the third example actually uses qwidget instead of qdialog which is a little weird

11597460
qdialog	qwidget
presumably that works because qdialog is a subclass of qwidget and doesn t do anything meaningful in its __init__ but i don t know for sure

11597471

11597757
viewdidload	viewdidappear
edit well moving the setcontentinset out of viewdidload into viewdidappear makes it work correctly except as the view is shown the content inset is wrong and then it snaps into place once the view appears

11597757
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
guess something weird is happening between viewwillappear and viewdidappear that i m not aware of.

11597778
pop-up	dialog
after the user press the button a dialog will pop-up so i want to add the spin.js into the dialog

11597785
width	margin
width and margin are now linked so if i try

11597785
width	margin
i think that since the user has to compute specific low-level layout quantities like margin and width we are still basically writing a plotting library

11597798
post	get
this is the correct way to redirect the client to a resource using the get method after the server has correctly handled a post request

11597801
post	get
it allows you to scrape site quite easily but problem is when i try to post to login i get nothing back

11597843

slightly off-topic illustrative history couple months ago i made an userscript in vanilla js which runs perfectly fine in firefox and google-chrome and just now i had a report that it wasn t working in opera

11597866
octal	decimal
only decimal octal and hexadecimal are supported

11597897
getter	setter
but it s a bit unidiomatic in clojure where the use of data encapsulated behind side-effectful setter and getter functions is discouraged

11597900
elf	dwarf
basically i want to be able to change the path to the source file in debug dwarf section in a elf binary

11597905
post	get
i understand that javascript is the client side while php is the server side and the available options are to use the post get and cookie method

11597908
post	get
i want to get a first post content from url to my site

11597908

why hex and not just binary code or something else

11597914
octal	hex	octal	decimal
decimal base-10 octal base-8 hex base-16 are the most common ones but base-20 is not unheard of

11597921

it is possible to update wsgiserver from the cherrypy repository and make some changes to web.py to get it to run in python 3 but at present web.py is not p3-ready

11598053
sorting	grouping
i think all the chartcontrols sorting and grouping formulas work only for point datas not the datasource

11598114
serializable	deserialization
you do not need any custom serializable deserialization

11598139

11598313
qpushbutton	qwidget
i would like to create a qwidget with a large number of square qpushbutton

11598342
ubuntu	debian
you could debug it with gdb and a debugging variant of your gtk and glib libraries - libgtk-3-0-dbg and libglib2.0-0-dbg packages on ubuntu or debian by running with the environment variable

11598345
versioning	upgrade
even if it does keep your versioning list for further reference as well with a short description of the problem because in case the problem is not fully solved with the upgrade this information can be very useful at a later time to do a useful bug-report

11598368
folder	directory
change the files that are being processed to the static folder of where you flask app is running from and make the html src value relative to that directory

11598418
int	chars
change to a scanner it reads text and have convinance methods to transform the chars to for example an int your example using a scanner

11598419
int	chars
that means it will include the newline chars you enter when you press the enter key whose unicode encoded value will be interpreted as an int

11598429
rss	feed
in the rss feed for the post the title started with comments on

11598429

inherited	subclassing
when you inherited from an abstract-class and fail to implement all of its required abstract method s then you can only get it to compile by marking the subclassing as abstract too

11598519
dictionary	map
since you will only need to map keys to single values a dictionary is the right choice

11598532
int	chars
the atoi function converts chars into int

11598546
folder	directory
then move that into the folder that you want to become your working directory

11598561
folder	directory
it copies the tests and referenced assemblies to a test deployment folder typically under testresults in the solution directory

11598566
portrait	landscape
however i suppose you still want the user to look at your app in landscape mode after the portrait mode event

11598566
portrait	landscape	width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
when you received the portrait mode event you assign page actualwidth to user control height page actualheight to user control width the give user control a render transform of 90 degrees and render transform center x height 0.707 width y 0.5 then user control should just align to the landscape mode position

11598583

however if say two are on a page the animation would show and then hide

11603022
hide	show

my belief is that the only way i m going to add buttons like this and show hide them at will is to create a custom layout for them and make use of .setcustomview to place them into the action bar

11603243

to create an accessor for one of these classes i would just use in the subclass definition

11603520
imagemagick	magick++
i tried imagemagick and its api magick++ but that requires building it from scratch which is undesireable

11603583

hide	fadeout	hide	show	fadein	fadeout	fadein	hide
though note i m using fadein and fadeout rather than the more-sudden show and hide

11603660
hide	show
which lends itself to the following jquery which stores the nodes to hide show as they are and then restores them as required

11603662
extendscript	jsx
i have searched high and low but can t figure out how to use extendscript jsx to flip a single selected object horizontally

11603664

tablet	galaxy
i need to test with galaxy tablet emulator

11603898
inherited	properties
...you can t achieve that as long as your abstractclass is an entity in your model with its own table because you must map between navigation properties of the types they are declared in and impl1.independentclass and impl2.independentclass are inherited properties but they are not declared in impl1 and impl2

11603898
inherited	properties
for ef your model does not have any inherited instead it considers impl1 and impl2 as an entity that just contains its own properties plus the properties of the base class as if it were one class without base

hide	show
i m trying to do a simple hover over div and show hide image

11604064
mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseleave	mouseenter
use mouseenter and mouseleave instead of mouseover and mouseout

11604064
mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseleave	mouseenter
the difference between these events is that mouseenter and mouseleave only count when you fully leave an element while mouseover and mouseout count when you leave the element regardless if you are still inside the element

11604064
mouseout	mouseleave
for example when you leave an outer element for an inner element that s a mouseout but not a mouseleave because you are still inside the outer element

11604091

2 should we use one-time generated pojos or should we write add a maven plugin or ant that auto generates the pojos before each time compile task is invoked

11604338
getter	setter
application_model_user and application_model_message have only variables and their setter and getter methods

11604351

11604377
qscrollarea	qgridlayout
use a qgridlayout in a qscrollarea

11604516
width	margin
if you have an element whose width may change - you ll probably have to calculate it dynamically by jquery for instance and then set the negative margin

11604534
ienumerable	ienumerator
i m not gonna give you a complete solution but you should check out the ienumerable and ienumerator interfaces

11604539
width	height
i have not been able to find any d3 api documentation that would allow you to easily determine the needed width and height for a given d3.layout.tree or any other layout to ensure that no nodes overlap with one another

on the mac you can do with width and height in inches

11604648
post	get
is there any way to get it working i would be happy to post more information but i do not know where i should get that

11604661
width	height
you are not updating your width height or size when the window changes

11604667
strstr	substr
go with strstr - using regex to count a number of occurrences is not a good idea as you would need to use loop anyway so i would suggest you to do a simple loop with searching for poistion of substr and increase counter and starting search position after each match

11604676
versioning	upgrade
you ll need to upgrade your mysql versioning to one which supports innodb

11604692
strstr	strtok	strstr	strcmp	strtok	strcmp
as for performance i expect string functions strtok strstr strchr strpos strcmp ... to run all more or less at the same speed really really fast and regex to run appreciably slower albeit still quite fast

11604702
switching	screens
the problem is that after a few moments the iphone goes in sleep mode screens switching off and then the process is no longer active

11604754
post	get
a contextmanager has the advantage of not requiring two next calls to get to the stop iteration and cleaner syntax but if you wanted to return multiple values or something you could also do it this way but you can see that the post yield statement doesn t actually get called until the generator raises stopiteration on the next call the for-loop ends when it gets stopiteration

11604784
int	chars
the main burden of the project is the database which will hold 20 million rows of data with 5 columns per row 10 letter code 10 letter code 10 letter code 10 digit int url say 20 chars long on average

for-loop	arrays
as you can see from my for-loop i actually don t need all the files in the arrays after it gets separated by the t

11604820
express	node.js
i am tying to mock url s of the following form using the express module of node.js

11604837
post	get
the only problem with this is that get and possibly post request methods are already taken on your resources and mapped to your normal views which return html or consume http form post

11604847
getter	setter
you d just have to be sure to treat it as read-only unless either you use the function use a setcookie method attached to the function or you re targeting only browsers which support native getter and setter

11605110
ferret	sphinx
i ve was looking briefly at sphinx and ferret both of which seem to create an api for this but it was unclear whether they provided a clear text based option or if i would need to parse the search strings myself

11605143
post	get
i ve looked at other similar questions on stacked and even used an example which i will post below that says it should return an integer but i still get an array.

11605173
put	get
i am trying to get a scanner to read the input of a text file have that input put into a string have a stringtokenizer of that string and then have a string with each element of that array being a token of that stringtokenizer

put	get
get see --- you should be able to download the jar in project lib or put org.springframework.aws spring-aws-ivy 1.0 in project build.sbt

11605248
implements	extends
again i haven t tried this but since publishto is a and rawrepository extends resolver and takes an org.apache.ivy.plugins.resolver.dependencyresolver and s3resolver implements dependencyresolver i m guessing that it would work

11605278
mouse	keyboard
the simplest way to do this would be to use the java.awt.robot class which allows you to directly control the mouse and keyboard

11605303
folder	directory
the .git folder will contain all of the bits that are in your working directory so you can expect it to increase the size

11605313
free	malloc
now it might be in practise the number of threads doing is this is so low it s okay - in which case you may have a number of threads performing the malloc with the winner atomically activating the new memory and the losers seeing this and then free ing their memory

11605377
width	height
as far as i understand it asking uiscreen for its height and width

11605377
width	height
the only other way i am aware of that is pretty straightforward would be to ask a uiview covering the screen for its width and height most simply you could make your viewcontroller s view cover the whole screen

11605377
width	height
these should adjust for orientation by themselves from my experience it should definitely work if you get the height and width in viewdidappear animated or anything after

11605377
uiview	subviews
also the uiview needs to either be the uiviewcontroller s view property or a subviews of this view

11605377
width	height
once we have the width and height of the screen we can convert from your int s to screen position

11605389
implements	extends
extends listeditor and implements iswidget instead of extends composite

11605396
subtract	add
so let s change this to add six months got to the end of the month and subtract one day

11605443
macports	homebrew
edit#2 if you are running into errors installing it it is likely because you are missing libxml and other libraries which you will need to install through homebrew or macports

11605734
google-chrome	firefox
our plugin is a windowless one developed using gecko plugin api and is targeted for firefox and google-chrome

11605734
width	height
there is a window size issue problem when chrome from verion 18 onwards calls npp_setwindow npp instance npwindow pnpwindow for our plugin to respond and the html script uses the relative table cell size width 100 and height 100 to define the client area

11605734
google-chrome	firefox
the actual window position and size contained in npwindow is actually incorrect compared with what is in google-chrome 17 and firefox 14.0.1 currently the latest

11605738
width	height
suppose i have a div with 500 width and 700 height

11605765
width	height
you could consider dynamically setting the width or height as appropriate by using a basewidth variable and multiplying that by the number of final nodes being displayed

11605838
post	get
the crux of the issue here is encoding page a s post parameters into the get request for page b

google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome the button should be a tad smaller than in firefox

11605930
getter	setter
but why do we define private and then we use getter and setter

11605930
getter	setter
i know that we can have restrictions inside getter and setter but those if clauses are mostly for preventing the mistakes not the privacy restrictions

11605958
getter	setter
we use private fields and have getter and setter so those private fields can be accessed by other classes

11605958
getter	setter	public	protected
you can avoid using getter and setter by making your fields public or protected where appropriate instead of private

11605962
getter	setter
but as good as getter and setter are if you use them too much then its a sign you aren t getting a object to do the work you need it to

11605975
pull	push
i can now successfully push and pull from server a to from my github repository

11605975
pull	push
now i want to also setup another server server b so that i can push and pull from that one as well

11606074
getter	setter
there are one more benefit if you use the getter and setter it allows a subclass to override how to access the information with a method and more flexibility

11606087
super	extends	super	implements	implements	extends
i would probably create a new table and textarea class extends their respective super class and implements an editor interface like so

11606096
submit	submission
this will help prevent people from automating the process of submission the form as they will need to re-load the form and submit the token each time which most script-kiddies would not bother with.

11606131
put	get
the rub is lets say we have something like a jax-rs web service which can get put over that user

11606189
getter	setter
spring will automatically find the command object to bind the request parameters based on the getter and setter defined in the command object

11606201

11606344
noexcept	throw
the rules for destructors have changed in c++11 which means that a destructor without exception specification has an implicit noexcept specification which in turn means that if it throw an exception the runtime will call terminate but you can change the exception specification to noexcept false and then the destructor can also throw

11606400
post	put
which is also nice when creating updating and deleting comments using post put

11606400
post	get
method 3 is interesting from a get and post create perspective but gets kinda hairy with update and delete

11606401
width	height
every time i try to create a collision rectangle and pass in the planet.position values as well as the image width and height it throws back an error and wont let me

11606411
multiplying	subtraction
another way to do this is to multiplying the numbers you get by subtraction by 10 then convert to an integer then divide that integer by by 10.0

11606415
sorting	filtering
the requirement was that a user needed to be able save the existing gridpanel s visible columns applied filtering and applied sorting into a database with a name and then at later date be able to re-apply these three things to a grid panel to get the same filtering visible columns and sort state by selecting their saved format

11606416

11606417
pop-up	dialog
each item includes a button where the user can pop-up a dialog to enter or read their previously entered feedback on said line item

11606441
width	height
another complication i believe is that the final output and whether or not the widths match will also depend on the width and height of where i m outputting the final grob to whether its in a r rstudio environment or to a png file

11606442
pop-up	dialog
from that dialog i try to open another pop-up using this

google-chrome	firefox
i could browse to the css manually just fine but both firefox and google-chrome weren t applying them

11606475

so even though i specified type in the link tag both firefox and google-chrome were seeing the wrong content-type from the server and refusing to apply the stylesheets

we use ibm websphere app server

onresume	onpause
you have to handle the pause resume states of the activity cycle by implementing the onpause and onresume methods

11606599
onresume	onpause
of course you stop the video in the onpause method and maybe save the video tracking information and you restart it in the onresume method making the video continue from where it was stopped using the stored tracking information

nearly three children are there for parent node like

11621845
hide	show
if so that s the ui thread so you ve sent the ui thread 2 messages - one to show and one to hide before it could even handle them and when it finally reaches the point it can handle them it handles both of them so for a very short time probably un-noticed the progressdialog will be show

perhaps add a linearlayout as a parent with orientation vertical add some width or height properties and then add 2 textview s so as to be a title and a subtitle with some additional properties

one of them is for setting up the attributes for setter and getter and the other file is my main one where i am doing all of the comparisons

11641501

to test it out i put in a bogus domain name for the request but instead of httparty responseerror exception i expected i instead get got a socketerror exception

11641601
width	height
pretty sure your problem is you are not accounting for the width and height of the button and so if it randoms to 480 800 it will be off the screen

11641658
width	height
you can do that by finding the offset of the elements then finding the width height of each

11641710

11642016
int	chars
you can use int chars - 0 to convert chars to corresponding decimal int

11642017

11651258

i ve been experimenting with the decorator pattern to extends functionality of code you do not want to touch for example and i see how to implements it however i am now unsure why you don t just inherit from the original class and extends that way

11668158
short	base	char-pointer	pointers
in c or c++ there is no common base class for all types like java s object the best you can use is void stands for untyped pointers so it can hold anything or explicitely cast to the desired type but then it s undefined to access a short via a char-pointer

this would be a good starting point i haven t tested this in ie9 but i know it works ok in google-chrome firefox

11668234
accessor	properties
is there merely a possibility for other accessor or does a cli language exists that actually has more than the simple set get duo for a properties

11668326
accessor	properties
edit ok they have little to do with properties but they fall under the category of other accessor

11668333
getter	setter
in real terms there is just a getter and setter

11668333
getter	setter
this is shown in table ii.17 and uses the .other caption in il note it is .get for the getter .set for the setter and .custom for attributes

11668368
inherited	properties
if you want all instances of the control to inherited the default background color then don t set the backcolor properties for individual instances of it

11668724
dreamweaver	aptana
i m just started using aptana coming from dreamweaver

11668732

as you noticed your implementation of the cron daemon does not allow to be the files owned by non-root-users and you will not be allowed to make the file world-writable for the same reason of security

11668737
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
i could have used a separate sortedlist instead of the sorteddictionary for keeping the key and timestamp sorted on the timestamp but then i ll have to do a linear lookup for finding the key from the list when i have to update the timestamp when the same key is accessed again - i am looking for a better than linear way if possible

11668762
post	get
so this is a mega-simple post redirect get - submit data from somewhere get it in the post-friendly action do stuff with it poke it into temp data redirect to get-friendly pick it up again stick the user on a new view with the object in the model

11668984
nsstring	nsdata
the docs states that the classes in the dictionary must be of nsdata nsdate nsnumber nsstring nsarray or nsdictionary

11668987
backslash	double-quotes
aside my suggestion would be to use double-quotes for the string as you have with o clock. since mixing backslash escapes with php strings and regex patterns can get confusing quickly

11668996
bash	subshell
a recent addition to bash is the lastpipe option which allows the last command in a pipeline to run in the current shell not a subshell when job control is deactivated

11669012
int	boolean
a workaround would probably be to use the wrapper types instead of the primitive ones boolean instead of boolean int instead of int

11669071
spaces	delimiter
pageâ caption is not a valid attribute identifier so the parser is probably interpreting page as the attribute identifier treating the spaces as a delimiter and wondering what to do with caption

11669092
datagridview	datarepeater
this datagridview is placed on a datarepeater control so it s usually displayed many times on the screen

11669138
google-chrome	firefox

11671107
fiddler	charles
if ga tracking calls doesn t use the ios proxy they obviously won t be sent to charles or fiddler or whatever and it can t track anything

11671107

ember.js is 42k minified+gzip while backbone.js is just 5.6kb

11671483
ember.js	backbone.js
ember.js packs a lot of power in it which the barebones backbone.js doesn t give you

11671483
ember.js	backbone.js
if your requirements are covered by just backbone.js imo you should give ember.js a pass

11671483
ember.js	backbone.js
imho i would use ember.js if the single page web app is super complex with lots of feature requirements else backbone.js should suffice

11671767
inherited	properties
this is so that classes that inherited from the base class can access the variables themselves but classes outside of the inherited chain have to access the values via properties

11671767
inherited	properties
i find this particularly useful in a case where the base class needs to set the value of a variable in an inherited class without providing a setter on the properties so that classes outside of the inherited chain cannot modify the value

11671767
inherited	properties
what i m finding by fixing sa1401 issues is that i m opening up properties values to be set because i need to set them in their inherited class that i really don t want to be settable

11671767
public	protected	inherited	properties
i suppose i could just create a protected properties on the base class that allows me to set the value and then create a new public properties that does not allow me to set the value but then i have to create that new public properties on every inherited class

public	protected
it is public and being called from a not static protected method

google-chrome works fine and the desktop version of safari but on my iphone it scrolls horizontally

11671870

11672030
integer	unsigned
so yes it is a 16-bit unsigned integer

11672030

int	double
int and double arguments are passed to printf using the same mechanism probably on the stack

11674058
int	double
so the call will plausibly push the int value 10 onto the stack as a 4-byte quantity and printf will grab 8 bytes of data off the stack and treat it as the representation of a double

11674058
int	double
rather than abusing printf it copies the representation of an int object into a double object using memcpy

int	double
here as your pointer to double pf points to an address hosting an int value i what you ll get is undefined and most probably garbage

11674595
int	double
if you really want to see what s possibly behind that garbage when debugging on some platforms try the following code where we will use an union to simulate a piece of memory where we will write either double or int data

11674595
int	double
your printf could well behave like that and thus try to interpret a raw piece of memory as a double when it was initially set as an int

11674595
int	double
p.s. note that as the int and the double have different size in bytes the garbage gets even more complicated but it is mostly what i described above

11674595
int	double
but i want to print an int as a double

11674595

the casts offers a different memory layout effectively changing the int 10 data into a double 10.0 data

see also the full list of jgit egit to git differences and the related bug-entry

11676634

the solution is to make the parent li as relative positioned so even when div.content is set to absolute while calculating height it takes the width of parent li and you get the correct height

11676651

11676806
width	height
but if the image is missing we will render the alternative text instead and this changes the img element from a replaced inline element to a text a non-replaced inline element and for it we wonâ t support height and width by the spec

11676806
width	height
this would explain why setting display to inline-block or block changes the behavior then width and height are applied

google-chrome	firefox
my issue is that the following code works fine in firefox and google-chrome but does not work in ie9

11681627
accessor	properties
this makes some logical sense if you have set get accessor on a properties that properties is never going to be written to and or read from because any attempts to read write it will be intercepted by the accessor functions

11681627
accessor	properties
if you define a properties as writable and give it accessor functions you are simultaneously saying

11681627
getter	setter
i assume from the fact that you wrote a getter and setter you don t really want the property to be writable

11681660
operands	decrement
so now no valid operands for -- decrement operator so lvalue required error

11681665
packets	pcap
if i were to stick with libpcap for speed issues i was thinking i could just make a currentoffset variable with an initial value of 24 the size of the pcap file global header push it to a vector every time i load a new packets and increment it every time i call pcap_next_ex by the size of the packets + 16 for the size of the pcap record header

11682074
accessor	properties
or an accessor properties which has these four attributes

11682099
hash	salt
to be able to answer this question you have to understand two things the role of hash and the role of salt

11682099
hash	salt
every time i hash a password i generate a completely random salt which need not be secret and prepend it to my password before hashing it

11682099
hash	salt
the reason that the random salt need not be secret and in fact must be stored in plaintext along with the hash password is because the same salt used to generate the original hash is required to verify for authentication purposes that a given password matches the hash

11682099
hash	salt
because a good salt is randomly generated every time a user wants to change a password even re-storing the same password will almost surely create a completely different hash as long as the application storing passwords makes proper use of salt

11682099
hash	salt
if the hash algorithm is well-constructed then the only attack possible against passwords stored with random salt is a brute-force search

11682099
hash	md5
some hash algorithms like md5 are considered broken in that it is possible to find so-called hash collisions in faster than brute-force time

portrait	landscape
i made my app detect the orientation on the ipad and readjust it s location position accordingly fine so it works good on portrait and landscape

11691193
portrait	landscape
my problem in the virtual keyboard method that i have it s not considering the orientation in portrait once user tap one of the text boxes the method would lift up the view to make room for the keyboard and have the text box visible not covered - however when user in landscape and tap a text box the animation would push the view sideways instead of up as if it s still in portrait

11691198

11691345
int	double
because of my c++ oci wrapper only supports to bind int double string clob type of data

11691347
put	get
i think the best doable approach would be instead of using a normal list to have a wrapper to the list that when the get pos method is executed to obtain the object to create the view you make something like this get pos numberofviews and when it ask for the size of the list you put that the list is integer.max_value and you start your list in the middle of it so you can say that is mostly impossible to have an error unless they actually swipe to the same side until the reach the end of the list

11691378
int	double
usually this refers to situations when it matters if you pick an int float double etc

11691383

here is what i am working with that is showing up with the error and of course only in ie it works fine in google-chrome and firefox

11692156

11692208
serializable	deserialization
so when you add later a new serializable field to the class then you d need to change the serialversionuid field usually just incrementing it by 1 is sufficient to prevent problems during deserialization of an instance of an older version of the class

11692208
instances	transient
if your serializable class contains in turn a field property referencing an instances of another class which can absolutely not be made serializable then you d need to mark it transient

11692208
serializable	deserialization
if you d like to have finer grained control over serializable and deserialization then override the readobject and writeobject methods

11692231
children	parent
i am basically wanting to copy the behavior of how buttonbase.click allows parent to subscribe to any button click methods for their children

11692431
multiplying	division
assuming case_qty is non-negative you can shield yourself from division by zero and use indexes on pal_qty if any by multiplying both sides by case_qty

11692445
min	max
table-cells dimensions are determined by their contents of course you can add your own or max min dimensions

11692445
width	text-align
the width of the table would be fluid because it would be based on the width of the widest cell thus the blocks will line up nicely and will look very neat and you could hard-code or script of course i suggest scripting a style method to check if the last row contains less blocks and if it does to set the text-align to left for that cell only

11692456
google-chrome	firefox
also this is working everywhere and resize is working in google-chrome and firefox with proportions 100 to 50

11692681
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
so with that its almost easy to say learning in this day you will likely easily support ie 8+ google-chrome 10+ firefox 4+ opera 8+

11692691
post	get
if you want to use ajax rather than the html helpers use a div instead of a form and you won t get a duplicate post

11692704
hide	show
i have a function that is used to hide show textbox right after the checkbox it works very well untill one day i changed the checkgroup to radiobutton group

post	get
it works using the post method but it doesn t update the querystring and i want users to be able to see what they have searched so i must use the get method

11692932
integer	unsigned
my understanding is that it provides types long long and unsigned long long as an extension but doesn t change the semantics of integer constants

11692938
subtract	add
you then can easily just add or subtract the # of hours 3600 seconds in an hour depending on the time zone

11692946
google-chrome	safari
i ve logged a bug with apple they ve marked it as a duplicate so hopefully they ve received enough requests to fix this until then i m continuing to use google-chrome as the webkit developer is the same as safari s old version

11693014
setinterval	settimeout
production different options different timings for setinterval settimeout

11693036
mouseleave	mouseenter
the way you re describing this you will actually want to pass two functions to .hover one for the action on mouseenter and one for the action on mouseleave

11693066
mouseleave	mouseenter
in this specific case you can use the shorthand .hover for mouseenter and mouseleave

11693067
width	height
one other possibility is an item like textview that does not specify height and width values

11693068
mouseleave	mouseenter
at first .hover includes mouseenter and mouseleave

11693068
mouseleave	mouseenter
alone or you use mouseenter and mouseleave

11693337
int	double
you re returning 1 or 0 which are implicity either int or double i forget which but it s unimportant in the context of your question.

11693346
inherited	properties
no .prototype or the value returned by object.getprototypeof is an object which you can extend with properties so that those properties are inherited by instances

11693395
ontouchevent	ondraw
it is getting stuck because ontouchevent operates in ui thread so as ondraw

11693409
nsstring	nsdata
the array representation in the file identified by apath must contain only property list objects nsstring nsdata nsarray or nsdictionary objects

11693537
squash	branch	squash	merge
and again when i squash merge the original branch into master

post	get
users will hate any app that automatically post on their behalf so i recommend you do not do that as either people will stop using your app or they ll report it and it ll get banned

11693548
int	chars
there is no chars type in php and the string type does not readily convert to int

11693580
google-chrome	safari
i am having trouble showing a linear gradient in safari and google-chrome

11693606
width	height
just be sure to call inherited first and then use the updated width height to create the new region

11693606
width	height
createwnd should still create the initial region using the current width height

11693644
portrait	landscape	width	height
my photo sizes vary they are either landscape portrait or square and i need to make a watermark the best fit for each photo - so i need to resize just the width of the watermark without imagick as it s a long rectangle shape so height doesn t matter

11693930
rss	feed
the first tab gets posts from an rss feed

11693959
post	get
in a traditional web application idempotent requests which don t change any state are made via http s get method and all non-idempotent requests are typically made via the post method

11693959
post	put
the form is received from the browser via post and then rails looks for this field and decides whether to route the request to the put or delete methods of the controller

11693978
filtering	grouping
i also followed the instructions here about putting in a before filtering and only turn on profiling if the user is in the appropriate admin grouping

11693980

i m constructing the same selector twice for the mouseover and mouseout

11693986
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to a newer versioning like 2.3.2 or even the latest 2.5.1 and the default will be 1.5 and it should work just fine

11693986
versioning	upgrade
and while you are at it also upgrade to the latest versioning of maven 3.0.4 so that these newer versioning of the maven compiler plugin are the default

the only problem is the browsers don t as they only support get and post

11694048
swt	swing
swt is one thing swing is another

11694048
swt	swing	awt	swing
if you already have something written in swt and want to add swing components then you have to use the swt awt bridge

11694071
hide	show
i m working on the ability to show hide div s when an image is clicked and to randomly show divs on page load

11694085
pop-up	dialog
what i did was add an itemlistener and based on a certain logic i pop-up this dialog box

11694085
pop-up	dialog
the 1st one is to close the combobox pop-up and the 2nd one is the actual one on the confirmation dialog

11694085
pop-up	dialog
i want the confirm dialog to pop-up once the user has done selecting his option and the combobox pop-up closes

11694100
google-chrome	safari
one interesting thing to note this is working as expected in safari but google-chrome and ie are producing the problem above

11694101

i am using the following recursive method to list all files and folder within a given directory however it seems to be listing some files that aren t visible in windows explorer - even when i display hidden and system protected files

11694232
hide	show
i usually put the html for lightboxes in my rails application layout file then i would simply use js to show hide these lightboxes when needed - this is very static

11694232
hide	show
sometimes i would use jquery to create the lightbox and the content within it on the fly and then show and hide that very messy

11694237
put	get	post	get	post	put
the get put post delete mapping you re quoting works fine for crud operations but isn t necessarily appropriate for everything and isn t necessarily supported by all browsers

11694237
post	put
it s an architectural style don t stress too much about what post put delete the javascript does underneath

11694237
post	put
it s good for the framework to be able to expose delete put as such directly but have a fallback solution via post for the clients that don t support it

11694237
post	put
emulating put through post is ok you re just not making the most of put emulating post through put would be problematic

11694239
folder	directory
spontaneously i d save the images in a temp folder and move them to the production directory upon submit

if you only need the children to exist when the parent exists i would consider changing the node to simply have a std vector of other nodes remove the pointer

11694267

if you have a use case where you do really want to have the children outlive the parent you ll have to deal with the parent pointer since it could be destroyed before the children

11695160
jlist	jlabel
the data is saved in a .txt file and when a name is selected from the jlist my program reads the appropriate lines of data converts them into an object i ve defined counterparty and displays the appropriate fields of the objects in jlabel s

11695160
jtextfield	jlabel
i want the jlabel s where the information is initially displayed to convert into jtextfield s populated with the data from the jlabel when the edit button is clicked

jtextfield	jlabel
you should place your jlabel in a dedicated jpanel so you remove the jlabel from it and replace it with the jtextfield then repaint revalidate

11695336
getter	setter
if i change to a different view and then change back to the original view instead of the getter being called the setter gets called and the value passed is the first option for my radio buttons

11695392

11695554
width	height
this approach is brilliant but even though the height responds to max-width the width does not respond to max-height

11695574
width	height
the elements i use vary in width and height but all fit in a grid 4 different sizes all multiple of smallest+margins

11695586

as the width and height of the screen changes u change the size of your draw

11699731
unsigned	short
foobar expects a pointer to an unsigned short

11702166
inherited	properties
it did not log the nonenumerable properties that were inherited from object.prototype like tostring or isprototypeof

11702166
inherited	properties
that is explained well in the answers the function only takes own properties into account not the ones inherited from the prototype

11702166
inherited	properties
this applies both on normal properties and those inherited from their prototypes

11702193

chown	sudo
sudo chown -r www-data www-data myrepo

11702791
chown	chmod
the first issue can be solved by running chown or chmod on new view file right after executing mkview command

11702807
mouseover	mousedown
3 events inside a view is something that listens to dom events click mouseover mousedown etc and of course you will know which dom element was triggered the .bind or let s say .on does something when an .trigger is called the entire backbone code is full of custom triggers so that you can if you wish to be notified of model.add model.remove collection.reset etc

11702811

in c++ int can basically be used for boolean checks right

11702837
portrait	landscape
sheet i tried horizontal i tried 2x3 in portrait and landscape i tried all possible arrangements for the images and what i found was that the order of the stars made absolutely no difference i didn t really expect it to given the image is indexed and so all that changed was the palette being rearranged but the vertical layout produced a smaller file than any other

11702847
width	height
when i initialize object a it creates a grid cell with a specified width and height

11702852

11702936
post	get
at the moment i can test if a key is correct by comparing the output but i cannot bruteforce 16 character keys for obvious reasons reading other post it was my understanding that having the data i have it might be possible to get the key

11702938
width	height
the image resource has a width number of pixel columns and a height number of pixel rows

11702938
width	height
the physical width and height of the image as it appears on the pdf page is determined by the value of the ctm current transformation matrix at the time of the do operator

11702938
width	height
if the ctm would equal the identity matrix the physical width and height would be 1 pt high and 1 pt wide

11702938
width	height
the image height would be 300 pts and the image width would be 400 pts

11702959
strdup	malloc	strcpy	strdup	strcpy	malloc
i ve also switched between using strdup and malloc strcpy for allocating the strings but that didn t seem to have any effect

11703001
post	get
although performance is one of the key elements this is not a feature in nosql it is more a consequence of design what i think is the feature is the flexibility of its data structure and the possibility to store information in a single row avoiding multiple round trips when you work with records that are close related take a look of this post to get a better understanding of what i m talking about

11703016
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
this will return something like firefox opera safari etc

11703018
google-chrome	firefox

here is a link to almost the same exact question except all i need is to figure out how to get formtastic to emit the html similar to the example here show hide div if other radio or checkbox is checked

11703233
folder	directory
from the error you could see the electromart folder is missing in the path and when you move to another machine the directory structure might change too depending on how the server is setup

11703238
listview	gridview
it s similar to a listview so if you ve worked with a listview then a gridview should be okay

11703263
integer	fractions
with integer division you get truncation which means the fractions part of the result is thrown away

11703265
java.util.calendar	simpledateformat
you cannot extract them from simpledateformat afaik but you could use java.util.calendar to extract the date components using its method

this statement is undefined behavior because the argument has to be of type double and 9 5 is of type int

11703277
gson	jackson
and then binding or using gson or other data-binding library like jackson

11703282

the idea is to show the popover when you click the button and to hide the popover when you click outside the button

11703314
writetofile	nsdata
i m not sure about the nsfilehandle result when writing data but i would suggest using nsdata s writetofile atomically method as the atomically flag achieves just what you re asking about - it guarantees that either all data is written or none is

11703334
mouseover	mouseout
while it represents an element which has a pointing device over it there is neither a mouseover pseudo-class for an element that has just been pointed to nor a mouseout pseudo-class for an element that has just been pointed away from

11703411
rss	feed
apple appstore provides you with an rss feed to get the latest apps submitted into the app store into your favorite feed reader

11703447
wadl	wsdl
you just have to look out for other places the service endpoint might show up such as in wsdl wadl xsd references etc.

11703465
rss	feed
edit some 3rd parties do seem to have a feed available though follow the android market with an rss reader for beginners

11703490
folder	directory
you don t have permissions to access the directory var lib mysql whatever.sock because mysql is the owner of the folder

tricks with or x | 0 don t work for multiplication they seem to work for addition subtraction and doubles lose precision during multiplication

11703619
children	parent
in the flex layout model the children of a flex container can be laid out in any direction in any order independent of source order and can flex their sizes either growing to fill unused space or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent

11703651
min	max
you could then store the max and min lat and long along with that point in the database

11703684
google-chrome	safari
for example you can use this google-chrome safari hack inside the css file as css code.

11703687

post with the same tag get displayed

11703735
implements	extends
if you are worrying about code duplication then you could implements a base activity for which you implements the callback to show fragment c and make your two activities extends from that base class

11703735
portrait	landscape
as you didn t post any real code on how you manage those fragments keep in mind that if you are in the portrait orientation in the b activity showing fragment b and by clicking or whatever you do you replace the fragment with c this will not be carried to activity a if you switch orientation to landscape

11703759
move	drag
so far i ve been working with mvc3 with linq to sql so that all models have been pre-generated and i would create database myself then move the tables onto the dbml editor and if i wanted to change the table i d remove the entity on the editor and drag it on again

11703813
config	ini
the other traditional mechanism config files--whether xml ini .properties or whatever--help store config data between runs but do nothing to organize config options for the program code or during its execution

11703813
instances	transient
â â transient config â â if you need configs options changeable on the fly --say for the scope of a given method invocation--the method can extend the instances option chained mapping

11703813
profiling	debugging
for example if there s some period during program run you d like to turn on debugging logging or profiling you can turn that on and off whenever you like--just for certain instances or for all of them at once

11703817
rss	feed
i m trying to configure the simplepie rss parser to cache feed into a mysql database but i keep getting this error messages when i try to load a simplepie page

11703827
for-loop	loops
the problem is that the variable i inside the for-loop seems to lose it s meaning when we break out of the recursion and loops is not continued

11703828
folder	directory
initially i was getting reference errors because d3.js was not in the right folder however once i put it in the war directory they went away so the problem can t be a reference error

11703925
profiling	instrumentation
i ve spend the past week till now firing up instrumentation using the time profiling allocations and core animation tool to optimize as much as i can

11703954
min	max
and if you have access to a numeric editing text box you could even set min and max values or you could implement this yourself

11703964
opera	firefox
it appears that this isn t occurring in firefox opera can t test ie and it may be limited to webkit-based browsers

11704020
clpfd	yap
here is another solution that works both ways using library clpfd of swi yap or sicstus

11704045
uidatepicker	uipickerview
i m animating the uitoolbar so it slides up from the bottom together with either a uipickerview or a uidatepicker

11704049
accessor	properties
now with arc and synthesized accessor properties you do not have to care about all this

11704049
accessor	properties
it is definitely recommended to use the accessor and to not set ivars directly if there is a setter method in other words if you have a properties use its setter by calling self.property newvalue

11704083
inherited	properties
prototype properties points to the object that you have inherited

11704114
rpm	yum
i m pretty sure amazon linux is rpm based you ll want to install svn via yum

i noticed that when i try to manually set the time from the keyboard the numbers are changed automatically then the mouse is out of the input field

11704137
ddms	adb
i have very little information about what i might have done wrong but my ddms and adb have suddenly stopped detecting any android device that i plug into my macbook air running mac os 10.7.4

11704161
sudo	passwd
sudo apt-get purge php5 which will then prompt you for a passwd then proceed with removing php assuming you have the php package standalone and not bundled in with some preconfigured lamp stack but then again it should still work generally speaking so long as the version is right

11704206
actionscript	mxml
i m building an actionscript 3 project and have found that writing some components in mxml would simplify things

11704209
width	height
if you keep a div element with height and width as 100 and bgcolor as black

11704224
macports	homebrew
homebrew is generally a bit nicer than macports as it doesn t require lots of sudo action

11704225
hide	show
so with you asked vim to hide concealed text in insert and visual modes but show it in normal mode

11704243
post	get
this isn t a place where someone is just going to give you an answer do some research into the area then post if you get stuck

11704255
getter	setter
let s say i have a java pojo class that looks like this assume getter and setter for me

11704258
implements	extends
generally speaking you would switch your addchild calls to addelement and you would have to change your other classes that currently extends sprite movieclip displayobject to extends something like group so that they implements the necessary interfaces for flex application to work with them generally it expects more things than lower level flash objects provide since it has the layoutmanager popupmanager component life cycle etc.

11704258
implements	extends
in some cases you may want to stick with your current lower level extension say extends sprite and just implements ivisualelement yourself

11704274
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
do some research on getelementbyid getelementsbytagname etc

11704286
int	chars
what i am trying to say that 0 s and 1 s are neither int nor chars nor decimal values

11704286
int	chars
if you decide to see them as int then the 01101010 will be seen as the number 106 6a in hexadecimal which is written 0x6a while if you decide to see these bits as chars then the bits will be seen as the letter j

11704286
int	chars
so when you are creating a pointer you are saying that you want to treat the bits as a memory address not an int not a chars not a decimal value etc.

11704286
int	chars
as i said before an int will take 4 bytes in the memory while a chars will only take 1 byte

11704288
serializable	deserialization
you can then write the serializable deserialization yourself

11704309
int	chars
i need to convert a 21 bit signed int provided in three 7-bit chars into a 32 bit signed int

11704332
width	height
in addition inline elements can t have width height attributes

11704403
children	parent
filtermany doesn t filter parent results by children s expressions both has separate ranges

11704419
google-chrome	firefox
reported in javascript in google-chrome and firefox the reason is because the script that threw the error is served from a different origin than my site

11704461
apache	nginx
make sure that folder .. uploads exists and has permissions to write for user under apache nginx work www_data or some like

11704478
folder	directory
android aapt problem invalid resource directory name and the problem is desktop.ini wich is placed in all of the res folder

11704506
google-chrome	firefox
also use firebug in case of firefox or google-chrome developer tools in case of google-chrome for debugging

11704605
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it works in every browser i ve tested google-chrome opera safari except firefox my best guess is that this would be some sort of cache issue so i did npm cache clean but still no luck

11704621
sorting	filtering
it s likely that mongo isn t using an index for both filtering and sorting

11704639
for-loop	loops
note that you could have used two for-loops ie replace the current while loops with a for-loop but that s more a matter of style and semantics it won t affect the functionality of the code

11704649
put	get
if i don t put characters before the word return i get the error messages

11704663
centos	linux
i have a prestashop based ecommerce website godaddy linux centos vps

what you might have to do is add an additional element containing the background image at a lower z-index from your current elements and fade that in with the normal fadein fadeout functions

11704695
spaces	delimiter
just split the value with spaces as delimiter and pick the first value

11704697
width	height
you can get around this by wrapping the entire page content inside an absolutely positioned wrapper div setting its top and left values to 0px and height and width to 100

11704699
mamp	wamp
the major difference between this question and other questions here is that this is not to connect to a wamp or mamp stack but a remote database

11704741
onresume	onpause
to set and reset variables i think you can use the onpause onresume oncreate activity overrides to decide when to update your variables

11704742
width	height
if you want the bar to be resizable set its height and width to percentage amounts of the container height and width

11704748
lxml	elementtree
if you are familiar with xpath use lxml with elementtree instead

11704760
bellman-ford	floyd-warshall
you are correct about the first two questions and about the goal of floyd-warshall finding the shortest paths between all pairs but not about the relationship between bellman-ford and floyd-warshall both algorithms use dynamic programming to find the shortest path but fw isn t the same as running bf from each starting node to every other node

11704765
button	checkbox
in my app i would like to have something quite similar to android s built in popup menu see link below but it also needs to include checkbox and images and i should be able to choose several checkbox before closing with the same button that opened it

11704767
visualvm	jhat
using visualvm or tools like jmap and jhat would be the best way to figure out what is actually still on the heap

11704775
mvp	presenter
you might also think about using model-view-presenter mvp presenter first

11704785
oncreate	setcontentview
i can make this happen with the minimal project where oncreate does nothing more than call super and setcontentview

11704807
google-chrome	firefox
i do not care about google-chrome and firefox since they have sufficient native svg support

11704809
pull	push
realistically i expect that i m looking for a plugin that will do a pull -u on any sub-repos then commit and push that change to the parent before starting the build

11704864
inherited	properties
it s intended for keeping some bit of information for the control without having to inherited it to add properties for the information

11704865
cos	sin	width	height
since you know the starting point the width height of the image and the angle or cos sin of those you will have the exact coordinate of the end point

11704865
cos	sin
be advised...the exactness here is not really what you might have understood because we may the thing is we will have calculation errors in cos sin values

11704904
subtraction	addition	division	subtraction	division	addition
a 32-bit unsigned int fits within javascript s 64-bit float -- there should be no loss of precision when performing addition subtraction or division

11704914

now on my client computer #1 it is impossible for me to push pull any refs from my git server

11704935
post	get
i can t get the following code to post to the wall of user with user id 514559322

11704940
children	parent	hide	show
i consider my code quite deficient see the jsfiddle as i am forced to declare two times the group parameter in order to show hide children from a group parent

11704948
children	parent
if your parent div has a fixed width you ll have to calculate the total of the children and set or animate that manually

rubygems	rvm
after a lot of reading and trial and error i started about 3 times from scratch trying ruby 1.9.2 and ree both from source and with rvm i tried another howto 1 which had one big difference to the first one it suggested downloading and installing rubygems 1.4.2 instead of the apt-version of rubygems

google-chrome	firefox
for example if you go to the site in google-chrome or firefox with firebug and put the following in the console it resizes perfectly as you want it to

11705421
scrypt	pbkdf2
in my opinion the best approach to take is to pick a password hashing algorithm bcrypt pbkdf2 scrypt and then tune the work factor to give you the best tradeoff between speed and security given the computing resources available to you and the characteristics of your system

11705441
for-loop	arrays
notice the for-loop in this function which is simply adding each of the permissionid values from the userpermissions arrays to the userpermissions observablearray of the useraccount

in the comparison the signed chars gets converted to an unsigned int and thus looks like a really big value

11709270
children	parent
not selector is not recommended but still if you want to go with not selector itself try approach with children alone rather than parent clubbing parent and child elements

11709302
zlib	libz
libz zlib compression headers

11709326
int	chars
in your case signed chars is converted to unsigned int thus we are getting a big positive int instead of -1

i get the post from db and test if the current tag is already in db if it is nothing happens if it s not there it should update count field

11709657
width	height
there are some problems if your page has not fixed width - you need to bind on window resize recalculations of offset and height of your parallax div

11709657
width	height
also you must set s width and height

11709661
onfocus	onblur
also you should assign the onfocus and onblur functions inside the loop otherwise only the last input will work

11709686
getter	setter
the fact that div.getattribute class is also exported as a convenience function as the classname property with an impilicit setter and getter doesn t mean that it is a consistent way to handle dom node property names

11709712
sorting	grouping
so it just selects the one user s 50k posts out of the million and then starts grouping by topic_id and sorting

11709725
min	max
the fact that your dates are stored in a format that is not usable by sqlite date and time functions is not relevant to how the min and max function will operate on them

11709743
alarmmanager	wakelock
you only need a wakelock to keep phone running after alarmmanager has woken it up to send an intent to your receiver and until service has finished its work

11709900
width	height
you can then reference those array elements and perform calculations in order to know the width and height that that particular string of text will take up

11709900
width	height
you can then use those values to create an image with a specific width and height that will allow for the text to be displayed in its entirety

11709923
google-chrome	safari
for google-chrome i guess the normal dev tool would do this is a safari actually but this should come with other webkit desktop browers as well

11710011
move	drag
what happens on the blackberry device with trackpad when you click the trackpad using jcrop it starts to draw the selection as you move the cursor you cannot click hold and drag on the trackpad its more of a click event

11710011
mouseup	mousedown
it seems to me that jcrop is using the mousedown to track the click and drag selection process and then mouseup to release the selection and keep the crop box

storing statically as string arrays then processing them in initialisation into objects using a class which mirrors the objective-c structure converting to int boolean double etc from the string data

11710433
hide	show
to show all three paragraphs you will need to wrap them in another element and show hide that element rather than the paragraph itself

lapack	gsl
you have plenty of options lapack blas gsl and other self-optimizing libraries vender libraries

11710741
min	max
generally you will use a max or min macro to get whichever is the higher lower of a pair of variables or of a variable and a constant or even a pair of macro constants or other non-literal constant expressions

11710772
width	height
you can use desplaymetrics to get the dimensions of the device at run time and use the width and height you get

11710774
min	max
the header limits.h defines many values like int_max that will tell you information about the min max values of variable types on your system

11710798
ienumerable	ilist
because it it implemented over ienumerable not ilist

11710810
octal	decimal
if you study the formula you ll see that it converts to a three-digit octal number the digits are and and then converts that to a decimal number with the same three digits

awt	swing
eclipse may have a plugin but i usually find netbeans very good in gui and it is also recommended by sun for making swing awt gui

11710868
swt	swing
eclipse uses the standard widget toolkit swt not included in jre by default netbeans uses swing included

11710868
swing	windowbuilder	swt	windowbuilder	swt	swing
since recent eclipse versions it includes windowbuilder to create swing or swt via drag n drop

11710874
uiview	subviews
i d make each widget a customized uiview subclass and just add them to the main view as subviews

11710879
width	height
occupying the rest of the space on the right i d like to have a container so on the right side of the screen taking up screen width - 200 pixels this container would not have a fixed height but i want its top to be aligned with the top of the navbar

11710898
uilabel	uibutton
you should use addsubview only to add a true subview a uilabel a uiimageview a uibutton etc. or the child view if doing proper view controller containment etc. to a view

11710943
ienumerable	ilist
the difference between ienumerable and ilist is the enumerable doesn t contain any data it contains an iterator that goes through the data as you request the new one for example with a foreach loop

11710952
awt	swing
the code generated by the swing design tool is strictly swing awt based

11710983
children	parent
i tried using this find parent next and children to no avail

11711007
min	max
the objects at the leaf level belong to all three heaps this is where elements transition from the min part to the max part of the heap

11711007
min	max
now one can compute the sizes of the min heap and max heap use a partial sorting such as quickselect to partition the data and bulk load the three parts individually

11711007
min	max
or we can look at heaps of size 7 3 levels and discern min and max types

11711007
min	max
ensuring that for min levels we have the first type and for max levels we have the second type

11711007
min	max
this also is essentially an interleaved min and max heap

11711012
hash	md5
nobody seems to have mentioned hashing yet - with a strong hash algorithm ie sha-2 and not md5 it should be much safer

11711054
width	height
you can set minimum width and height using the following css properties

11711071
mousemove	mouseup
the function repositions the element based on the change in location of the mouse which is queried by handlers added to the root document element for captured mousemove and mouseup events

11711071
mousemove	mouseup
it is important to note that the mousemove and mouseup handlers are registered as capturing event handlers because the user may move the mouse faster than the document element can follow it and some of these events occur outside the original target element

11711084
mouse	keyboard
wm_lbuttonup etc to manage your mouse and keyboard states - as many still detest dinput8

11711094
children	parent
so your code might look like this assuming children rely on existence of parent and not the other way around

11711095
google-chrome	safari
it works in safari on the mac but not in google-chrome or in ios

11711120
children	parent
you are breaking this by declaring that both the parent owns all children but also that each child own it s parent

11711120
children	parent
smart pointer can have their own meaning for swapping children between parent but for general usage you should accept raw pointers

11711137
filesystems	fat
there are also file sytem limitations and what not so check your filesystems type as mentioned by ajreal fat32 has a limit of 4gb 99 chance your not using fat but still it is an example

int	chars
chars are unsigned 16bit int in java

11711422
put	get
that way you should at least be able to get the editor to not put everything inside your anchors in one line

11711427
int	chars
ctype_digit will however return true for strings containing numeric chars but return false for int

11711430
minimum	max	min	max
this will be slightly biased away from the maximum id or minimum if you switch the min s and max s in the equation

i am looking for some open source .net libraryies which makes publishing and consuming rss feed easier

11711524
width	height
edit square s height cos lat width

11711526
int	chars
up to this point you are correct though short is not guaranteed to be 2 bytes long like int is not guaranteed to be 4 â the only guaranteed size by standard if i remember correctly is chars which should always be 1 byte wide

11711593
put	get
one issue is that you will need to put a lot of fingerprints and they will need to be subtle if a attacker can get two copies of the program and can compare the files between the two he will be able to tell what is the identifying information and just put whatever they want in so they can t tell who they got it from

11711637
width	height
the terminal size is determined by pandas.util.terminal.get_terminal_size this returns a tuple containing the width height of the display

i m going to go out on a limb and guess that you have 4 processors or 2 with hyperthreading

11712058
openfeint	scoreloop
the openfeint sdk is no longer supported so the best choice will be to use scoreloop or something else

11712067

maven	pom.xml	versioning	upgrade
to get rid of this nasty error you can upgrade maven versioning maven-compiler-plugin versioning or configure versioning in you pom.xml

11712162
width	height
this is the code which i have written in my button1clickevent initially when i click on the button i do get a width and height but when i change the size of my jframe and then again i click on button1 i get the same width and height as i got earlier.the values are not changing anytime

11712175
width	height
the reason imshow is not working is that the value returned by read ... is height x width x colors x numframes where height is the height of the video width is the width of the video colors is the number of colors usually 3 and numframes is the number of frames you read

11712222
fadein	fadeout
secondly when writing javascript case does matter and its fadein and fadeout notice capital letters

11712252
fixed-point	fractions
the most obvious solution is to use a small unsigned type since you don t need negative values using a fixed-point representation so that a value of 1 represents some fractions of a radian

11712252
unsigned	short
if you use a 16-bit unsigned type typically unsigned short that gives you 13 bits after the binary point so a value of 1 represents 2 -13 radian

11712252
floating-point	integer
integer values are easier to deal with than floating-point

11712256
clearance	devise
i ve modified my devise table user to have a clearance column

11712256
clearance	devise
unlike all the examples i m reading my clearance role in the examples is not a separate table with a relationship but is its own column in the devise table user

11712256
clearance	cancan
apperantly however cancan thinks that my user confirmed clearance level of 2 falls under the else provision and therefore i can only read posts

11712261
setw	ostringstream
you can use a temporary ostringstream object to hold the output and then use setw on the string provided variable names omitted

11712277
g++	gcc
linux simple way is to install gcc or g++

postgresql	mysql
support of database mysql postgresql migrations schema changes loading data etc.

11712413
quicksort	heapsort
heapsort although somewhat slower in practice on most machines than a well-implemented quicksort it has the advantage of a more favorable worst-case o n log n runtime

11712414
quicksort	heapsort
in their respective worst cases heapsort is faster than quicksort

11712414
quicksort	heapsort
that is actually the reason such hybrid algorithms as introsort exist introsort begins with quicksort and switches to heapsort if it sees that quicksort is struggling with this specific input

11712487
put	get
however when i put this in some method say showmypdffile and try to call that on commandlink pdf doesn t get open

google-chrome	firefox
everything works great with google-chrome but not with firefox

11712532
disk	ram
like they say above image file size on disk is only important for deploying your application on google play users will download less but on ram the image is completely raw which means every single pixel counts example a completely red 128x128 bitmap takes up the same space as a completely colorful one having both exact same color depth

11712546
move	drag
everything works ok that is the time counts down but the problem is that i have a uitableview in the application and if i touch the table and drag it to move along the cells the timer stops until i release my finger from the screen.

11712578
integer	unsigned
row is of type nsinteger so i m assuming that the problem is that the book wants me to send objectatindex a signed integer when it is expecting an unsigned integer

11712578
int	chars
member reference base type chars const chars int is not a structure or union

11712586
apache	nginx	gunicorn	uwsgi
a common setup would be to run nginx for static resources in front of apache mod_wsgi gunicorn or uwsgi as the wsgi server which for a small site could be done on a single server

11712639
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd
however if you mean to serve static content through the same web server lighttpd apache nginx that is serving the django application then you can do that easily by running python manage.py collectstatic in the project directory to copy all static files into one directory and configuring the web server to serve from that directory as you would any other static site

11712689
google-chrome	firefox
i tested this fix in ie9 standards mode firefox and google-chrome

11712689
google-chrome	firefox
in browsers that support document.addeventlistener such as ie9 standards mode firefox and google-chrome the sys.application constructor adds a domcontentloaded event listener that calls sys.application.initialize

11712690

11712812
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
all the salt does is make them throw out any precomputation and solve the whole problem which is time consuming but certainly possible especially for hash like md5 -- you should move to sha256

11714721
width	height
each inner div has different content different height and width

11714721
margin	height
i think of it as line spacing but another way to think of it is top and bottom margin on each line in the outer div rather than on the outer div as a whole and without overriding the top and bottom margins of all the inner divs which is what i have done for now or making all the lines the same height as line-height does

11714752

int	chars
in c i would like to convert a signed chars to an int without sign extension

11715179
int	chars
so if the signed chars is 0xff the int would also be 0xff

11715196
for-loop	loops
after the for-loop has performed its operations on the top side it would shift left again pushing the bit off of the number and making it equal to 0 which is less than kleft and loops would end

11715219
post	get
the closest i was able to get was this blog post

11715221
kerberos	ntlm
would you like the existing form-based logon but allow users to enter their ad credentials into the form a la outlook web access or have the application instead make use of iis windows ntlm or kerberos authentication done via http headers which is more secure as the user never needs to type in their username password

11715221
kerberos	ldap
if the application does use the stock membership or web.config-defined authentication and membership system then it s hypothetically possible for you to change the web.config file to use an activedirectory ldap kerberos provider instead of its own however in my experience very few asp.net applications outside trivial hello world-examples use the membership system by-the-book

11715228
udp	tcp
if you were using tcp rather than udp as part of the constructor of the tcpclient you can specify which endpoint you want the outgoing connection to use

11715251
put	get
of course i don t recommend that you ever assume a dll is in the root of the drive what i would do is put the dll you need in the same directory as the plugin dll and then you can get the path of the dll using getmodulefilename

11715251
firefox	safari
for installing rather than putting the plugin in the plugins directory in the firefox or safari directory you should install it through the windows registry

properly implemented ssl or spdy can be fast the server overhead is not high and is easily moved onto a separate reverse proxy machine

11715509
getter	setter
and having declared the properties you can now let the compiler synthesize the setter and getter

11715509
getter	setter
if you do that declare a property and then synthesize it the compiler will behind the scenes create the instance variable for you and then automatically generate a setter a method that is set followed by your variable name setforgotpassword and a getter method a method with the same name as your variable which will retrieve the variable contents for you for each of your properties

hide	show
you can use the jquery functions of show and hide to do the required

11716142
decoder	encoder
since the localstore is string based only i am presuming that you will be writing your own json encoder decoder

11716159
draggable	droppable
a workaround which i suggest is there is an option to call a function after each draggable or droppable event

11716182

11729796
xslt	xquery
regardless of where you re running it either xslt or xquery can select only the records which match the id the user has selected

11729796
xslt	xquery
but if the xslt xquery is running on the server in order for this to work you have to have either a page refresh or an ajax call after the user selects an id to let the program on the server know what the selected id is

11729796
xslt	xquery
xquery is not a querying language used within xslt - that s more like xpath

11729796
xslt	xquery
xquery is something you would use instead of xslt or beside it

11729813
strstr	memcmp
strchr memcmp is how most libc versions implemented strstr

11729816
post	get
whenever i apply pagination i get duplicate post shown because the habtm in rails doesn t keep the database unique it applies the uniqueness upon making the query

11729840
google-chrome	firefox
when i ask jplayer in google-chrome to do this it works fine but in firefox it pauses itself for about a 1 3 second before re-playing the loop

11729840
google-chrome	firefox
once again google-chrome did this well and while a bit better of a match firefox failed to render a perfect loop

11729855
disk	ram
if you truly need a memory table you can create a ram disk add a tablespace for it and create tables on it

11729866
pop-up	dialog
you can however look into modal pop-up like jquery ui dialog

11729891
implements	extends
since generic list of generics isn t valid i implements a non-generic interface iexceute and made the generic interface extends the non-generic one and was able to create a list

11729893
rsa	aes
the server is then supposed to decrypt the aes key using its private rsa key

11729902
min	max
according to the docs the expression expr between min and max is equivalent to only when all three arguments are the same type

11729930
versioning	upgrade
if no tables are listed you are using an older versioning of mysql jdbc driver with the following bug you should either upgrade or use database name as the first argument to gettables

11729946
portrait	landscape
the modal view controller should present itself modally when the device is on landscape mode and should dismiss itself when going back to portrait

11729961
int	boolean
though it doesn t really apply in c++ in old c that doesn t have an actual boolean type any int type can be used -- but in this case a comparison to true can give incorrect results

11730001
pop-up	dialog
i want the c++ side to be able to pop-up a dialog

11730008
xna	slimdx
considering the lack of windows 8 love that xna is getting support being dropped apps won t be sellable on the app store -- i d go with slimdx -- it s better than xna anyway -- the only down side is that you can t make xbox apps with it

11730017
put	get
the problem is that when i put the same for-loop within the for-loop with both the same objects i don t get the behavior i was expecting.

11730034
post	get
since you re doing a custom ajax post to get the data you must specify a function that calls the response callback with the desired autocomplete candidates

11730057
folder	directory
remove the jar files from the build path and drop them in the folder web-inf lib of your webcontent directory

11730112

11730199
post	get
whenever i run the program i get the following httpresponse from my post method

11730211
mongodb	bson
mongodb is bson not json as such i do not believe there is a direct conversion as you see in the console which is actually converting to json the same way you do in python

11730224
disk	ram
if you are saving to a database and if your working set is too large to fit in ram available to the database engine using the smaller size can have a huge difference on performance because more records fit onto fewer sectors of your disk reducing disk seek time assuming no ssd and increasing the amount of data points that can be transferred through the io channel per unit time

11730248
prng	random
also md5 s prng output isn t as random as it should be

11730259
post	get
that would explain post -based queries your first example not working while get based ones do

11730262
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
i m trying to get my head around the c# sorted collections such as sortedlist and sorteddictionary

11730326
portrait	landscape
so rotating the device to landscape while on a presents b modally and rotating back to portrait on b dismisses b and goes back to a

11730336
lisp	scheme
ideally for me it would be a code in python and or lisp scheme

11730353
put	get
so i ve been trying to put it on my website but whenever i run the game in browser i simply get a white screen though checking the java console shows no errors

11730371
post	get
i m starting to get into python lately and was wondering if you could post some code about how to to encode a json string send it as an http request to a url and parse the response

11730442
pull	push
but that ll only come up sometimes when adding and removing files -- when two or more people are modifying the same .m file all you have to do is git pull and then git push and it will calculate insertions and deletions for you

11730483
folder	directory
it seems to me that you want the webserver s folder to be conveniently accessible from your home directory

11730487
jobs	cron
i have set up a series of cron jobs on an internal company server to run various php scripts designed to check data integrity

11730487
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i would like to create a semi-cross-browser solution in which google-chrome firefox and safari create a uri to download the csv file after javascript dom traversal compiles the data

11730487
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
code works as described in modern versions of firefox safari google-chrome

11730494

i m relatively new to expressionengine and as i m learning it i am seeing some stuff missing that wordpress has had for a while

11730516
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
pretty good support in firefox safari opera and google-chrome

11730550
box-sizing	margin	width	margin
note i removed the margin since that was causing an overflow and set the box-sizing to determine the width of the element including the width of the borders and padding

11730562
google-chrome	firefox
as long as it works in both google-chrome and in firefox the same way as in accessing the elements works fine even if the output has the undefinedx1 i consider it some kind of bug in google-chrome not refreshing something internally

11730562
for-loop	arrays
then i did a for-loop on the arrays logging or using each element all showed up fine

11730597
strstr	atof
the standard string functions strstr atof etc are another

11730634
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
try making your uitextfield the first responder inside viewdidappear instead of viewwillappear

11730649
box-sizing	margin
using calc to compensate for the margin and box-sizing for the padding

11730663
spaces	delimiter
i have a text file with the following contents delimiter is a single spaces

11730665
uiview	subviews
in the first block of code you held the uiview around by adding it to a subviews but let the uiviewcontroller go away

11730675
width	height
i set both scroll panel and horizontal panel to 100 width and height

11730675
width	height
so i cannot center the formpanel inside of horizontalpanel since their height and width are the same

11730709
width	height
by resolution i mean the dimension in the form of width x height

11730729
squash	branch	squash	merge
finally we squash commits from our dev branch if necessary and merge them with our local master

11730757
dataoutputstream	bufferedinputstream
go immediately for datainputstream and dataoutputstream maybe also bufferedinputstream it s been a while for me so i m rusty

11730798
bufferedoutputstream	bufferedinputstream
he probably wants you to interpose a bufferedoutputstream between the objectoutputstream and the socket and similarly for bufferedinputstream

11730836
google-chrome	firefox
btw this is demo ware and only needs to work on firefox and if possible google-chrome

11730862
int	double
mid returns a string format the string to a int long double float ect..

11730885
width	height
i also find setting position absolute and all four directions to 0 is more reliable than 100 width and height

11730889
width	height
i m looking to take a folder worth of images and have php determine their size and then write their code depending on whether the width or height is higher

11730936
for-loop	loops
statements after each if unless you want it to exit the for-loop after only one time around loops which i don t think you do

11730950
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
the sorteddictionary is a balanced tree while sortedlist is just a continuous slab of memory that happens to contain ordered elements

11730987
google-chrome	firefox
this login form works brilliantly in google-chrome but in firefox it for some reason freezes the username input after i ve started writing the password and when you remove focus from the password box that s frozen too

11730995
subtract	add
however now the multiples of 400 that are leap years have been subtract too so add their count back + m_year - 1600 400 base year here is 1600 the largest multiple of 400 not after 1900

in your code addclass and removeclass are executed so fast it s like nothing ever happened

11731175
debian	linux
my code works just fine in linux debian squeeze but when i tried it on windows xp and 7 i got a constant stream of error messages

11731212
for-loop	loops
i would use a conditional statement and use a for each loops instead of a for-loop

11731231
put	get
the following is probably a better design move all your audio files to your assets directory and put the file name in the button s tag use the same click event handler to get the state of the one mediaplayer object stop it if its currently playing set the new file to play from the button s tag and play the file

11731270
mouseleave	mouseenter
i want to create a mouseenter mouseleave state for hovering over group headers

11731273
mouseleave	mouseenter
i couldn t figure out a solution to delegate to the mouseenter mouseleave events properly using extjs terrible event binding

11731273
mouseover	mouseout
however i did figure out how to add delegation listeners to the mouseover mouseout events

11731285

referring to this stackoverflow article css font-face not working with firefox but working with google-chrome and ie you my want to add the following mime types in your .htaccess file

11731427
width	height
i can get both of the images height and width but when i go to resize it it returns a null bitmap

11731428
for-loop	loops
i could exploit this with a for-loop and a starting index value for each row equal to the position of the first 1 from the previous row but am i correct in thinking that the numpy argmax function will still outperform a loops written in python

11731512
wildfly	glassfish
below is a servlet 3.1 compatible one which matches tomcat 8+ wildfly 8+ glassfish 4+ etc

11731540
opera	google-chrome
the getusermedia function that alex w mentions is only currently available in opera and google-chrome you can read some blog posts about it and see some demos here

11731580
maven	m2e
the m2e plugin has a project option â œresolve dependencies from workspace projectsâ that tells downstream maven projects to use the target classes directory of the upstream dependencies instead of using packaged jars

11731584
octal	hex
works for positive negative integers but not octal hex representations floats etc

11731659
redmine	gitolite
i am trying to setup redmine with gitolite and used this guide

11731659
redmine	gitolite
everything seems to be working fine the repository is created through redmine i see the repository under gitolite repositories

11731667
union	distinct
as omg ponies has already pointed out that there is no use of using distinct with union you can use union all in your case...

11731669
union	distinct
you should use union all if there are equals rows in both tables because union makes a distinct

11731696
django	web2py
for example i see backbone web2py django enyo kendo meteor node.js etc etc

11731701
nsis	uninstaller
i have an nsis installer that calls an uninstaller to automatically uninstaller the older version of the program

11731702
implements	modifiers
edit you also should switch from an auto-implemented property to a manually implements property with a backing variable declared with volatile modifiers

11731747
google-chrome	firefox
this only happens in google-chrome in ie 9 and firefox 14 it works aok - so clearly i have chanced on a quirk and a very specific one at that as it s not reproducible in jsfiddle

11731751
disk	ram
if you take care to make sure the two threads don t get confused when the first thread wants to re-read back a record still being written to disk by the second thread there should be no other issues there either -- but asynchronous writing is likely to increase your throughput with most access patterns unless you are i o bound anyway or really short on ram relatively speaking

11731764
client-side	server-side
in web development client-side javascript frameworks are mostly separate from server-side python frameworks so a python framework .

11731788
post	get
i ran into a similar problem and ended up implementing a simple addparameters method extension for the ajax.request class to get this done for both get and post requests

11731792
implements	extends
for example you can have a singleton that implements an interface or extends another class

11731798
union	distinct
the use of union guarantees distinct values - union removes duplicates union all preserves them

11731798
union	distinct
this query will out-perform all other answers because the database can efficiently count distinct values within a table much faster than from the union list

11731831
onfocus	onblur
i don t know if my issue is with asp.net the multiline control or something else but the onblur and onfocus are not working

11731852
put	get
assuming that images ima1 is in b2 this would be something you could put into c2 to get you what you re after and then paste the formula down

11731858
hide	show
i don t see how there can be any ui displayed by .oninit that the user can click on since the main window has not been created yet but if you moved the code somewhere else you could hide show the installer with hidewindow + bringtofront basically showwindow or disable the buttons you don t want the user to click on with getdlgitem + enablewindow

11731898
ssl	https
if you want to configure tomcat to accept https communication then your etc apache2 crt ssl file needs to be a java keystore and not a bare certificate file like apache httpd uses

11731903
width	height
if the image data inside the pdf say height 216 and width 288 then this is the size in pixels not inches or any other length unit

11731945
client-side	server-side
php is a server-side language while javascript is client-side

11731957
width	height
i have an image in a div and i am setting all css properties in the style property of the div including bottom left height and width

11731973
google-chrome	firefox
it works just fine in google-chrome but doesn t execute the jquery stuff before returning true either in firefox or ie

11731981
width	height
now if you don t give it a width and height you can use bottom and right to make it so it takes up all the space except for whatever you specify in those style attributes

11731989
uiview	subviews	uilabel	uitextview
i have a uiview called containerview in which i have a few uilabel s and uitextview in it and i am adjusting the final height of the containerview by later on iterating the height of it s subviews and summing them up

11731998
laravel	codeigniter
i am using backbone.js along with a php mvc framework codeigniter laravel

11732006
config	ini
when i specify the path to config in the ini as relative to the exe launching the product only works when launched from the directory of the exe

11732006
config	ini
launching from another directory fails unless the config path is set to an absolute path in the ini file

11732025
librsvg	batik
for example there s embedded svg animation using batik or librsvg

11732038
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
now it s true you can use a for-loop like a foreach loops by using count arrays .

11732042
inherited	properties
to clarify you re adding a properties to the type frmnewform which inherited from form

11732056
client-side	server-side
it also lets you set state server-side in advance of the tests like logging in a user and setting content for the page to reduce client-side mocking

11732085
apache	nginx
i have converted most of my apache mod_rewrite rules over to nginx s httprewrite module which calls php-fpm via fastcgi on every dynamic request

11732097

i call get put delete and post methods in qunit test like this and it works fine

11732138

i have a number of video files mostly in flv format h.264 aac that i would like to stream to a client which in this case is a roku box that accepts mp4 h.264 aac and http live streaming hls

11732141

i m trying to see on success of a json request that for the particular hyper link it should call addclass and removeclass to add remove particular css properties

11732171
post	put
i am going to put them in the if statement so if a negative number is entered the program stops and post their average

11732186
int	double
so from safety reasons it won t allow to use bintree int in addbranch in case getbranch 0 will return something different then bintree int like bintree double

11732238
implements	extends
what is the difference if we implements an interface and not extends our class

11732246
portrait	landscape
i did some cursory exploration into this using the accelerationincludivingravity property of an ipad and discovered that the portrait - landscape values of x y and z are different than the landscape - portrait values of x y and z

11732246
portrait	landscape
in my initial testing i found out that a portrait to landscape rotation event occurs at x y z 8.5 6.8 0 and that a landscape to portrait rotation event occurs at x y z 4.5 6.8 0

11732272
getter	setter
note please make sure you don t inherit the simpleboardgame as the main class in land class if you want to access the variable inside the main class just make setter and getter for that

11732290
versioning	upgrade
each msi has the same product guid and upgrade guid and the same versioning number

11732315

11732402
int	chars
i m trying to read the first chars as a string and the third chars as an int and then print those out on the screen

11732404
cos	sin
this should not be computationally intensive at all especially since you only have to do a single sin and cos calculation for each image your angle doesn t change for every pixel

11732404
cos	sin
no worker threads no mutexes no redundant calls to sin cos

11732473
mocha	zombie.js
in mocha you use a separate tool for http response testing such as request supertest zombie.js etc

11732481
disk	ram
the disadvantage is that it s rather complex to implement and the entire clipmap has to be stored somewhere probably in a big file on disk so that you can load parts of it into ram as needed

11732492
putty	winscp
if you are on windows you can use a combination of putty and winscp to manage your server and its files respectively

11732581
floating-point	integer
integer and floating-point arithmetic are totally different

11732581
int	double
in this example the types int and double are automatically coerced converted to type double without an explicit cast

11732581
floating-point	integer
there are languages in which you could not even sum an integer and a floating-point number without an explicit cast afaik sml in which by the way parametric polymorphism is key to overcome this kind of problems

11732581
min	max
this of course also applies to forms of method overloading in classes i.e java.lang.math methods min and max are overloaded to support different primitive types

11732581
haskell	sml	haskell	ocaml	ocaml	sml
take for example the cases of duck typing in dynamic languages like python or even in statically-typed languages like go or algebraic data types in languages like sml ocaml and scala or type classes in languages like haskell multi methods in clojure prototypal inheritance in javascript etc

11732582
ubuntu	linux
alternatively if you don t care about the android ui you can simply install a generic linux such as ubuntu

11732582

the salt is generated in the create_hash function and is stored in the resulting hash which ends up looking like sha256 1000 salt hashed_password

11734495

if you are looking for a web framework simpler than django look at flask flask uses jinja2 as the default template engine

11737976
udp	tcp
the idea is that it captures all packets tcp and udp that passes one network device eg wifi card and you apply a filter on the port that your application uses and eventually an ip address

11737978
postgresql	mysql
i have tested sqlite with 3rd party server mysql and postgresql

11737978
postgresql	mysql
it also feels that mysql and postgresql will be a litte overkill for such requirements

11737981
width	height
now if testview provides a nstableheaderview via -headerview property the split view divider cannot be dragged all the way to bottom or right to hide the testview but stops to the boundary of the initial width or height of the testview

11737986
put	get
i have a html xml document that is originally a cstring and i want to get rid of all the newlines essentially put everything into one line

11737996
google-chrome	firefox
then the browser at least firefox 14 and google-chrome 20 keeps a local copy sends if-modified-since and if-none-match headers and the server returns a 304 code and the file contents are not downloaded

11738092
google-chrome	firefox
the website layout looks good in google-chrome but weird in ie and firefox latest ver

11738124

you can use melt from the reshape package to convert from an array marix to a data.frame flat structure

11738133
cpu	hyperthreading
however the returned number is twice as high on a cpu supporting hyperthreading

11738133
cpu	hyperthreading
for that i have to deduce whether the cpu is hyperthreading

11738133
cpu	hyperthreading
lenovo thinkpad w510 i7 cpu with 4 cores and hyperthreading 16g of ram

11738231
post	get
when i create a comment for a post send a request to fb i get a successful response i get the id for a newly created comment for the post

11738234
mvp	presenter
with mvp best is to let the view assign itself to a created presenter by injecting it into a property of the presenter

11738234
mvp	presenter
since you are using mvp the only things you ll ever need to directly resolve are presenter

11738256
pthreads	fcntl
it might use the pthreads advisory locking as documented in the flock manpage and if i were you i would write a 10 31-line test program in c to show what fcntl manpage thinks about the advisory lock you have made from within finder

11738286
crypt	salt
the standard des-based crypt returns the salt as the first two characters of the output

11738286
crypt	hash
note also that crypt despite the name does not actually encrypt a string it just generates a hash

11738303
google-chrome	firefox
the inputs seems to be disabled but only with firefox with google-chrome or ie it s all working as expected

11738314
stdout	stderr
if this is not sufficient to solve your problem you ll want to see what was output to stdout and stderr

11738314
stdout	stderr
now you have access to the exit status stdout and stderr streams - in fact everything you d get if you ran the process within a console

11738359
crypt	salt
the standard des-based crypt returns the salt as the first two characters of the output

11738369
http-headers	content-type
i guess one way would be to read the http-headers especially the content-type header and evaluate whether it is an image or not

11738385
gif	png
image gif image png etc

11738391
integer	fractions
n 2 this is an integer division where the fractions part will be ignored

11738468
bids	ssis
i have to use a wcf service in the ssis script component which is developing in bids 2005

11738492
for-loop	loops
but i would use a for-loop instead of the while because you know how many times you need to loops

11738492
for-loop	loops
here is my version - the changes are use of a scanner renaming x into i and changing the while loops into a for-loop

11738506
.when	each
i have gridview with template field of dropdownlist in each row..all dropdownlists are set to default value select .when i select any value from dropdownlist it will change color of 3rd row below than it but when i re-select select option the color is still there of 3rd row.i don t need it.it should be changed to default color of gridview that is white

11738513
width	height
on fullscreeneventchange resize your video to 100 width and height and position it on top revert on close

11738514
int	double
in case you want to explicitly convert the int into float or double you can use any of the following conversions

11738556
spaces	delimiter
this ensures that the shell will ignore the spaces and won t consider it as a delimiter

11738559
margin	font-size
as discussed in the comments you could do the same with the margin padding and borders to make the whole element scale cleanly rather than just the font-size

11738604
openni	kinect
i m currently on schedule with kinect openni and nite

11738641
width	height
no there is no way you can do that inside of one img tag as the background and the image itself are assigned the same height and width so they will always overlap each other and be stretchd or shrunk into the dimensions you specify

11738716
width	height
definitely when you apply height and width style to img tag it will apply to the main image ie image in src

11738723
oncreate	setcontentview
in the oncreate method i m calling setcontentview

11738826
width	height
i think there are better ways to do this but if you absolutely have to do it your way use padding - setting the width and height of your image with css will definitely deform it .

11738835
portrait	landscape
i m developing a mobile application in flex 4.6 and i have the autoorient property set to true so that flex takes care of changing between portrait and landscape mode when the phone is rotated

11738835
portrait	landscape
the transition between portrait and landscape consists of the application rotating from one position to the other and it doesn t look good at all

11738835
portrait	landscape
but to do with portrait landscape transitions instead

11738844
folder	directory
i have downloaded qpdf put the unzipped folder in my program files directory and added the bin folder to the path

11738866
processors	hyperthreading
another approach is to use all the processors even if hyperthreading doesn t help provided it doesn t make the code dramatically slower

11738877
width	height
now i want to place the child elements such a way that the top and left of the picture is always 25 of the height width of the container div

11739300
move	drag
i am trying to figure out how to move the items in a pre-populated listbox with mediaelements up and down via mouse drag

11739321
xstream	jackson
if you need to support both xml and json you need to include jackson first and then org.restlet.ext.xstream as xstream is also capable of json representations but the implementation is rather poor as described in restlet docs this is recommended order by restlet authors

11739364
width	height
public bitmap int width int height int stride pixelformat format intptr scan0

11739399
google-chrome	firefox
this loads perfectly fine in google-chrome and firefox

11739433
codeigniter	cakephp
zend framework is like any other framework cakephp codeigniter symfony... and you can setup new project via cli command project generator or manually setting up project folders and include paths

11739438
cpu	hyperthreading
beware that the solutions proposed so far can solve your requirement as you asked but not only intel cpu s offer a form of hyperthreading sparc comes to mind and i m sure there are others as well

11739511
width	height
for me i make the first item in the collection double width double height by setting columnspan and rowspan to 2

11739536

for x86 up to and including gcc 4.4 the default for 32-bit was and for 64bit was note the hyphen instead of underscore.

11739622
google-chrome	firefox
the problem occurs mainly on google-chrome and my iphone...maybe a little on firefox but not really noticeable

11739636
put	get
what i would like to do is is to somehow get the first image from this div i need to search for img since i can t control their classes ids and put it as a thumbnail in a listview

11739653
sudo	passwd
in your case sudo needs a passwd which it can t get because it is not an interactive session

11739653
sudo	passwd
if you really want this configure sudo to accept you without asking for a passwd

11739679
for-loop	loops
and the whole block of your for-loop is a single statement as far as cmd is concerned thus when loops runs any environment variables are already expanded to their values

11739691
versioning	upgrade
your database will be upgrade in-place after overwriting the 1.7.0.0 files with the new versioning files clearing the cache and browsing any page

11739692
versioning	upgrade
incremental versioning upgrade of the ide cannot be performed at this time

11739692
versioning	upgrade
to upgrade to the most recent versioning you must download the latest installer

11739812
int	chars
enum types are usually used instead of magic numbers in programs and thus are designed to make the code easier to read by a human but the underlying representation is in one of the base data types int chars etc

11739911
keydown	keyup
you can start a timer on keydown and then check that timer on keyup to see if the key up was at or lower than your long press time

11739916
hide	replacewith
i wanted to hide the #maincontent after the replacewith method completes

11739928
jstl	taglib
as to your concrete problem you most likely forgot to declare the jstl taglib in the xml namespace

11739966
width	height
make sure that you are putting fixed height width to that div

11740034
getter	setter
for the mongomodel you will need to convert the guid to objectid back and forth in the property getter setter in the case of mongodb just padd the bytes of the objectid to create the guid and remove the padding when used in repositories

11740044
jquery-ui-autocomplete	typeahead.js
you should use a library like jquery-ui-autocomplete or twitter bootstrap typeahead.js on the client side

11740064
rspec	machinist
while using rspec 2.10.0 machinist 2.0 rspec-rails 2.10.1 and rails 2.3.6 i am having issues using the rspec mocks argumentmatcher anything

11740146
stdout	fflush
that system.out.println in the sample code probably does a fflush for every line which automatically will shift the bottleneck into the console stdout

11740158
android-listview	baseadapter
android android-listview expandablelistview baseadapter

11740224
getter	setter
usually one say if it s a required dependency use the constructor if it s optional use getter setter

11740272
apache	nginx
in my opinion you will never get the same level of security with a pure-python server that you could have with majors web servers as apache and nginx are

11740297
width	height
this should work if you have the buffer as byte a width and the height + the pixelformat stride

11740308
getter	setter
in my opinion it is more correct to write setter s getter s since then the number of properties will only grow

11740313
g++	gcc
if you are using gcc g++ you can use a command like this to generate makefile acceptable dependencies

11740316
implements	extends
to implements it you need to inherit sqlmembershipprovider and extends it

11740322
cdi	facesservlet
i want to use cdi with these servlets but it only works for the facesservlet to be more precisely for the beans the jsf actions are routed to

11740344
versioning	upgrade
so i upgrade the libraries to versioning 0.7 but line fill property does not work and causes the invalid results

11740375

11740384
width	height
i try to create an edittext dynamically with layoutparams.matchparent for its both width and height

11740396
post	get
to send big chunks of data you should use post instead of get

11740396
nsstring	nsdata
in this case body is a simple nsstring object but it can be anything that you can insert in a nsdata object

11740430
folder	directory
need an inotify compatible script writing that will monitor a certain directory and if any new files folder are created in in copy those files to another folder

11740446
children	parent
in your example you will need to explicitly call databind on the control you want bound or on a parent which will invoke databinding on all children

11740512
floating-point	integer
instead you should pass the measurement in its native form an integer or a floating-point number and add the quotation mark at the last moment when you are about to display the string to users

11740556
post	get
you ll get the best answers if you ask specific questions rather than please review my code ...and if you limit each post to a single question

11740578
folder	directory
using directory iterator you can make a list of all files of a folder

11740615
rss	feed
i need a function that checks if a date from a rss feed of an event is today

11740632
put	get
if i put this.value i get the selectedvalue so myurl0 2 ...

11740658
nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue	nsurlconnection	nsoperation
you can also wrap your nsurlconnection code inside a nsoperation subclass and use nsoperationqueue to manage the downloads using nsurlconnection

11740690
width	height
figured out that using setelementsize and setelementposition instead of using width height and x y makes quite a difference

11740702
nsstatusbar	nsstatusitem
i m familiar with the technique described here drag and drop with nsstatusitem to make an nsstatusbar item that can handle file drag drop

11740717
getter	setter
you can write an additional property with your custom getter and setter that does your own thing and then accesses the synthesized ones like so

11740787
ubuntu	linux
i was lucky and had two laptops side-by-side one windows 7 one ubuntu linux

11740787
mouse	keyboard
on linux you can do all of those questions just with the keyboard and i realized how quickly things can be if you don t need the mouse

11740788
ratingbar	textview
i have created a custom cursoradapter which binds some view items a textview and a ratingbar in a listview to some columns in a sql database via bindview i.e

11740845
apache	nginx
gevent is much more likely to survive a ddos attack than apache but nginx is as good as gevent on this regard although i don t see why using it if you can do just fine with your pure python server

11740899
margin	height	width	margin	width	height
but behave more like block items margin padding width height work as you d expect

11740937
behat	mink
i use the behat and mink to write the tests and i have some problems with tests for registration system

11741015
public	protected
an obvious solution would be to make a protected abstract method to be implemented and a public non-abstract method that calls the abstract one and all the other methods that i need

11741031
post	get
for now i was able to solve this by changing the method from get to post

11741053
portrait	landscape
when i rotate it to landscape and back to portrait the webview is suddenly back to the wanted position

11741056
textview	imageview
i have created a custom listview with one imageview and nine textview s

11741100
public	protected
the idea is to provide a public method that executes the steps of your algorithm at high-level and use overrides of protected abstract methods in subclasses to deal with lower-level steps of the algorithm

11741117
post	get
if you can get at the svn logs post them

11741144
min	max
the min will cap the amount off at the whatever you decide is the max backgrounds

hint there s a method of graphics class g.drawimage image x y width height this

11741292
subtract	add
note that if we subtract mid and if we add mid

11741338
post	put
currently it does not support put post delete but if you post that as a feature request in the project status open then it will certainly be added to the pipeline

11741338
post	put
edit the latest pre-release adds support for put post delete operations

11741344
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
you can easily upgrade an existing netbeans installation to the latest versioning 7.2 was just released all your settings will be saved - and the old versioning remains entirely functional should you need features that are abandoned in later versioning

11741352
versioning	upgrade
to give you an idea how often gmail is upgrade take a look at the list of gmail versioning that rtm team is keeping track of

11741413
getter	setter
i ve got 2 entites with its setter and getter

11741432
min	max
min and max widths can be used with defined widths as well

11741432
min	max
real-world scenarios - these are two of the most common uses of min and max width that i have seen

11741478
pop-up	dialog
and if i click that day which is the date today it will pop-up a dialog

i am using cvs2svn to convert a bunch of cvs files from my repository over to svn

11742342
post	get
you can combine that with jon skeet s unstrained melody or any other post il processor to get a proper type constraint on an enum but that is optional

11742343
hide	show
second despite that correct observation i can still attest that i am seeing the behavior that you are complaining about and here s why the show event is triggered before the actual modal has been show and hence your call to hide is made before the rest of the show code

11742426
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari

basically i need to show a loading message on a long running javascript code and hide it when this code ends so something like

11742516
implements	extends
i can t implements both activities as one in same view because the two extends from different classes the first one has a parent that creates a custom menu and the second one comes from mapview so the option to do all things in one activity is not available

11742564

post	put
if needed i can post the code of how it builds these subforms but since it pretty huge all together i ll just put most relevant parts here

11742679

it may be that on the first execution of the query the index and or data blocks that had to be accessed were not in the innodb buffer pool or the myisam key cache and had to be retrieved from disk

11746880
innodb	myisam
those blocks will remain in the innodb buffer pool and the myisam key cache wholly independent of the mysql query cache

11746880
innodb	myisam
typically you do not want to flush blocks from the innodb buffer pool or the myisam key cache to measure performance

if you want to start with no blocks in the innodb buffer pool or the myisam key cache then shutdown and restart the mysql server

but even if those blocks are not in the innodb buffer pool or the myisam key cache it s likely those blocks may still be in memory in the os file system cache

11764890
content-length	content-type
content-type and content-length are also valuable and small to have and you already mentioned that cache headers were important to you

11764955
x86	mips
one architecture to another if that is an interesting comparison some as mentioned mips or32 you have to specifically perform some sort of instruction for the comparision others like x86 msp430 and the vast majority each alu operation changes the flags arm and the like change flags if you tell it to change flags otherwise dont as shown above

11764975

11765186
post	get
you need to use the post redirect get pattern for this

11765194
post	get
the problem you are facing above specifically can and should be solved with post redirect get

11765199
put	get
just off the top of my head one way to do it would be to put all of your imageviews which you should get from your grid s adapter into an array and iterate over that array every 5 seconds using your timer and determine which imageviews should be be set to invisible setvisibility view.invisible

11765307
width	height
need to calculate image s original width and height values when one of them defined 0 on css

11765325
post	get
these logs will offer you request dates request types get post etc files query strings ips useragents and a slew of other informative parts

11765328

since you are saying that you do i suggest running the request through a proxy charles for mac or fiddler for windows and making sure that the request that s being sent actually includes the content-length header

11765334
switching	screens
so if that made no sense i m trying to make the proximity sensor s role switching so that it dims when the screens is in light

11765335
ember.js	backbone.js
that s why a lot of people are moving to lighter backend backbone.js or ember.js combo instead of a complete solution like django

11765357

if the author of this article was referring to the actual database versioning running on the server needing to be upgrade then that poses a problem as this is not an acceptable solution to my customer at the present time

11765462
post	get
make a php file which will take the data from the html file which has the pincode say using post or get

maven	pom.xml
due to problems with the jstl libraries as a result of using uri templates essentially i was getting 500 status codes because of a classnotfoundexception with a jstl class i had to add the following dependencies to my maven pom.xml file these come from our private repository but you should be able to understand what they are

11765827
width	height
which is fine it s easy enough to extract the name width and height of the grid

11765838
subtraction	addition
an obvious solution would be to perform addition or subtraction to each number in the given range one by one

11765838
range	minimum
then finally perform update operation to get the minimum and maximum number in the range

11765838
subtraction	addition
this is just a simple example.the actual problem might contain thousands of such addition subtraction operations.i hope it s clear now

11765858
int	double
you could multiply the number by 10 cast it as an int and then divide it by 10.0 to get a double with exactly one decimal point

11765865
readonly	temporary
applications to sql server routines or pass readonly temporary

11765903
inherited	subclassing
the difference is that subclassing that won t also be abstract must implement all inherited abstract methods

11765903
superclass	subclassing
as to the why or perhaps more explicitly why choose the abstract superclass rather than an interface often it s useful to provide implementations of only some methods of an interface - for instance for code-sharing - and require concrete subclassing to provide specific implementations for other parts of the interface

11765940
mouseup	mousedown
i just have a hunch that you were perhaps trying to use mousedown and mouseup events ..

11765951
getter	setter
both your getter and your setter call themselves recursively

11765951

nsnull	nsstring
instances of nsstring nsnumber nsarray nsdictionary or nsnull

11766075
mvp	presenter
mvp has been designed to separate the user-interface specific interactions and specific control capabilities which in most cases are framework vendor dependent and to hide them from the business logic the presenter

11766075
mvp	presenter
i suspect you would not have to support different user interface technologies at the same time like asp.net web forms wpf silverligth or asp.net mvc but if you hypothetically have to port an asp.net mvc website to a destktop wpf app and stick to the mvp design pattern then you would in the best case have to only implement the view interface in each ui technology keeping the same codebase for the presenter services and all the business logic stuff well in reality going from asp.net mvc to desktop would be quite an adventure but the example should emphasize that the presenter and business logic would not have to be modified

11766078

for that reason i recommend that you capture the full request using development tools in your browser firebug for firefox google-chrome development tools for google-chrome etc and base the login script on that

11766650
post	get
in the method i am doing the post request i fire another function controller which then displays a form html file which i load via get and then fills the form fields of the form with the values from the json object returned by the first post request

11766655
i2c	spi
the best thing to do is to look at an embedded system such as the raspberry pi that is not only a full linux-capable nanocomputer but also includes gpios as well as a i2c spi bus for more complex interfacing

11766659
google-chrome	firefox
since this works in firefox i m not quite sure that its a google-chrome bug or expected behavior

11766659
mouseup	mousedown
what i ve done is not apply any perspective to the transform until the mousedown event is fired this somehow allows the mouseup event to fire and links to work

11766715
submit	submission
you can handle the submit event which will occur only for your form submission

11766737
strlen	strncpy	strlen	strcpy	strcpy	strncpy	memcpy	strncpy	memcpy	strcpy

post	put
post something take what i give you and put it anywhere you want under something as long as you give me its url when you re done.

11766853
width	height
i think the best way fot the image to look the same on all devices would be to set width height programmatically

11766860
folder	directory
how do i create a directory in the lamp root folder var www using the terminal and lamp

11766860
ubuntu	linux
i m just getting to grips at using linux ubuntu and i ve just setup lamp so i m still not to sure on how i can do this

the xml serialization assembly built by sgen should be built as anycpu and so will run in 32bit on x86 and 64bit on x64

11767303

the neat thing is that if you call this on the topmost parent all the children will automatically inherit the same background colour

11767310
width	height
for the looping make sure to go one less than the width and height

11767347
countif	sumifs
indirect and sumifs and countif are others

the weird thing is that on firefox there is no problem it works as it should but in safari and google-chrome it does not

11767615
width	height
the x and y values seem to be the positions for the stretch starting point relative to the entire width and height of the image 0.5 would mean a point in the middle of the image

11767615

11767916

11767917

integer	radix
parseint parses a string into an integer with the radix base specified -- 10 corresponds to decimals

11774342
int	chars
and for the reason your code was not working my only guess is that you weren t stripping out all non-number chars from the string hence when the ++ increment operator tries to force a typecast it just returns a nan as the given string fails to be parsed as int

11774342
int	chars
i found the main problem of your code retrieves the full url of the image that is why as my paragraph above implies you weren t removing all non-number chars and it failed to evaluate as int

11774353
folder	directory
the image directory is currently in the dist folder

11774386
instances	transient
removing the transient lifestyle causes different kind of problems that result in concurrency conflicts when updating objects from ravendb since probably the message handler keeps getting the same instances of the documentsession which holds a cached version of the updated object

width	height
if you do not define that height the div should automatically resize with the browser width

11774758
width	height
you did specify a height which makes sure that at least the whole background image is shown but this also means that the div will never resize with the browser width

11774758
width	height
making sure that both the div and the image have a width of 100 the full width of the browser the image will resize with the browser and the height of the div will adept to that of the image and thus push the other content below the div down

11783575
google-chrome	firefox
what s interesting is that firefox and ie9 will process the larger data set just fine but i thought google-chrome had a larger stack size limit than either of these browsers so i would ve expected them both to fail as well

11783603
width	height
i use console.log to get the height and width it is returning and it always 22x272 so i believe clientheight is getting the file button height or something like that

rss	feed
simple answer to this one is that there seams to be a problem with simplepie if the header information in the rss feed is slightly unconventional

11784206
accessor	ivar
also use self when referring to your variables that way you are accessing the instance variables properly through your accessor methods and not the ivar directly

11784268
versioning	upgrade
however when installing from nuget it puts it in a subfolder that contains versioning so if i upgrade msbuildtasks it will break the path in the build file

11784296

11784430
ordinals	difference
build up on wergeld s solution here as you see in his solution the end of x-axis was position correctly at 5 30 but there was a suddent leap in time this is because the ordinals property of the axis is set to true by default which means all points are equally spaced in terms of pixels immaterial of difference in terms of time so the axis leaves enough room at right for just 1 point and hence number of pixels required to add one point

11784430
ordinals	difference
on setting ordinals to false it will allocate as much space as is needed based on time difference

11784447

which is a 32 bit unsigned integer with all bits set

11785765
int	boolean
you can replace || with | the bitwise-or which works on int but then the entire expression will need to be converted to boolean by comparing it to zero because in c# the if -statements require a boolean

11785819
factors	matrix
matrix elements are required to have no attributes so factors dates and posixt items become their numeric representations if coerced to matrix

i m aware of the existing c c++ libraries some of which offer fractions apa with floats and other with rationals none of them features fixed-point apa however and of course i could benchmark a library that relies on float implementation against one that makes use of rational implementation but the results would largely depend on implementation details of those particular libraries i would have to choose randomly from the nearly ten available ones

11799328
public	protected
being the property protected internal instead of public i was afraid it might not work but yes it did all of it and smoothly really

11799328
public	protected
if a navigation property does not really needs to be public for proxies to be created protected is enough i m leaving internal out because i assume that only influences the ability to use that property for the relation mapping why on earth the restriction on the expression to extract the property for the hasmany method or better yet since i understand the property must be a property of the type being mapped and not some random collection why is not there an overload for hasmany which takes a string propertyname and searches the property for itself even if it is not a public property

it has been my experience that there is no way to do what you want in ie and you should simply put a switch in so that non-ie users get the wiz-bang you re looking for but ie users have to do it the old-fashioned way

division	multiplication	multiplying	division	multiplying	multiplication
this means that if you really need a lot of digits after the dot you can take any big-integer library multiplying all your data say by 2 64 and you basically immediately get fixed-point arithmetic with 64 binary digits after the dot at least as long as arithmetic operations are concerned with some extra adjustments for multiplication and division

11799941
division	multiplication
note also that in many practical applications multiplication operations are often accompanied by division operations as in that compensate for each other meaning that often it is unnecessary to perform any adjustments for such multiplication and divisions

i don t think that the rails ujs tools are enough to change the state of an input field add remove a class or show and hide properties

11800029
switching	screens
in order to get it to switching back to the default launcher when they are not in car mode would be a bit tricky but you could prolly achieve it with some sort of fork activity that checks if car mode is enabled if so go to your car mode launcher if not go to the default launcher it gets trickier if the user already has a different 3rd party launcher so essentially your app will always be the home screens app no matter if car mode is enabled or not but if it is not then you manually start the normal home screens

also instead of onchange you can also use onclick on the submit button option to call the check function as like follows

11800358
src	attr

opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
as a side note also it looks like firefox and opera allow at most 10 respectively 20 different nested iframes other browsers like google-chrome and explorer add iframes ad infinitum. you can use the following code to embed the parent page in the iframe via the slightly modified url

11800649
websocket	pusher
if your application just needs a websocket based messaging service and is largely peer-to-peer you might consider using a commercial websocket service like pusher

11800649
google-chrome	firefox
the older is still used by current ios devices and the newer ietf 6455 version of the protocol is used by google-chrome firefox ie10 and the flash based websocket polyfill web-socket-js

so in short credssp works as long as we re using ntlm for server authentication and fails when we use kerberos but kerberos definitely works fine if we re using kerberos for delegation as well

11800817
uiview	subviews
you should have a uiview contain your image for your wheel as a subviews to it as well as the labels

11800880

11801063
google-chrome	firefox
the image shows up in google-chrome in firefox but does not show in ie8

11801074
width	height
alternatively you could bind the scale transform to the height and width of the control using multibinding

11801074
width	height
then with a converter you alter the scale to the max of height or width then the stripes will remain the same size

11801096

11801155
folder	directory
i know how to extract a jar file to the directory and add them to the jar file using java.util.jar package but as there are a lot of files to extract from the file is it possible to add new classes without extracting the files to the folder somehow directly

11801656
apache	nginx
you could use a middleware such as those provided in django-secure or you could handle this at the apache nginx haproxy level by redirecting all http requests to https

11801714
width	height
i had a problem resizing a google calendar fed iframe so i ve just made a default size to it in the iframe s style width 600 and height settings of basically the maximum i would want 980 i believe then wrapped that in a container div with height and width at 100 and min-height and min-width at 400px and 300px respectively and then added some jquery to run at onload and onresize.

11801714
width	height
so to clarify the resize function runs onload because i am targetting mobile phones and tablets in my responsive design which takes the height and width of the calendarcase div and sets the height and width of the iframe #googlecalendar accordingly minus 10 pixes for some padding

11801717

11801828
int	chars
xij just expands to the chars chr int ij 16

11801857
for-loop	loops
as you can see above the for-loop lets you iterate directly over the contents of an iterable as opposed to the while loops method where you keep track of an index and access items with the index

11801886
folder	directory
you can do that either from the same app that inserts the data from a test app that also uses the datadirectory property if it is in the same output folder or you can open the file in the output directory bin release in your case

post	get
so far my idea would be when a user login s in with facebook using sso on the app they get a token from facebook when they then post things to the website from their mobile they pass this token and their fb userid to the mvc webapi service and the server makes a request to fb and checks that the token is valid before actioning any post or puts etc

we don t even do that bit by writing code much we do it all visually with our mouse and keyboard

11803780
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
this is based on all the other browsers i ve tried safari google-chrome firefox not calling the callbacks in this case until after the prompt is dismissed

11803794
inherited	subclassing
looks to me as if you want to delegate some behaviour to other classes which are usually not subclassing in terms of inherited

11803795
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
right now the borders work for ie8 firefox google-chrome safari but not ie9

11803798
aggregate-functions	sum
in some cases i have seen the aggregate-functions as sum max or avg

11803806
range	minimum
if you know the endpoint slope behavior of a range you know if there is a local minimum within

11803820
awt	swing
also regarding oh yeah game.java extends canvas you don t want to mix awt and swing components unnecessarily as this can cause side effects

11803924

11804090
google-chrome	firefox
it should work both in firefox and google-chrome ie has some other issues with select

11804096
post	get
if i understood your question right...you have a dependency on your get requests...that is to say the second get depends on the first...if that is the case obviously you need to take consecutive get operations...however if that is not the case that is if you know the order of get request and the response won t be affected by local conditions...then i suggest you do post get operations on server side...trigger the first one an let the server handle the rest and get the result.

11804105
put	get
easiest way to get that id is to put it in a hidden input element in your html then grab the value in your javascript

11804109
addition	multiplication
i think the add refers to the multiplication by 2 the adc is actually a trick to add to pos and the or joins the mbsrlentable entry and the rest of the code but that seems to be in the wrong order and then the or would correspond with an addition in the source

11804126
pull	push
i do this so i can work on my project at work push my changes then go home pull the latest from my fork and continue working

11804270
superclass	subclassing
in what order are members of superclass attempted in relation to subclassing

11804356
inherited	properties
what i would suggest doing is creating a custom class that inherited from window and add relaycommand properties for the different buttons you want to display on all windows

11804407
public	protected
a simple workaround for accessing protected declarations in classes is to inherit from the class and use the public redeclaration feature of c++ which enables using the declarations in extern c functions

11804409
width	height
i have a div tag with a fixed width and height and in the preview i d like to display some html h1 h2 p block quotes lists all shrunk down so the entire chunk of html fits inside the preview perfectly scaled and proportioned

yes using swingwt an implementation of swing using swt as the backend

11805018
swt	swing
many people prefer the higher-level swing apis but the swt uses native widgets

11805018
swt	swing
it also lets swing applications run unmodified using an swt backend since your program is already written using swt that doesn t help you but it will others

11805036

11805146
getter	setter
the ember getter setter methods trigger the updates in the templates they fire internal events which cause every property observer to know something happened

11805202
versioning	upgrade
it doesn t download a complete copy of the package but only the files you need that aren t already located or cached on the system so that upgrade to new versioning are usually much faster because they only download changed files

11805207
width	height
i need frame height frame width duration of movie and frame rate

11805248
width	height
it seems that i m stuck with whatever width height i initially pass to -nswindow initwithcontentrect stylemask backing defer

11805259
hide	show
this function is supposed to hide the patient note and show the next note if they have another note

11805273
width	height
it should be noted that the documentation for esri.graphicsextent ... specifies that if the extent height and width are 0 null is returned. this case will occur if the returned graphics array only has a single point in it so you ll want to check for it

11805289

int	double
by the way for built-in types like int long long double why const t is better than i remember i ve read in effective c++

11805385
children	parent
i have also used wait_all_children method since as per the document of the module on cpan it will wait for the processing to get over for all the children of the parent process

11805385
for-loop	loops
i have not understood why wait_all_children method is place outside the while or the for-loop though as observed in the documentation as well since all the processing is taking place inside loops

11805486
children	parent
if you have children that have a smaller height than their parent floats will bring them to the top whereas inline-block will screw up sometimes

11805486
children	parent
one technique you could use to get rid of white space would be to set a font-size of 0 to the parent then give the font-size back to the children although that s a hassle and gross

11805488
submit	submission
i don t quite see why the fields would be reset prior to submission since you don t bind to any submit event handler.

11805539
post	get
when i view index.ctp which displays post i get the following error

11805551
children	parent
when the parent runs out of jobs it jumps out the while loop never having run anything in it itself and then waits for all the remaining children to exit

11805551
children	parent
as you can see any code in the loop after finish is called is never going to run in either the parent because it doesn t do anything after or next within the loop or the children because they exit at finish

11805623

thumbulator doesnt require anything but a c c++ compiler to get it up and running the binary file format you can type the machine code in hex and just go for it with a hex editor you will be doing that anyway

11806163
elf	coff
also because it is a high level question and problem the real questions are where do i learn assembly where do i learn about the relationship between assembly and machine code where do i learn about system calls which are not an assembly question they are unrelated to learning asm you learn assembly language itself then you learn to use it as a tool to perform system calls if you cannot perform the system calls directly using a higher language where do i learn about executable file formats like .com .exe coff elf etc

11806194
google-chrome	firefox
i haven t tried this in all browsers but it works in google-chrome ie and firefox and i think it should work in other browsers

prepare	execute	prepare	bindparam
prepare bindparam and execute will all alert you to errors by either returning false or throwing an exception depending on the error reporting mode pdo is in

11806662
bash	zsh
it s not a serious problem but i d like to eliminate this by instructing the deployment script to use zsh instead of bash

11806738
udp	tcp
you could have two or more tcp socket connections between the two processes and or two or more pairs of udp sockets sending packets back and forth

11806738
udp	tcp
nevertheless what you d need to do is have each instance of your application create multiple sockets either by socket +bind for a udp socket or by socket +bind +listen +accept for accepting an incoming tcp connection or by socket +connect to initiate a tcp connection to the other program instance

select nstextview doubleclick in ib on it because nstextview is in nsscrollview by default or select it in document outline and go to attributes inspector - linguistics - and uncheck continous spell checking here

11806931
textarea	textbox
now if you use a control textbox or textarea instead of a div with the behaviour will be as you expected no difference between clicking the span or the button because the control manages its own cursor to test this just replace the div by a textarea

11806975
google-chrome	firefox
using json library google-chrome and firefox has build in this method

11806980

uilabel	nsstring
- uilabel lable uilabel label textsize nsinteger size labletext nsstring str

11807118

in the case of primitive wrappers int double valueof takes a string 12 and creates an instance of that wrapper

11807316
jquery	simplemodal
another option is to create a simplemodal dialogue box for each image and echo out the jquery with php since the images will be in the database

11807323
udp	tcp
sometimes binary data is sent directly in tcp streams and udp datagrams i assume that s the level of abstraction we re talking about

11807329
pull	push
are those handled by mercurial in the same step or do you have to commit push and pull update everything manually

11807332

google-chrome	firefox
you can enable these in node by running node --harmony and by enabling the experimental javascript flag in google-chrome it s also in firefox by default

11807342
queue	fifo
it sounds like you need a fifo queue in sql

11807355

if you don t have your passphrase anymore it is better to re-create a new set of public private ssh keys protected if you want with a new passphrase and publish that new public key on your github account

11807377
ready	each
another suggestion would be and you have mentioned this above if you made a and rather than dowork performing a foreach maintained the current executing job in your object you could simply dequeue each item when ready for processing

11807398
next	except
you would think the last answer would be enough except here somes the next question

11807428

11807531
unsigned	short
format specified type unsigned short but the argument has type nsinteger aka long

11807675
children	parent
note by the way that the wording in the opencv docs is a little ambiguous but describes the children of that contour if it is negative then that is an inner contour and describes the parent of that contour if it is negative then that is an exterior contour

11807731
width	height
you can quite happily use javascript to change the dimensions of the embedded tag either using jquery with the height and width methods or natively in javascript using

my understanding is that the library project stores the dll in its own directory bin folder

11807897
uiview	uipagecontrol
or you could use one single viewcontroller with multiple uiview and a uipagecontrol like in the default weather app

11807934
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
however floating-point addition subtraction and multiplication commonly execute in about four cpu cycles so they are fairly fast even without early outs

11807934
cpu	processors
additionally most modern processors execute several instructions at a time so other work proceeds while a multiplication is occurring and they are pipelined so commonly one multiplication can be started and one finish in each cpu cycle

11807934
multiplying	division
to remove a previous scaling of 0x1p57 multiplying by 0x1p-57. this is because division instructions are slow on most modern processors

11807996
punctuation	words
word-splitting correctly is a bit tricky but here s a simple start that breaks words at punctuation or spaces

11808014
many-to-many	one-to-many
because relationships could be set up any way one-to-many many-to-many one-to-one and could be empty your statement about subsets is not correct

11808044
for-loop	arrays
as this is information from user input i am using a variable created by the num_rows in my database to determine the number of times a for-loop runs through displaying my arrays values

11808044
for-loop	arrays
the for-loop contains a form that displays one value of the arrays and a like button type submit and repeats this form until all values have been displayed from newest to oldest with a like button following each

11808044
for-loop	loops
i ve even tried using a while loops instead of a for-loop

11808075
maven	pom.xml
my app is maven project and i run it from eclipse and settings are in both web.xml and pom.xml

11808086
inherited	subclassing
normally we just inherited the field and set its value in constructor of subclassing

11808120
for-loop	loops
rather than the for-loop switch that to a while loops over your posts table

11808145
width	height
you have to set some width and height of the table to get that work

11808159
button	checkbox
i know how to validate the normal input fields but the radio button and checkbox are causing trouble

11808171
portrait	landscape
here are screen captures of me opening the application rotating to landscape touching the screen to display the video controls then rotating back to portrait to see the corruption

11808176
google-chrome	firefox
same as in google-chrome and firefox

11808177
multiplying	multiplication
say upperbound for short in java is 32767 and i am multiplying 328 100 i can t actually do comparison with short.max_value because after multiplication answer would already be overflown and answer would be -32736 which is certainly smaller than short.max_value

11808191
typedef	struct
coordinate is typedef on anonymous struct not object

11808211
draggable	droppable
it is not about files as you don t have problem with them but it is about draggable and droppable including greedy droppable

button	checkbox
in stead of checking the value you want to check if the checkbox radio button has been selected

11808251
width	height
can t this be solved in css by defining the width and height like so

11808255
email	dkim
yesterday i made tests where the email had dkim pass

11808264
superclass	subclassing
it shouldn t be read isolated from other parts of a design so if a reader is unsure about what any of the components is an instance of the subclassing and the superclass he or she should look into the - hopefully - accompanying class diagram

11808296
google-chrome	firefox
i am doing the following on google-chrome but it does not work on firefox

11808299
width	height
the window shrinks to the original width but not the original height

11808333
versioning	upgrade
i actually upgrade my crystal report versioning to get the pdf versioning higher than 1.2

11808339
debian	linux
it appears that libsndfile s native platform is debian gnu linux so the source may be a little trickier to work with under windows

11808423
google-chrome	firefox
what you want is hard to achieve even more if you don t target a specific browser vendor like firefox or google-chrome etc

11808454
google-chrome	firefox
i tried it in all browsers ie google-chrome firefox

11808537
hide	show
so the bottom only show 5 product images hide the div of the currently viewable product

11808552
translation	localization
the approach i tought of was to have a big xml file with all the general translation in various languages and smaller xml files with localization for the single pages and single plugins

11808584
inherited	subclassing
any actual types passed to the respective type arguments are meant to be a part of the given inherited hierarchy starting with the base class you specified so users of your class can specify any type that matches the base class or any of its subclassing

11808601
getter	setter
add getter and setter for your container class

11808604
integer	unsigned
looking in the documentation for that function and selecting the overload for an unsigned integer

11808606
hide	show
this is so you can hide and show the panel at any time

11808629
width	text-align
when i try the same using display inline-block and text-align centre i can have the content centred in the screen even though the wrapper stretches to 100 of the width

11808666
getter	setter
i would recommend that you get rid of the custom implementations of the setter getter for musicplayercompletionblock and just declare a property

11808666
getter	setter
the generated setter getter will take care of copying the block

11808731
actualheight	actualwidth
the actualwidth and actualheight properties do not reflect the rendered size

11808778
pop-up	dialog
check this previous so question how to create pop-up window modal dialog box in html

11808789
actualheight	actualwidth
actualwidth and actualheight will get you the correct result when the layout of the grid is updated

11808793
ready	each
separate branches for each environment live stage dev n and a verified code flow from dev where you develop and can have broken codebase state to stage where release candidate resides and is ready for testing and does not change from stage to live where your live code is in stable state

11808801
actualheight	actualwidth
after call grid.updatelayout method actualwidth and actualheight will reflect the new values

11808816

i am able to get ram hard disk and battery info and would like to inform users when free hdd ram or battery is let s say less than 20 even if my app is not running

11808834
google-chrome	firefox
note google-chrome shows a slight variation compared to firefox and ie on how it calculates the absolute position of the d element

11808834
width	height
this solution removes your 100 inline styling on d s width and height

11808856
equals	charat
i already searched stack forums and docs oracle but i only found that this exception is thrown when is index equals the size of the string for charat method

11808867
google-chrome	firefox
this function is working in firefox but not in google-chrome on mac os i didn t test yet ie

11808871
lwuit	lcdui
if you want an application that looks as good as if it were developed with lwuit but in a smaller jar file and that is easier to debug for you one solution is to develop the gui from basic geometrical shapes and images drawn on a lcdui canvas

11808873
int	chars
in this case you want an int and so s must be a sequence of chars that form a signed int

11808893

i am trying to show hide the next two rows of a table using jquery

11808983
mouse	keyboard
a nifty cross platform solution for simulating keyboard and mouse input

11809003
portrait	landscape	width	height
i ve got a ul list which contains a 9 pictures which are either 70px in height or 70px in width depending on whether the image was taken portrait or landscape

11809026
width	height
then draw that image on your main canvas and manipulate its width and height

11809052
addition	multiplication
inner nodes represent operations addition multiplication etc. and

11809064
post	get
ideally you use ajax to post the first option and get the options for the second select

11809065
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
note i have only tested the above link in google-chrome so there could be inconsistencies on firefox opera etc

11809093
freebsd	centos
i put the videos on a local server in my office along with the exact same web pages using apache and freebsd hostgator uses centos

11809115
hide	show
as i understand it you want to show hide #copy based on the emptiness of #recentinc and do the opposite for #recently_viewed

11809122
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
you simply can create an arrays loops over the values using a for-loop and push ing the values

11809226
hide	show
i am creating an application in which a camera is showing with an option on screen to hide and show grids on the screen

11809226
hide	show
but when i hide the grid and click show then horizontal lines are not showing.

11809228
implements	sealed
implements the parameterless work method in your authenticatedbase and use the sealed keyword to stop it from showing on inheritors of authenticatedbase

11809254
maven	pom.xml
i agree that there should be a way to specify that maven itself should look at my pom.xml and generate a project dir structure from that

11809254
maven	pom.xml
step 1 move your already created pom.xml somewhere else maven will complain if you already have it in the directory where you will run the next command

11809258
ubuntu	debian
try this tip to force uninstall apps in debian ubuntu

11809258
versioning	upgrade
the syntax changes between drush major versioning and if you let apt manage this you could inadvertantly upgrade your drush install

11809273
put	get
if you want to filter cursor adapter follow sam guide in your posted code you get data from cursor and put to your class so it not cursor adapter

11809304
implements	extends
when designing linq instead of creating a new interface that defined each member that any object that it would be possible to query using linq would need to implements microsoft instead decided to take the existing class ienumerable and extends this class using extension methods

11809304
implements	extends
so microsoft created lots of extension methods extends ienumerable inside the system.linq namespace and any class which uses the system.linq namespace and contains an object implements ienumerable can use these extension methods to query that object

11809304
implements	extends
in regards to where where is an extension method extends ienumerable and returning a new object which implements ienumerable

11809399
hide	show
you can give each input an id attribute and use jquery to hide show based on the id

11809448
post	get
i am using get method for form post but i am not interested if person could see if i am using yii framework

11809509
min	max
for this i have to calculate a max a min and a margin of error these will indicate the interval of my dataset

11809521
next	except
this sort-of works except that it skips the last-child proceeding immediately to the next album and the first-child else if statement doesn t work at all with slideshow.cycle prev

11809525
addition	multiplication
floating point addition and multiplication typically take few cycles in modern processors

11809587
put	get
but to do so it has to keep track of the object separately such an object is put on the finalizer queue waiting for the finalizer thread to get around to executing the finalizer

11809587
cpu	processors
their values take a lot less memory than an reference type object and can be stored in cpu registers and the cpu stack memory locations that are highly optimized in processors designs

11809642
plot	heatmap
4 plot your heatmap

11809642
plot	heatmap
in that case you ll have to play around with some x-scale factor and y-scale factor to transform your heatmap s coordinates into pixel coordinates first and then plot the heatmap and then the overlay should work

11809653
int	double
if you re using sse adding constants directly to the exponent field is a legitimate trick in fpu code it s quite terrible - it typically has double the throughput and a 4 times better latency except on processors that have a float- int and or int- float penalty

11809728
post	get
if i run this code as is then i get a page where i am able to edit all the post i imagine because post draws from an association

11809728
post	get
then if i change the post to discussion.posts.at 0 to get the first post then i can proceed to the edit page.

11809741
implements	extends
i suggest that you don t have your gui or applet classes also implements listener interfaces since this can make your code difficult to debug and extends

11809779
sudoers	visudo
to do this i need to run the command visudo in order to add edit the sudoers file i then added the following into the sudoers file

11809805
gentoo	opensuse
on opensuse redhat gentoo you have to use perl version of rename

11809815
division	multiplication
but the possibility of overflow is still there another useful trick may be dividing n - r + i and i by their gcd before doing the multiplication and division and still overflow may occur

11809821
ubuntu	linux
i ve been using linux ubuntu aptana and it has the nice word navigation you described then started using max os x for work and it does seem like the mac version of aptana and it seems to lack the same functionality it only jumps over words separated by whitespace and not underscore or camelcase

11809828
udp	mtu
udp is not connection oriented you can never say that two packets belong to each other you can use getsockopt to determine mtu and stay under it preparing packets by hand with proper offsets

11809828
udp	mtu
basically while sending udp packets larger than mtu ip fragmentation can occur if it s supported on your platform but not all platforms support it

11809836
put	get
i am requesting to twitter to get all the locations of my users but then when i try to put them into my array all my objects get the same location the last location of .each

11809903
google-chrome	firefox
this anchor works fine in google-chrome and even in ie but when i use it in firefox the browsers redirects to #dash-main .load billing.php

11809966
innodb	myisam
innodb or myisam

11809981
width	height
you don t need to set the width and height because during image loading this information is loaded and set

11809981
width	height
it is not possible to change the width and height of an image object

11809981
width	height
you can just query its width and height

11809985
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and opera are refreshing images after src change but firefox don t

11810019
nsmanagedobjectcontext	nsmanagedobjectmodel
if you change the user also changes nspersistentstorecoordinator and nsmanagedobjectcontext but nsmanagedobjectmodel - not there nsfetchrequest

11810030
children	parent
for example if the action was to create a parent some children and attached them i dispose immediately once that is finished

11810054
put	get
but i can t get put works with an entry

11810110
x86	64bit
this occurs when running a 64bit version of ubuntu without the necessary x86 libraries installed and trying to execute a 32-bit binary

11810165
junit	testng
it will get run automatically each time at least with testng but i suppose junit support inheritance as well

11810178
hash	md5
you cannot decrypt an md5 hash

11810205
hash	salt
when the user enters their password concatenate it with a random salt and hash it for the password recognition routine

11810205
hash	salt
use a different salt and hash it again for the aes encryption key

11810213
tunnel	vpn
so the best approach here is some type of ssl tunnel or a vpn to your office network and the bonus part is you likely not have to re-link the front end to a different ip address since once that tunnel is setup to your office then the result of the network setup including the use of printers etc

11810250
content-disposition	content-type
you can rename a .html file to .doc and word will eat it but you will still need some php or whatever serverside language is your drug of choice to send a content-disposition download tag and a content-type application vnd-ms-word header

11810273
children	parent
for example having audio visual as parent and mp3 wma as audio s children and mpeg avi as visual s children

11810283
post	get
okay firstly you need to change your request to get from post

11810300
width	height
you can also filter by image width and height but it appears to be weird with how it finds the width and height

11810300
width	height
...it would spit out the width xxx and height yyy ...but it doesn t

11810300
width	height
that being said you can use a similar solution like above for width and height too

11810316
redmine	gitolite
since you ve bundled redmine with gitolite that probably means that redmine is managing these public keys and you would need to upload them to redmine so that redmine can update the admin-repository

11810323
apache	nginx
the only way to serve the blog is via apache or nginx

11810326
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
unfortunately i have found a sample that works in ie9 google-chrome opera and safari but not in firefox 14

11810352
folder	directory
containers are similar to folder or directory and blobs are similar to files in our system.if you specify it is similar to specifying drive folder file .hence when you access a blob through a url you actually fetch the blob file through http

11810384
post	get
either get or post

11810404
hide	show
i recommend having the image already in place in the html and just have the jquery show hide it as required

11810456
qobject	qwidget
it s also possible to re-emit signals with an int qwidget or qobject parameter

11810492
width	height
we will start returning a dictionary containing the fields url height width and is_silhouette when accessing the picture connection for an object and specifying a callback property

11810515
x86	mips
now compilers will take c++ code and generate its corresponding assembly code for the architecture x86 mips etc.

11810546
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
this seems to be supported in all browsers that i ve tested ie 8 google-chrome 21 firefox 12.0 opera 11.61 safari 5.1.2 under windows and android 2.3.3

11810589
put	get
if the item already is in the map get the value increment increment it and put it back into the map

11810645
google-chrome	firefox
however when i go to edit the product status of a product that i have entered and change the availability date in google-chrome it wont work but in firefox it does.when i say it doesnt work i mean that when i click on the date field the datepicker opens but when i click the date it wont return it in the field

11810668
post	put
the way to send json like any payload is to put it in the post data not the url

11810686
pow	sqrt
i m wondering if fast implementation of pow for example this one is a faster way to get square root of an integer than fast sqrt x

11810699
google-chrome	firefox
this is working great in firefox but not in google-chrome

11810699
google-chrome	firefox
in this block every console.log fires in firefox when i mouse over and click the copy span but in google-chrome all except the complete listener fire

11810704
fadein	fadeout
you can you use the jquery fadein fadeout methods which will look like a slide effect

11810710
mouseout	mouseenter	hide	show
i have a tooltip that show on the mouseenter event and hide on the mouseout event

11810728
mouseout	mouseleave
try mouseleave instead of mouseout like this

11810733
interbase	firebird
see the interbase 6.0 data definition guide page 107-111 available for download from or the firebird book by helen borrie page 281-287

11810739
mouseout	mouseleave
use mouseleave instead of mouseout

11810749
pow	sqrt
therefore you could take that algorithm and replace b with the constant 0.5 and now you have a sqrt that is at least as fast as that pow

11810749
pow	sqrt
please note that that pow function is an approximation and has relatively large error and therefore is not nearly as accurate as say most library sqrt functions

11810758
pow	sqrt
with regard to c standard library sqrt and pow the answer is no

11810758
pow	sqrt
first if pow x .5f were faster than an implementation of sqrt x the engineer assigned to maintain sqrt would replace the implementation with pow x .5f

11810758
pow	sqrt
the code you linked question you asked is about attempting a crude approximation of sqrt using a crudely approximated pow

11810758
pow	sqrt
i also measured the run-time of the system mac os x 10.8 pow and sqrt and of the sqrt approximation here with one iteration and multiplying by the argument at the end to get the square root rather than its inverse

11810758
pow	sqrt
the correct value returned by the system pow and sqrt is 1.73205

11810758
pow	sqrt
running in 64-bit mode on a macpro4 1 the pow approximation takes about 6 cycles the system pow takes 29 cycles the square root approximation takes 10 cycles and the system sqrt takes 29 cycles

11810772
mouseleave	mouseenter
you need to write your mouseenter and mouseleave functions in a proper way something like below

11810822
min	max
you can specify the min and max date

11810835
post	put
the search will query the facebook graph api as you can do using hate my boss type post limit 100 locale en_gb my issue is that i want to put quotes around the query so when the user types into the text field and hits the search button the php code does the rest and queries the api but at the same time will query it like i hate my boss

11810898
postgresql	mysql
i m migrating my mysql databases to postgresql

11810898
postgresql	mysql
so could you please convert this mysql query into postgresql

11810913
hive	hdfs
there should be a directory in hdfs named user hive warehouse lip_data_quality dt 20120712 after your load

11810914
folder	directory
i ended up making a directory structure for my compass project in the main app resources folder

11810942
int	chars
reorder is int array only carries the new index order of the chars in the given str

11810964
width	height
the whole height and width seemed promising but making and adjustment broke it entirely

11810987
spaces	delimiter
i do not simply include spaces as a delimiter in the for f statement because that can throw off the token counting when a value is sometimes blank and sometimes not

11811023
letter-spacing	text-align
this might be less important if it did not cause the text with letter-spacing of -1px to be slight off-center when you are trying to align it with text-align center

11811030
sorting	filtering
this way the question of unusual sorting becomes not relevant - the log data gets eventually converted into information by applying proper set of filtering with few clicks of a mouse

11811055
post	get
i am able to log in and get the user s first name but when i go to post nothing shows up on user s wall

11811055
post	get
i get a callback notification saying response was received successfully but id of post is 0

11811055
post	get
i have even tried replacing the call to get user s info with the post and still get same result

11811087
filtering	grouping
i want to filtering search by age grouping

11811088
mouse	keyboard
i m not sure you ll have any luck getting doh robot to work with a headless browser it s very much attuned to generating low-level mouse and keyboard events

11811098
draggable	droppable
i ve got three draggable images and three droppable divs for them to go into

11811153
stdout	stderr
close file descriptors for stdin stdout stderr and tty close lkml

11811153
stdout	stderr
duplicate tty file descriptor to stdin stdout stderr dup

11811156
width	height
when ever you float something you always want to give it a specific width and if the container of the floated elements doesn t have a specific height you would add

11811159
jobs	cron
sqs expects your application to be idempotent and i ve got multiple consumers producers where even if sqs had a deliver-once mechanism i will have race conditions creating duplicates and race conditions consuming because my consumers run via cron jobs

11811201
width	margin
basically when you add a margin to the right div you are increasing it s width by more than 75 in total width 73 and margin-left 25 - this makes the div s width greater than the allowable

11811238
udp	mtu
by default linux udp does path mtu maximum transmission unit discovery

11811253
invariantculture	cultureinfo
the invariantculture property returns a neutral cultureinfo that is based on english settings so it uses period as decimal separator.

11811260
udp	mtu
-- by default linux udp does path mtu discovery

11811260
udp	mtu
this means the kernel will keep track of the mtu to a specific target ip address and return emsgsize when a udp packet write exceeds it

11811283
put	get
this query will get a list of columns along with their schema and table names matching whatever you put into the parameter somecolumnname

11811285
mouse	keyboard
see xilinx spartan-3e fpga starter kit board user guide ps 2 mouse keyboard port section and or generic ps 2 electric protocol description the latter essentially repeats the former in more detail

11811286
put	get
let s get through a simple put to a map but first we have to determine how the map is built

put	get
doing a put operation on this map it will first get the hashcode of the key

11811300
mouse	keyboard
rdp usage will use both in and out bandwidth since you send input keyboard mouse etc. and it sends mainly screen changes

11811332
post	get
i would suggest you do some research attempt some code and if you get stuck then post what you have so far -

11811334
int	boolean
also preg_match returns an int and you re doing on a boolean which will never hold true since they will never be of the same type

11811369
post	get
i have searched for a few days now high and low and have not been able to get a post to the twitter api to work correctly

11811369
post	get
i am able to successfully get the request token and exchange it for an access token but when i do a post to statuses update i get a 401 error

11811464
width	height
the first parameter is the width and the second is the height

11811485
for-loop	arrays
when i want to remove the brick referencing it with an arrays in a for-loop i randomly get the exception error like many others that the object must be a child of the caller

11811497
hide	show
all you do is assign an id to each header that you click on and then on click you hide all content and show the one clicked

11811529
screens	tablet
android introduced fragments in android 3.0 api level 11 primarily to support more dynamic and flexible ui designs on large screens such as tablet

11811529
screens	tablet
because a tablet s screens is much larger than that of a handset there s more room to combine and interchange ui components

11811564
awt	swing
the jframe naming came about because it s a swing frame and swing came after awt the original java windowing toolkit which already had a frame class

11811564
awt	swing
since both awt and swing where available at the same time they used the j prefix to demarcate the toolkits note that jframe extends frame btw

11811587
google-chrome	firefox
however this fiddle on win 7 is showing me that on google-chrome ie9 and firefox all are applying one less pixel after the last letter firefox is showing me to start out with one less pixel to begin with in the gap to the border which seems to be in violation of it not being applied to the end of the line

11811587
width	text-align
either solution above may or may not help with differences in text-align center calculations as that appears to partially depend on the 1px rounding for center based on the display width as seen when one stretches the width of this fiddle

11811594
x86	64bit
now given in most cases 64bit is not needed at all i think targeting x86 in the executable would just be the best general solution all the other assemblies are targeting anycpu but from what i can see the executable determines where it goes

11811602
vim	emacs
i recently switched from emacs to vim so i m kind of a newbie

11811612
post	get
that s the idea of get method - to path parameters through url probably you should use post

11811624
struts	sitemesh
here is my web.xml configuration - i guess problem is using struts tags with sitemesh

11811638
bash	zsh
don t think there s any way to right justify items on the prompt using ps1 in bash pretty sure there s easy ways to do this in zsh though

11811648
windows	wow64
windows server core 2008 r2 and presumably core 2012 support wow64 as a separate installable and removable component - including the .net bits

11811669
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
the recommended way to handle that situation is to use a qgraphicsscene and qgraphicsview and then populate the scene with qgraphicsitems

11811675
vim	textmate
it s similar to textmate and has support many vim key-bindings

11811676
int	boolean
i need to somehow specify return values but in fact this function returns pretty much everything depending on int code value -- boolean int pointers etc

11811712
children	parent	inherited	properties
note that if you add more styling to the parent you would have to set an alternative for the child divs parent div to prevent that properties from beeing inherited by the children

11811735
postgresql	mysql
i am in the process of switching from mysql to postgresql because of all of the troubles i have been having with south and mysql but i can t even get this process done

jdk1.6	jdk6
very strangely enough when i add the javaee6.jar to the javadoc tab of the jdk6 platform and in the project structure window i right click on the jdk1.6 library with show javadoc a browser window opens and i get to see jee6 documentation like i wanted

11811829
post	get
all post will be write and publish by admin but as content provided by different author and need to change post author id from admin to other author author id will get from custom field

11811829
post	get
now how can i use above value to change id on the fly while admin publish the post the post author id should change with above id value get from selection box

11811848
post	get
now how can i use above value to change id on the fly while admin publish the post the post author id should change with above id value get from selection box

11811862
pop-up	dialog
there s no way to trap it so i can pop-up a dialog to ask the user if they really wish to exit

11811866
apache	nginx
whether that s apache or nginx php-fpm or just php-fpm you need something to actually run the wordpress code then use the same proxying system you are using now

11811935
super	self
it is stated that if we use super myclass self .__init__ text inside __init__ of myclass we get into recursion

11811935
super	self
but as i understand myclass inherits object so super myclass self should just merely be object but it turns out that super myclass self is __main__.myclass

11811954
hash	salt
salt hash should be used only for authentication

11811980
width	height
there is an example returning image s real width and height which i found these method from this answer

11811992
ffmpeg	handbrake
you might also try handbrake but that also just uses ffmpeg x264 afaik

11811996
put	get
the main reason i have this as a transient property is so my uitableview entries get put into sections based on nsdate but can move between the sections when the date changes

11812005
width	height
i would recommend setting the height and width of the html and body tags as well

11812022
super	self
the problem is that by writing super myclass self .__init__ text you are saying to use the super relative to whatever class myclass refers to at the time super is called

11812022
super	self
you define an __init__ method on origmyclass but that __init__ method calls super myclass self not super origmyclass self

11812022
super	self
decmyclass defines an __init__ that calls super decmyclass self

11812022
super	self
note that this means that when the super myclass self call later executes it will be doing super decmyclass self

11812022
super	self
decmyclass.__init__ calls super decmyclass self .__init__

11812022
super	self
origmyclass.__init__ calls super myclass self .__init__

11812022
super	self
because myclass refers to decmyclass this is the same as super decmyclass self .__init__

11812022
super	self
thus super decmyclass self .__init__ again calls origmyclass.__init__ which again calls itself and so on to infinity

11812022
super	self
note that super calls super sub self

11812038
versioning	upgrade
so if you re not using 2.10.x upgrade and if the problem still persists upgrade to unstable versioning 2.11.3 or higher before to test before filing a bug in

11812039
put	get
if you want to get around that you can put the code in the if blocks as dynamically executed code i always feel this is a bit of a hack workaround

11812060
uninstall	upgrade
as to whether it is technically an uninstall of the old product or an in-place upgrade seems of little importance

11812060
versioning	upgrade
upgrade code the upgrade code stored in the upgradecode property should remain the same for all versioning of a product

11812072
min	max
then you can determine min and max row col in the grid so that the cells include every drawn region

11812111
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it works in google-chrome opera and safari but not in firefox neither ie9

11812132
width	height
executes before callback function gets called before you set the width and height

11812134
width	height
the width and height dimensions are calculated according to dstx2-dstx1 dsty2-dsty1

11812138
sqoop	hadoop
i have set up a single node hadoop cluster and configured it to work with apache hive now when i imported a mysql table using the following command using sqoop

11812178
removeclass	fadeout
change the order of calling fadeout and removeclass methods try this

11812196
post	get
with these in theory you can get rid of the problem by authenticating the users when creating these and let facebook post them instead of scheduled jobs on your side

11812197
google-chrome	safari
definitely check google-chrome safari as suggested

11812205
min	max
you could narrow the box down to find the actual max and min pixels in it if you have many outliers

11812224
switching	screens
do this for each possible id number and change the screenstate to whatever screens state you want it to switching to

11812227
put	get
usually i put external jar files into script library but periodically get outofmemory

11812268
google-chrome	firefox
it perfectly works in firefox and ie in google-chrome there is a problem during animation some thumbnails are moved 1px left or right

11812274
addition	multiplication
multiplication is a relatively complex operation and is likely to be slower than say addition or comparison

11812300
distance	polygons
if we consider the origin of our coordinate system the center of the polygons it boils down to finding an equation such that for any input point in cartesian coordinates the output is the distance from the closest side of the polygons

11812300
distance	polygons
gives us the radial distance from the center of the circle which could be considered as a polygons with infinite sides

11812300
distance	polygons
gives us the chebyshev distance from the closest side of the square which could be considered as a polygons with 4 sides

11812363
d3.js	crossfilter	d3.js	leaflet	leaflet	proj
my current proj includes a combination of bootstrap jquery jquery-ui d3.js leaflet crossfilter and some obscure stuff and it is fair to say that although the application is awesome the code has become an unholy mess

11812363
d3.js	crossfilter
especially code for d3.js and crossfilter is quite verbose see source of the official crossfilter demo for a typical example

11812438
folder	directory
you can instead use the same code in a .htaccess file in each of the folder you want to prevent directory browsing

11812460
restsharp	twitterizer
i m currently looking at mvvm light restsharp silverlight toolkit facebook c# sdk and twitterizer as the primary libraries to use

11812536
chunked	transfer-encoding
it depends on the response if the transfer-encoding of the response is chunked then you read until you encounter the last chunk r n0 r n

11812536
chunked	transfer-encoding
if the transfer-encoding is also set to chunked then you must dechunk the decoded response

11812536
chunked	transfer-encoding
if the transfer-encoding is chunked read and dechunk the data piece by piece

11812564
post	get
theoretically you could use curl for manipulating the gravatar site with get and post requests and parsing the result

11812569
pop-up	dialog
the stock trader ri sample app only uses a modaless dialog pop-up

11812601
awt	swing
of course you might put the applet in a swing gui account for the weird mix of swing and awt and use the layered pane to draw over the top of the entire applet

11812682
explode	implode
when dealing with an array just implode it with some wacky delimiter like or something and str_replace the lot explode the lot again and bob s your uncle

11812704
bottle	flask
i would go with a micro framework like bottle or flask

11812704
django	web.py	web.py	cherrypy
django is a full stack framework and if you don t need database interaction i would seriously look into one of the above cherrypy or web.py

11812704
flask	web.py	flask	cherrypy	web.py	cherrypy
like i said before web.py cherrypy flask are also good alternatives

11812731
arp	udp
that means there is no send buffer when sending udp messages and there are arp requests pending

11812732
google-chrome	firefox
all of that code works fine in firefox and the other browsers but not in google-chrome

11812755
coffeescript	haml
i m working in rails and my goal was to use the same format haml for partials on the server haml ruby and templates on the client haml coffeescript but that proved to be impossible and anyway not very advisable

11812759
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it works fine with firefox 14.0.1 google-chrome 21.0.1180.6 and safari 5.1.7 this with file estilo.css #contenido line height is used to make it fit in safari and google-chrome

11812759
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
if i change its position to absolute i got the same look on google-chrome 21.0.1180.6 and safari 5.1.7 opera 12

11812791
post	get
what you can do is make an http post request instead of http get

11812798
fastcgi	scgi
the uwsgi protocol is more akin to fastcgi or scgi

11812801
width	height
the problem is that the textview text doesn t show up in the dialog if i set its width and height as in the code above

11812818
isotope	masonry
same problem as here how to avoid gaps using isotope with masonry layout

11812835

replace width and height with some defaults for the viewbox

11812835

post	get
if you have some particular characteristics that you need for your threading that asynctask will not readily handle or if you need the thread for an indeterminate period of time until the user presses a stop button use your own thread and something else to get work to the main application thread a handler or post or runonuithread

11812914
width	height
when you set up the cell in cell for rowatindexpath you re setting the frame to cgrectzero a rect at position 0 0 with width height 0

11812914
width	height
you then reset the position but you never reset the the width height

11812914
width	height
or just use cgrectmake x y width height to make the frame

11812934
onmouseover	onclick
however two very important things i would want it to detect are onmouseover over a node and onclick over a node again

11812963
google-chrome	firefox
you can inspect elements in both google-chrome and firefox if you have firebug and both will display the layout information of the element

11812969
for-loop	arrays
a common way to solve this is to traverse the arrays elements in reverse order because the elements that are repositioned by removing the current element are ones that you have already traversed not the ones the for-loop is still going to process next

11812974
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
you should also construct the objectoutputstream before the objectinputstream

11812981
mouse	keyboard
i guess that you mean the lack of mouse and keyboard activity in this window

11812981
mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	keydown	keydown	mousedown	keydown	keyup	keydown	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown	keyup	mousedown	keyup	mouseup
so you would have to add a listener for keydown keyup mousemove mousedown mouseup dommousescroll touchstart touchend touchmove events

11812981
mouse	keyboard
this way the timeout will fire one minute after the last event received one minute after the user stopped generated keyboard or mouse events in the window

11813064
folder	directory
ok so the background on this is that i have some files in the subdirectory linking to other files using links like files test.php because those files expect the other directory to be in the root folder but on my site they aren t

11813087
for-loop	loops
when searching nameslist i have for-loop to takes the names one by one is there a way to search the list one time without loops

11813114
for-loop	arrays
when iterating an arrays with a for-loop the incrementing index is just the index into the arrays

11813115
for-loop	arrays
you should traverse the arrays with a for-loop and a counting variable as you do below

11813163
margin	height
also make the element have height 0px and throw in the same for padding and margin for good measure so that it wont occupy any space when its hidden

11813164
for-loop	loops
when searching nameslist i have for-loop to takes the names one by one is there a way to search the list one time without loops

11813166

i am using a multiple image in my css it looks ok in firefox and google-chrome latest version however the opera v12.0 it doesnt position my second picture well

11813281
screens	hdpi
hdpi stands for high density pixels that means devices that have a screens with a high resolution would use this drawables

11813281
screens	mdpi
normal screens would use drawables from the mdpi folder

11813281
mdpi	hdpi
you can put all high density icon in a hdpi folder and all lower resolution drawables in a mdpi or ldpi folder

11813284
hide	show
i ve been using the standard method to hide show a class namely

11813285
fadein	hide
if you want it to permanently display without fadein after the first load just set the css display property to block assuming you used css to hide it in the first place

11813289
stdout	stderr
there are ways to redirect stderr stdout to logcat but there are drawbacks either need to adb shell setprop which is only for rooted devices or a dup like technique but creating a thread just for that purpose is not a good idea on embedded devices imho though you can look further below for this technique

11813363
for-loop	loops
you have a semicolon right after your for-loop so there is no actual code in loops also you calculation is wrong you add an extra value because you start b at one

11813383
typedef	struct
i need to use typedef struct data datas

11813459
typedef	struct
defining a typedef for a struct type is also unnecessary

11813474

11813555
pypdf	reportlab	pypdf	pdfrw	reportlab	pdfrw
i ve been googling for about an hour and the packages i ve found are either massive overkill and still don t provide useful examples such as reportlab or seem to assume that the only thing anyone would ever do with pdfs is concatenate several of them together pypdf pdfrw

11813807
client-side	server-side
the fine folks at repl.it provide a version of python that is compiled in javascript using llvm and emscripten - it s heftier than some of your other options and possibly buggier but it s completely client-side and therefore not vulnerable to some of the attacks that a server-side setup might be vulnerable to

11813823
xlib	xcb
i ve found plenty of examples documentation explaining how to do this using xlib xcb for linux win32 api for windows and carbon for osx but i m having a hard time finding a way to do this that would be applicable within the scope of a qt application

the password is saved with one way encryption. so there is no way to get the password out to put in anywhere in a form s hidden field which would be a bad idea anyway

11814350
hash	salt
at the suggestion of the top answer on this post keep me logged in - the best approach i decided to hash a combination of the user s salt and password in one cookie and store the user s id a number in another cookie

11814350
hash	salt
the salt value i used is the same one that i used to hash the password of the user when they first register so it is static - it doesn t change between sessions

11814350
hash	salt
3 in a scenario where some user with malicious intents were to gain access to the database a secure website would have salt and hash passwords making it rather difficult for the hacker to gain access into multiple accounts if at all

11814350
hash	salt
but by simply playing around with the hash and salt values and creating a cookie that matches the values they ve changed on the database they can effectively get access to any account they want rendering the whole password-hashing process as useless

11814350
gmail	hotmail
surely websites like gmail and hotmail who offer this keep me logged in feature follow a more secure approach than what i m doing now so how would they do it

folder	directory
depending on you development environment your future intentions you should place the libraries in a location best suited to it for example in a lib directory within you project folder but outside of the source

11814569
int	chars
i have done type casting with int and chars but not with pointers so i posted this question

11814576
submit	submission
i believe that most well made authentication will have some sort of nonce in its form which is essentially to ensure that unless you use their form to submit the submission will be rejected

11814583
folder	directory
create an xml file in the values folder in your resource directory

11814598
int	chars
as for the second printf printing zero remember that int are four bytes while chars are only one

11814620
int	chars
what it does is that assuming address stored at a is say 100 and assuming that int takes 2 bytes and chars takes 1 bytes in memory

11814620
int	chars
one byte stored at p is the chars representation of the first byte of int 1 which is 0

11814643
int	chars
in more probably the type int on your computer has size 4 bytes while chars is 1 byte long you can verify this using the c operator sizeof so the first element of your int array is

11814643
int	chars
for this reason when you use a chars pointer to see the values of your int array you proceed forward one bytes at time not 4 with the obvious result you ve obtained

11814653
int	chars
when you cast it you basically just said okay i know this is a pointer to an array of int but now we re going to reinterpret the data as an array of chars

11814653
int	chars
because it is a chars array it advanced one byte down the array which is in the middle of the int which contains 0

11814664
min	max
_segment_tree 1 holds max min of the whole data array - it s the root of the tree because array-based binary tree has to be indexed from 1

11814664
min	max
hereby if _segment_tree k holds min max of data b e then segment_tree 2 k holds min max of data b b + e 2 and segment_tree 2 k + 1 - of data b + e 2 + 1 e - you can see these indicies in the code

11814678
width	height
when the browser width height is small than the tabpanel i need to display it

11814682
int	chars
p is declared as a pointer to chars not int and is initialized to points to the first element of the array a

11814682
int	chars
the int value above interpreted as a chars would look like so

11814682
int	chars
points to the next int 2 points to the next chars which is 0

11814745
hash	salt
you will notice here than if you add to the salt beyond 22 characters the hash will remain unchanged

11814745
crypt	salt	crypt	hash	hash	salt
that is crypt will truncate the salt down to 22 characters before performing the hash

11814745
hash	salt
also the format of the salt hash is base 64

11814789
superclass	subclassing
if a subclassing defines a static method with the same signature as one in the superclass it is said to be shadowing or hiding the superclass s version not over-riding it since they are not polymorphic as instance methods

11814789
superclass	subclassing
secondly the return types must also be compatible in both the superclass s and subclassing s method

11814870
superclass	subclassing
the return type of the hiding method in the subclassing must be assignment-compatible with the return type of the hidden method in the superclass

11814970
affinity	processors
however you could always try setting the affinity for the matlab process to all your processors manually by the details available at the following link for linux

11815006
chunked	transfer-encoding
edited because i mistakenly took characters produced by transfer-encoding chunked to be caused by misconfifguration

11815009
int	double
would do - since you re using int will return you an int and probably round up down the result casting to double will change this result to a valid one

11815026
x86	64bit
i ve set my path from my computer properties to c program files x86 java jdk1.7.0_05 bin the 64bit version of that and without the bin at the end and jdk1.7.0_05 jre bin

11815084

11815133
put	get	post	get	post	put
the poster used some middleware to approve put get post delete requests like so -

11815149
filtering	grouping
you can just join the tables grouping by employee and filtering the grouping for those with less than 4 records

11815163
int	double
although its often considered best practice to use int long or bigdecimal most investment banks and funds use double because once you understand how to use them safely they are simpler than long and faster than bigdecimal to use

11815174
getter	setter
hereâ s an example for the getter and setter

11815202
width	height
if your decision is based on height and width a very simple script around ffmpeg can do this for you

11815202
width	height
in the output you will have height and width parameters available for the stream

11815202
width	height
based on height and width take decision in your script to rotate or not

11815229
versioning	upgrade
without strict versioning you cannot track versioning of your database and you cannot do explicit upgrade you cannot do downgrades at all

11815233
cout	cin
the iostream library is a fairly large and also has static initialisers - for instance to initialise cout cerr and cin objects

11815246
post	get
the post get their own unique _id but upon creation also get an owner_id which is the id of the user that wrote the post

11815250
min	max
you need to store separately the max min for each interval and what values have been added to it just their sum

11815250
range	min
this range does not cover the whole interval of the first node so we update the children and then set the min for the whole interval that is the value of the first node to be the min of nodes 2 and 3

11815279
octal	decimal
in 07777 the backslash is followed by 3 octal digits 0 7 7 which represents a character with the value 077 in octal or 63 in decimal

11815300
crypt	md5
i m upgrading my auth class replacing md5 with crypt for storing passwords

11815310
post	get
i m writing a node.js bot for irc and i want it to post links in irc that people can click on to prompt it to post more data this is because i want to allow irc users to stay on the channel yet prevent my bot from having to flood the channel and get banned for spamming

11815311
width	height
this state is set using glviewport pos_left pos_bottom width height

11815324
width	height
that would make the element have 0 height and width which would cause a sort of jumping effect

11815397
hide	show
don t create a new j x frame on runtime contents of this container will be the same no reason for that create that once time reuse this container and for visibility on the screen to hide show use setvisible false true

11815397
jlist	jtable
read oracle tutorial about jlist jtable and listselectionlistener logics will be the same and for swingx components too

11815397
mouse	keyboard
i d be use jpopup as control for displaying the jdialog just to avoids annoying events came from mouse or keyboard

11815397
jcomponent	jdialog
create a new separate void that fills value from jtable s row to the jcomponent s placed into jdialog

11815418

try to remove the 2 rows the change the width and height of the picturebox or set them to be constant like 1 or 2 or.

11815424
children	parent
the new circles and its parent don t keep the structural harmony anymore some children circles are not contained anymore by its parent

11815433
width	height
following is my code snip the frame width and height is 176 144

11815449
getter	setter
i cowrote this code with someone who believes that in the name address and student classes it is necessary to include all of the getter and setter that are currently there

11815494
public	protected
you can always set the properties as public or protected or with default scope and access them provided the class is in the appropiate package

11815494
getter	setter
that said it is always good practice to use setter and getter

11815494
getter	setter
setter and getter also help to add logs breakpoints to check the behavior of the program

11815494
getter	setter
and most decent ides allow you to automatically code setter and getter just from the properties so it is not a big deal

11815504
put	get
it should not be a splash screen because i d put a textedit and a button to get the user s username

11815554
google-chrome	firefox
however this doesn t seem to work in firefox ie only in google-chrome

11815577
getter	setter
by establishing and using getter setter from the very beginning you ve enabled your code to have all the bounds-checking logging etc

11815577
getter	setter
in the future if you don t do them now without requiring client-code to adapt to a conversion to getter setter

11815594

oncreate	recreate
when i rotate the entire activity is recreate and i lose all variables declared in my oncreate within the fragment

11815669

width	height
it seems like that css width and height of canvas is completely different than the actual width and height of the canvas element

11816369
width	height
so if you wish to make the coordinates of the html elements match the coordinates of the lines on the canvas element you need to set fixed width on the div that contains it and the same and fixed width and height directly on the element

11816394
put	get
how you get it back and put it into the original file however is more complicated

11816397

so either give a fixed width height to the imageview instead of wrap_content or you have to scale the imagedown based on your phones screen size

11821878
httphandler	httpmodule
in authorizerequest you can access the incoming path and querystring data before imageresizer or any other httpmodule or httphandler ever sees it decide whether or not the user should be able to access it today and either let the request continue or throw an http 401 error

i can easily create properties in my employeescheckboxlist that get set the width height of the checkboxlist within my usercontrol

11822167
width	height
and then in my .aspx page i can set the width and height at runtime with

11822167
width	height
if i set the above height and width properties to 100px and 150px what i would like to achieve is not modifying each web control with those measurements but rather set the viewable space of the user control to those dimensions

min	max
first random.next min max will include min in the random pool but not max

11822437
stdout	stderr
the trick is the clones share stdin stdout and stderr

11822444
put	get
to get attached objects you either need to query the object from the db on the context or manually call attach before delete to put the object onto the context

11822503
post	get
it seems ie uses get post commands for http requests and connect command for https requests

11822503
post	get
for get post commands i should directly send get www.google.com.tw 80 http 1.0 to other proxy servers instead of sending connect www.google.com.tw 80 http 1.0 at first

11822547
pull	push
it is possible to push your values from viewcontroller1 onto your viewcontroller2 but in order to pull it i d say global variable will save you lots of headache

i m having a problem compiling the following code with avr-g++ c++ compiler for avr microcontroller

11822736
highcharts	highstock
all the said the same can very much be done in highcharts too the master detail chart there is a combination of more than one chart the master being the same as the navigator in highstock and detail is the main chart so you can as well set the series type of the master to be column there and you are done fiddled

11822742
nunit	mstest
i use nunit instead of mstest

11822884
post	put
in your routes.rb you define update_password as a post action on the collection users update_password but in your form you are implicitly defining it as a put action when you pass user to form_for since user already exists

11822884
post	put
i haven t tested this but i believe that changing your route on the collection from a post to a put should fix this

11822891
listview	gridview	gridview	datalist
datalist doesn t has such feature so you need to use gridview or listview control

11822958
children	parent
thinking about it further there is a direct one-to-many relationship between a parent process and its children

11822958
children	parent
waitpid will wait on its children and the os will keep track of those children and deliver them to the parent

11822958
children	parent
this will happen regardless of how many generations of the process are created - the parent reaps its children

11822985
width	height
to fix the width height problem you can add padding to your field_container but that will make the container bigger

11822985
width	height
if you can t change the container width you can also use the following trick but that will still increase the height

11823006

11823476
interbase	firebird
up to me if to need on disk persistence then go to firebird embedded + unified interbase library

11823512
performselector	delegation
you can implement the table view delegation method tableviewselectiondidchange and in that method call performselector withobject afterdelay to add any delay you want before showing the popover

11823569
google-chrome	firefox
this works in google-chrome and in older versions of firefox but not in ff14

11823608
inherited	properties
but i can t do the first because in createrequest i user properties of request class and i can t do the second because i use other types that don t inherited from request with map function

11823633
post	get
to get the content of the post you would do something like this

11823660
min	max
i solved this error by using integers in min max and values

11823803
width	height
combined with the width or height as usual

11823828
getter	setter	mutators	getter	mutators	setter
if gvismerge could change parameter values for the googlevis objects passed to it then it would need an accessor method and a mutators method a getter and a setter neither of which it has

11823828
min	max
my guess is that shouldn t be difficult because all you need to set common min max values for the axes is the data set displayed by each chart

11823828
range	max	range	min	min	max
append the returned values from a call to range for each annotatedtimeline chart then pass in this aggregated range for every call to annotatedtimeline which will obviously give each chart drawn from the constructor the same min max values on the given axis

11823846
packets	multicast
the result of the first is that your process will receive all packets multicast or not that are udp and are destined for your port interface

11823846
packets	multicast
the result of the second is to ensure that packets addressed to a given multicast address are sent by the network routers to your interface

11823866
children	parent
strategy 3 you wonder if two siblings actors playing ping-pong are not replacing a better more modular actor hierarchy where basically each actor communicate only with his parent and his children and has no knowledge about his siblings

11823891
width	height
i have made one button which height and width is same

11823891
width	height
now i have set its required height and width as per the one screen in which it is looking perfect

11823891
width	height
so if there is any view that generate at run time and you want to set its height and width then the best way is to calculate its height-width ratio and use it

11823910
ubuntu	linux
i recently developed a gui for my application that runs shell scripts on linux ubuntu 10.04

11824017
for-loop	loops
it is much faster to iterate the contents of a collection with a for-loop or a while loops and have no function call at all than it is to use .each with its resulting function call for each item

11824054
gif	png
try to use png files you can convert gif file using paint or other software

11824068
onchange	onsubmit	onclick	onsubmit	onclick	onchange
in an element s inline event handler like onclick onchange onsubmit etc. you do not need the javascript prefix - the reason you often see it is because people confuse it with the href syntax that i explain below

11824155
getter	setter
with setter and getter for each property

11824325
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs

this works fine in google-chrome moz firefox opera but in ie not

11824406

when i hover over the menu it show correctly but when i move the mouse down to one of the nested uls it hide the dropdown again because of the script

11824507

getter	setter
also it has a getter and setter

there are a few important rulles and required knowledge how concrete layoutmanager works with min max and preferredsize came from its childs

11824635
jcomponent	jdialog	jwindow	jcomponent	jwindow	jdialog
use jscrollpane as first jcomponent added to the jframe jdialog jwindow and with to determine maximum size for jframe best could be from display resolution don t use pack in the case that maximum size is exceeded otherwise containers bounds could be out of the screens

11824646

ps i used the arm compiler armcc 5.01 build 94 in arm ds-5 ide and also keil uvision 4.54 on my machine

11824648
m2e	pom.xml
which leads to the interesting question why m2e reports a pom.xml file for it

11824648
maven	m2e
as for question #2 maven and m2e as well will try to download a release something that doesn t have snapshot in the version only once

11824666

to get fancier you could use a fifo or a message queue for instance

11824689
pop-up	dialog
when i select multiple then it launches the pop-up dialog

11824689
pop-up	dialog
currently i catch onchange event to check if user has selected multiple value so that i can launch the pop-up dialog

11824689
pop-up	dialog
now i select multiple onchange gets fired and pop-up dialog gets launched

11824689
pop-up	dialog
now again if i select multiple then onchange event won t be fired and thus code would not launch pop-up dialog

i have tried useing onclick onblur and onfocus events but they are not of much use to me

post	get
i managed to get this to work after reading this post running delayed_job under monit with ubuntu

11824814
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
if you re only searching by file name file attributes file date the magic method to have the best performances is to manually parse the file allocation table if filesystems is fat and the master file table if filesystems is ntfs

11824814
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
it s not too hard for the fat filesystems as it s quite simple and well documented but it s more difficult for ntfs as the filesystems is much more complicated and not-so-well documented

11824854
jquery	simplemodal
hi you have to include the jquery file before the simplemodal file

11824905
groupbox	panel
note that that question was intended for winforms not wpf so you will have to revise the controldefaults dictionary which handles grouping controls panel groupbox which is not needed here and would not work in wpf

for unit tests i use nunit 2.6.1 and for mocking fakeiteasy 1.7.4582.63 which i install via nuget

11824945
calloc	malloc
of course you first need to allocate memory for the newnode s parent using malloc calloc doesn t make sense in this context - it s used for arrays

11825039
public	protected
improving this via the public overloaded non-virtuals call protected non-overloaded virtuals idiom

11825039
public	protected
the author said the idea of the public overloaded non-virtuals call protected non-overloaded virtuals idiom is to change the public overloaded methods to non-virtuals and make those call protected non-overloaded virtuals.

11825081
g++	gcc
but i have a problem with the long long type in gcc g++

11825098
width	height
a second related note i d add is that for an annotated time series chart docs you must explicitly set a width and height for the chart

11825150
public	protected
with the public non-virtual idiom the user always calls f in confidence and the library developer can override only those parts that she s interested in by overriding a uniquely named protected function without having to touch a name that may affect other users

11825271
pull	push
when i type git push or git pull on either computer it says already up-to-date

11825301
testdriven.net	ncrunch
i used to work with testdriven.net which is imho the best runner out there but lately ncrunch is my new favorite for unit testing

11825301
testdriven.net	ncrunch
i still use testdriven.net for heavy integration tests as i usually disable them in ncrunch and specific tasks so using both runners is a great combination for the tdd practitioner

11825317

jxtable same as a plain jtable does format a date value by default using the format as returned by dateformat.getinstance

11825425
google-chrome	firefox
so far it s working perfectly in firefox and google-chrome

11825425

serializable	deserialization
arrays and simple hash objects could be simply copied during serializable deserialization though their children will often need to be recursed over

11825764

this is true when using s with printf or when using strcpy or strlen

11825829
pop-up	dialog
works well but i can t find the way to modify the default title of the pop-up dialog - it always says problem occurred

11825841
put	get
in my new sf2 app i generated all entities from the existing database to src package bundle databundle entity - of course i d like to have generated forms as well so i need for my foreign-key relations __tostring methods which i don t want to put into those generated files because they get overwritten yes they also get backuped in an extra file so my changes aren t lost but manually merging files is not what i want

11825852
try-catch	exception-handling
in my java code i have handled my exception-handling using try-catch but in the code i have so many repeated exception-handling that may throw same exception-handling in different classes which reduces the readability and code reuse

pop-up	dialog
a broadcast action_close_system_dialogs will be thrown just before any system dialog pop-up

11825960
children	parent
the only possible plus i can think of to not using float right would be the fact that it causes inline elements that are floated right to appear in reverse order unless the parent element is the one being floated in which case its children will appear in the correct order

11826049
versioning	upgrade
i have the upgrade mountain lion versioning of macbook pro with retina display

11826061
inherited	properties
it seems to have lots of functionality for creating classes with public and private properties and members inherited etc

width	height
so i tried to get the center coordinates using display metrics getwidth and getheight methods and converted to geoppoint using mapview.getprojection .frompixels height 2 width 2

11826172
inline	inlining
by outsourcing your inline assembly that does function calls into a static inline __attribute__ naked function you can get around having to specify extensive clobber lists as the compiler will recognize it s a function call and preserve restore as necessary around it even when inlining the code

11826181
getter	setter

11830648
hash	salt
the server generates a random salt appends it to the password hash the result and stores the hash and the unhashed salt value

11830648
hash	salt
the server retrieves the salt from storage appends it to the password hash it and compares the result to the hash password in storage

11830648
hash	salt
if the passwords are not salt then there is a very high probability that many of the hash will be the same because many people use the same weak passwords

11830648
hash	salt
now even if two people use the same password a different salt will have been generated for each of them and the resulting hash will be different

since jsf 2.x it s recommended to explicitly specify a getter and setter for component attributes which in turn delegates to uicomponent#getstatehelper

11831742
getter	setter
that s all you basically need note that the getter and setter must exactly match the attribute name as per javabeans specification

a bit messy but it does seem to work in ie google-chrome firefox and safari

11831877
ilist	icollection
ilist is everything that icollection is but it also supports adding and removing items retrieving items by index etc

11831877

margin	height
you have set the content height to 100 but not removed the default margin or padding in some browsers

11832546
min	max
generally there is no best way to find the min max in the performance point of view because it depends on how this application will be used

11832546
min	max
-finding the max and min in a list needs o n time so if you want to run many many in the context of the input operations your approach to find the min max after all the operations took place is fine

11832546
min	max
-but if the list will hold many elements and you donâ t want to run that many operations you better check each result of the op if its a new max min and update if necessary

11832620
equals	gethashcode
you should always override gethashcode when you override equals

11832672

i have recently started using behat with mink on a php project that uses the slim microframework my behat tests work fine but i would like to run them as part of my build which uses the jenkins-php template by sebastian bergmann

11832689
pbkdf2	hash	hmac	pbkdf2	hash	hmac
however i wouldn t worry too much in the case of pbkdf2 since the timing attack that comparison function was designed to defeat applies more to hmac signing rather than password hash verification.

11832689
salt	md5
to answer question 2 for insecure constructions such as md5 salt+password encoding the salt first would allow an attacker to use existing ascii md5 tables to attack the entire digest where a raw binary salt would make such tables useless

min	max	subtraction	addition
i will assume that all update addition subtraction operations happen before finding max min

11832869
min	max
i don t have a good solution for update and min max operations mixing together

11832869
subtraction	addition
subtraction is addition with the negated number so they can be treated similarly

11832869
subtract	add
when we need to add k to the original array from index i to index j we will add k to index i of our array and subtract k to index j + 1 of our array

11832869

11833139

wsdl.exe has been around since .net framework 1.1 while svcutil.exe came out in .net 3.5

11834175
superclass	subclassing
but that s not the end of the constructing we re still being initialized by the subclassing constructor which overrides some of the superclass s members so when the thread jumps right in dispatching events to the database it occasionally gets in before the subclassing constructor updates the database reference to the correct database

while it would be possible to include a prefuse visualization as a java applet in a jsp page i would rather recommend to use d3.js or protovis for web-based visualizations

11834394
width	height
the only issue is that the way it prints out the data is determinate of the terminal width height making it potentially unparsable if run at weird size

11834395
google-chrome	firefox
same behavior in firefox 14 and google-chrome 20

11834496
superclass	subclassing
i am writing code that has a superclass that encapsulates an object that is specific the every certain subclassing for example below are example relationships for the type of subclassing with the type of class it encapsulates

11834503
rss	feed
additionally i m trying to figure out how to count the number of entries in an rss feed through ajax but i ve never programmed around rss before

11834517
terminate	timeout
the advantage of this is that you can set the timeout for every server connection to terminate the script since calling the method resets the previous timeout countdown

11834539
google-chrome	firefox
upon inspecting the differences in generated source code between google-chrome and firefox shows the url being generated being different for firefox

11834573
getter	setter
the xsd doesn t can t define all logic vars other than basic properties and setter and getter so we ve tried to inject code by xsd definition which are actually discussed by other folks couple of times

11834573
getter	setter
it looks to me there is no way we could take or import any packages other than setter or getter

11834606
passenger	webrick
believe it or not this actually fixed the problem in webrick but i m hesitant to use this approach in a multithreaded passenger environment because i think it s tantamount to modifying a global variable which could potentially affect other threads

11834611
dictionary	map
a map or dictionary would be good for that

11834611
dictionary	map
in fact if you have the flexibility i d make the array-of-arrays a map dictionary and cut out the middleman

11834622
width	height
try to position a over the images put a low opacity on it and a width or height half the size of the image

11834678
strcat	gets
yes the 0 of the first argument to strcat gets overwritten and it becomes the last character of the concatenated string

11834699
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
this issue only exists in firefox not in internet explorer opera or google-chrome

11834788
width	height
you said that you matched the size of children this means you have set the height width of so if there is no adequate height then vertical scrollbar may come

11834801
portrait	landscape
you need image assets for both retina and non-retina landscape and portrait

11834812
keydown	keyup
you might want to listen for keyup or keydown instead

11834832
put	get
i know if i use either the framework or framework64 versions of regasm i can control where in the registry entries get put - and i have seen some references to running cscript as either 32 or 64 bit which possible affects what part of the registry is searched depending on the cmd shell invoked and i have tried both ways as well as trying an administrator shell

11834832
win64	windows
when running under the vs2010 x64 win64 command prompt again as admin the registry entries appeared under hkey_classes_root clsid but this time the test scripts worked from the same prompt and also from a standard windows cmd prompt however they fail from a 32 bit prompt

11834878
google-chrome	firefox
i am using both google-chrome and firefox to visit zencart website but in return i am getting error like this

11834941
prepare	execute
the database constructs the query when the statement is prepare and then re-uses this every time the statement is execute to avoid overhead

11834946
packets	pcap
i capture packets in client side with wireshark and here you can find pcap file

11834946
packets	pcap
in pcap file you can see that mpeg pes packets take only 2 of all stream and others packets are simple udp

11834983
post	get
my approach didn t work but i decided to go one step behind so now i am using an even simpler client with a simpler provider in order to just test my post and get methods

11835005
int	boolean
i have a running spring-ws project that can unmarshal requests using jax2b but when unmarshalling of int boolean fail i get an error message with little detail and often without the name of the invalid element

11835013
hide	show
then just show hide those buttons when the image is hovered

11835041
hide	show
instead of switching between the modals show hide i need to animate the first modal aside until disappearing revealing the second modal

11835045
google-chrome	firefox
but if the command takes more than 30 seconds the first way display a connection reset browser error page same on firefox ie google-chrome ...

11835049

if the detailsview is in edit mode it will display a dropdownlist to let the user select from a list of items that come from a sqldatasource

11835076
maven	pom.xml
i am trying to write a java program that takes a maven pom.xml file as input and does following

11835107
folder	directory
the only different thing to be loaded depending if you are mobile or not would be the controllers directory all the rest of the application folder is fine for both versions

11835136
fadein	fadeout
you can try fadein and fadeout methods

11835151
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox don t care ie does

11835160
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that the css doesn t get interpreted by google-chrome or firefox but it works in internet explorer

11835181
versioning	upgrade
the major number tends to change only when there is something really earth shattering that means that going from the older major versioning to the newer major versioning is a significant upgrade effort

11835246
for-loop	loops
you can loops over that custom function and break when it returns empty you ll have to play and learn some syntax or at least i would but the syntax for a for-loop in mysql is here

11835258
pull	push
they each have a repository and there s a central repository they both push to and pull from

11835258
fast-forward	merge
so bob gets the error because he s trying to push something that requires a real merge not a fast-forward

11835273
int	double
for example if the client wants to send a string perhaps it would put str as the first three bytes of the message and if it s an int it s int or dbl for double and so on

11835303
ostringstream	std
a type-safe alternative with no concerns over buffer size would be to use io manipulators either on the output stream directly or on std ostringstream

11835321
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
you can use objectinputstream and objectoutputstream for read and write those objects

11835341
inherited	properties
if a specific properties is declared in the stylesheet for a given tag that value will not be inherited from the parent with the inline style

11835352
pop-up	dialog
well the timer will run as soon as the modal dialog pop-up

11835361
int	chars
it s not up to the socket to define the format of the message chars data -- strings int or other type of objects binary data etc

11835405
pop-up	dialog
based on my research and what public opinion is it seems like where the focus goes for a modal dialog pop-up would depend on the usecase

11835407
stdout	fflush
note that the c library may cache outputs so to make sure the data is output you need to call fflush stdout

11835409
google-chrome	firefox
finally remember that while the likes of browsershots can help you with css it can t check javascript with browsers such as ie7 having a big performance hit versus google-chrome or firefox especially with intensive graphics such as svg or manipulation using xpath selectors lacks native support

11835426
hide	show
some of selection input controls drop down list radio buttons check list etc in form will determine availability enable disabled or show or hide of next controls on form

11835427
int	chars
the arithmetic properties of chars pointers and unsigned int

11835474
cpu	processors
multicore refers to a computer or processors that has more than one logical cpu core and that can physically execute multiple instructions at the same time

11835474
cpu	processors
the only reason your cpu isnt running at 100 all the time is that the operating system knows how to suspend the processors which basically makes it stop everything and wait until something happens such as an io event or a clock tick

11835515
post	put
you have to put post method in partial view

11835531
clang	llvm
the llvm c compiler clang which also has a static analyser built into it like gcc spits out the two warnings by default

11835542
jqplot	highcharts
i personally think highcharts and jqplot are the best looking with adequate documentation

11835556
uiview	subviews
you can even add multiple opengl es views as subviews of a standard uiview

11835584
apache	nginx
i watched a screencast which explained how to setup capistrano and unicorn with nginx but also gave examples for apache

11835584
folder	directory
then when i run cap deploy the rails app is put into the releases folder and in a directory named by timestamp

11835614

changed cell.textlabel.text to show to hide

11835614
hide	show
i want to animate the cells when i click on the show hide button

11835650
width	height
in your first sentence you say fixed width but in the code you say height so i m not sure if this is what you re looking for

11835707
post	get
now the post works but i get this error

11835714
post	get
i guess you are new to c++ so i post corrected code here to unpuzzle you and get you going but please read a book on c++

11835782
bonjour	jmdns
also if i am using jmdns or bonjour there are call-backs for both servicefound and serviceresolved

11835805
accessor	properties
my only real challenge with ember so far is that accessor for objects and properties vary so much from situation to situation and there s no real documentation for that

11835839
stringbuilder	stringwriter
i also tried doing the stringbuilder stringwriter but no luck

11835897
put	get
your logic is sound the issue is that when you declare a char array of size 10 you don t actually get 10 spots to put characters in you only get nine

11835905
post	get
when i get back a dto class as part of a post request i can use automapper to map it onto my poco class and this works fine too

11835916
serializable	deserialization
actually you can configure mixins for serializable or deserialization or both of course

11835932
memcached	apc
instead look into apc memcached or redis as they allow you to store data directly in memory which is much faster to read and write

11836049
mouse	keyboard
i am using cgeventpost to programmatically post keyboard and mouse events

11836049
mouse	keyboard
since all keyboard and mouse events end up triggering actions that run on this thread this approach works just fine

11836062
client-side	server-side
call a server-side method from the client-side

11836065
portrait	landscape
i have previously tested this application on the kindle fire and both portrait and landscape mode worked on all screens but when i upload the application onto the nexus the application always stays in portrait

11836078
post	get
if i open two browsers window any browser enter the same query in both windows and post on both pages as fast as humanly possible i get unhandled exception in my web service

11836121
strcat	gets
so character array pointed to by filename is both returned from strcat and gets modified with concatenation result

11836126
onclick	onfocus
alternatively if you want the user to be able to change the selection after the initial click change the onclick attribute to an onfocus attribute

11836132
oncreate	setcontentview
my problem is that i have in my oncreate activity right after all variables initialization setcontentview r.layout.main

11836220
width	height
i ve found that by setting the width and height of the containing div will make the image larger but only with fixed pixels rather than 100 which is what i need

11836282
g++	gcc
tested on gcc g++ ubuntu 10.04

11836287
webclient	webrequest
i have tried every type of webrequest webclient combo to get round this but the timeout is immediate

11836289
implements	extends
i can t figure out how to extends but you can take advantage of the fact that arrays implements to do

11836341
for-loop	loops
if the while loops is inside a for-loop the while loops needs to be entirely done to loops back to the for-loop

11836341
for-loop	loops
try to use a for-loop inside a for-loop or insert some kind of counter in the while loops

11836342
put	get	post	get	post	put
get and post do work put is apparently not working

11836350
width	font-size	width	height
you need either to dynamicly resize de font-size or the div width height

11836362
width	height
still fittext makes its calculations based on the width of the container not the height

11836364
post	get
you would get the output of the almonds post that belongs to the other nuts parent category that s categorized in almonds

11836394
folder	directory
the thing is that when you load images from the assets directory the system doesn t apply any scaling or processiong whatsoever to your bitmaps instead when using the drawable folder android tries to scale your image according to your device s resolution

11836399
width	height
address x + y width + z height width + t length height width

11836399
width	height
data 0 0 0 0 and data 0 0 0 1 are width height length addresses part

11836403
gif	png
nothing fancier than that i ll put in something about ignoring gif jpg png adding www

11836409
width	height
i read some thread saying that the child of the tablerow not need to specify its width and height so i did it but the chart is not displayed

11836409
width	height
if i specify the linearlayout to be width fill_parent and height 200dp then the linearlylayout is only fill 1 3 of the tablerow

11836413
imperative	declarative
declarative sentences have a number of properties that distinguish them from imperative sentences

11836413
imperative	declarative
often we can convert from imperative to declarative by adding context

11836413
subtract	add
regarding monotonic declarations can add constraints which subtract possibilities

11836419
public	protected
the only reason php lets you call a non-static method using the static notation was for backwards compatibility in php 4 because php 4 didn t have the static modifier for functions or public protected private

11836420
mouse	trackpad
update just to be clear- neither when scrolling nor automatically based on mouse or trackpad options remove the problem for me

11836451
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
it works fine in google-chrome safari explorer and opera

11836506
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
would a higher range of floats be more accurate to multiplying divide add subtract than a lower range

11836558
printf	strcpy	strcpy	malloc
use the result of first strchr + 1 as the argument to a subsequent strchr and then malloc and strcpy or printf into

11836562
width	height
which will add it to the x y coordinates you specify with the size specified by your width height

11836587
asdoc	swc
my second question is about building fat swc files including the asdoc information

11836594
post	put
now i want to put the results also in a form so i can post it to the a database mysql

11836614
uiview	subviews
you want to create your nib and set it s main view to be an instance of your uiview subclass then load the nib in viewdidload of your viewcontroller and add the nib s views as subivews of your scrollview which i m assuming is a subviews of your viewcontroller s view

11836634
mp3	wav	mp3	ogg	wav	ogg
edit i should mention i also get this error if i try loading an mp3 or ogg file as well it doesn t just happen with a wav

11836637
width	height
the image in the background is width 300 height 200 and transparent area should be width 200 height 20 and right 0 bottom 50

11836638
min	max	aggregate-functions	sum
typically one would use group by clauses in conjunction with some aggregate-functions sum count max min etc. to derive some values related to the grouped fields

11836640
multiplication	exponent	division	multiplication	division	exponent
multiplication and division operate first on the normalized mantissa then on the exponent

11836640
subtraction	addition
addition and subtraction are of course another story

11836695
portrait	landscape
i m trying to make a navigation controller that when rotated to landscape pushes a new view onto the stack and when rotated back to portrait it pops that view

11836695
portrait	landscape
so far i can get the landscape view displayed but the only when i can get the portrait back by pushing that view controller again onto the stack

11836748
put	get
i am able to do put get using ipaddr port using my firefox client

11836751
hide	show
my div container just hide and show but dont do the awesome jquery animation

11836790
inherited	properties
i ve some classes a b c they all inherited from class baseclass and each adds a new properties that is not found in baseclass

11836790
inherited	properties
lets say baseclass had a properties name which a should inherited i get an error that name could not be found

11836824
portrait	landscape
however if it is taken in portrait mode it is rotated 90 degrees and if i take it in landscape mode it is rotated 180 degrees

11836839
inherited	subclassing
all of these view controllers inherited from a custom subclassing of uiviewcontroller i created called gamecontroller.

11836839
superclass	subclassing
my problem is when i open each level on my test device gamecontroller s viewdidload is getting called before the init or viewdidload methods of my subclassing controllers and so none of my level images values are getting assigned to the superclass properties

11836852
width	height
you can then remove the height config on you image as the layout make the inner item fit the whole height and width automatically

11836889
outputstream	inputstream
i saw this most efficient way to create inputstream from outputstream but i am not sure if this is the best route to go.

11836904
google-chrome	firefox
there are also a number of developer tools available to help with this type of thing such as the rest console app for google-chrome or the restclient add-in for firefox

11836929
jpql	hql
you can most definitely use any type of database-specific function you wish with hibernate hql and jpql as long as hibernate is the provider

11836936
int	chars
i have tried making the list column chars varchar and int all have not helped

11836949
children	parent
by using position absolute throughout your fiddle you are removing the child elements from the flow of the dom and interfering with the ability of the parent element to incrementally hide its children

11836964
for-loop	loops
now i d like to have some kind of loops i m guessing it s a for-loop but i m not entirely sure so that after a function has been completed it ll return to the top so the user can enter a new function number and do a different equation

11836977
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in google-chrome but not ie and firefox

11836982
for-loop	loops
the text box does not update because the program is tied up inside the for-loop and thus never gets back to qt s event loops to redraw the widget

11836984
width	height
when you change the width and you haven t defined the height yet the browser automatically keeps the proportion between them so the height will also be 110 and 90

11836986
puts	fflush
2 user changes product and puts product to invalid state remember that invalid state is still acceptable for object unless we decide to fflush it to database

11837030
qevent	qmainwindow
for example the missing reference to qmainwindow event qevent mentioned above becomes

11837113
post	get
answering an old post since someone might get this page from a search engine

11837150
fileoutputstream	bytearrayinputstream
just replace fileoutputstream to bytearrayinputstream vice versa

11837229
dictionary	map
i did consider the following but not sure if there is a way to disk map the dictionary and without using a lot of memory except during dictionary creation

11837239
sorting	filtering
but if you need to update new products every so often or if you want to add features like filtering search sorting etc. than having a database is the way to go

11837241
google-chrome	firefox
i m currently working on a flash game and at least on my machine the audio seems to lag by a fraction of a second in google-chrome but not in ie or firefox

11837241
google-chrome	firefox
the audio is delayed in google-chrome but not firefox or ie

11837267
floating-point	integer
that code was written to accept either integer or floating-point weights.

11837294
mathml	mathjax
the upshot seems to be that in order to guarantee decent rendering of mathml you need your users to install either mathjax stix or asana math fonts

11837366
submit	submission
finally i realized that there are two submit buttons so i tried passing the name parameter when submission the form

11837368
width	height
the rotation is straight-forward but on resizing the height and width dimensions are reversed

11837397
min	max
obviously this doesn t work as this does not allow you to pass in variable which in the case below is min and max

11837436
min	max
mixing of group columns min max count ... with no group columns is illegal if there is no group by clause

11837442
google-chrome	firefox
i m using firefox and google-chrome

11837447
put	get
when i put the same function in a class however i get an error

11837460
min	max
when you are using a column in count min max avg aggregation functions you have to mention that column in group by clause like this

11837489
width	height
by definition gridlayout forces all elements to be the same height and width -- ie

11837505
bufferedoutputstream	bufferedinputstream
and yes it s really recommended to use buffered clases like bufferedinputstream and bufferedoutputstream

11837515
ubuntu	linux
this script worls fine on ubuntu linux

11837526
google-chrome	firefox
i am using firefox 14.0.1 stable on ubuntu 12.04 and google-chrome works fine

11837599
setcontentview	findviewbyid
you call findviewbyid before even you have any views a call to setcontentview

11837600
int	chars
int main int argc chars const argv

11837605
pull	push
in order to interact with remote repositories via git the git directories need to be added to the remote machine s windows path environmental variable this should be done for any windows machine running git and needing to clone push or pull

11837607
min	max
note that and are corresponding to max min

11837636
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade fos userbundle with composer from 1.2 to the latest versioning 2.0 and followed the instruction to delete the propel_user_class definition in the app config config.yml file as indicated in the upgrade.md file

11837677
rss	feed
i m working on an android rss feed reader

11837709
int	chars
however unlike all the other conversion specifications the n conversion specification is an output operation that takes a pointer to an int and it is used to find out how many chars have been written up to that point in the format string

11837757
ubuntu	debian
as the wiki page says on some versions of debian or ubuntu you can do this with

11837774
for-loop	arrays
as for output use a for-loop or foreach look to go over the elements of your arrays and print them

11837853
memcached	apc
everything from apc to memcached to polling a file will all likely put less load on the server than having the client set up and tear down a connection every second

11837867
put	get	post	get	post	put
if you are using this to get html code using a ajax get or post method then i would go with the first one because anything that is echoed from the php file is put into a variable that you can use

11837872
inherited	subclassing
another solution with mono inherited could be to subclassing the kinetic.rect class using the extend method and overload the shapetype attribute which will become the key for your filtering

11837874
width	height
also set the height and width of the sidebar div

11837908
bindparam	bindvalue
you need to use bindvalue instead of bindparam

11837921
uiview	uipangesturerecognizer
i am currently holding 3 uilabels inside a master uiview object which is attached to a uipangesturerecognizer

11837922
int	chars
if its a number an int then look it up in the letter number mapping print the chars

11837934
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
at the application delegate level create another uiview or uiviewcontroller that manages both the uinavigationcontroller s view and some other view that displays what ever it is you want displayed above the uinavigationbar

11837973
put	get
to get the full picture of the test you now have to mentally put all these pieces back together

11838006
subtract	add
your event handlers for the add and subtract buttons are inline and very simply only increment or decrement the number in the hourvalue box there is no code to change the class of the same relevant number .spanval element

11838037
children	parent
as another possibility if the bst is stored as a 1-dimensional array instead of with pointers between nodes you can simply walk over the array and do the math to determine each node s parent and children

11838042
getter	setter
in case anyone is wondering this is done so that freemarker can access public properties on objects without needed getter and setter

11838063
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i originally had everything in plain html and all the pages showed just fine in google-chrome firefox ie and safari

11838063
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
thinking that the pages will grow and it d be good to put the header navigation and footer in include files i did that without much trouble and everything was going well while testing in google-chrome firefox and safari

11838063
post	put
let me know and i ll put it all here in this post

11838118
portrait	landscape
there is a image control in my page which support the landscape and portrait layout

11838140

within control s constructor control property-values are still not valid location height width text etc...

11838142
jobs	cron
if your on a webhost they often use the cpanel system which has cron jobs build in

11838142
jobs	cron
go to the menu or search for cron jobs and add one

11838183
integer	unsigned
date is the json representation of a 64 bit signed integer for milliseconds since epoch unsigned before version 1.9.1

11838184
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome the text is displayed next to the image icon

11838184
google-chrome	firefox
however that will break the styles for firefox and google-chrome

11838184
google-chrome	firefox
so you will have to add some smarts to make the design work for ie 7 and google-chrome firefox

11838205
subtract	add
you never bound anything to the add and subtract links

11838213
uptime	reboot
from my reading of the documentation the uptime clock only gets reset when the device is reboot

11838219
centos	linux
in mac osx and in linux centos i insert a new system environment variable myapp using .bashrc .bash_profile

11838254

as you can see from the screen print the region increases in width but if i increase the height it adds it below the region s border which is the aqua color

11841536
for-loop	loops
you could solve this by using a for-loop be careful the length of loops might change due to the removal of elements

width	height
one suggestion is this that you check out the dimensions of you image in the folder and define the size accordingly in height and width

11841863
free	malloc
ditto for malloc free as opposed to new delete and many other aspects

11841865
qobject	qwidget
my main problem is that any implementation that i could think of i mainly thought about implementing it with signals and slots will require the refreshable interface to inherit from qobject so some meta-data will be stored and i ll be able to use signal and slots and this means that widgets will not be able to derive from refreshable because they already inherit qobject via qwidget

11841912

11842554
post	get
my answer is if you call any specific post in html which is obviously admin manageable there are lots of chances that same post can get deleted by mistake then the above code will not work as the post id could not be retrieved so we basically make a category and add the post in it

11842567
qobject	qwidget
and yes you are right on the observation that you can t inherit from qwidget and yet another interface which must inherit from qobject too in order to be able to declare a slot

11842572
width	height
this is potentially possible if you measure the screen width and height and use the functions in in the view class to figure out the specifics of that particular view and its children

getter	setter
apparently this naming inconsistency and another a getter returning a primitive but the setter only accepting objects was apparent by chance for older xml-compilers due to some inconsistency in the specification

11856279
implements	extends
if your class has constructor arguments that do not directly map to properties with getter methods and or there are other complexities to restoring object state you can generally work around these by extends persistencedelegate and implements the necessary behaviour yourself

int	chars
looking at glubyte s typedef we see that it s actually unsigned chars which means that it takes int values from 0 to 255

viewdidload	viewwillappear
a neater solution would be to add your label view in viewdidload and only alter the position of that already existing view in viewwillappear

11856472
hive	hdfs
it looks to me like hdfs and flume might be obvious choices i would look into either hbase or hive depending on what kinds of analysis you are interested in how flexible you are in organizing the data

11856472
hive	hdfs
bulk would probably be a mapreduce job on hdfs where piece-by-piece could be managed through hbase column-family values or hive rows

to upgrade the versioning you can either create a java library artifact for newer neethi library and include it in the car file and deploy the car file or copy the new neethi library to location while the server is running

11856660
versioning	upgrade
so imo the bottom line is you will face some issues with the versioning upgrade

11856804
packets	multicast
allows an application to receive wifi multicast packets

11856804
packets	multicast
acquring a multicastlock will cause the stack to receive packets addressed to multicast addresses

11856804
packets	multicast
i suspect the term multicast may be in reference to layer 3 as opposed to layer 2 broadcast but because the class overview states allows an application to receive wifi multicast packets i m a little uncertain and would like some clarification

short	base
unfortunately there s little that you can do short of getting the api docs from the oem good luck with that and updating the code base for that specific driver

11857129
getter	setter
actually it is impossible to have out parameters in java but you can make a work around making the method take on a de-reference for the immutable string and primitives by either writing a generic class where the immutable is the generic with the value and setter and getter or by using an array where element 0 1 in length is the value provided it is instantiate first because there are situations where you need to return more than one value where having to write a class just to return them where the class is only used there is just a waste of text and not really re-usable

11857129
int	boolean
a way to do this in java would be boolean validate_index int index int arr_len int rem1

you could prevent direct reference to the object by creating a proxy to access it unfortunately javascript doesn t support dynamic getter and setter also called catch-alls very well on some browseres you might achieve it though see this so question so you can t easily redirect all field and method which are just fields anyway accesses to the underlying object especially if the underlying object has many fields added to it and removed from it dynamically

i m reaching now but some other approaches i ve thought of include 1 providing a custom serializable deserialization for items with an encodedattribute 2 implementing my own static tripledes single-block encryptor with no instance initialization overhead 3 against my preferences passing an externally-initialized encryptor into the constructor for each item 4 implementing an iencryptable interface and re-enumerating the items after the results are populated 5 perform all encryption external to the viewmodel implemented everywhere the viewmodel is used

11866118

then using jquery depending on whether you are in edit mode or create mode you can hide or show the elements based on the value of the data- attribute of the option

stdout	stderr
windows command-line programs use the main entry point and output the stdout and stderr file handles via the printf statements to the console window

11866124
stdout	stderr
windows gui programs use the winmain entry point and does not set up the stdout and stderr file handles to go to a console window as they do not initialize a console window to output to which is why you do not see the output from the printf statements

11866124

11866312
prepare	execute
then execute first the prepare goal

11866354

the easiest way to post data from javascript and move the page to the results rather than using ajax to do so without changing the page is to put that information into a form and then submit it

if you open it up in google-chrome and firefox or ie you ll notice i m having some trouble getting the lis to correctly line up with the nav bar

joptionpane	jdialog
consider using a joptionpane or a modal jdialog for displaying a blocking window that stops the main program until the dialog has been dealt with

11866413
hide	show
the link s click event should call a jquery that calls a method to toggle hide and show for elements in matching the class

numeric sorting double int on every column with numbers

11866447

11866498
addclass	removeclass
i typically use jquery s addclass and removeclass accordingly

11866498
hide	show
jsfiddle example 2 - after using the show and hide functions it will not properly hide the div using the css class

11866505
width	height
so to do this you just copy the width height pins etc.. and then step through all the glues in the original shape and move the glues to the new shape

11866555
client-side	server-side
in short there is no footprint available server-side that tells you anything about what client-side method was used to change an attribute

11866586
hide	show
i have done this also a lot - my solution was to not use the hide show at all and simply create a hidden css class and toggle that or add remove as you have done

11866629
hide	show
its because jquery hide show puts an inline display property to hide or show the div

11866629
hide	show
you can use .css display to clean the div after using hide show

11866646
hide	show
additionally i would recommend sticking with one way to show hide stuff your own or jquery

11866646
hide	show
use jquery show hide for all showing hiding but you can still add a class for tracking just don t have that class hide your elements

11866656
ubuntu	debian
then exit the console and reconfigure the system time zone debian ubuntu sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata

with the help of live http headers or some browser plugins similar you can grab the get or post request and parse the response web page and try to emulate human behavior and try to get some similar result

11866835
post	get
emulating post and get request is the most clean way i think

11866891

firefox doesn t seem to support running javascripts but in safari you might use a script like this to get the urls of all links

11867302
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in google-chrome firefox because they auto-correct your html code

11867302
width	height
your css code is missing something is an inline element so height en width will not work unless you make it a block element

11867411
sorting	filtering
the strange part comes when i try to add filtering or sorting

11867480
spaces	delimiter
in your example it looks like each subfield is delimiter by a pair of spaces and a pipe character between them and if that s the case make sure that you either create rules to let you escape that delimiter as needed or make sure that the frontend never passes the delimiter to the database

11867509
updatepanel	scriptmanager
at best the scriptmanager will perform a response.clear to wipe out your response.writes at worst you ll break the updatepanel protocol body and you ll get a javascript error

11867557
uilabel	uitextview
from pulling an uiimage from a uitextview or uilabel gives white image

11867606
post	get
xhr-polling means that your server will be waiting for 10 seconds on any get of post received that it does not have an answer before answering instead of sending back an empty response

11867606
nodejitsu	heroku
i personally use xhr-polling as a fallback option from websockets in an application on nodejitsu another node hosting like heroku and it is working fine

11867606
post	get
there is no new connection that is created on every new polling it is just a way that only one get or post is sent to the server every 10 seconds instead of having to poll the server every .5 seconds to have a real-time application

11867668

11867888
for-loop	arrays
i am splitting the arrays in chunks of 500 and using settimeout instead of for-loop

11867897

kerberos	ntlm
ntlm is not like kerberos where there s a signed token that a service can validate on its own

11867975

i have 3 pages that uses the same files the images and it is too expensive to load the images at each page s ready section so i was thinking about loading the images to an array or list with the getfilesasync method when the app starts up and then making it public with the winjs.namespace.define

11868135
children	parent
if you have another element inside parent you can use this technique to make one of the children full height

this is not the right way to do it because it doesn t select the max rank of each book

11868166

11868167
hash	md5
converting a hexadecimal value that represents a hash value md5 or

11868661
post	put
forms editing existing resources use put forms creating a new resource use post

11868665
post	put
another alternative to consider is that if you do a put rather than post that will overwrite the existing data rather than appending to it

11868696
pull	push
you can find all the basic commands like commit update merge push pull etc

11868699
post	put
if user is a new record post is used and the button label becomes create user otherwise put is used and the label becomes update user

11868713
post	put
now consider a similar case to the above but for an action such as create or update - things activated by simulated put or actual post requests

11868717
union	distinct
the union clause can be faster because it will return distinct records at once duplicated records won t be returned otherwise you will need to do it in the application

11868717
union	distinct
you can mix union all and union distinct in the same query

11868717
union	distinct
types are treated such that a distinct union overrides any all union

union	distinct
a distinct union can be produced explicitly by using

11868717
union	distinct

cout	cin
read the user input inside the main the part where you use cin and cout

11869363
int	boolean
it is not necessary to always return primitive types such as string int boolean

11869370
google-chrome	safari
pretty silly but at least it works and in both google-chrome and safari

11869376
folder	directory
with the file will be searched in the directory where the file which includes something is located if the include isn t found the compiler will look in the standart include directory it s compiler dependent in which folder this is

11869415
oncreate	onstart
you probably is calling this at oncreate or onstart or onresume methods which runs before layout measure

11869431
google-chrome	firefox
now i have created a test case which i want to run it on ie firefox and google-chrome at the same time

11869431
google-chrome	firefox
i already set up the grid with a hub and three remote controls firefox port 5556 ie port 5557 and google-chrome port 5558

11869434
width	height
you set them based on the width height of the mainmenu sprite

11869434
width	height
but that sprite has no children yet the child is added on the next line so the width height are still 0

11869437
floating-point	fractions
ieee 754 floating-point numbers are represented by a sign +1 or -1 encoded as 0 or 1 an exponent for double-precision -1022 to 1023 encoded as the exponent plus 1023 so 1 to 2046 and a significand for double-precision a fractions usually from 1 to just under 2 represented with 53 bits but encoded with 52 bits because the first bit is implicitly 1

11869437
hex	binary
e.g. the number 6.5 is encoded with the bits 0 sign +1 10000000001 exponent 2 and 1010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 binary fraction 1.1010 hex 1.a decimal 1.3125

11869437
floating-point	fractions
we can write this in hexadecimal floating-point as 0x1.ap2 hex fractions 1.a multiplied by 2 to the power of decimal 2

11869437
range	infinity
when numbers are in the normal range not underflowing to denormals and not overflowing to infinity then there are no differences in the significands of numbers with different exponents so

11869477
google-chrome	firefox
when i open the html in firefox and google-chrome the information is displayed correctly the xxx.php file contains a simple mysql query but it does not work with ie

11869495
puts	gets
the method i m having problems with gets two foxpro tables and puts them in datasets

11869500
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in google-chrome and firefox but as expected not in internet explorer

11869508
for-loop	loops
instead of a while loops i would recommend a for-loop

11869534
int	chars
you re adding chars together - which will give you an int value

11869589
hash	md5
if you just want to md5 hash a simple string i found this works for me

11869609
postgresql	mysql
if you are looking to mix and match some tables in mysql and some tables in postgresql vs

11869609
postgresql	mysql
a single database that could be either mysql or postgresql i ve been working on an orm called orb that focuses more on object-oriented design and allows for multiple databases and relationships between databases

11869609
postgresql	mysql
right now it only supports postgresql and mongo just cause i haven t needed mysql but i d be up for writing that backend

11869634
innodb	myisam
method #2 use innodb instead of myisam

11869639
for-loop	loops
you should use a for-loop rather than a while loops with an incrementing variable

11869659
profiling	debugging
when i debugging and f10 on just the linq query not the return i get this output in sql profiling

11869721
width	height

11869730
subclipse	visualsvn
what i ended up doing was to delete all the svn files on my hard drive deleting subclipse tortise silksvn and then reinstalling visualsvn using the instructions here

11869730
subclipse	visualsvn
i installed subclipse first then installed visualsvn which worked for me and avoided all the configuration steps i had to do with other svn packages that were referenced in the original tutorial

11869749
pow	sqrt
if you assume a wrong gamma value of 2.0 you can calculate it with a sqrt which may be faster then even the built in method that behind the screens does most likely something like pow frag.rgb 1.0 2.2

11869833
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
but my solution works great on ie9 when running it in the standalone browser also in google-chrome opera safari but not when running it in eclipse

11869874
width	height
you probably need to assign a height and width to the image

11869889
onchange	onkeyup
the onchange event only fires after the textbox loses focus so i suggest the onkeyup event

11869897
setinterval	settimeout
for example i redefined setinterval and settimeout functions to track how many timeouts intervals are active and now i relized that i wont be able to use them outside of the file the engine is in

google-chrome	safari
i ve tested in ff14 google-chrome 21 safari 5 windows and safari mac and webkit browsers on android and iphone

11869902

as you can see in the screens firefox sees the cookie headers and sets them appropriately but opera does not

11869992
post	get
i ve scoured what seems like every post on here but i can t seem to get any further in finding a solution

11870002
pbkdf2	salt
winrar uses a good kdf pbkdf2 which includes a salt

it works fine in firefox google-chrome but in ie8 and below the image just doesn t show up

11870093
fseek	fread
in order to jump around this file i m using fseek then fread to return what i need into the structures i m using the problem being that when i read from the file in loadtile the structure gametile8file gtf is full of what appears to be junk data

11870093
fseek	fread
i m checking the return values on fseek fread and fwrite and all are saying there isn t a problem

11870096
postgresql	mysql
sqlalchemy will then compile the statements to mysql or postgresql and connect to the appropriate database

11870096

most higher level db modules in the python universe are still recommending mysql-python and psycopg - both of which are not pure-python and compile link configure against the installed database

11870129
for-loop	arrays
i m having an issue when i set my arrays which is defined as a for-loop within my html equal to and it doesn t pick up on it

11870176
postgresql	mysql
it will work with most database types and certainly does work with postgresql and mysql

11870180
hide	show
you could create a div that was the size of the html give it a z-index very high after that you hide or show this div when you want to block or show the page

11870199
postgresql	mysql
if you aren t wedded to mysql i would urge you to consider using postgresql which is basically a much better database all round

11870205
stdout	stderr
one problem i experienced with trying the proc reliable route is that it seems to have after effects on stdout and stderr and i would need to fix those after each call to run

11870205
stdout	stderr
i am running in parallel and any change to stdout and stderr effect all of the threads using windows at least

11870205
stdout	stderr
io captureoutput has the same issue for me but it tries to correct the stdout and stderr jumbling internally and causes the following error to occur

couchbase	couchdb
couchbase puts memcached in front of couchdb with another subsystem for clustering support

11870286
pull	push
you can also build a simple comet server to do a push pull type thing when ever updates are pushed down from the server

11870308
put	get
but when i put in the url i get the following server error

11870347
move	drag
now whilst you still get the same problem if you drag 4 upwards if you touch 2 and move back down into the gap nothing is highlighted so it will sort correctly

11870384
google-chrome	firefox
the first error comes when loading the page in google-chrome and the second comes when loading in firefox

11870441
fink	homebrew	fink	macports	macports	homebrew
i already removed fink and macports und installed homebrew

11870443

jlabel	jlayeredpane
the above adds the jlabel component lbl to the jdesktoppane which is a jlayeredpane with the specified layer of 50

11870526
width	height
for a fancier approach but one requiring more work you can use a 1d list and compute the index using the 2d coordinates along with the table s height and width

11870529

do i need to convert it to ogg webm mp4

11870529

11870743
for-loop	loops
in my current project i stumbled upon a weird phenomenon where a nested for-loop would only execute the inner loops once and then simply stop

11870743
g++	gcc
the source code provided was compiled with gcc g++ 4.5.3 without any special optimization flags

11870747
width	height
simply specifying max min-prefixed attributes is not enough you should add specific height and width settings only then fluttering disappears

11870777
put	get
this therefore allows any size of stuff to get put into the queues so that the limit you found does not get in the way

11870787

11870807
fadein	fadeout
here you ve to make the fadein within the fadeout callback function so that fadein will happen just after fadeout

11870835
kerberos	ldap
what i really was looking for turned out to be packag krb5-server-ldap this is where the ldap schemas for kerberos are stored.but what i especially want to mention is the brilliant stuff about kerberos ldap nfs in this blog kerberos+ldap as backend .i would recommend everyone looking for kerberos 5 plus ldap information to read this material.it has saved me hour of work.very precise and right on target

i was setting it for the get post requests

11870899
post	get
now when i hit the endpoint a.foo.com api with the request method options get post i get the following headers

11870919
memcached	apc
there s possibly a better solution for what you re doing like memcached or apc fetch store but i have run into similar circumstances that largely benefited from the including stuff for instance tweaking smarty templates to be included rather than eval d worked amazingly

11870977
apache	nginx
it will add some overhead to serving the files though as a full symfony2 request will need to take place whereas serving files straight over apache or nginx won t have the overhead of the framework stack

11870987
minimum	max
i m simply checking the values of two input textboxes and alerting the user if the max price is less than the minimum price but they re evaluating backwards

11871004
put	get
if a malicious user manages to get change the password no mechanism you put in place will stop them

11871032
queue	fifo
since you know the maximum size of the fifo i guess it s something like n+1 2 but you would need to double check this you can use a ring buffer to hold the queue ranges

11871071
post	get
i would like to return the object after the post http post or get request

11871071
post	get
i read some article about performing an http get and post request but i still cannot figure it out

11871072
post	get
i was trying to use the .getjson jquery function in a previous post i made however i couldn t get the browser to parse the json response accordingly i m thinking because the json response is in a remote server

this is happening on firefox as well as google-chrome

11871301
google-chrome	firefox
i don t know yet what causes this but it is the same with firefox and google-chrome

11871319
min	max
it s likely that tm2 is a value that is larger than the max int32 value or lower than the min int32 value...i would add a check something like.

i am running into an issue when attempting to put the image from the tumblr body into my website as a separate entity from the actual text post for styling css purposes

if not you need an image that s half the height width

11871677
for-loop	arrays
if you want to be more efficient simply walk through the arrays checking the group condition within a for-loop

if you just want to have reasonable scripting language not necessarily looking as the example try ironruby ironpython or even javascript or c# namespace compilerservices allows you to compile code on the fly then load it possibly in separate appdomain to be able to unload it afterwards and run

11872511
multiplication	modulo
note the uint32_t s as opposed to int s - they make sure the multiplication overflows modulo 2 32 as it is supposed to do if you choose 32 as the word size

11872511
fixed-point	fractions
calculating ak w gives a fixed-point result with the format q32.32 the mod 1 step takes only the 32 fractions bits

11872511
integer	fractions
of course when multiplied by m all the fractions bits become integer bits because of how m was chosen and so it simplifies to just a plain old modular multiplication

11872573
hex	binary
alright so first things first you need to convert that hex array into integer then to binary

11872582
hex	binary
now we split the string convert each byte from hex string to int then convert it to binary string then take away the 0b with add zeroes at the beginning so the sequence exactly 8 long

primes	catalan
the problem is to find the n-th catalan number mod m where m is not primes

11873334
primes	catalan
use catalan formula again it wasn t fast enough due to the ncr function can t speed up using exponentiation squaring because m is not primes

11873365
width	height
by changing the width and height of the subview the 3rd and 4th parameters to cgrectmake the subview becomes large enough to contain the square being drawn

i have come up with a very simple method of achieving this but was wondering if anyone could point me towards any literature or such that could help me get a better idea of how other examples have been put together

11873955
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
if you are under ubuntu debian linux you can get this logs here

11873972
google-chrome	firefox
i found there are a lot of registry keys that firefox and google-chrome change when each sets itself as the default browser

11873972
opera	safari
i believe safari and opera are both similar in behavior

11873996

11874132
mouseleave	mouseenter
i am relatively new to jquery and i seem to be stuck with this mouseenter mouseleave problem

11874132
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine when the page first loads in firefox and google-chrome and i haven t scrolled yet but after scrolling down and back to the top the menu will hide on mouseleave

11874132
mouseleave	mouseenter
some of the other methods i tried was to pass the b variable to another function create a seperate div and track it s position to determine whether or not to use the mouseenter mouseleave and finally to bind them but none of this seemed to work as i thought it should

11874157
stdout	stderr
either use err.printstacktrace system.out if you really want the output on stdout instead of stderr or err.printstacktrace

11874159
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it is supported in opera ie safari firefox and google-chrome

you just forgot that the span is an inline element wich can not have a floet width an height applied to it

11874261
serializable	deserialization
after having looked through many different sites i have found that using the c# xml serializable deserialization method to pull defaults from the schema is not possible if the schema has to be dynamic meaning that the object being deserialized can have different defaults in different schemas

11874265
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox but in both ie and google-chrome nothing happens

11874268
ubuntu	linux
it s included in the ubuntu repos and probably other linux distros and the website has ports for windows mac

11874292
multiplication	modulo	division	modulo	division	multiplication
the key is that modulo multiplication decomposes but division doesn t so one first must reduce the fraction as follows

11874292
multiplying	modulo
now use modulo arithmetic to multiplying together the non-cancelled factors

11874316
width	height
to adjust the position i need the width and height of the popup

11874316
width	height
the problem is that outerwidth and outerheight do fail actually because since i use the animated version of show the retrieved height and width are minimal

11874320
mouseleave	mouseenter
you weren t accounting for the scrolled status of the page so the mouseenter mouseleave events were regardless of whether the page was scrolled resetting the class-names without regard

11874320
mouseleave	mouseenter
the result of this is that if the page is un-scrolled the mouseenter mouseleave events do nothing because they shouldn t the normal class-name is correct in this case whereas if the page is scrolled they remove the scroll class-name on mouseenter and restore it on mouseleave

11874322
mouseleave	mouseenter
here you simply add the variable isontop and the mouseenter and mouseleave handlers check it before they do anything

11874324

11874404
domxpath	domdocument
use domdocument and domxpath

11874420
getter	setter
just like getter and setter methods in java

11874423
post	get
i am guessing that it has something to do with my get and post functions being improperly formatted but am not sure how to proceed

11874430
getter	setter
properties can have side-effects they provide syntactic sugar around getter and setter methods

11874439
getter	setter
he s saying that properties can provide a getter but not a setter therefore making them read-only for example

11874439
getter	setter
this means that property setter getter can apply logic that a mere public field can t

11874494
g++	gcc
my gcc and g++ version

11874498
getter	setter
as others have posted you can also put logic into your getter and setter

11874505
put	get
once that s done use insertbefore to put the list where the table was and finally use removechild to get rid of the table

11874525

11874654
width	height
wrap your iframe in a be sure to specify the width height less than the iframe width height

11874674
for-loop	arrays
the naive way to do it is to wait until the arrays are filled then merge with a for-loop

11874674
for-loop	arrays
what i want to do is move the logic from the for-loop into the callbacks because if you run the for-loop right away the arrays won t be done downloading through the callbacks yet

11874692
google-chrome	firefox
to add features to the gmail ui you d probably have to implement this as a google-chrome extension and or firefox or ie extension to support those browsers

11874695
for-loop	loops
your code never gets to the body of the for-loop because the condition is already false before it starts loops

11874759
put	get
if you put p.total last you will get wrong answers because miles totalmiles will be converted to an integer

11874827
jar	war

11874842
google-chrome	firefox
this seems to be isolated to google-chrome and firefox only

11874874
children	parent
and if i may add a last comment it s generally a good idea to choose the parent widget as callbackelement so you don t risk to forget to add elements when you begin to have lots of them all children are automatically included in the parent

11874926
google-chrome	firefox
so whereas for a box 4x high with an image 2x high firefox gives me the correct top 1x google-chrome gives me top 2x

switching	screens
i m guessing you want your screens to switching to another layout when the button is clicked

11875425
put	get
it seems you want to do some sort of where did the user touched in a place if i was you i would get a uiview for example which is my complete touchable area and just add the rest of the elements there you can put them wherever you want they can even overlap or anything just make sure the superview is the one receiving the touches and do some math to see which one was the closest to the elements center

11875427

width	height
this should fit the image to the height of the gridview maintaining the aspect ratio and crop the remaining width unless the image s width is smaller than that of the gridview when the height is matched

11875616
width	height
if you have a gridview that is 400dp in width and 800dp in height

11875616
width	height
an image of 600 x 600 will fit the height and then crop the remaining width

11875616
width	height
if however the gridview was landscape 400dp in width and 300dp in height then a 600 x 600 image would fit the width and then crop the height

11875616
width	height
if you only ever want it to fit the height assuming that the height might change programmatically or due to different device s screens i would suggest making the image considerably wider so that even when presented with a gridview with a very wide aspect ratio it will choose to fit the height and crop the width

11875617
google-chrome	firefox
now i still having a problem this solves the problem with google-chrome firefox etc

then used a viewflipper to switching screens similar to the code given here

11876026
inherited	properties
the only real option i can think of is stashing addeventlistener and removeeventlistener into other properties of window.prototype i m only assuming that s where all other add removeeventlisteners inherited from then overriding the originals so you can attach ids to event-bound elements for tracking what has or hasn t been removed yet and passing the eventlistener arguments on to your alternates and passing args and firing your alternates after you do your id attaching detaching tracking voodoo

11886770
innodb	myisam
then the first suspect is that your tables are using the myisam engine instead of the innodb engine

11886770
innodb	myisam
myisam doesn t enforce foreign key constraints but innodb does. the output from

11886770
innodb	myisam
to change the engine for a table from myisam to innodb

11886770
innodb	myisam
it basically needs to create a new innodb table and copy all of the data from the myisam table

11886811
ostringstream	std
in order to create formatted text with inserted textual value presentations you can use a std ostringstream from the header like this

11886837
stdout	stderr
the posix.1-2008 specification of tee 1 requires that output is unbuffered not even line-buffered so in this case it is possible that stdout and stderr could end up on the same line of foo.log

11886837
stdout	stderr
if you want the stdout lines cleanly separated from the stderr lines consider using two log files possibly with date stamp prefixes on each line to allow chronological reassembly later on

11886849
instances	transient
i was trying to declare instances of springlayout that were local to the constructor as transient

the pc code uses directinput and windows messages to generate keyboard and mouse events that the game understands

11887304
mouse	keyboard	post	get
using the information in the post here using iohidmanager to get modifier key events i managed to get keyboard input working but have so far been unable to extend the example code to generate mouse events as well

11887304
mouse	keyboard
if i can t get this working then i guess i can move over to cocoa event handling but the pc code also has some keyboard and mouse polling that i was hoping to implement as well and i m not sure that cocoa supports polling keyboard state - although i will be happy to be corrected

11887308
post	get
get or post by anonymous user should redirect to login page

11887308
post	get
get or post by logged-in user with no profile should raise a userprofile.doesnotexist exception

11887336

this approach can be made more robust by using re.split instead of str.split and by filtering out potential empty grouping resulting from four or more consecutive line breaks

11887339
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
the text file is rendered correctly in firefox and shown in tabular format but is shown as plain text in google-chrome and opera

11887340
width	height
with my current layout whether i use fill_parent or match_parent it seems to be setting the width and height to wrap_content

11887356
post	get
you should then have access to post- id to get the id of the current post

11887357
put	get
of course if you get the data and then put it back in the db again it will result in a total mayhem of coding and decoding

it s a common issue with ieee floating point representation which store approximations of decimal values

11887636
eventlet	gevent
reading gunicorn s documentation a bit further and reading a bit more about eventlet and gevent i think that gunicorn answers my question perfectly

11887636
eventlet	gevent
so the solution is to change the default worker type from synchronous to asynchronous choosing eventlet or gevent here s a comparison

11887636
eventlet	gevent
i was wondering how i should change my existing code but apparently the standard python modules are monkey-patched by gunicorn upon startup actually by eventlet or gevent so all existing code can run without change and still behave nicely with other threads

11887651
ubuntu	linux
m using linux ubuntu and g++ compiler

11887760
put	get
if i put a simple echo in my load more script the jquery success function shows an alert to say it worked but if i start doing wordpress stuff i get an internal server error this is the code in the load-more.php file

the charts are working ok in most browsers including firefox and opera

11887803
folder	dir
locate your .md content in your _posts folder sub dir is fine and then call your content with something like

11887815

then before submission your form you can perform another check and if that returns true as well submit the form

11888047
nexus	artifactory
i have nexus as local repository manager and have a couple of proxied repositories to remote repositories managed by artifactory

11888087
post	get
the new post type will also get its own special section of the site layout

11888093
int	chars
and that means an index on the int column isn t going to help even for a like predicate that has leading chars

11888136
rvm	bundler
with rvm rbenv and bundler there should be no reason why you can t deploy different versions of rails on the same server if that is even the issue

11888141
coalesce	isnull
aaron bertrand compared coalesce with isnull and found no significant performance difference between the two

11888146
superclass	subclassing
if i create the criteria based on superclass.class it works but a need to add restrictions that apply to both the superclass and the subclassing and this code is actually buried under a whole lot of other stuff

11888262
dictionary	map
one approach is to create a dictionary or hash table to map string names to objects to sort of achieve what you want

11888275
folder	directory
teamcity is changing the local temp directory environment variable to reference the agent s temp folder

11888327
screens	tablet
to me it s pretty obvious why someone would want a version of an app for small phone screens and another larger tablet screens

11888327
screens	tablet
at the same time you wouldn t want those fat buttons designed for mobile screens showing on a nice 10 tablet

11888382
int	chars
you are storing numbers as int but querying then as chars the like operator implicitly converts int to chars and it surely is not optimal

11888443
division	multiplication
operations like multiplication or division can have special meaning for matrices

11888454
ffmpeg	libav
yes it is possible to pass many of the x264 options through the command-line and api at least when using libav i canâ t confirm with ffmpeg now

11888506
post	get
so now i m thinking that i may need to just translate the post raw body contents into query string variables - the volume of data in the call is probably low enough that we can get away with this - and then maybe update the api call handler to accept get parameters in this scenario

11888510
width	height
this too is solvable by explicitly setting height width and using images of an exact size - or more effectively by using background url ...

11888586
google-chrome	safari
the problem computers run os x multiple versions and the problem occurs in both google-chrome and safari multiple versions

11888654
inherited	subclassing
ideally i d subclassing deprecated for that overengineered extends deprecated to get the ide highlight it but java annotations are not inherited

11888656
portrait	landscape
it works just fine if the current orientation is the same as the nib s orientation but i can t make it work if the current orientation doesn t match the nib ie current orientation is landscape but nib is portrait

11888656
viewdidload	viewwillappear
oddly viewdidload and viewwillappear report the correct self.interfaceorientation while unfortunately reporting the wrong frame but any attempt to draw in these methods will draw at the wrong orientation

11888663
for-loop	arrays
data is an arrays so just use a for-loop

11888782
debian	linux
i dont have internet connection so i installed gcc on my linux system manually through its debian package

11888814
uidatepicker	nscalendar
uidatepicker returns by default a nsdate with the system nscalendar and nstimezone but when you try to print it later you do not format the output

11888814
nsdateformatter	uidatepicker
so 1st you need to setup the uidatepicker correctly and 2nd transform the output with the nsdateformatter so it knows the calendar and the timezone being used

11888820
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome just says no view available firefox doesn t respond and ie nothing

11888876

i m asking because i want to make a background image for the div and i want to know what size it should be...note that the width and height varies between different browsers...obviously

11889008
m2e	pom.xml
alternatively inside eclipse when you open the pom.xml file with the m2e plugin installed you should see the dependency tree tab at the bottom of the editor like so

11889008
maven	m2e
if so i would recommend installing the m2e plugin linked above and then importing the maven project using import existing maven project from within eclipse

here s the weird part if you put in a value other than 4 such as 5 you get a different error

11889505
getter	setter
encapsulation isn t a must if you re going to be directly accessing members with trivial getter and setter

11889527
google-chrome	firefox
i copied this example out of a svg workshop and i tried it in google-chrome and firefox

subobject	instances
then i tried to bind each column of each table view to the selection member of the class with a model key path specifying the array property of the instances and for the two-dimensional tables a member of the subobject

11889584
subtract	add
it seems you want to add and subtract the numbers component-wise treating your data as a table with rows and columns

11889596
inherited	properties
this way you can also inherited it s properties and create new one

11889610
fiddler	charles
use an http monitor such as charles fiddler or even firebug to find out what additional headers are being sent from the brower in the success case

11889628
initializer	class-method
you can also have both class-method and instance methods in the same class using the class ones when needed and initializer the class to use the instance ones when needed

11889643
post	get
you should use the prg post redirect get pattern to avoid such issues

11889682
implements	extends
you can implements multiple interfaces you can only extends one abstract class

11889689
superclass	subclassing
only a subclassing tiger would not be abstract but most of what a tiger does that s not tiger specific would be implemented in it s abstract superclass

11889693
pull	push
cool at this point i have a forked copy of the redmine on my system which i can commit and push and pull from

11889719
move	drag
usually when i want to move something on the scene i just select it and drag change it since it s a lot easier than just writing it in xaml

11889738
udp	tcp
briefly layered service providers are a way microsoft offers for third-party software to insert itself between your application and microsoft s tcp udp stack in their winsock dlls

11889741
floating-point	integer
similarly when you specify â œ fâ but pass an integer the printf routine may read from a floating-point register but the integer value is in a general processor register

11889772
folder	directory
my solution was to just keep a folder in my web directory

11889818
superclass	subclassing	abstract-class	superclass
if speaking generally an abstract-class will be needed when we need to force down some features on the subclassing from superclass letting the subclassing to have the flexibility to add other functinality

11889824
firefox	safari
identical code works fine if the expiration time is greater than 4 hours and the issue does not occur in firefox or safari

11889854
prepare	execute
finally when i prepare and execute the it seems as if nothing has happened and it doesn t generate any error

11889863
ati	nvidia
all of this makes me think it has something to do with the way nvidia and ati interpret and compile glsl

11889863
vbo	normals
so when creating the vbo and drawing it i do not enable color texture or normals since there s only information about the vertex position

11889865
int	boolean
i use this to schedule draw calls for 2d drawing and this draw code checks certain state fields like int and boolean

11889866
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
so far it looks just like margin-top is not working in both firefox and ie while it works perfectly in google-chrome and opera

11889866
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
please take a look in google-chrome or opera to see how it should look as well as either firefox or ie

11889866
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
also there is another problem with the position relative function on the login box in firefox - the login box works perfectly fine in the other 3 browsers ie google-chrome and opera

11889867
children	parent
in this phase each parent calls layout on all of its children to position them

11889869
rss	feed
i read an rss feed and grab the first title then populate it in the list

11889915
visualvm	jhat
use some visualization tools like jhat or visualvm etc.

11889920
width	margin
yes just be sure to set the left margin and width for each div to be the same and you can alter the top and bottom margins to make them fit how you d like

11889930
post	get
be careful that window.location.assign makes a new get request after your main post request

11889943
post	get
i suggest you use a rejex to get rid of all the slashes when you retrieve the field from the database but before you post it to the client

11889948
ilist	icollection
another thing is that i tried to change ilist of t to icollection of t and that could be a solution as client code of myclass uses add remove methods so no refactoring is necessary but interesting thing happened

11889949
coalesce	isnull
another complication is that isnull does not do type promotion in the same way that coalesce does though coalesce has its own problems due to not being a functionâ it is expanded to a case expression sometimes causing unexpected side-effects due to repeat expression evaluation

11889984
bluetooth	usb
i m using an arduino uno to hook a genuine snes controller to a computer via usb or bluetooth

11890015
tostring	getter
javascript s date object has lots of different versions of tostring and different getter so it should be pretty easy to get the output you want

11890030
google-chrome	firefox
this causes an error in firefox as well as google-chrome

11890062
post	get
as you are using restful controllers consider that ajax is capable of get and post http methods

11890062

the one thing to keep in mind with a hash based data structure is that your objects need to have implementations of gethashcode and equals that are meaningful the default ones usually aren t for your custom types

11890119
hide	show
that would hide the login view and show the page that is below it

11890130
ready	each
for each remaining set which has pairs that are ready to be included you create a new subsequent state taking all the pairs from the set which are ready

width	height
thus when i tried to access it through the annotatedtimeline it couldn t find a valid width or height and threw and error

11890390
rss	feed
my problem is that our trac is not public not even to all these users who don t have accounts in trac otherwise we could point them at reports in trac and they could log in as themselves to read them and we can t automate this extraction because it requires a forms authentication process - i can t find a readonly rss feed which doesn t require authentication

11890710
uipagecontrol	subviews
you can have a container viewcontroller with uipagecontrol and uiscrollview that holds your widgets just like the weather app in ios.depending on the different widgets you need to implement different viewcontrollers and add their views to scrollview.if you do not implement different view controller you might have difficulties handling your subviews since you need to control your views from a single view controller

implements	extends
due to the fact that this application is already written it would be an insurmountable task to make every mouselistener keyboard listener any kind of input listener to extends implements a specific class interface that would store the last time a user-initiated event happened

if you want to have an image inside you can just put the inside the header element or use it as the background-image url in the css and position it with background-position see also although the compatability table at the bottom is important if you want to do anything too specific with this property

11891125
google-chrome	safari
in terms of preventing a site from entering browser history i don t know of a good way to do that but perhaps the best choice is user education about various privacy modes that the browsers themselves offer google-chrome s private browsing or the similar feature in safari

i have tried in both google-chrome and safari

uicontrol	uibutton
the safer bet would be to subclass uicontrol directly and reimplement those selectors so that you don t have any uibutton specific legacy

11891731
width	height
answers on other questions give values which appear to be about the same width height of the text

11891731
width	height
suggested methods include using â sizewithfont constrainedtosize and other nsstring methods sizethatfits method of the uitextview this gives a more correct height but the full width of the view and the contentsize property of the text view also gives the wrong width

11891751

11892016
ostream	ostringstream	ostringstream	std	std	ostream
my guess is that i could have used ostream and iterate over its elements by using an iterator just like for std vector instead of using ostringstream and the str method to convert it to a string but i couldn t find any information regarding this

11892052
put	get
i have tried to put it in the app delegate also and i can t get that to work at all

onresume	onpause
to make things a little better you should implement onpause and onresume as they are going to be called each time you change of activity or rotate your phone

11892201
onresume	onpause
in any case you should add all the event listeners into the oncreate method but anything related to the information being shown could go into onresume and you should save any information or state during onpause

if you are having still problem then i would implements my own localcontainerentitymanagerfactorybean class which extends from abstractentitymanagerfactorybean so you can override setpersistenceunitname then see what is going on

11892265
filtering	grouping
for grouping of similar elements you want to give them all a common class and then use getelementsbyclassname notice the plural elements vs element - this function won t work with ie 8 or earlier however so if you need to support ie you would have to do getelementsbytagname and then filtering in only those that have the class you want

11892537
reportlab	pdfrw
pdfrw itself has some examples that show reading pdfs and using reportlab to output

11892537
reportlab	pdfrw
but you can do this a different way with pdfrw -- if you can use another tool to convert the svg file into a pdf image then pdfrw can take that converted pdf and add it as a form xobject into the pdf that you are generating with reportlab

11892537
reportlab	pdfrw
the entire reason i wrote pdfrw in the first place was for this exact use-case -- being able to reuse vector images in new pdfs created by reportlab

11892560
folder	directory
i can add the .momd as a file in the copy bundle resources by adding a reference to it to the main project in my supporting files group but since the .momd is not a finder level bundle it adds it in as a directory and the .momd contents get copied into the app bundle but not the .momd folder itself so the system cannot find it when the app runs

for that i recommend using tox and having it configured to create a 2.6 environment to test on so that when your coworkers run your test suite the tests are run in a 2.6 virtualenv

11892710
accessor	properties
you re better off just using properties for numerator and denominator rather than writing your own accessor

i would add guava-11.0.1.jar to a maven repository and then add it as a dependency in my pom.xml

11893138
zoo	xts
i think that the package dyn works for zoo objects so i would expect it to work the same way with xts but though there might be something updated

11893147
children	parent
so the first time in this method take form3 as id and current uicomponent is f subview it search for all its facets and children to see if any component match form3 of course none will match since form3 is the parent of f subview in my structure

11893183
dictionary	map
unfortunately it doesn t look like the headers in your file map to what you want to call them in your code - so you would need to assign the names of the fields yourself based on what was in the dictionary

11893202
client-side	server-side
note however i don t think your mvc client-side validation picks up this rule so it will only apply server-side

x86	64bit
x64 is used as a short term for the 64bit extensions of the classical x86 architecture

11893420
x86	64bit
many people also call this stuff x86-64 to have a vendor-independent name and to stress the fact that it s the 64bit evolution of the x86 architecture

11893427
children	parent
i found that #build does setup the association models but only from the parent model down to the children

11893442

i know there are some post about this but none of them really helped me i get the error below and in the index.php file i only have one line php code and it still throws this error

switching	screens
however if i then switching to one of the scaled resolution modes 1680x1050 the system no longer displays the image 1 1 but scales it down it occupies the same screens real estate as a 500x500 image on a 1680x1050 screens

11893665
ubuntu	linux
i am running ubuntu linux server php5 apache2 and am having trouble getting any sort of cronjob to run through the crontab

11893672
min	max
so i don t think it is going to work with the min max values you want to use

11893672
min	max
with regards to the jquery code to set min and max attributes you should use the attribute method

11893708
filesystems	fat
all i ve seen is the 4gb limit of a fat filesystems

11893718
int	chars
you could use an array of well any size int and apply your operators to it an element at a time which will probably be a bit more efficient than an array of chars

11893734
screens	tablet
the problem i am facing is that different screens width is being returning in different browsers.like i have a tablet android 4.0.3 whose actual screens width is 800 px and when i run my script on it by the default browser then it returns accurate screens width 800px but when i open it with different browsers then they return different widths like uc browser is returning 740 px when i run script on opera mini then it returns width as 441 px

11893738
folder	directory
i ve built an in house app that needs to start in public folder directory structure is as follows

they could name the root folder myapp whatever but it will always have a sub dir called public

11893741
strsplit	substr
strsplit substr string.lastindexof

11893761
folder	directory
folder is a very screen based concept better to think of a directory on disk as a directory and zip entries as zip entries

11893761

min	max
i am trying to use aggregate function like max min in jooq and refering their mannual but i am not understanding their examples that how they created max function and used it in their example

11896556
getter	setter
then some header files will include these definition files and use c preprocessor to generate the variable declaration and getter setter

11896556
getter	setter
also the signatures of getter setter are not generated until compile time so there is no intellisense support for them too

11896559
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i m trying to make a ui with a uinavigationcontroller that presents some uiviewcontroller with a child uiviewcontroller as a sidebar view

my approach is to put the sbt.bat sbt-launcher.jar and all its required directory like .sbt plugins and .ivy into a folder to be synced by dropbox or likes

11896687
folder	directory
i have successfully changed the boot ivy directory by using -dsbt.boot.directory -dsbt.ivy.hom in command line for sbt-launch.jar but i can t find the same for plugins or the whole .sbt folder

11896710
hide	show
so that when i do hide show navigation bar the stretching and shrinking of video view should be avoided

do.call	lapply
i have to guess slightly at exactly what you want but here is how to go about using base r do.call + lapply as well as plyr

11896996
google-chrome	firefox
memory leaks and or loaded and unused content are normally cleared after a refresh - especially in google-chrome - on the other hand firefox is a real memory muncher 6-12 hours of having it open even with no activity you ll see an increase in memory usage

11897116
x86	64bit
i m familiar with x86 32-bit assembly in ms-dos environment but i m a beginner in x86 64bit assembly and in linux assembly programming in general

11897116

the idea would be to keep 8-bit and 16-bit operands as is and replace 32-bit operands with 64bit operands

11897120
google-chrome	firefox
possible in google-chrome and firefox apparently

11897127
ubuntu	debian
or with debian ubuntu

11897163
jpql	hql
by all means use hql jpql every time you can instead of criteria queries they are much more readable imho

11897180
mouseleave	mouseenter
the two scripts are doing completely different things but just guessing here i think what is confusing you is that in the second script the .hover function takes two callbacks as parameters one for mouseenter and one for mouseleave like this

11897234
calloc	malloc
you cannot do that without allocating memory explicitly using malloc or calloc to the char pointers

11897243
width	height
ext.onready function new ext.window title hello width 300 height 500 items getitems .show

11897248
int	double
as of java 1.5 the compiler automatically boxes primitives into their corresponding class eg int and int double and double etc and un-boxes as required

11897249
getter	setter
meaning if you have really a pojo that doesn t extends any other class that has nothing in the default no-arg constructor that the only thing it does is to provide getter setter to properties and that no other code by you listeners for instance changes it then there s no way hibernate is setting the values back to their default values

11897276
width	height
the pixmap is black in background and plotting pen color is red so when it reaches the end of screen width i have to start drawing the graph from position 0 but from the second cycle onwards i have to fill the previously drawn pixels not the entire pixmap just a rect of width few pixels and height height of pixmap with black color

11897282

11897449
free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	malloc
you are likely going to want to overload the new operator to use malloc and delete to use free so that you can grow your data structure on demand with realloc

11897459
google-chrome	firefox
it renders correctly in google-chrome and firefox but in ie the charts and filters selectors do not look correct

11897487
int	chars
i would say that depends on the size of int and chars

11897487
int	chars
if int is 4 bytes and represents 2 bytes the int consumes more memory than the chars -array so you are not initialising the full int -memory to 0 by setting all chars -variables

11897496
gentoo	linux
the server is running gentoo linux so i figured i was looking for a block somewhere in my apache configuration

11897590

11897948
min	max

11897993
min	max
you must first select the records you are interested in and then select max and min from those

11898039
put	get
since meteor includes jquery by default you can utilize a jquery plugin for that i presume something like can do the trick for you and supports both get and put

11898039
put	get
otherwise it would be a pain in the ass to get it to work but not impossible since you can access put in meteor

11898059
accelerometer	gyroscope
if you are bound to use pure accelerometer data because you want to support older devices that do not have a gyroscope you have to use cmmotionmanager s accelerometerdata property

11898082
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine on firefox and google-chrome

11898144

11901236
width	height
â if width height we will always return a square picture.â

11901308
xrange	enumerate
i would use enumerate as it s more generic - eg it will work on iterables and sequences and the overhead for just returning a reference to an object isn t that big a deal - while xrange len something although to me more easily readable as your intent - will break on objects with no support for len .

xrange	enumerate
xrange should be a little faster but enumerate will mean you don t need to change it when you realise that you need p afterall

to get around this you can either use group by instead or put the whole query in a sub-query and run another select with order by on it

11904555
implements	extends
even though the class itself implements not extends the terminology for the generic definition is extends

11904557

oncreate	setcontentview
this works fine because i can find the analogclock since it s in the layout xml file of the configuration screen which i set in the oncreate through setcontentview

11905949
min	max
i think your best bet is to simply take the event type as a normal integral type use an enumeration to define the built-in types and provide user-defined min and max values between which the user creates their own integer values with a separate enumerator

11905957
width	height
resizable height and width

11905957
hide	show
show hide columns

11905972
int	boolean	int	double
if you dont know about php and single double quotes it will cause the contents to be treated as a string value rather than int of boolean true false

11905989
int	boolean
specific key casts are mentioned in the documentation in particular for your case that boolean are cast to int ie

11905994
int	double
they both return double and the both take 2 int

11905995
qcompleter	qabstractitemview
the issue here is that the completer actually contains a pop-up which is actually a separate qabstractitemview widget refer to the qcompleter popup documentation

11905999

you might want to try to use the replace function rather than hide and show

11906243
google-chrome	firefox
we have a similar setup to yours and after a little testing decided to use a tiling window manager instead of just running google-chrome or firefox in x

if your worried about the security of the connection you could establish a ssl connection using https example here

11906257
sortedmap	sortedset	treemap	treeset
to keep your java side collection ordered you don t need to keep calling the sort method but just use a ordered collection like treeset or treemap or any collection that implements sortedset or sortedmap to store your data

11906257
comparator	comparable
you still need to implement comparable or comparator as adelboutros said

11906266
pull	push
here viewcontroller talks to one or more services to pull push the data from to the database using daos

11906277
hide	show
however i wanted the dialog to display quickly especially when hovering so i wanted to simply show and hide it

11906294

11906404
width	height
you re restricting both the width and the height so basically it s wrapping but you can t see the wrapped part

11906404
width	height
you can remove the height so you see the wraps or increase the width so it doesn t wrap

11906449
gif	png
if you have php 5.3 and the finfo pecl extension you can use it to get the mime type of the file and have a whitelist of types you will allow png jpg gif i would imagine

11906497
overwrite	preserve
if chrome can t write to it s config directory or if that directory is getting overwrite your settings will not be preserve --- otherwise a kiosk like you describe should work with the settings you specify

google-chrome	firefox
it works just fine in google-chrome and firefox

11906518
accessor	properties
if you access the properties through the dependencyproperty interface it completely bypasses the properties s get set accessor

11906518

in this instance if i manually assign obviously the set accessor for the myvalue properties won t be called

11906527
comparator	comparable
then inside your list you would obviously use the sorts and comparable comparator techniques

11906538
put	get
i put the condition in the select clause rather than the where clause so you can easily get the 50th percentile 17th or whatever values you want

11906544

11906814
sse	avx
the avx intrinsics is missing most of the corresponding sse integer operations

11906814
sse	avx
without mixing sse and avx operation and without manually inverting a0 and a1

goto	break
in my opinion there is absolutely nothing wrong with using a modern goto to break out of an inner loop

11907083
multiplying	division
beware of the integer division if both numerator and demoninator are integer types not an issue in your case but we make sure numerator is decimal by multiplying by decimal literal which insures we have decimal type value.

11907101
post	get
this post deals with the fact that you can t reliably detect mime types without iis but it should get you on your way.

11907116
post	get
his implementation is a little different than yours but by playing with the border-radius you should be able to get the effect closer to what you have in your image though i doubt you ll be able to get the shadow working if you prove me wrong post your code here

nunit	mstest
this sounds similar to a known issue that i m currently writing a blog post about for the f# team blog probably to appear in the next few weeks regarding mstest rather than nunit

should allow you do to sync request with the ability to allow self-signed and works a lot like asihttprequest but is based on nsurlconnection instead of being the lower level cfnetwork framework

11911421
post	get
the request that caused the error was a get and you are trying to get the value of the title parameter from the post dict

11911421

11911426
post	get
for me it look like your are trying to retrieve data from a post request but the query is in reality a get request

11911427
int	chars
the only way it could fail to be a no-op is if the range of chars is larger than the range of int for example if chars and int are both 32-bit but chars is unsigned.

11911432
post	get
firstly this is a get query so the post dict will be empty

11911435
folder	directory
for example using the genericoptionsparser parameters you can specify files and folder to include which are then available in the working directory

11911443
int	chars
yes you are missing something fundamental the compiler does not read the chars from the memory as if the memory represented an int

11911443
int	chars
instead it reads a chars as a chars and then sign-extends the value to fit in an int so chars -1 becomes int -1 as well

so you can t just copy css directory of downloaded jquery ui to your theme folder of mvc4 and expect it would be applied for your site

11911737
width	height
if you have the option of giving a fixed width to the table cells and a fixed height to the header you can used the position fixed option

11911743
getter	setter
if you were to implement your own enum analog in python i think namedtuple would be the closest thing seeing as your java enum has getter but no setter - namedtuple s are likewise immutable

11911744
google-chrome	safari
the first step is to open the site in safari google-chrome s web inspector and get a feel for where in the tree the data you want is

11912219
bids	ssis
there is one more tool called ssis log analyser which helps you to debug your package without opening bids

11912241
min	max
eventually you will need to look at the ends of each unit slope segment to get the min and max

11912241
min	max
this is all we need to compute the min and max values

11912241
min	max
so min is -1 and max is 10

11912241
range	min
run time will be o min k log n k 2 where n is the maximum initial range value 10 in the example and k is the number of operations applied

11912721
pull	push
this can led to a lot of confusion in your scenario if you run git push or git pull without explicitly mention the remote branches you want to push or pull

11912730
hide	show
by using jquery show and hide methods you can fix this

11912747
pull	push
the problem is that git seems to trigger the post-receive on a pull and a push and recalls-itself in the fashion of an infinit loop it stops with a error building trees

11912747
stdout	stderr
to get the less error messages i pipe the stderr to the stdout because afaik appending isn t possible with the stderr-pipe-redirection and append it to an error_less-file

11912834
stringbuilder	stringwriter
in the rare cases you might want to write to an in memory stream of characters in a multi-thread way and you didn t care how jumbled up the text it produced was you can still use more natural alternatives like stringwriter which wasn t available in java 1.0 or synchronize a stringbuilder

this all works great in firefox and google-chrome and ie9 but not ie8

11913092
getter	setter
you can use list which will have setter and getter

11913118

intersect	contains
another approach would be to work with rect and detecting collisions with contains and intersect

11913409
int	chars
each chars as an int

11913461
children	parent	width	height
for width problems i add different background-color to elements and parent to better see which one isn t as expected and which one has only floating children and thus no real content in the flow anymore thus no height thus no visible background color...

11913473
post	get
also it implements the post-redirect-get wikipedia approach where you get a post request process it and redirect the user back with a get method to prevent the double-form submissions on back refresh button presses

11913484
button	checkbox
the expanded works fine gives me radio button but i want checkbox

11913493
children	parent
and constrain the number of children per parent via a trigger or in the application

11913493
children	parent
the trigger on parent is needed to prevent insertion of a parent without any children

11913493
children	parent
if you only require each parent to have a maximum of 9 children not exactly 9 children as implemented in the above trigger you can remove the deferrable initially deferred change the to and chop out the delete handler in the child trigger

11913493
children	parent
btw if i were working with jpa in java or some other reasonably clever orm i d just constrain the size of the collection of children on the parent

11913497
next	except
the call to mysql_fetch_array moves the internal pointer to the next row thus you are getting all rows except the first in your while loop

11913520
folder	directory
if you look at the original date file under your project folder and then find the same file under the xcode build directory

11913524
maven	pom.xml
the solution is to add an ignore filter option to the pom.xml file and tell maven not to encode the keystore file

11913591
getter	setter
you can have properties in a protocol provided every class that conforms to your protocol have a corresponding synthesize for that property or provide a getter and setter

11913594

if i were to write a tlv encoder decoder in ansi c i would choose a proven standardized flexible data serialization on-wire format asn.1 ber thrift etc

11913594
decoder	encoder
others allows you to automatically generate encoder decoder for the data scheme

11913599
retaincount	dealloc
retaincount never reaches 0 because when it s 1 and release is called it calls immediately dealloc without decrement retaincount

ant	maven
i haven t investigate it much further but i used certain things pretty often such as maven and ant builds - those however they seem a bit archaic worked well can t remember any problem with that

rss	feed
am trying to extract rss channel item title and rss channel item description from the wordsmith xml feed

11913993
iprincipal	iidentity
during subsequent requests the auth cookie is read and the iprincipal iidentity is reconstructed before executing an action method

11913993
iprincipal	iidentity
this way you re not losing anything that comes out of the box with the default iprincipal and iidentity implementations

11913993
iprincipal	iidentity
you can still invoke isauthenticated on the iidentity or even isinrole string on the iprincipal

11913998
google-chrome	firefox

sse	avx
you need to ensure your memory is 32 memory bit address aligned to exploit auto-vectorization and avx to the maximum and 16 bit address aligned to exploit sse to the maximum always align to 32 memory bit address

11914054
sse	avx
update and one more thing make sure your img is actually page-aligned which implies avx and sse aligned

division	modulo
this is generally done with the modulo remainder after division operator

to install files into a subfolder of the sys.docsdir directory add a new root under files- define distribution tree with the name and add the files below that folder

11914719
onresume	onpause
in other words put your save restore code for non view objects in onpause and onresume instead of onsaveinstancestate bundle and onrestoreinstancestate bundle

11914719
onresume	onpause
finally i guess that you don t need to save any state if you only have view objects and if you have any other states you can use preferences file or sqlite to save them in onpause and retreive them in onresume

there s the class table inherited model where each subclassing has a table of its own that extends using the word loosely the main superclass table with a copy of the key and additional columns

then slowly start replacing with your code and be very careful with the following css-attributes they not only help to find errors like the most useful css borders but they also help to stop new content that is added from bloating previous one max width height css attributes

put	get
i put codes to functions.php file when use this function in another page i get this error

11915632
rss	feed
the issue was a rss feed on the sites page

11915645
for-loop	arrays	min	max
quick n dirty use a second for-loop for the second arrays but do not reinitialize the min max etc again

11915645
min	max
cleaner would be to make a class to hold the min max etc and a method that is passed this result object and an array

11915645
min	max
the method then scans the array and updates the result objects min max etc

11915684

note that the character spaces is being treated as a delimiter

11916168

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
moreover you can use a mix of sessions between ie firefox safari and google-chrome

11916251

11916302
datagridcomboboxcolumn	datagridtemplatecolumn
it works perfectly when i use datagridcomboboxcolumn but i d like to use datagridtemplatecolumn to add some more features in future

11916308
division	multiplication
now i would think that i am not the first one who has this kind of problem and there would be already a library for that that already has multiplication division implemented - but it seems that it isn t

11916367
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the footer looks further down in mozzilla firefox 14.0.1 while in safari and google-chrome looks fine

so if you put this code into a route you can get access to the request for your username and password

11916557
toolbar	tabs
since i only have two tabs that are links on the toolbar i was thinking of using an if else statement in jquery to determine which page the user is on and therefore which tab to highlight but i am not too sure how to do that

11916593
min	max
first having the min max avg for a simple array

11916593
min	max
note since you can t use java libraries for your assignment is easy to do your own versions of the min max functions read the math javadoc

11916593
min	max
using an array is a little bit ugly to read so is better if you create a class to hold the min max avg

11916593
min	max
additional notes if you are studying computer science you ll learn in the future that the loop to calculate max min avg has a complexity of o n

11916593
min	max
if the values array is fully loaded in memory doing the max min avg in three different functions thus reading the array 3 times is still an algorithm of o n order with a bigger constant

11916593
min	max
with the power of today s computers the constant is so small that most of the time you ll not get any gain from calculating min max avg in the same loop

11916599
jobs	cron	pull	push
i m very confused about gae s concepts of tasks task queues both push and pull cron jobs and how each of these relate to frontend vs

now instead of null put at the end put the char that you should get at the end

11916653
versioning	upgrade
if get_count returns 100 you will need to upgrade your phpcassa to latest versioning

clang	llvm
apple clang version 4.0 tags apple clang-421.10.60 based on llvm 3.1svn

11916766

filtering	grouping
it s a bunch of code built upon wcf but it let you query your datasource with dynamic linq filtering ordering paging and grouping client side

11916904

gridbaglayout	boxlayout
i would suggest using a gridbaglayout instead of boxlayout

11917095
istream	getline
istream getline expects a pointer so there is no need to dereference it as you did

11917097
pipe	freopen
to present the output in an existing console window one can just omit the calls to allocconsole and freopen and redirect standard output of rundll32 to a pipe

viewdidload	dealloc
in basewebviewcontroller i am calling super viewdidload and super dealloc in their respective methods

11917162
viewdidload	dealloc
my question is that since both basewebviewcontroller and secondarywebviewcontroller are subclassing the baseviewcontroller i m not sure what to do regarding calling super viewdidload and super dealloc in secondarywebviewcontroller

11917162
viewdidload	dealloc
in secondarywebviewcontroller i had been calling those super viewdidload and super dealloc but i noticed it caused some problems especially with random crashes when calling super dealloc

11917162
viewdidload	dealloc
secondarywebviewcontroller s viewdidload and dealloc calls the superclass s viewdidload and dealloc causing strange behaviour

11917162
viewdidload	dealloc
currently if i comment out super viewdidload and super dealloc in secondarywebviewcontroller so that baseviewcontroller is never dealloced then everything runs fine

11917216
screens	tablet
or should i just change the css for span7 for tablet screens sizes to match that of span10

postgresql	mysql
in my experience redis is an awesome addition to your stack and can help process data at blazing fast speeds compared to mysql postgresql or any other rdbms

11917310
wordpress	joomla
at wordpress joomla drupal.

11917314
for-loop	arrays
if you want to iterate the arrays use a for-loop or one of the iteration methods from jquery or the native api

11917321
free	malloc
about memory allocation you should use stack instead heap avoiding malloc free in this case

11917328
cvs	svn
it would poll your svn git or whatever cvs you use for changes and then build it on the configuration you provide

11917375
button	checkbox
to get the usual autocomplete behavior go to your project -- build settings -- user header search paths and add example to the list double click on the setting click the + button write example and make sure to turn on the checkbox to the left

11917399
prepare	execute	versioning	upgrade
my fourth vote for versioning 2 is because the repbg function is prepare to have it s execute method function upgrade so you can only take out the preload value from the class valuelist

11917417
subtract	add
with the solution below you can just add subtract values from your symbol list and the table will change automatically

11917437
screens	tablet
i will answer it myself i removed the javascript code and replaced it with this simple change to the bootstrap css to change the width of span7 to the same width as span10 for tablet screens sizes

11917491

vsto	add-in
i have a document level add-in for excel 2010 that i created using vsto

11917491
vsto	add-in
i have actually done this in some situations but not in cases where the document itself included a vsto add-in

11917491
vsto	add-in
make a wrapper project that includes the workbook vsto add-in

-no children are shared among parent

11917584

serializable	deserialization
you can control the serializable and deserialization process using a number of methods specified in msdn

11917612
children	parent
in a tree whose number of children is variable you wouldn t be able to say that it is complete any parent could have the number of children that you want

11917661
minimum	max	min	max
according to the xpages extension library book you can use the min and max properties of xe djnumberconstraints to control minimum and maximum values allowed

11917687
realloc	malloc
the default clause should probably be using realloc rather than malloc and the cast in the default is seriously problematic

11917687
realloc	malloc
given that p is now initialized to 0 a null pointer you could do without the malloc and simply use realloc unconditionally

11917700
width	height
so if my billboards have width and height in metres and their distance from the camera is known as well as the focal length of the camera i can calculate their size on the sensor

11917721
getter	setter
i wonder how to hide a real property field not make it private or public but force to use setter and getter and provide him with simple setter and getter

11917779
matplotlib	scipy
i m using dendrogram from scipy to plot hierarchical clustering using matplotlib as follows

11917785
post	get
how can i modify this action so that for get request it would give out form and for the post request it would process user input data as if it were a separate action

11917785
post	get
update1 i want a single action that serves get and post requests

11917798
for-loop	loops
loops could be created by goto or it could be a for-loop

11917809
mouseleave	mouseenter
you should use mouseenter and mouseleave because it doesn t trigger every time you change elements within the wrapper div

11917809
slideup	slidedown
if your div is height 0 after slideup you may have to slidedown 0 then hide before fadeto

11917925
for-loop	loops
so when you use geocoding inside the for-loop loops is already finished when you receive the results i will always be 1 and point to the last item of people

11917930
getter	setter
this basically forces the property to be accessed through getter setter methods

11917930
getter	setter
personally it feels like over engineering and prefer to just use pimpl to hide my private details and just provide the getter setter explicitly

11917935
google-chrome	firefox
i have troubles with simple javascript code which works in firefox and not in google-chrome

11917946
put	get
i want to get the free space available on each partition to determine where best to put files

you can download it from itunes and from its settings you can choose any browser to simulate as ie ie8 google-chrome firefox

11918035
postgresql	mysql
the reason for thinking in a change mysql postgresql is because i ve been talking to some people that recommended that i shouldn t use mysql because in their own words it is confusing and outdated

11918082
portrait	landscape
the view controller loads a list of videos youtube mobile page but now when you select a video to play the file plays in the ios movieplayer in landscape which is a good thing but behind the parent view controller which remains in portrait

11918279
google-chrome	safari
webkit has a proprietary background-clip text style but it only works on google-chrome and safari

11918290
width	height
i have a div with width 100 and i need the height of the same div to adjust according to how many pixels wide the page is

11918290
width	height
the reason is because an image is stretched across full width of the div and if i set a solid height different resolutions will render it differently and the image looks stretched out

11918308
postgresql	mysql
generally if you re new to both i d say mysql is very easy to start working with while postgresql can have quite a steep leraning curve

11918308
innodb	myisam
my advice would be - don t bother just do what article says except maybe creating tables in innodb format rather than myisam

11918323
width	height
obviously change the width and height combinations to whatever you need and you can also use max-width or width as required

11918333
width	height
i had a similar problem and i solved it by adding style to html body - min width and height elements

11918335
folder	directory
if that works but file is missing at viewdidload then the only possible is you or the system is deleting all files in the documents directory i have heard if your app uses icloud the rules for this folder change

11918340
coldfusion	railo
i m new to railo moving away from coldfusion 8 where my site used to used to use cfx_imagecr3

11918390
int	chars
your conversion failed because you ve entered as a first chars the - sign that cannot be converted to int

11918406
width	height
i was not specifying the height width and margins properly

11918426
hide	show
i typically factor out the hide show logic

11918437

11918513
whenever	capistrano
i wrote a capistrano task to link the files whenever i do a deployment

11918548

11918603
audiotoolbox	avfoundation
for audio it only contains the audiotoolbox and the avfoundation

11918622
linestyle	gnuplot
linecolor 0 isn t defined i don t know why gnuplot uses two different conventions here -- i suppose because in theory the colors corresponding to any particular linestyle are terminal dependent so it doesn t really matter too much anyway...

11918666
getter	setter
update it looks like the tag_tokens method is broken for you in both the getter and setter

11918728
width	height
just know the basics bitmap width and height for example 256x256 the circles radius and to make things easy make the circle centered at 128 128

11918730
mouseup	mousedown
the mousedown command fires but the mouseup command does not

11918739
jar	war
using war file setwar webapplicationcontext on web-inf is not an option since package is jar

11918745
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseup	mouseleave	mouseup	mouseenter
preferably i could make it so as soon as you mouseup from dragging the items on the left side outside of its div container they would disappear but i d setting for after they revert back to their original location the li item will disappear but the mouseenter mouseleave events aren t working right for me

11918771
google-chrome	safari
when testing in google-chrome internet explorer and safari everything goes fine

11918800
mouse	trackpad
or you could use the mouse if you re on a laptop where the trackpad is nearby + in gvim

11918891
width	height
this is the shorthand which will create two variables x and y which are width and height respectively

11918956
min	max
this way you can reuse the dps wherever you want and json parser should deserialize it properly to the iteminformation with proper values for dps min and max

11918990
mouseout	mousedown	mouseout	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown
you may want to attach to the mouseout event and set a status on the mousedown so that if you mouse out of the div while mousedown is active it treats the mouseout as a mouseup

11918990
mouseup	mousedown
edit add prevent default to your mousedown event and the subsequent mouseup should fire appropriately in ie9

11919006
post	get
that s the beauty of http based web services soap or rest any client that can get or post an appropriate http request can use it

11919011
width	height
trying to set min width height of all divs to be the current width height which are both 100 by css using javascript or using only css if possible

11919024
int	double
in the file i was reading it went int double int int for each line for about 40 000 lines

11919030
public	protected
it sounds like player is a character so that inheritance should be public not protected

11919074
pdcurses	ncurses
if you need them to work under windows you ll have to use pdcurses as a replacement for ncurses or pywin32 rather than termios

11919077
portrait	landscape
i can start it up in either portrait or landscape mode and everything works as it aught to

11919077

the master popup button is visible in portrait mode but hidden in landscape mode

11919098
short	base
datauri will now contain the data uri for the image which will contain along with a short prefix the base 64 encoding of the image

11919102
width	height
as far as i understand if you dont specify the width and height of a div by default it will always take it from its enclosing div

11919102
width	height
this will apply width and height both as 100 to all 3 divs in wrapper1 wrapper2 wrapper3

11919108
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the problem is that one set of widths works for firefox while another works for safari google-chrome and neither works for opera

11919116
post	get
if you don t understand get and post variables i reccomend reading at least the php manual s page on the array or a more general overview of get and post variables

11919138
int	chars
and querying chars 1 might be faster than an int

11919156
onfocus	onblur
i ve tried using onblur and onfocus handlers but they only fire during a change and not when the initial page is loaded

11919165
getlasterror	deviceiocontrol
i am able to get a handle but once i use deviceiocontrol it fails getlasterror says error is an incorrect function

11919169

all those apis that say they are restful where they say do a get on this url with these parameters and post on this url with a document that looks like this are not practicing rest

11919274
post	get
if it was because you have heard some of the benefits of rest and how to gain those benefits implicitly by making your api restful the unfortunate truth is that there s more to rest than urls and whether you get or post to them

11921219
width	height
if you still want to use the gridview then make it fill all the width height by using fill_parent and not wrap_content like you did for the layout_width height and in the oncreate method use a handler to post a runnable in which you retrieve the gridview s layoutparams and use those to set up the adapter

11921597
uiview	subviews
simplest solution i ve found that works consistently is to make your content view a tiny uiview subclass - bearing in mind your content view itself is required by uiscrollview to never change if you enable zooming - apple has some bugs up to at least ios 6 that kick in when you change the content view of an existing scrollview so it s a good idea to keep it trivial and put your custom views inside it as subviews

probably the easiest way to get it running is to make a directory called public and put index.html in it and modify your express server so that it serves static files from that directory

to prevent alarmmanager from creating notifications while your app is running simply use alarmmanager.cancel pendingintent intent in onresume and recreate your alarms in onpause

11928712
equals	compareto
the basic contract of compareto and same goes for equals method are

11928712
superclass	subclassing
ideally i d write a compareto in subclassing as well it may or may not use superclass s compareto

11928712
equals	compareto
implementing compareto or equals in your subclass you will be breaking either symmetry or transitivity

11928712
equals	compareto
it suggests that there is no way to extend a class and override the equals method which has same contract as compareto to it something differently

11928717
folder	directory
created virtual directory for this folder

11928718
superclass	subclassing
yes the behavior would be same as you are not overriding the compareto method but then make sure your subclassing does not alter any attributes in a way that can break break the code in compareto method implements in superclass

11928730
free	malloc
i think implementing my own array using malloc free to make sure targets are not retained would be one solution but all this hassle smells like there is already a solution implemented somewhere

11928749
portrait	landscape
i designed ipad based website with pure html and css everything work pretty good but only one thing that i have noticed and it is about the smoothness when we change device view from landscape to portrait or reverse its change with little jerk

11928886
folder	directory

11928916
superclass	subclassing
since your superclass will presumably not know what its subclassing are doing if a subclassing overrides compareto in such a way that it gives an answer different than its superclass it breaks the contract

11928951
google-chrome	firefox
this happens in google-chrome and firefox so what s the theory of the indexof and lastindexof treat undefined differently

11929004
filesystems	fat
fat may sound like a strange name for a filesystems but it s actually an acronym for file allocation table

11929004
filesystems	fat
the fat filesystems limits filenames to the 8.3 naming convention meaning that a filename can have no more than eight characters before the period and no more than three after

11929004
filesystems	fat
filenames in a fat filesystems must also begin with a letter or number and they can t contain spaces

11929004
filesystems	fat
vfat is an extension of the fat filesystems and was introduced with windows 95

11929004

11929351
hide	show
you can bind on hide and show event of accordion-body to set status for the collapse item

disk	ram
then use lo_import to read the data from a temporary file that s on disk so you don t have to fit the whole thing in ram at once

11929406
textview	imageview
the answer ended up being to give the textview a weight of 0 and the imageview a weight of 1

11929406
textview	imageview
that way textview showed up perfectly but only took as much space as it needed and the imageview took up the rest of the space

11934923
width	height
there is no method to find out the width and height of the image without loading it so you will have to dynamically load it and to do so you can use

11934969
getter	setter
if all you re doing in your getter and setter is setting a property that is not used elsewhere and there s no other processing then you gain nothing by using a getter and setter so you re better off with your original approach

11934969
getter	setter
finally another major disadvantage of getter and setter is that they are specified in ecmascript 5 and as such are only available in relatively recent browsers

11934992
rss	feed
i want to read out a specific attribute with simple xml from an rss feed

11934996
opera	google-chrome
webkit google-chrome and opera support the getusermedia api and google mozilla and opera have partnered up to form the webrtc initiative

11934997
ubuntu	centos
i m trying to install yum or apt-get into my system ubuntu centos

11935019
getter	setter
the convention is easy you need to return a boolean can skip the getter and the corresponding setter will take a boolean parameter as well

11935019
getter	setter
would return a boolean but you d still need a getter and setter which deal with different types

11935019
getter	setter
and since that part of the javabeans convention normally only is about getter and setter has.

11935019
accessor	properties
example if a person has a car properties you d expect to have a getcar accessor

11935019
accessor	properties
hascar wouldn t be an accessor since the derived properties hascar would need an accessor named gethascar or ishascar

11935019
accessor	properties
if has was an accessor prefix the properties would have the conflicting name car

11935035
express	node.js
i m working with node.js express mongodb and got stuck on this data passing between frontend and backend

11935062
spaces	delimiter
i don t think using spaces as a delimiter is a good option in this case since your fields will almost certainly contain spaces

11935062
spaces	delimiter
as such i believe the spaces as the delimiter is probably what is creating the extra fields not the semi-colon

11935077
spweb	spsite
in your example you are directing the creation of an spsite object with new spsite but you are asking spsite to create an spweb object for you with site.openweb

11935091
ubuntu	linux
i created a amazon ec2 instance with ubuntu linux 64-bit 12.04 lts now when i ssh into it i get the following

11935101
spweb	spsite
openweb either has a new spweb inside it or the new spsite myhost created a new openweb for you this you don t have to know you just know you ll get an spweb object

11935116
prepare	execute
the execute statement takes a prepare statement and well.

11935116
int	double
my_variable is a temporary variable but it can only be of a scalar type varchar int date datetime binary float double etc. it is not an array

11935126
gridview	rowdatabound
for filling the gridview you have to use rowdatabound

11935156

11935158
filtering	grouping
for each row in cellforrowatindexpath filtering the enrollments for that grouping and draw the cell

11935172
floating-point	fractions
if you have an ieee-754 floating-point number in a float then the job of converting to or from your 8-bit format is one of rounding the significand the fractions when going to the narrower format and of adjusting the exponent bias plus handling special cases denormals overflow nans

11935172
floating-point	fractions
as an aside note that the proper term for the fractions portion of a floating-point number is â œfractionâ or â œsignificandâ the term used in the ieee-754 standard

11935182
stdout	stderr
note that you are redirecting stderr to stdout with your

11935185
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	linux	centos	linux
i have no idea what linux distribution ubuntu centos is

11935185
ubuntu	centos
ubuntu and centos are two different distributions

11935219
getter	setter
probably it is not a bad idea to define annotations setter and getter

11935224
nsmutablestring	nsstring
third of all you can not change constant strings defined like this constant string you will have to use nsstring stringwithformat str rather yet nsmutablestring for your purpose

11935287
packets	multicast
i m building a multicast client with gcdasyncudpsocket and i m facing a lot of packets loss

i then want to be able to use jqueryui drag and drop to move the text box onto a grid

11935554
hide	show
you could also store a reference to the old div that is being show so that you could just hide that one and show the other rather then iterating over an entire list of divs

11935554
hide	show
in reality you only need to show one div and hide one div

11935664
int	double
let s compare the result in squeak smalltalk in double precision float converted to exact arithmetic fractions with arbitrary int length at numerator and denominator

11935704

11935739
button	checkbox
in case you have click event bind in checkbox or radio button

11935762
int	double
change int values to float or double

for-loop	loops
but the problem here is dstmat is all zero outside after the for-loop but inside loops it has exactly the value i want

11936066
width	height
i also don t want to just add a height and width attribute because this results in a image with a ragged edge that does not scale well

11936070
width	height
a piece of html that i m trying to parse contains some attributes values without quotation marks for example with width and height attributes

11936080
couchbase	couchdb
memory usage is always an issue in any system.i am using mongodb for production and when i compare with similar solutions couchdb couchbase redis.io mongodb is really good in memory management and easiness of implementation

11936087
jboss	glassfish	jboss	weblogic	glassfish	weblogic
normally jsf is already provided as part of the java ee api by a decent java ee application server such as glassfish jboss websphere weblogic etc

11936087
primefaces	richfaces	primefaces	trinidad	richfaces	trinidad
jsf component libraries like trinidad primefaces richfaces etc are not part of the java ee api and thus surely need to be supplied by the web application project itself

11936155
accessor	properties
i suppose you mean a field by properties which usually has accessor and mutator get set-methods

11936182
google-chrome	safari
i made a js fiddle of it working properly in google-chrome and safari

11936182
google-chrome	firefox
i hope this doesn t throw anyone off but to make it work exclusively in firefox and not google-chrome what i do is make the .sticky class have a width set to inherit

11936182
firefox	safari
then it ll work just for firefox and safari

11936213

use box-sizing border-box

11936679
public	protected
for example make sure each one is specified as public private or protected

11936772

init.d	pid
i was using an init.d file to restart my server however i had to actually stop the server then remove the pid file manually for unicorn

11936857

installation	upgrade
there are some bugs in the ubuntu installation upgrade configuration settings for mysql 5.5 from 5.1

capistrano	rvm
duh i didn t have the capistrano rvm gem installed so i couldn t require rvm capistrano correctly

11937138
int	double
finally the actual issue that i personally needed to address was almost exactly the same except i was dealing with int which also struggle with the xml representation of 0 double values

11937185
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	linux	centos	linux
this is definitely amazon linux centos based not ubuntu

11937185
ubuntu	linux
another hint is that the default username in amazon linux is usually ec2-user while in ubuntu it is ubuntu at least if you use the default stock ami

11937188
scrypt	pbkdf2
since the proper options seem to be bcrypt scrypt or pbkdf2 and bcrypt was most easily accessible to me in php.

11937188
hash	salt
a different random salt is used for each hash

11937188
hash	salt
the hash algorithm settings and salt are stored together

11937188

11937364
put	get
also if you could get the test to simply return true false then you could delete the if then else and put

11937384
put	get
but if you think that your interfaces get too complicated with overloading and your function is small you should declare it inline and put it in a header

11937386
draggable	droppable
it s just a hunch but maybe it s only a matter of the size of your draggable being too big and being over more than one droppable item

11937386
draggable	droppable
tolerance specifies which mode to use for testing whether a draggable is over a droppable

11937386

11937416
pop-up	dialog
i need to use the pop-up feed dialog instead with the correct link

11937417
google-chrome	safari
apparently certain browser engines like trident ie and webkit google-chrome safari there are some cases where the onresize event is triggered multiple times when it should only happen once

11937466
folder	directory
for backup i have tried rename it sometimes fails createdirectory then copyfiles then delete them time consuming lots of files and directory and have preferred to use move folder where every function is replaced with its un-version like .movefolder_locate_movefile - un.movefolder_locate_movefile

then put the ajax request together using your url http method post or get and the datatype in this case i used json

11937586

you should really convince your boss to either use json in the body of a post or use get parameters in form of a get

11937615
folder	directory
in your working copy you have the hidden .svn folder in every folder of your directory structure

11937626

when i download the sourceforge version of numpy scipy matplotlib for python 2.7 i m taken through a 5-step installation process which results in an error

11937633
pop-up	dialog
if you want to do this without a page load using pop-up dialog or similar you would need to look at using ajax

11937680
width	height
if the hyperlinks aren t fixed width you could set the background-size not supported on ie9 and earlier or add an img tag to each hyperlink statically or using js or jquery and scale it to 100 width and fixed height

11937684
public	protected
when you move cacheable to private or protected method injection works because cacheable doesn t take effect in this case - only public methods can be adviced using proxy-based aop

11937699
inherited	properties
since in the html the aggcardcontroller comes inside of the aggviewport it will inherited properties from the parent scope

11937713

11937758
put	get
apc does no fragmentation memory management so unless you have a lot of excess unused memeory apc will get fragmented and have a hard time finding large enough holes to put new requests to store stuff

11937777
free	malloc
the problem is you need to ensure that the memory allocation functions new delete malloc free match exactly between your calling code and the dynamic library

11937781
free	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	calloc	malloc	realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc
the argument does not match a pointer earlier returned by the calloc malloc or realloc function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to free or realloc

11937816
whenever	capistrano
what i ended up doing is removing the require whenever capistrano from the config deploy.rb to avoid the automatic deploy

11937827
folder	directory
if the directory does not exist or the specified language is not located there ci will instead look in your global system language folder

11937832
url.action	html.beginform
url.action and html.beginform now take a negligible amount of time even with lots of routes

11937837
try-catch	exception-handling
i would also only use them in cases where i have try-catch blocks around the calling code that can catch and handle the exception-handling appropriately

11937837
try-catch	exception-handling
so for example i might have a case where i instantiate a database connection within a try-catch block and then have the db abstraction layer throw an exception-handling in cases where the connection could not be established

11937913
min	max	aggregate-functions	sum
i want to get aggregate-functions values sum avg max min for each month within each year

you can then load the strings from the appropriate language when a page is requested in django this is done automatically after some configuration i can imagine it to be similar in flask

11937959
folder	directory
if this is the case move everything in the public directory one folder up so it s in the docroot again and remove the public folder which is no longer needed

11937967
width	height
pass the parameters to width and height static or dynamic upto you inside the widthdp and heightdp variable and put it in a webviewclient and it should work fine

11937995
width	height
i ve had a look at a few jquery plugins which allows the user to upload and crop an image and most of them seem to work by posting the x and y coords and the width and height to the server

11938024
filtering	grouping
the grouping by clause is not where you should be filtering formatting your data

11938024
aggregate-functions	sum
of course you could use whatever aggregate-functions you want instead of sum

11938026
onclick	onchange
i suggest onclick instead of onchange should work for you if your select element changes when user chooses different option

11938074
post	put
http post data is usually populated in _post php input will usually contain put data

11938079
spaces	delimiter

put	get	superclass	subclassing
my subclassing are all data processors and the superclass defines the common code between them which allows them to get the data parse it and put it where it needs to go

11938486
versioning	upgrade
now upgrade to the same versioning of modx that should fix all your path issues

11938497
post	get
first if you want to hide the data you should switch to post rather than get

11938569
uilabel	uibutton
since your uibutton and uilabel are subviews of the same view you can tag your label and use viewwithtag to find it from your button s action code

11938613
post	get
as suggested by sixeightzero post should be used instead of get in such cases

11938648

opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
this javascript works in firefox ie google-chrome but not in opera

11938753
inherited	properties
you could have properties inherited from an abstract base class say abstractproperty that does not have a templated type then have propertymanager accept the abstractproperty arguments

11938772
put	get
i put your javascript at the bottom of the page to get it to work without the need for a timeout

11938786
matplotlib	scipy
i ll need at least numpy scipy pyqt4 pyopengl h5py optionaly matplotlib

11943556
submit	submission
i suspect it has something to do with when i click submit it is submission the submitano and not the query so the next page is simply picking up the last query that was typed

11943571

if you have a database the most desirable option is to geocode the addresses as you enter them in the database then use the coordinates from the database to place the markers rather than geocoding them on the fly

11943574
vb6	vba
this using wininet is vb6 but should also work in vba excel

11943576

11943594
profiling	debugging
i don t know why but for some reason the profiling schema under xcode had release config instead of debugging

11943637
for-loop	arrays

11943786
int	double
you should have written 150.0 208 and 190.0 209 to instruct the compiler to divide them as double s not int

11943812
xdebug	xhprof
as opposed to xhprof profiling with xdebug produces output as the script runs which means even if the script hangs or times out you will be able to dissect the trace generated up to that point

11943817
for-loop	loops
try using a regular for-loop instead or a while loops

11943861
viewmodel	caliburn.micro
thirdly you might want to consider a conventions based mvvm framework such as caliburn.micro which will allow you to use actions instead of wpf commanding which means considerably less boilerplate code binding up verbs on your viewmodel with events on your view as well as other advantages

11943873

see this fiddle for an example of a 100 width height layout made possible with absolutely positioned elements

11944060
powerpc	i386
most sources seem to suggest cmake_system_processor but that s a bad solution because that will always return i386 on os x for example no matter whether you re compiling for i386 x86_64 powerpc or ppc64

11944084
put	get
as per my understanding that if you re trying to get an inside container move outside of its outside container you need to put relative and absolute positioning like this

11944091
x86	64bit
unless you actually need the 64bit memory space in your nlreg client just set the target platform in your client project to x86 not anycpu then it ll always work regardless of 32- or 64bit os

11944486
packets	multicast
hi guys i have a multicast socket that is receiving packets and is working fine

11944506
getter	setter
you could use getter and setter

11944514
hide	show
the reason why hide and show dont work is because those ase jquery functions if you re using mootools and would like to use hide and show you need to write functions like so

11944562
for-loop	loops
you could also replace that while loops with a for-loop since you re just incrementing an index

11944568
put	get
in prepareforsegue on first window i get the code i need and put it into the second view instance

but if tcp were a layer above udp it would be limited by udp s semantics tcp ports are bound to a connection udp datagrams are not

11945008
crossover	mutation
if the number is within an allowable scope i will use brute force loop through all the possiblity instread of using genetic algorithm because to design ga and the possibility factor crossover mutation rate are not easy

11945054
versioning	upgrade
you could try either casting the return value from drassistreport.findone to a basicdbobject or upgrade the versioning of morphia that you re using to a versioning whose morphia.fromdbobject method takes a dbobject rather then requiring a basicdbobject

11945124

11945563

division	addition	division	multiplication	addition	multiplication
on simple low-cost processors typically bitwise operations are substantially faster than division several times faster than multiplication and sometimes significantly faster than addition

11945579
addition	multiplication
while modern processors usually perform addition and multiplication just as fast as bitwise operations due to their longer instruction pipelines and other architectural design choices bitwise operations do commonly use less power performance because of the reduced use of resources

11945642

11945792
getter	setter
i would save amtime and pmtime in instance variables and access them in my code through self.amtime and self.pmtime since they are properties getter setter methods will retain release appropriately

new and delete can not be safely mixed with malloc realloc and free

11946052
free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	malloc
but c++ can itself use malloc realloc and free sometimes fine but for proper objects it ll only get you so far lots of existing c++ library code hardcodes use of new and delete and you d need to handle placement-newing and destructing objects yourself

11946052
free	malloc
you could explore defining your own new and delete operator in terms of malloc and free - i ve never seen it done though

11946068
width	height
as for the actual information needed i m looking for the position and size x y width height of a window selected by the user preferably as with xwininfo via the mouse but searching by name would be acceptable as well

action-filter	onactionexecuting
or if you write a custom action-filter that uses the onactionexecuting event to pull the domain model that was passed to the view map it to the view model using automapper and substitute the model with the view model for the view you could further simplify the repetitive code

11946357

the war has built in checksums so if an entry in the war has the same path last-modified crc and size then it is a good candidate for exclusion from the delta so you take a safer hash or two sha-256 and md5 for example to give to different functions to compare with and if those hash are the same

floating-point	integer
the simple summary of tskuzzy s answer is use a floating-point buffer to store the pre-bloom image and either convolve into a second floationg-point buffer whence you saturate the pixels back into integer format or saturate on the fly to convert each output pixel back to integer before storing it directly in an integer output buffer

11954188
floating-point	fixed-point
the airy convolution must be done with headroom in either fixed-point or floating-point and these days the former isn t usually worth the hassle with fast fpus so common so that brighter spots in the image will bleed correspondingly more over their neighbouring areas

cut out the bit about the request stream - it s only for post and put

the problem is that when some other windows cover my jframe and then uncover it the content of the jframe is not repainted - unless i resize or min max the jframe

11957132
width	height
i want to create a one-page website that would be composed of a series of panels each the size of the viewport both in height and width and with different background colors

11957139

this can be based on how you declare variables where you don t set them to a value at all or in your other lifecycle functions they are cleared such as onpause or onresume

11957147
hide	show
i want to show a div when i mouse over the hyperlink and hide it when i mouseout

in the code below i get the pre-dispatched and index action log messages but do not get the post action and as you can expect it also does not redirect me to the homepage when it is complete

11957271
width	margin
the thing about html elements though it that you can t always depend on width alone since there are some things that add to the actual space the elements take up such as margin and border

11957271
width	margin
you can either remove the border padding and margin or tweak the width of the two elements

11957290
uploadify	plupload
it appears to me that your best bet would be to use an uploader such uploadify or plupload that resolve this issue using html5 flash or hacks based on how you set them up

11957315
width	margin
the width property does not take the margin padding or border into consideration

11957315
width	margin
to get around this you either want to set the margin padding and border to 0px reduce the percentage width a tiny amount to compensate or the most complex option wrap the inputs in an invisible div and set the width of that instead

11957318
hash	salt
you store the hash value and the salt if it is per user

11957318
hash	salt
when the user authenticates you take the password they give you prepend the salt and hash that

11957324
equals	gethashcode
note if one uses this pattern one should override gethashcode and equals for the deeply-immutable type but not the mutable one

11957330
client-side	server-side
personally i would just write a php script or set up mod_proxy to fetch the file on the server-side to avoid the client-side cross-domain issue altogether

11957377
integer	unsigned
2 incompatible pointer to integer conversion sending int to parameter of type nsuinteger aka unsigned int

11957426
ubuntu	freebsd
i doubt it is in two lines should be in one at least in ubuntu so my guess in freebsd same

11957445
put	get
before i put down the query i have so far i just want to say that i can get this information easily through multiple queries so if this is the best practice then disregard improving the query but i was aiming to minimize the number of queries needed to get all needed information

11957446
min	max
each series is shown with a vertical line ranging from the min to the max with a tick mark at the average

11957450
g++	gcc
this avoid a copy from named struct to indexed array and vice-versa and replace it with a generic solution and is thus easier to maintain i have very few places to change when i augment the state vector .it also work well with various compiler i tested several versions of gcc g++ and msvc

11957493
button	checkbox
so here instead of a radio button group i can have multiple checkbox selected

11957515
int	chars
but for the sake of explaining some regex your problem is that d+. d+ matches one or more digits followed by any chars followed by one or more digits. if you gave it an int greater than 99 it would work since you re matching

11957548
spaces	delimiter
in direct answer to you question no you cannot specify 2 spaces as a delimiter

11957549
mvp	presenter
here is an example mvp model view presenter - passive view with the message box

either way when the share operation completes the buildpath for libs android dependencies does not have the android-support-v4.jar in the location specified which was in the workspace

11957558
google-chrome	firefox
this way it is working for both google-chrome and firefox at my computer

11957648
websphere	ibm
we ran into a problem with ibm s websphere application server where we had to set the rule for classloaders to parent last at least if my memory doesn t fail me here so that it would use the classpath from the jvm instance first and then use the classloader for websphere because we loaded a log4j.jar that was older than the one ibm started including in a newer version of websphere

11957648
jar	manifest.mf
another option would be to expand the jar update the manifest.mf file to include absolute references to the properties then re-jar the files into a custom version

11957751
tcpclient	networkstream
i have an application that communicates with a modem using a tcpclient networkstream streamwriter and streamreader

11957772
portrait	landscape
i have an app with several normal activities which can run on either landscape or portrait

11957772
portrait	landscape
on some device such as samsung galaxy tab 7 and galaxy s3 a rotation animation is shown when going from a normal portrait activity to camera landscape activity and back

11957772
portrait	landscape
this is confusing for user because landscape activity simulates being on portrait

11957772
portrait	landscape
onconfigurationchanged is called only when rotating same activity activity a on portrait - activity a on landscape

11957772
portrait	landscape
but it s not called when going from activity a on portrait - activity b on landscape

11957772
portrait	landscape
removed normal transitions portrait- portrait and landscape- landscape but it didn t removed rotation animation portrait- landscape and vice versa

11957772
portrait	landscape
this happens when changing from camera activity locked to landscape to other activity while holding phone on portrait

11957802
hide	show
so hide the password fields and make sure your registration code will allow this you may need to stick in a random password behind the scenes if your code requires some password text just don t show it to the user

i ve tried with both atomikos 5.6.0 and bitronix 2.1.3 xa jta implementations

11957881
for-loop	arrays
i debugged and i think the error is coming from the setlayoutparams but it doesn t make sense because if i take out the for-loop and create just 1 button not an arrays of buttons then it ll work

11957901
spaces	delimiter
then i split it into tokens using delimiter and spaces

11957925
dictionary	map

for-loop	loops
in the traditional for-loop you have to study the body of loops for unusual control flow continue break return and dinking with the iterator in this case skip the next element with ++it

11958175
hide	show
in the window s onscroll get the current scroll position as well as the div s position from the top of the page and show hide your element accordingly

11958276
onclick	onkeydown
i would take the onclick and onkeydown out of your html elements.

11958276
keydown	keyup
i used keypress here instead of keydown because keydown will focus the link and then keyup will fire the click event

11958287
setcontentview	findviewbyid
findviewbyid works only after you have done a setcontentview

11958287

11958474
decimal	ieee
the ieee 754 double-precision binary floating-point format which is what javascript uses for its number type gives you a precision of 15 - 17 significant decimal digits

11958519
filtering	grouping
i would remove all the grouping and sums and see if you can filtering by one invoice produce an unique set of rows for all the data

11958522
fadein	fadeout
when a particular link is clicked it should be displayed with fadein slow and vice versa for fadeout

so while the original image whose image orientation was either right or left was being rotated onto its side by this line which is why i was cropping with an x offset in both portrait and landscape sizes the filtered image s orientation is up

11958855
keydown	mousedown	keydown	keyup	keyup	mousedown
you can do two things run a function with setinterval which checks for the values of the textarea periodically or bind a combination of mousedown keydown keyup keypress and keyup events to detect every possible way of inputting data then comparing the current length of the textarea s text with the last value 0 initially to see whether there s a change

i m not sure if this is a bug with angularjs firefox google-chrome or whether it s simply a quirk...however

11959225
getter	setter
so in rowcontent.cs i added getter and setter depending on the data i needed from the form

11959225

in this same file you re going to want to add some more getter setter functions depending on what you want to do just like the other user control

11959312
post	get
i ve already configured my script to bypass the confirmation page using a cookie and i ve figured out how to use a post request to get to all new issues rather than the default of today but now i need to cycle through all of the 19 pages

tcplistener	tcpclient
i have found tcpclient and tcplistener but i am unable to broadcast an ip to 255.255.255.255.

11959435
google-chrome	firefox
this is because ie will scale the whole iframe to your set zoom size not the content within it which is what google-chrome and firefox do

11959435
google-chrome	firefox
it works for me in google-chrome firefox and ie8

11959452

11959539
children	parent
you can t change properties of parent in css upon interaction with children - it works one way only

11959544
width	height
both of the previous two options would require individual items to have their height width set

11959547
hide	show
if you want the user control to display different shapes you can expose a property on the control data bind to that property and inside the setter of the property read the value and toggle the visibility of the various xaml shapes to show or hide whatever parts of the composite image you want

11959559
width	height
i know that normally an image will be displayed at two times its normal size due to the scale factor and in making your site compatible with a retina display you must take a 2x scale image and set its in-browser rendering width and height to half its actual dimensions

11959565
french	hebrew
this solution should work for english hebrew french german characters and more

11959574

my random function takes a set of points values and interpolation those points with a polynomial splines

11959589
pop-up	dialog

11959599
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
by every browser i mean safari firefox google-chrome and ie9

11959601
getter	setter
2 create class with getter setter for list and int and return the object for getlist call

11959640
folder	directory
further more if you are creating a multi-module project from scratch you start by creating the parent project then when you add modules to it they each show up as individual projects in eclipse with the physical directory living under the parent project folder as needed by the default maven build process

11959643
hide	show
i want to be able to hide and show it and i don t want the whole app to die just because the console was closed

11959657

11959659
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it works in firefox but not in google-chrome or safari

11959710

11959845
xna	slimdx
i haven t tried using c# with directx myself but from what i ve read your main options for directx and c# are either slimdx which you count out or xna which many users seem to find lacking in features especially from the newer versions of directx

11959889

which will ultimately scale the image to the jpanel s size by using getscaledinstance int width int height imageobserver io

11959918
clang	llvm
note i am using mac os x mountain lion and apple llvm compiler 4.0 basically a snapshot of clang 3.1 svn

11959928
width	height
if either width or height is a negative number then a value is

11959928
width	height
if both width and height are negative then the original

11959938
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
the widget isn t getting things like viewwillappear viewdidappear etc

11959938
uiview	calayer

11959973
hide	show
it works - id_2 show hide correctly

11960000
put	get
this can get you a long way while you figure out some other place to put all that data you are shoving into the user s session

11960001
couchbase	couchdb	membase	couchbase	membase	couchdb
i d like to add that couchbase is a faster and more scalable option than couchdb the 2.0 version introduces views at a high level it s a distributed memcached membase server merged with couchdb but of course more sophisticated than just mashing them together

11960001
couchbase	couchdb	membase	couchbase	membase	couchdb
founders of both couchdb and membase server created couchbase

11960092
gridview	rowdatabound
you can use gridview rowdatabound event to access drop down list similarly set selectedindexchanged event for the dropdownlist

11960104
addition	multiplication
and the value of this expression evaluated according to the precedence rules is 62 because multiplication has higher precedence than addition

11960217
hide	show
i have a script that show more info when clicked and when clicked again it hide the info

11960217
hide	show
the problem is that when clicked it show and hide information of all the div s with the same class name instead of only the one that was clicked

11960219
integer	unsigned
this works because unsigned int and unsigned long are the same size 4 bytes on ios so changing the typedef of nsuinteger makes the compiler and the developer happy but the hardware doesn t care since it s just doing integer math in both cases

11960238
ubuntu	linux
i m not too familiar with linux systems but i was able to get the pahole command working on a system running ubuntu linux

11962352
google-chrome	firefox
the height of the gray first line is 32px in both google-chrome and firefox

11962352
fontfamily	font-size
it s a result of how the operating system happens to render that particular fontfamily at that particular font-size with that particular line-height in that particular browser

11962352
fontfamily	font-size
choosing a fontfamily a font-size and a line-height helps to minimize the inconsistency

11962621
uilabel	uitextview
this isn t flexible or adaptive and whether you are using the interface builder to configure the object displaying the text uilabel or uitextview or other class the second line of the text may disappear because it falls below the visible area set-up when you create the uilabel or uitextview

11962621
uilabel	uitextview
i ll use uilabel as an example here but both uilabel and uitextview objects have properties you can set programmatically or in interface builder that will effectively enable them not only to stretch their display area instead of shrinking your text but also to wrap your text at the most logical point based on the new size of the display area

11962636
post	get
note the answer turned out to be instead of in which the second does not allow dom submission while also submitting that input s value in the get post data

11962650
put	get
i would suggest you get the data out and put it into a database that is easy for you to access

hide	show
i want to hide the label just like what you can do with richtexteditor by unchecking show label

11963770

as the answers above me suggest it s because it has virtually no size you need either to put content inside to resize it or to set width height or padding in css bordertop class or you can put another empty inside it with set size

then set static_root to be some folder on your filesystem that is not the same as any of your directory listed in staticfiles_dirs list

11964040
memcpy	strcpy
you probably want to define your copy constructor for class a to ensure the problem your asking about is handled correctly though not by using memcpy or strcpy

11964041
stdout	fflush
now on most implementations stdout is line-buffered which means a n triggers a fflush

11964077
width	height
everything works great the 1px high image scales in width height perfectly.

11964083
put	get
when you do it would be great if you factored it into a library and put it up on hackage--windows does not usually get much love in haskell land as i myself show p so i m sure other windows programmers would be grateful for an easy way to take screenshots

11964102
free	malloc
the problem is if the second malloc fails the free only frees the base first malloc

11964102
free	malloc
it does not free any other memory allocations created by the second malloc

11964145
folder	directory
copy msvcr71.dll from javaâ s bin directory to tomcatâ s bin folder

11964145
folder	directory

11964172
post	get
if that doest fix it post a comment and i ll work up a sample to match yours and see if i can get it to work.

11964175
post	get
i get a php fatal error uncaught oauthexception a user access token is required to request this resource. which makes no sense because i can post to the feed as the page no problem

11964178
google-chrome	safari
the code snippet works perfectly fine on ie safari mozilla and google-chrome

11964245
hide	show
solved php-mode on depends on c-mode outline-mode and hs-mode hide-show-mode to manage codes so i use keys in outline-mode to hide and show the blocks.in my emacs use c-c c-a to show all codes and use c-c c-t to hide a body

11964264
rss	feed
i am trying to add a rss feed to my website using google feed

11964281

while this approach appears to work fine in ie firefox it appears to not work so well in google-chrome

11964286
ubuntu	linux
3 ubuntu linux machines

11964304
mouseleave	mouseenter
deprecated as of jquery 1.8 the name hover used as a shorthand for the string mouseenter mouseleave

11964304
mouseleave	mouseenter
it attaches a single event handler for those two events and the handler must examine event.type to determine whether the event is mouseenter or mouseleave

11964400
hide	show
i have tried using document.getelementbyid and add remove class that i named show hide but that doesn t work very well i might have wrong attributes in those classes i am not sure

11964403
nsurl	nsstring
selectedfileurl is an nsurl instance not an nsstring - you probably misunderstood the docs of the framework library you re using

11964445
google-chrome	safari
note i am setting both html and body height to 100 which is needed for google-chrome and safari

11964447
post	put
i would also avoid using query strings along with post or put data

11964453
hide	show
before jquery i used the following method to show hide an element

11964453
hide	show
you can either pass it true or false as a parameter to show or hide the element or if you don t pass it a parameter it will try to figure out whether to show or hide the element

11964472
my.cnf	mysql.sock
i tried this solution but it turns out the section in my.cnf already has the socket pointing to the location of mysql.sock verified by using sudo find -name mysql.sock

11964481
maven	pom.xml
adding hibernate 3.5.x to a maven pom.xml build

11964488
google-chrome	safari
note i am setting both html and body height to 100 needed for google-chrome and safari

11964488
google-chrome	firefox
tested and works fine in ie9 firefox google-chrome

11964505
for-loop	arrays
mob arrays length will be zero to start with so the for-loop will never happen

11964507
put	get
if you wanted to get between 1 and 6 you would put

11964568
folder	directory
if puts files in different folder then solutions becomes very slow while build debugging also searching file in folder directory is painful sometimes

11964569
int	chars
also you shouldnt store phone numbers as int i recommend better a chars or varchar

11964573
single-quotes	backslash
any other single-quotes must each be preceded by a backslash

11964623
mp3	ogg
edit i forgot to mention that i am loading mp3 files not ogg

11964626
int	chars
you should use dword 1 or bool true there are lots of documents that show code with chars int dword bool but the right one is book or dword maybe int in some systems.

11964637
children	parent
here is my scenario i have parent table to many children table

11964637
children	parent
from parent which should give 500 parent with related children

11964637
children	parent
one second request it says each item of the 500 parent is not 2nd level cache and it generates 1 query for parent and 500 queries more to get children for each parent

11964644
post	get
then create a simple plugin for joomla that sends get s and post s to your api either crud or just reads

11964655
button	checkbox
on the phones running icecream sandwhich if they check the checkbox of every row and then click the delete button of the last row the app crashes with an arrayindexoutofbounds error

11964702

you can create multiple viewstub in your xml file and can show the one you want against each button click and hide others

11964793
debian	linux
you can install it from your linux mac repository usually it has name ectags or exuberant-ctags on debian or from it s site

11964809
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
so far we ve accomplished taking a screenshot of the current page with extensions for firefox safari and google-chrome - which were all more or less easy

11964814
folder	dir	folder	directory
however in another folder i have a different directory called dir specifically other dir

11964847
margin	height
you basically need to make sure that either the content has a bottom margin greater than or equal to the height of the footer or if the content is in a container of some sort that it s container has a bottom padding equal to or greater than the height of the footer

11964865
post	put
this allows user agents to represent other methods such as post put

11964893
folder	dir
it should then only ignore the dir folder that is at the root

11964947
networkstream	sslstream
the stream itself is typically a networkstream or a sslstream

11965039
sbt	giter8
got a fresh homebrew install of scala giter8 sbt 0.11.3 and maven and everything checks out for the most part

11965057
int	boolean
it will work only for boolean values as they will be casted to int 1 or 0

11965090
sorting	filtering
however i couldn t find a solution in the jquery-api for filtering and sorting

11965123
pop-up	dialog
jquery mobile 1.2 alpha introduces pop-up while it already has a similar widget called dialog

11965141
getter	setter
lets suppose i have a field with short defined getter setter like following

11965165
trie	tree
there is no silver bullet but a radix tree gives the advantages of a trie fast look up and insert at least asymptotically - with a better space consumption

11965185
mouseover	mouseout
so the li itself and the div each remove one displayed class on mouseover and remove it s own respective class on mouseout

11965211
implements	extends
i use zookeeperaccessimpl but i suppose this isn t the best name it hint only implements the zookeeperaccess but not extends abstractzookeeperaccess

11965211
implements	extends
i use abstract class to implements some code for interface and provide some code to be abstact for zookeeperaccessimpl to extends

11965215
postgresql	mysql
mysql is cross-platform and it doesn t matter which os it is running on same is true for postgresql and most of other database platforms so you can switch server side if you are not using any platform-specific feature

11965278
ubuntu	linux
i was trying to setup a scheduled task in linux ubuntu server 12.04 cronjob to perform a daily backup of all my mysql databases on midnight

11965290
google-chrome	firefox
i tried it to open on google-chrome firefox and ie but none of browser display line while circle was ok

11965300
children	parent
the constructor of each view model creates its children via mapping options and each level is passed a reference to its parent

11965307
post	get
i can get more specific if you post more code

11965352
for-loop	loops
also right now the string is only 1 digit long once the user inputs his or her name i shall use a for-loop to loops all of the letters completely

11965353
gtk	cairo
toolkit such as wx qt gtk cairo opengl swing etc

11965398
subtract	add	int	chars
you can t convert a string directly into an int you need to take one chars at a time and subtract the value of the chars a then add 1

11965403
for-loop	loops
if you need that functionality either use a different type of loops for-loop or maybe do-while-loop or test for number of elements first

11965408
getter	setter
the getter is never hit after the value is modified in the setter

11965449
mouseover	mouseout
in this case if i drag mouse into the area of mouseover it stop auto refresh until i drag mouseout out the area of mouseover

11965453
post	get
but the dbgprint message that you may not be seeing is because post vista the debug messages logged with dbgprint get filtered and not shown in the output

11965469
ant	maven
i have an existing ant and we planned to use new maven to call it

11965469
ant	maven
i have not compared class pathes set by it and those available to maven but my test showed they dont match and ant won t run with some pathes passed to it from maven

11965530
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
the adk doesn t want to allow me to add an onclicklistener to the listview and instead insists that adding an onitemclicklistener is the way to go - but obviously this won t work for an empty list

11965539
google-chrome	firefox
the solution was to debug with firefox extensions google-chrome

11965540
tabcontrol	tabitem
i guess i should elaborate a bit on the real case i m working on i have a tabcontrol where the content of each tabitem is developed elsewhere but typically complex

11965594
hash	md5
once you have created your own unique key you will need to get its md5 hash and obtain a maps api key for it like you did for the debug certificate

11965634
mouseover	mouseout
but if you only want to occur the auti refresh only on mouseover and again want to stop the auto refresh on mouseout then you can do as follows

11965698
cos	exp
generally one can get such a function by using combinations of built-in functions like + cos or exp that are vectorized as well

11965734
m2e	pom.xml
because the native library location is cleared presumably by m2e re-configuring the project according to the pom.xml

11965757
width	height
adding to the other answers the most important thing to get this to work is to set the layout width or height to 0px

11965778
getter	setter
if it was up to me i would avoid those magic getter setter either way and just add your own getter setter methods to the class

11965786
crypt	hash
you can use crypt or hash instead

11965875
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
in your java code you can then add an onclicklistener to your emptylist object which returns false if the listview has an item count greater than 0 allowing the click to pass down the view heirarchy and be picked up by your onitemclicklistener

11965929
getter	setter
what i understood from above definition is that creating variables mark them private and generate getter-setter for those variables and use object to access those getter and setter

11965929
hide	show
abstraction is the process of abstraction in java is used to hide certain details and only show the essential features of the object

11965954
min	max
this strictly follows your requirements not to use sort min max but also uses python best practice by not re-inventing the wheel

11965959
fancybox	caroufredsel
i m trying to get caroufredsel and fancybox to work together like they do here

11965959
fancybox	caroufredsel
fancybox works if i remove all caroufredsel code

11966111
google-chrome	firefox
this is not happening in firefox 10 google-chrome or ie for example

11966131
hide	show
after that i can in java code hide show some buttons in tray by id or select some of them with another color .

11966138
width	height
i ve experienced that when you don t limit your height or width of your layout padding tends to give better results sometimes

11966162
width	height
then when found the page width and height via some dynamic computation from database i will override it by using

11966172
oncreate	setcontentview
the workaround of calling settitle in oncreate before setcontentview should do the trick though

11966192
for-loop	loops
another difference regards breaking out of loops with break or return in the for-loop

11966222
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i have a uiviewcontroller segued to from a uitableviewcontroller which is itself embedded in a uinavigationcontroller

11966248
stdout	stderr
in process a i have the following code fragment after process.waitfor where outt and errt are the threads to read process b s stdout and stderr respectively

11966248
stdout	stderr
anyway in the run method of the outt errt threads i have the following where the pipe variable is a writer instance i am capturing stdout stderr of the sub-process to

11966248
stdout	stderr
the in variable is the stdout or stderr stream obtained from process

11966251
httpconnection	downloading
just use httpconnection class and stream classes to upload downloading files to and from the server

11966284
pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	hash	hash	salt
it s a pbkdf2 password hash function with a random salt generator

11966329
folder	directory
that is when i install tortoisesvn manually myself i do not see the file and cannot find the directory httpd under the installation folder of svn

11966334
slider	galleriffic
everything works fine if the galleriffic slider show is in an iframe inside of the div facybox uses but it breaks if i try and initialize the galleriffic inside of the page that contains the div that facybox uses

11966345
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome everything works fine but in ie when the form is submitted the httpget action is being fired rather than the httppost

11966404
children	parent
how my xml node structure works is i have multiple children elements of parent that also occur multiple times

11966404
children	parent
i am able to get to the children elements but only the first one of each parent

11966404
children	parent
when i echo count i m able to get a total count of the children elements for each reoccurring parent but i can t seem to work with that data

11966437
superclass	subclassing
another option is subclassing nsarraycontroller and over-riding the superclass methods like add to write your code for opening your slide sheet maybe before calling the superclass method

11966445
listview	gridview
i want to create a datatemplate in code behind for my treeview with a listview which has a gridview which columns count depends on my data

11966486
pop-up	dialog
when the select object dialog pop-up search textblock and add it

11966493
public	protected
it can however access public and protected members of b and a

11966514
put	get
but when i put the swf in iframe i get an error like

11966538
super	abstract
to avoid instanceof i m not sure what would be best but you could chain an extra method specific to an entity class which then calls the super abstract class if necessary

11966559
daemons	systemd
on a freebsd systemd in the top output below the mysql daemons is in state sbwait

11966570
post	get
i wasn t using kendo.aspnetmvc.js which made kendo ui use get instead of post

11966671
accessor	properties
to my surprise the set accessor gets invoked every time i select an object of type vessel in the linq code with value as null of the properties

11966682
post	get
then in the click event handler you get the data you want and post to the service manually

11966682
post	get
you have to build the post request manually and get the response from the remote service

11966683
getter	setter
if it should be available from other classes you should implement getter and setter

11966712
integer	unsigned
let transform be a function that takes an m-bit unsigned integer x and an index i as arguments

11966722
debian	linux
i am running node.js on my linux debian server and am having problems running a .sh script trying to install rpm

11966735
x86	64bit
in c c++ code local variables are allocated on the stack and the space used there is different between 32bit and 64bit mode due to the point below and due to the different rules for passing arguments 32bit x86 usually on the stack 64bit x86 in part in registers

11966735
int	double
currently two main branches of 64bit environments exist il32p64 what win64 uses - int and long are int32_t only uintptr_t is uint64_t talking in terms of the sized int from and lp64 what un x uses - int is int32_t long is int64_t and uintptr_t is uint64_t but there s the subdivisions of different alignment rules as well - some environments assume long float or double align at their respective sizes while others assume they align at multiples of four bytes

11966735
int	chars
the examples just given are only about language primitives chars int long etc. but of course affect all sorts of platform-dependent runtime library data types whether size_t off_t time_t handle essentially any nontrivial struct union class .

11966759
for-loop	loops
then make a for-loop to loops through the numbers 0 to 100 and test each number with that function

11966763
getter	setter
we always say that data will be encapsulated if we simply define variables private and define getter setter to access those variables

11966783
width	height
you may set height and width of the element before you call galleria.run #galleria

11966789
getter	setter
you can encapsulate the logic under getter setter for example

11966821
getter	setter
the data is safe because you can do additional logic in your getter setter and its not possible to change the values of your variable

11966841
getter	setter
the only way to do it would be with encapsulation or simpler put give getter and setter to that field thus you always know and can check react to fields updates for example

11966887
getter	setter
the way i understand your question is although we declare variables as private as those variables can be accessed using getter and setter the are not private

11966887
getter	setter
well when using getter and setter you can restrict access to the private variables

11966914
uilabel	uitextview
inside of these 3 different views i have a bunch of stuff uilabel uitextview etc

11967033
mouseleave	mouseenter
all you have to do is define on mouseenter and mouseleave for each maindiv

11967043
post	get
the reason why the viewstate per default is serialized and sent to the client is i guess that it s the easiest way to get it back when the client performs a post back

11967075
width	height
i need to get each image with its corresponding width and height properties if they exist

11967089
getter	setter
i have solved this by adding into basearticle and using getter setter to effectively hide this property in my basearticle entity and lifecycle callbacks to handle nullable

11967100
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
with jquery i alerted the div height in firefox google-chrome and opera the div height has 164px but on ie 7 it has 172

11967106
webkit	gecko
it works fine in webkit and gecko but not opera

11967149
google-chrome	firefox
should make ie google-chrome and firefox react more consistantly

11967152
textview	imageview
you can try using textview rather than imageview or imagebutton and then assign background for the text view as the image you want and set the text you want for textview and make it wrap_content for layout_width

11967166
wordpress	joomla
drupal and joomla are a lot harder to grasp then wordpress from my understanding

11967182
getter	setter
in general encapsulation of fields by getter and setter leaves more flexibility for changes

11967182
getter	setter
data is neither hidden nor safe by using getter and setter

11967191
email-ext	jenkins
i want to edit email body in pre-send script in email-ext jenkins plugin

11967192
post	get
when i view my facebook fanpage app by web browser i can get the signed_request parameter in my post method

11967374
google-chrome	firefox
i created a form which works in google-chrome and ie but not firefox

11967388
freeglut	glew
i have also installed the packages like freeglut mesa-utils glew and so on

11967447
inherited	properties
the opacity is then inherited by the child and cannot be overridden with it s own properties

11967472
int	chars
agetxt.gettext returns a string object containing the chars typed by the user and you try to put it in a int var which can only contain int

11967472
put	get
just put it in a string object then parse it to get the integer value by doing integer.parseint mystringobject

11967514
min	max
see how min max handles nan -

11967518
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i am having this issue only in ie 9 otherwise i have no problem in other browser such as firefox safari google-chrome etc

11967553
awt	swing
please bear in mind that in awt and swing components there are many methods paint paintborder paintchildren paintcomponent repaint and others that are called via call-back whenever the gui engine finds suitable

11967560
icq	xmpp
also you can use so called transports to use xmpp to transparently send reviece messages from other protocols like icq msn aol etc which may be what you need if you really need icq

11967605
folder	directory
i need to keep a certain svn folder inside a mounted boxcryptor directory that is located inside a dropbox folder

11967605
folder	directory
i only want to keep the working directory there without the .svn folder

11967619
awt	swing
the article painting in awt and swing additional paint properties opacity suggests why the opaque property allows swing s paint system to detect whether a repaint request on a particular component will require the additional repainting of underlying ancestors or not. because you extend jcomponent the opaque property is false by default and optimization is not possible

11967692
int	chars
so the condition is true for any minus sign followed by any int or chars

11967730
versioning	upgrade
i have happily used various versioning of xcode for a while and recently upgrade to xcode 4.4.1 and ml

11967741
width	height
you may want to play around with the width height to better meet your requirements though

11967741
width	height
another idea would be to create some kind of paint manager or paintable interface that given a graphics content could paint it self obviously you d like to know some more info like width height

11967746
google-chrome	firefox
the graphs work perfectly in google-chrome and firefox

11967837
google-chrome	firefox
this has allowed me to completely move from firefox firebug to google-chrome

11967837
portrait	landscape
you can set the screen resolution to whatever you like here and even quickly toggle between portrait and landscape

11967882
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	linux	centos	linux
now i would like to know if there is a more general way of changing the generated escape sequences in linux ubuntu centos

11967883
folder	directory
so when i create an alternative view from the original one it will placed inside mytheme folder some where other than module s directory that obviously cannot access script folder of original view

11967923
button	checkbox
i want to add a checkbox in the scrollviewer when the user clicks the button

11967935
post	get
the target php page was edited to handle post and get

11967959
highcharts	highstock
i am using the highcharts js library and in particular the highstock timeseries chart like this one

11967979
google-chrome	firefox
it works in ie 8 firefox and google-chrome

11967982
for-loop	loops
i am trying to paginate the results using limit keyword for 30 records in select statement after check the number of pages i have used 2 loops for-loop for header and while loops for result rows and limiting using limit

11967994
nsdatecomponents	nsdateformatter
edit if you are asking this because you want to output a time in readable form don t use nsdatecomponents -- use nsdateformatter

11968033
post	get
when i send a post request to a server if the response is 200 i get the json body

11968043
many-to-many	one-to-many
i m afraid i can t help you with the many-to-many relationship as i m trying to solve the same problem at the moment but as far as one-to-many for existing instances goes you can add a foreign key as an optional parameter in the hasmany hasone and belongsto functions it defaults to classname _id

11968048
punctuation	words
similar situation but trying to match a words after a punctuation

11968130
backgrounding	multitasking
the app can also be put into backgrounding using the multitasking switcher or the multitasking gestures on ipad

11968139
hide	show
the progress bar will show annotating... and the left hand side of the file where the annotations should show up says computing... these will be stuck until i do hide annotations or i manually cancel the task

11968140
user-controls	tabcontrol
im writing a wpf application where usercontrols are added to a tabcontrol at runtime - creating a tab for each user-controls

11968140
width	height
the problem then is...these controls can have different width and height which means the tabcontrol must adjust its own width and height accordingly

11968151
vim	emacs
in vim or emacs it can be done by repeat input feature

11968165
range	minimum
ideally i would like to be able to set a minimum height and a maximum height and then have the slick grid auto-size itself within that range based on the number of rows

11968167
min	max	width	height
like islands schould be rounded but variate in shape and scale min max width height

11968170

my hypothesis is that if inet is overridden with a protocol that is empty in this case that would be fins which intends to deal with inet at the userspace level but this appears to be too late for the phone systemd to be satisfied the adb daemons classified as a type of systemd service perhaps cannot work be connected to and android hardware will crash because of this

my idea was to simply make it all a table that fills the page with a height and width of 100 and one row with two cells

i was able to easily give these both the proper widths and height left has width of 6.5in and height of 100 while right has width and height of 100

11976356
width	height
in the right td cell there is an iframe with a width of 100 and a height of 100

11976356
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
this is where the problem is it fills the full width but refuses to be any taller or shorter than the default 150px this is consistent across ie firefox and opera but not google-chrome google-chrome properly stretches the iframe vertically 100

subtract	add
and with this implementation we would need a method for each arithmetic operation add subtract etc.

11998384
subtract	add	int	double	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
edit - enhance question if we think on the java.lang.number from a abstraction perspective we would think that any number can be part of arithmetic operations but yet again it doesn t seem to exist a simple way to add subtract multiplying etc x to a list of number independently of their type int double short...

will speed things up a bit as find won t descend into .git directory but it still does descend into git repositories looking for other .git folder

11998980

also if you are using google-chrome use developers tool to see if there are javascript errors develop for safari

11999012
hid	keyboard
provided you re developing for a version of android with the usb host api which it sounds like you are you ought to be able to write some code to temporarily grab the keyboard s interface from the kernel send the appropriate data to set caps lock and then release the interface so that the hid driver will pick it up

11999019
gridview	rowdatabound
this is usually done in the rowcreated method of the gridview or at least i do it this way as fas as i know on the rowdatabound you only have the data for the row but it doesn t exist on the page yet to find a control in a row use

11999063
for-loop	arrays
if you strip all these out and just call lapack in your for-loop since you already know the dimensions of your matrix and maybe know that it s real not complex things run much faster note that i ve made my arrays larger

11999065

11999120
profiling	benchmarking
first caveat - make sure you have done appropriate profiling or benchmarking before embarking on any optimisation work

11999123
width	height
you can explicitly set width height to image if you know the dimensions for advance

11999123
width	height
this is because jquery load event occurs before all images downloaded and for does not have any width height set to it browser does not know its height so it assumes 0px

11999148
google-chrome	firefox
everything works fine in firefox and google-chrome but ie9 and earlier fails

11999207
pop-up	dialog
another dialog should pop-up select target tab select launch on all compatible devics avd s

11999217
for-loop	loops
on the other hand if you want to construct your own loops always use a for-loop - updating loops variable within a while loops when it s unnecessary is considered poor style because it can lead to nasty bugs

11999308
post	put
you just need to put that menu widget in a layer that only applies to blog post pages

11999316

11999422
switching	screens
edit since you edited your question with the answer code you should have any problem with your switching statement take a look at the following screens shot

11999425
range	max
the query has a subquery that returns a table with all the dates in the range and for every date the max date in the table with the values that is before the given date

11999428
width	height
of course setting the height of a canvas element in css is not the same as setting the height and width as html attributes of each canvas tag

11999435
superclass	subclassing
you must provide a default constructor in your subclassing when in it you need to define a default constructor that will not call a non default constructor in the superclass

11999435
superclass	subclassing
in the example above the subclassing construtor will call super the default constructor of the subclassing so you must provide a defualt construtor in the superclass or write your subclassing this way

11999482
rowdatabound	onclientclick	gridview	onclientclick	gridview	rowdatabound
you could use gridview s rowcreated or rowdatabound events or even on the buttons onclientclick event if that button is on the same row of the gridview just get the sender etc based on your logic

11999500
jobs	cron
if so look into cron jobs

11999502
for-loop	loops
use for-loop to loops through it to print the values scanned

11999531
punctuation	words
tokenise the address into individual words thus ignoring weird punctuation etc. and re-join the string

11999559
width	height
the main parameters needs to be at least flexible in height preferably flexible in width too but not required

11999635
for-loop	loops
the only 1 line after the if statement is consider in the for-loop when loops end the world print

11999663
factors	mean
by good way i mean speed mostly but of course elegance and good architecture are factors too

11999725
stdout	stderr
its standard io stdin stdout stderr operations will be

11999750
post	put
simply put the post s argument is that types have meaning and there is not room in the meaning of int for something like numcapabilities which is execution-context-dependent

11999762
width	height
the problem is that the page title is set to an image of width x height

11999855
junit	testng
simpler approach could have been been junit and testng supporting assert counter which can print not just the number of tests but also asserts used in the test methods

11999859
google-chrome	firefox
this works in ie and firefox and should work in google-chrome

11999864
x86	64bit
you will however need to make separate x86 and x64 builds with the respective architecture s dlls since an any cpu .net application will run in 32-bit mode on a 32-bit os and in 64bit mode on a 64bit os

11999956
