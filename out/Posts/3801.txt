8645821
width	height
you can set the width and height attributes of the image tag like so

8645824
width	height
there are width and height attributes though it would behoove you to do a little reading up on cascading stylesheets css

8646359
google-chrome	safari

salt	md5	crypt	salt	crypt	md5
i read on php.net that md5 is useless and they suggest using crypt + salt

8646455
hash	salt	crypt	salt	crypt	hash
so when i see that the salt is stored in the hash password and that you use that hash password as salt i think crypt + salt is not more secure against a brute force on output hackers who managed to steal hash passwords

8646469
opera	firefox	mp3	ogg
opera and firefox don t play mp3 in html50 but they play ogg

8646495

hash	md5	crypt	hash	crypt	md5
crypt with hash is simply more expensive than md5

8646614
screens	mdpi	screens	hdpi	mdpi	hdpi
if for instance you determine that a view has a height of 400dip it will represent 400px in a mdpi screens 300px in a ldpi screens and 600px in a hdpi screens

include the fstream header file and using std ostream

8646707

this works but when i put it inside a div the div doesn t adopt the size of the contents meaning the red color in the example goes over the entire width of the page if the page can contain the whole text and if i get a horizontal scroll-bar it doesn t go over the initial field of vision

8646832
width	height
also the shrink-wrap works if i leave out the height and colunm-with and instead put just a fixed width

8646876

it s pretty simple i take what i get from the server through post and add them to nsstrings or uiimage in the case of the images for use in a uitableview

8646889

you should keep range min and perhaps set max 160 and min -5 to make the slider render nicely

8646904
put	get
about how to structure your code well simply put i d get the button to start the timer then the timerelapsed event would control the creation of ellipses in the picture box every 1second

8647108
min	max
so you get insert delete and look for a specific element in o 1 and max min delete in o n

8647108
min	max
you can also make max min o 1 and delete o n instead

8647108
min	max
if you are keeping your array sorted it will cause insert delete to be o n but you will gain o logn find and o 1 min max

8647108
min	max
you can get o 1 min max any how for both

8647111

the file loads fine in ie google-chrome and safari

8649143
rss	feed
iâ m looking for a little help guidance on what the best practice may be for creating an rss feed from a drupal 6.19 site

8649179
google-chrome	firefox
apparently this bug has already been reported to google-chrome and firefox

8649213
hide	show
this show hide the .hidden elements when clicking on a .dim element but it also allows you to click on a .hidden element and not toggle it s visibility

8649290
777	tmp
the only way to fix it is a chmod 777 tmp -r and then the site loads straight away

8649343
updatepanel	scriptmanager
what i have already tried is reading updatepanel scriptmanager and scriptmanagerproxy classes codes nothing found

8649343
updatepanel	scriptmanager
i think i might need to create my own updatepanel and or scriptmanager classes for use

8649349
google-chrome	firefox
i work on ubuntu 10.04 i was testing my application using firefox and chromium and i was trying run my application on windows xp using the same web browsers with the same effect just one difference - google-chrome made me install web toolkit...so i did it but it still gives the same error

8649363
16-bit	64bit
16-bit of the address are used to index into a 65536-entry table containing a pointer to a second-level map which tracks a range of the address space normally 2â¹â bytes 64kb for 32-bit processes 2â¹â ¹ bytes 512kb for 64bit processes

8649364
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i tested in firefox google-chrome and opera and those all work fine but i m having a problem with internet explorer surprise

8649464
rss	feed
i would like to provide the user of my android app a preview of each article given to them by an rss feed

8649464
rss	feed
since the user enters the url of the site with the rss feed i don not control the source of the rss i must assume the page is using the rss 2 specifications

8649522
firefox	safari
which will validate as css3 but older versions of firefox and safari will automatically use -moz-border-radius 5px

8649535
for-loop	loops
there s nothing wrong with your for-loop but a while loops is the wrong thing to be using here

8649564
777	tmp	chown	chmod
rather than permitting everyone access to all files and folders within tmp chmod 777 -r tmp you may want to consider ensuring that var www episodecalendar staging is recursively chown d chown -r user group var www episodecalendar staging by whatever user requires access to run the web server

8649578
pull	push
it allows you to do push pull work from an svn remote but still uses git locally and thus to make local commits without pushing to svn repository

8649580
google-chrome	firefox
seems to work fine in google-chrome and firefox

8649594
ncover	partcover
the other way i have seen this done with some other eg ncover partcover coverage tools is to post process the results ie if xml use an xslt transform the xml to remove the coverage data related to the generated partials and then generate the coverage report

8649620
unsigned	short
where utf8 is a char and utf16 is an unsigned short

8649627
width	margin
i tried setting td width for the green portion and setting margin 0 auto but the green just expands to the width of the tr

8649652
google-chrome	firefox
the is support for this in google-chrome and firefox at least although i am not too sure how comprehensive it is

8649655
children	parent
you can also easily create parent children nesting

8649656
cvs	svn
many svn cvs users expect to host related projects together in one

8649669
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
no it s not possible the ntfs or fat filesystems which is what windows uses doesn t record this information

8649706
google-chrome	firefox
i checked it with google-chrome 16.0.912.63 and firefox 10.0 and got similar results

8649767
rss	feed
i am looking for an rss feed published on a facebook page and not a profile

8649807
ssl	https
transport means ssl which have to be https

8649809
hash	md5
node.js computes the md5 hash of the password before using it as the key

8649809
hash	md5
compute the md5 hash of the password and use that as the mcrypt key

8649879
children	parent
selecting a node based on its children doesn t work. add to that nth-child and nth-of-type which is what i was originally going to suggest will select nodes based on their index within the parent which in this case is the element

8649882
post	get
the strange part is that i am able to connect to the api with no problems when i do a get request but there must be something i must be doing wrong with my signature when i try to create a post

8649916
put	get
if i put the line before the match i get yes printed out as originally expected

8649920
folder	directory
if your assets folder is changing a lot and it would be a pain to manually update the list you could probably put a script into your build process than would make this directory listing file automatically for you on build

8649944
mouseover	mouseout
one kind-of-hackish solution would be to create named functions to pass to hoverintent for the mouseover and mouseout behaviors instead of anonymous inline functions as i m doing now

8649992
google-chrome	firefox
but i only tested in ie7 + and it works in 3.6+ firefox and google-chrome

8649995
getter	setter
it s called by a jsf page that uses getposts to fill a datatable and a form to insert the post posttext is another property that has getter and setter

8650004
serializable	deserialization
mine s customizing the serializable behavior instead of deserialization but you can implement your own code in the deserialize method to do that

8650054
google-chrome	firefox
this doesn t work in the firefox or google-chrome console it did work in ff3.x

8650087
width	height
you can also finagle html block elements to look like triangles by giving them a width and height of zero and applying special border properties to three of the element s sides

8650088
maven	pom.xml
from what i can tell this can be worked around by asking that ivy not check the consistency of the pom.xml files maven has this setting off by default

8650090
hide	show
hide show uinavigationcontroller

8650120
getter	setter
my news.java file contains only field declarations no getter or setter

8650128
debian	linux
i m using debian linux so would prefer command line tools

8650129
jobs	cron
instead i am thinking of having a hash table db object stored in memcache that the pipeline uses to store all intermediate results and have cron jobs that loop through all entries of the hash table db and write them in the datastore

8650142
mouse	keyboard
it supports windowless rendering so there s no window handle to take focus which means it s not going to accept any keyboard or mouse input unless you manually direct them its way

8650173
jboss	glassfish
hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto for hibernate as used in jboss and eclipselink.ddl-generation for eclipselink as used in glassfish

8650195
getter	setter
update i should have used better language - the vdp will be accessing the bufferedimage through a synchronized setter method and the edt will be accessing it through a synchronized getter method

8650207
setinterval	settimeout
i have a problem with javascript functions settimeout and setinterval functions

8650220
pylons	pyramid
and since you ve installed pylons pyramid into a virtualenv you need to activate it first with source bin activate in the command line

8650242
hlsl	glsl
metasl shaders can export into cg hlsl glsl and also mentalray shaders

8650242
hlsl	glsl
metasl glsl hlsl etc can be created via mental mill standard edition which is free with a license of 3ds max 2011 and higher

8650245
post	get
i would advise against using empty for checking cookies and get post values because empty strings and 0 are considered empty which is probably not what you want

8650279
put	get
i did notice that if i put a time filter it comes back much faster but it won t guarantee i get back the last 20 checkins

8650360
pop-up	dialog
otherwise you can do it the easy but messy way using pop-up dialog and by overriding listview s onitemlongclicklistener

8650403
put	get
my querydisplay class has so much in it i don t know what to remove from it and where to put it to get it working

8650408
opera	google-chrome
i have built a page to test the framework out and it works fine in google-chrome and so on desktop slightly buggy in internet explorer 7 and works fine with a blackberry s native browser but none of the form elements work in opera 6.5 for blackberry bold 9700

8650462
nsstring	nsdata
you re attempting to pass an instance of nsdata into -initwithcontentsofurl to create the jsondata instance of nsstring

8650528
pcm	music
so you probably should use pcm adpcm for sounds and aac mp3 for music

8650541
put	get
edit by the way if you put the items in the list in reverse and then sort it you get

8650546
int	chars	getchar	fgetc
the getchar getc and fgetc functions or macros return an int not a chars

8650546
for-loop	loops
you can use a while loops or a for-loop but you don t need both

8650562
getter	setter
i donâ t think you need to make the setter and getter synchronized since they should only be accessed from edt

8650596
width	height
i ve got a situation where i would like to be able to know a jframe s height and width as the user drags their mouse to resize the frame

8650596
implements	extends
my problem is i have made my hsframe class extends jframe and implements actionlistener mousemotionlistener actionlistener is irrelevant to this question however

8650596
implements	extends
this is a code excerpt from my hsframe class extends jframe implements mousemotionlistener

8650596
width	height
the height width x and y values all repaint perfectly

8650596
width	height
in the canvaspanel class itself i extended componentlistener and added a listener to an hsframe object there--it does not update in real-time which was fine but it does repaint the height and width after the mouse is released regardless of which corner the hsframe was resized with

8650622
uwsgi	cherokee
i am running web2py 1.99.4 on debian 6.0 sqlite 3.7.3 cherokee 1.2.101 uwsgi 0.9.9.3

8650666
pop-up	dialog
would work but it pop-up a dialog saying can t switch

8650682
bde	dbase
hi could anyone recommend a free component that i can use to load dbase iii tables into delphi preferably without using the bde

8650718
width	height
so having images with a multiple width and height suffices

8650748
width	height
say i have a div container with a fixed width and height

8650771
disk	ram
actually prefer ram not disk since it s temporary for a period anyway and recreating it only costs much time

8650773
getter	setter
apparently one interesting side effect pardon the pun of the way that f# handles the syntactical sugar of properties as opposed to the c# way is that the getter and setter of a property may return accept different types

8650804
content-length	content-type
it issues an http command like get image.jpg and receives an http response whose content-type is something like image jpg whose content-length is the number of bytes in the image and whose body is the raw binary image data itself

8650804
put	get
writing restful resources has trained me to expect symmetry between http get and put so that for example a url that delivers json data when i do a get will then accept json data when it is presented with a put

8650804
put	get	content-length	content-type
in both cases there is simply a content-length giving the number of bytes in the payload a content-type header declaring that the payload is json in some character set and then the character data sits alone and unadorned as the body of the get or put

8650804
put	get
i had expected that i could design a restful interface for this that supports symmetric get and put â so that put commands involve no special encoding nor involve any idea of a character set but simply have a content-type of image jpg and then a mass of binary jpg data as their payload

8650812
getter	setter
from section 8.13.1 of the spec if a property member has both a getter and a setter and neither is an indexer then the signatures of both getter and setter must imply the same property type

8650822
super	extends
anything you want public just extends super controller

8650838
post	get
if a user grants publish_stream to my application i can then use the the application access token you get this by issuing a get to client_id app_id_here client_secret app_secret_here to post on that user s wall -- but not to that user s friend s wall

8650854
dictionary	map
due to dictionary is not thread-safe locking global hex map inner loop within a thread is not good idea

8650871
coffeescript	haml
basically it s just a src directory with haml templates sass and coffeescript

8650925
google-chrome	safari
however in safari and google-chrome the slide show is offset by about 15px

8650989
comparator	comparable
here natural ordering means the class can implement interface comparable which allows you to specify the behavior of comparator

8651021
folder	directory
plus it is all contained within one folder in your applications directory so upgrading removing is painless

8651056
udp	tcp
you should read up on the osi model and read about common protocols used within it ip tcp udp etc

8651110
spaces	delimiter
edit2 spaces can be seen as delimiter if it doesn t match it may raise an error or just not work i don t care

8651141
width	height
i have a uitextview that must keep a width of say 100px but the height can grow

8651143
postgresql	mysql
i think this might be a postgresql issue - i use mysql locally for development but heroku runs on a postgresql database and i am doing the following query in the function that gets calles by the ajax autocomplete request

8651215
versioning	upgrade
this would also be a good chance to upgrade to the latest versioning of eclipse now 3.7 indigo

8651220
ienumerable	icollection
making use of generics and implementing interfaces such as ienumerable icollection will make your code cleaner and maintainable for instance by implementing the ienumerable interface it makes possible to use the foreach statement

8651227
post	get
i would use html get or post

8651227
post	get
there is some helpful documentation here on the difference between get and post

8651234
jobs	cron
use cron jobs or a php bot

8651234
jobs	cron
i would use the php bot because then you don t have to use cron jobs

8651276
portrait	landscape
if i rotate from portrait to landscape then back again it is also fine

8651304
postgresql	mysql
also you should be aware that mysql s like is case insensitive but postgresql s is not so you might want to downcase everything to avoid confusion

8651323
min	max	range	min	range	max
i want to be table to work out information based on the lowest maximum and average prices from table but the min max and avg must be based upon the middle 60 range of prices and not the true min max and avg

8651342
pull	push
so as long as your server allows read write access to the repository using one of those protocols you should be able to push to and pull from it

8651355
formview	detailsview
if you re using the formview or detailsview control in your asp.net webpage then you can use the oldvalues property of the forms s itemupdating event to compare the values before posting to your database

8651363
hash	md5
the problem is as both of the worker processes run their task functions getdigest they seem to be using the same hash object md5

8651369
setinterval	clearinterval
you can use setinterval to change the images every x miliseconds and then use clearinterval to stop it

8651380
for-loop	loops
by the way you use i as loops counter in the for-loop as well as for the strlen inside that loops that s generally a bad idea

8651400
width	height
i m going to add the element id to an array if i set it to visible so i know which ones to flip back to hidden after i get the width height

8651411
int	chars
|id int | session chars | timestamp datetime |

8651504
public	protected
the identifiers implements interface let package private protected public static and yield are classified as futurereservedword tokens within strict mode code

8651504
accessor	properties
the lefthandside also may not be a reference to a data properties with the attribute value writable false to an accessor properties with the attribute value set undefined nor to a non-existent properties of an object whose extensible internal properties has the value false

8651504
accessor	properties
arguments objects for strict mode functions define non-configurable accessor properties named caller and callee which throw a typeerror exception on access 10.6

8651605
yslow	pagespeed
the performance rules best practices for yslow and pagespeed are complementary but there are some differences so running both is a good idea

8651607
mongoid	activemodel
for anyone who is interested the most minimal requirement for using has_secure_password with mongoid is simply the inclusion of activemodel securepassword in the model

8651611
stdout	stderr
this is a very barebones example if you compile it to a dynamic lib you probably want to redirect stdout stderr and stdin

8651760
redhat	fedora
if there are any funky redhat centos fedora flags to worry about that should handle it

8651763
uiview	subviews
i have an uiview with a uiimageview as the subviews

8651798
spaces	delimiter
i m trying to preg_split a string of tags delimiter by commas double quotes or spaces

8651799
hide	show
when user hits download button show action sheet again but hide the download button and show progress bar

8651812
put	get
if i put a call to createframebuffer before makecurrent you get a similar error

8651830
ant	maven
it provides multi-module project support that is superior to both ant and maven

8651837
post	put
also in my post table or feed_items -- whatever i stow the original article description content encoded in the description_original column then put a clean version in the description column

8651839
width	height
a quick check to see if this is a related problem is to set the height and width properties of the datagrid to a fixed size for the duration of the test and try running again

8651857
width	height
a quick check to see if this is a related problem is to set the height and width properties of the datagrid to a fixed size for the duration of the test and try running again

8651864
pop-up	dialog
i would like to call the javascript function to open a file upload dialog rather than open a new pop-up when the browse server button is clicked

8651886
clang	llvm
have not tried but using the python bindings from llvm s clang parser may work

8651947
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition
as i have looked at intelâ s 64-ia-32-architectures-optimization-manual.pdf and the latency for addition subtraction multiplication is the same or better for float compared to int for mmx

8651957
jar	war	client-side	server-side
that would help you inculcate a strong sense of segregation of server-side vs client-side war vs jar and hence understand why gwt was invented in the first place

8651960
width	height
i have tried setting the size in the xml and i have just tried setting it dynamically by getting the screen size and messing with the screen width and height to set the size

8651960
width	height
using the xml has worked fine for me before but most of these new 7 tablets use the large layout so my images and text are really small if i set the height width and text size with the xml

8651978
awt	swing
you should never override the paint method of japplet that is an old awt technique and is not used with swing

8651991
collabnet	svn
one of the best svn server products is collabnet subversion edge

8652026
prepare	execute
as an sql command execute runs a prepare statement

8652030
disk	ram
so can i think like this new file - does not create a real file in disk it is just an object in ram

8652032
hide	show
when i hide this div1 and show the div2 and enter some text in some textboxes of the div2 and hide it

8652084
completionhandler	clgeocoder
look at clgeocoder which includes methods like geocodeaddressstring completionhandler

8652085
post	get
if so i could do 2 additional queries 1 to get the art_ratings.post_id s in that list and another to select all post in those list of post_ids

8652096

8652101
stdout	stderr
to actually redirect stderr to stdout you need to use

8652129
min	max
you may try running your program with -xms and -xmx option to specify the min and max heap space the java virtual machine uses to run your program

8652172
children	parent
you need a coordinating parent frame so that two or more frames needing to reference and communicate with each other have to be children of that parent frame

8652180
extjs	mootools
i don t mind using some other big library instead prototype mootools extjs

8652249
division	multiplication
as you can see it doesn t change the multiplication into a division or the division into a multiplication

8652300
textarea	textbox
gets textbox textarea gets buttons gets radio buttons gets checkboxes.

8652345
map	quadtree
but if it had been done that way every map delegate would have had to be able to efficiently find the annotations for the given region and so would have dozens of questions about how to properly implement a quadtree for the sake of providing the right set of annotations to the map view

8652372
division	modulo
then using division and modulo on a given number you can quickly get the number of 1-bits in that number and 0-bits

8652402
inherited	properties
in some environments host objects don t inherited from object.prototype making it easy to check against or have certain properties that throw errors prototype on some interface objects in ie or even throw errors themselves on access

8652452
portrait	landscape
i know i can specific application orientation portrait or landscape through manifest file

8652452
portrait	landscape
however currently i would like to have landscape orientation for tablet application and portrait for phone application

8652590
agda	prolog
if there is an agda coq or prolog solution i m interested

8652664
put	get
now i am extending xydataitem and adding a new field to the sub class so that i can either put the information directly in it or put an id that can help me get the additional data from the data list and that s why i hope the crosshair can give me the exact data item

8652730
ubuntu	linux
i have a remote ubuntu linux for testing a ruby on rails application

8652737
ienumerable	ienumerator
i know this is an old discussion but i reasontly wrote a library where i used ienumerable of t ienumerator of t where users of the library could implement custom iterators they should just implement ienumerator of t

8652737
ienumerator	idisposable
i found it very strange that ienumerator of t would inherit from idisposable

8652756
ubuntu	linux
i have compiled the php script in linux - ubuntu using hiphop-php

8652757
google-chrome	firefox
we can use theform.elements i .getattribute selectedid as this will work for firefox google-chrome and ie

8652757
google-chrome	firefox
will not work in firefox and google-chrome and it will give undefined as value

8652789
multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract	subtract	add
i have created a gui calculator program that performs calculations in a linear order but i want it to perform calculations in an order of divide multiplying add subtract b

8652826
super	self
self super init

8652826
super	self
self super init

8652839
put	get
or just put data filter on top one and then hide those elements on the 2nd list which get hidden on the first

8652986
folder	directory
this will give a virtual directory of current application.with this you can append your created folder name

8653002
screens	tablet
these screens lies in hpdi-category of android some tablet like 10.1 and 7.0 some phones which have 480 800 screens etc

8653017
sequence	permutation
i would like to create a dynamic array which store permutation sequence such that

8653034
thin	webrick
i have switched to thin from webrick

8653077
getter	setter
and here is my getter and setter like this

8653119
implements	extends
if subclassing the extends class must implements the runnable interface which in turn supports abstract dispatching of menu actions on activation

8653146
content-length	content-type
normally a put request has a content-length header but perhaps there is a way around this such as using multipart or chunked content-type

8653151
rss	feed
the only way i can think creating a rss feed without views is using the node_load function

8653164
post	get
you can also use httpconnection for get and post

8653192
getter	setter
for now lets say only two years and its getter and setter

8653192
getter	setter
and its getter and setter

8653192
getter	setter
by 3 30 plans and its getter and setter respectively

8653211
profiling	debugging
if you want to test application on device then you need to create debugging profiling for it

8653217
appendto	each
therefore neither method above nor a sow reap in which the result is collected as a list at each step is going to be more efficient in fact less than appendto

8653236
implements	extends
this should clearly be abstracted away properly by creating a plancollection class or simply maintaining a list of plans which all extends implements a common plan class interface

8653249
getter	setter
just add your boundary checks in these getter and setter and you will be good to go

8653250
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested on ie 7 ie 8 firefox 7.0.1 and google-chrome 16.0.912.63 m

8653253
mouse	keyboard
i want to create a custom control like uitableview in iphone in .net using c sharp so user can scroll using mouse or keyboard navigation keys

8653379
mouse	keyboard
the datagridview does sound like it might fit your simple requirements you can certainly scroll using the mouse or keyboard

8653404
gridview	rowdatabound
entries are treated in the gridview differently so i manage them in the rowdatabound event of the gridview

8653407
min	max
you can specify now aggregate property with following values sum min max last first count avg custom for every gridboundcolumn and the grid will calculate these aggregates if showfooter is set to true

8653427
move	drag

8658227
formview	detailsview
thus this explanation is more applicable to a detailsview or a formview

8658303

but you should probably create classaviewcontrollervc in the init or even better viewdidload method. note if you create something in viewdidload you need to release it viewdidunload as well not only in dealloc

8658345
unsigned	short
in this case a single unsigned short is allocated and the bit fields are divided up within that value

8658354

google-chrome	firefox
while jensgram did alright in the comments i got 26 in google-chrome and 6 in firefox

8658578
ienumerable	icollection
ienumerable s type parameter is covarient as seen by the out keyword while icollection s type parameter is not since it is both in return positions and method parameter positions in the icollection interface

8658607
int	chars
pgerror error operator does not exist chars varying int

8658645
extjs	prototypejs	extjs	mootools	prototypejs	mootools	jquery	scriptaculous
well pretty much every js framework does that - from ye olde prototypejs scriptaculous livepipe if you must to jquery jquery tools or jquery ui - if you must mootools mochaui dojo dijit yui if you must - but never with alloyui extjs sencha

8658721
joptionpane	jdialog	joptionpane	jcomponent	jcomponent	jdialog	jwindow	jdialog	jwindow	jcomponent
you can place any jcomponent to the joptionpane there i can t see any limits joptionpane is same top-level container as jframe jdialog or jwindow but in contrast with plain top-level containers joptionpane has implemented return events from built-in funcionalities in integer value meaning buttons yes no ok cancel and close too

8658812
put	get
when i put the exact same code into a python script file and execute it i get the following error

8658826
int	double
if you do use floats or double when converting to int use math.round math.floor or math.ceil as appropriate

8658898
background-image	background-color
change the #thumbs li to have no background-image but instead a background-color

8658908
division	modulo

that said there is an extension you can use that would clean up your history a bit but won t resolve your issue with needing to pull before you push

8659101
ivar	subclassing
i subclassing possession and created a class called ballglove that included a new ivar brandname an nsstring

8659144

push does not do an automatic pull

8659181
stdout	stderr
looking at the script that launches the java process i see that stdout and stderr are redirected to dev null

8659181
stdout	stderr
should i try redirecting stdout stderr to a normal file

8659184
temp	tmp
for example you may need chdir into the parent folder of the folder you wish to zip and then get a temp file name in tmp and then create the command to zip to that temp file name

8659197
stdout	stderr
redirecting stdout stderr to dev null means you re throwing away valuable info

8659197
stdout	stderr
it s probably easier to redirect stderr to stdout so you can interleave the results

8659249
post	get
i ve read the java ee tutorial jim driscoll s blog post and all over the internet and still can t get my head around it

8659250

vim	kate
i could do so in vim and kate but not in qt creator and i have to use it

8659346
post	get
so the crux of the problem as you re asking it seems to be that you re correctly using a post request on your register form but your tutorials all want to use get

8659346
post	get
the first parameter of that function is a request method--change it to post rather than get and the request will be treated like a post which register.php expects

8659354
clang	icc
gcc decided not to warn as does clang but icc intel compiler would warn in this situation

8659359

8659380
post	get
i ll post the solution here once i get it working

8659386
vala	genie
you could use valac --dump-tree to convert from genie to vala

8659386
vala	genie
converting from vala to genie is a bit more complicated since the vala.codewriter class in libvala only outputs vala not genie

8659386
vala	genie
you can freely mix genie and vala files within the same valac invocation

8659424
put	get
there are more ways to skin a cat the classic one being to use unprotected private get put methods from iterate the public get set methods wrap that in a mutex lock

8659438
put	get
the mutex that s acquired when you use the synchronized keyword are reentrant so if iterate already owns the mutex then it can reacquire the same when calling get and put

8659438
put	get
similarly locking for both get and put will be handled for you by concurrenthashmap

8659463
super	implements
this is super annoying since clearly a resize should count as a history step and i don t want to rewrite the script to implements multiple open close operations on the original file

8659468

8659607
keydown	keyup
on the keydown event you set it to true on the keyup event you set it to false.

8659607
keydown	keyup
note this works for any key you will have to specify which you want in the keydown function but you can leave it generic in the keyup function

8659628
uicontrol	uibutton
to prevent the user from going anywhere while you re working in the background you should either set the enabled property on each uicontrol uibutton uitextfield etc or perhaps overlay a transparent uiview over the whole ui to block touch events

8659660
persistent	transient
it looks like hibernate will not persistent a field with the transient keyword regardless of what other annotations you have

8659660
persistent	transient
the separate transient annotation will allow you to direct hibernate to ignore a non-transient field for persistent but i don t think it s possible to do the opposite of having hibernate persistent a transient field

8659668
super	implements
the moment you override a class method you can decide to implements it with the help of the super implementation or without it

int	double
when you re programming in java the operator is generally used for comparing primitive data types int double etc.

8661566
int	double
not really sure what you want to accomplish but your array will hold references to the objects if you use int double etc but the values itself if you use int double etc

8661566
int	double
however since int double etc are immutable i don t really know what you will gain by only having references to the objects

8661601
width	height
whenever i google how to disable paging everyone points to this thread which i have followed - both interative height and width are at 0

it works fine in firefox but in safari it downloads a strange .xhtml file that on closer examination appears to be the default error page that would occur

8662214

8662441
inherited	properties
the autosize properties is there just inherited from textbox and you can get to the properties

8662470
width	height
since css does not allow percentage values to generate border widths which would be ideal in this situation i think your only solution is to dynamically write css rules adding a style tag to the head element via jquery that then builds the width and height of your triangles based off of the widths of your nav tags at runtime

8662493
division	multiplication
if you really concern about speed sometimes you can approximate multiplication or division

8662493
addition	multiplication
and in that case multiplication becomes addition

8662496
hash	salt
as explained there bcrypt automatically generates a random salt which it stores in the same string as the hash password

8662524
ravendb	db4o
so apparently ravendb doesn t use the private backing field like db4o does

this seems like it can be a recent problem since there are new versions out for both node.js and nowjs

8662544
zoo	xts
i have been trying to stay away from rep seq 5 or 7 kind of solutions since there may be some observations that i may need to filter from the data later on so i would like to have a solution that doesn t depend on the particular vector of my data but rather i would prefer the solution to be more general that is to depend on the date class i.e posicxt xts or zoo class

i m using rspec spork capybara and capybara mechanic to write integration tests for a registration path that uses facebook connect

8662557

8662609

it seems that the transactional cache works correctly for this but requires jta environment with a standalone transaction manager such as jbosstm atomikos bitronix xa datasource and a lot of configuration changes and testing

8662699

put a width on your container div and add a margin 0 auto

8662746
put	get
while it is technically the case that you can separate your implementation from your interface the syntax for templates gets so annoying to type repeatedly i would strongly recommend that you just hold your nose and put the implementation in your class until you get over the smell

8662750
jlist	jtextfield
remove the request focus from the cell renderer code and the jtextfield becomes editable again - but then i have to click on the jlist to use the arrows on it or tab through it

8662807
getter	setter
in general when translating from java to c# getter setter methods in java are mapped to properties in c#

8662825
rss	feed

post	get
it is basically a copy of the default recent post plugin that comes out of the box and then i am adding a filter to only get a certain post category

8662920
implements	extends
i can t use delegation because i m extends the class rather than implements an interface and the base class might still change unless java has more reflection features than i m aware of

8662920
getter	setter
a copy constructor will not be reliable as far as i know because the base class could change to incorporate additional state and my copy constructor would not be calling the getter and setter for that state

8662953
onfocus	onblur
you would just need onfocus and onblur event handlers on the fields inside the fieldset and these handlers could be the same functions for all of them

8662982
.htaccess	httpd.conf
allowoverride is set to all in httpd.conf and accessfilename is set to .htaccess

8662989
background-image	background-position
the background shorthand property affects background-image and background-position among other things

8662989
background-image	background-position
since all you specify are the urls to the background images the simplest fix is to use background-image instead of background in your first two rules so that background-position isn t implicitly set and thus won t necessarily override your third rule

8663039
appendto	each
i was thinking if generating a random id for each div.thumbs and then using that id to appendto the images and div.delete-pic

8663272
hash	md5
for the encrypted password i use and md5 hash

box-sizing	border-box
than you need to set box-sizing to border-box because you need to set the padding top after

8663545
post	get
that isn t standard and probably not safe since phpsession stay open even when a browser tab maybe not be open to the site since the cookie isn t eased until the browser is shutdown and also you could just send a post parameter to the site and get the info too so login scripts are a little more advanced you could something like have a unique key that is generate upon logging in and when they leave the site using javascript delete the cookie something like that

8663602

this seems to be the only attribute that doesn t display properly because when i put this instead i get the correct id for that entry

8663744

8663754

8664581
width	height
the method can use the measuredwidth height of its children or assign a new width height by calling layout method of the view

8664581
width	height
lets say the onlayout method calls childview.layout 0 0 150 150 now the width height of the view is different than the measured width height

8664933
dbcontext	objectcontext
the objectcontext class you mentioned and the dbcontext class i referred both are parts of the entity framework itself

8664933
dbcontext	objectcontext
the objectcontext class lives in system.data.objects namespace whereas dbcontext lives in the system.data.entity namespace

8664933
dbcontext	objectcontext
both objectcontext and dbcontext class provides facilities for querying and working with entity data as objects

for mobile support one h.264 mp4 output can take you a long way

8665429

8665611
post	put
there are many facebook likes on the post i have put up

8665642
waitpid	fork
if i use waitpid too early my parent process will get blocked when i use it too late i get overwhelmed by zombies and cannot fork anymore which is not only bad for my process but can cause unexpected problems on the whole system

8665642
children	parent
i ll probably have to program some logic of using some maximum number of children and block the parent when that number is reached - but that should be not necessary because most of the children terminate quickly

8665642
children	parent
the other solution that i can think of creating a two-tiered parent process that spawns concurrent children which in turn concurrently spawn and wait for grandchildren is too complicated for me right now

8665642
children	parent
if the answer is that parent processes need to have a way to find out what happened to their children then for god s sake there is no reason to count zombies as normal processes and forbid the creation of non-zombie processes just because there are too many zombies

8665670
hex	binary
do a reverse hex dump to convert the file into binary xxd -r dump.txt dump1.txt

8665670

in the documentation of winsock it says that these are only the possible values that it implies well they don t have to match necessarily stream is to tcp or datagram is to udp

8665756
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
i think there is a way use fileinputstream and fileoutputstream if you want to open an rtf document in jtextpane if you want to load it.since it is a stream of byte it will try to load it byte by byte

8665765
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
for some reason firefox google-chrome and opera return my-file.html

8665775

8665902
crossover	mutation
given the f and your score aka fitness function all you need to do is construct a population of possible metabolite combinations run them all through f score all the resulting spectrums and then use crossover and mutation to produce a new population that combines the best candidates

8665902
crossover	mutation
choosing how to do the crossover and mutation is generally domain specific because you can speed the process greatly by avoiding the creation of nonsense genomes

8665902
crossover	mutation
without knowing about your domain i can t say what a single member of your population should look like but it could simply be a list of metabolites which allows for ordering and duplicates if that s interesting or a string of boolean values over all possible metabolites which has the advantage of being order invariant and yielding obvious possibilities for crossover and mutation

8665939
firefox	safari
if when i play it in firefox before then safari works

8665939

you could use the width and height properties in your css to adjust the size of the textarea

8666064
put	get
if i put in double-quotes as in this example i get the following error

8666077
swt	swing	awt	swing

8666077
swt	swing
personally i prefer swing but you can do the same thing with swt

8666077
pop-up	dialog
your best best here is to pop-up a modal dialog box that asks the user for authentication information

8666082
awt	swing
it mixes awt and swing bad it does not attempt to implement any sort of applet context and does not call the applet init start stop destroy methods but is enough to get the applet on-screen from another class

8666107
awt	swing
if all you need is a standalone java application you should use a canvas or even better not use awt at all and use swing instead

8666138
opencv	emgucv
while emgucv does wrap some opencv functions in unmanaged code thus why we add the opencv.dll it also tries to keep as many functions as possible in c#

both server-side and client-side the answer is yes

8669466

for example if you just need to keep a running count of the number of each type of object you have you could just use the nscountedset directly it descends from nsmutableset so it is already mutable and not bother with creating the arrays

8669491
google-chrome	firefox
i was able to find a jquery solution that seems to work in firefox and ie but unfortunately not in google-chrome

8669551

you will need to combine the two forms into one you don t even necessarily need the form tags use javascript or jquery to capture the submit button click evaluate the input value based on your validation rules that route the form submission and then post the values to a form likely through ajax

8669578
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it is just that firebug in firefox and the web inspector in safari and google-chrome all each show four errors related to this

8669604
hash	salt
basically this is what you do when you salt password hash although for slightly different reasons

8669604
hash	salt
it doesn t prevent collision attacks entirely if you have a hash function mapping arbitrary-length input to a fixed-length output hash can always collide but using a secret salt should make such attacks harder

8669625

not only that but even if it ends up in a valid state the ancestor class may still be confused about the state its in if it s been mutated outside the class public protected interface

8669830
unix	bsd
syslog names an event notification system which originated with bsd unix

8669846
int	double
the major driving force behind the need to do compile-time validation of the sort int are ok double are not ok was that you could access operations implicitly a+b would succeed if the types of a and b supplied at template expansion allowed the + operation

8669846
int	double
it is not the same in c# if you want an operation to be done on a value passed to a generic you must either stipulate the existence of that operation explicitly through a type constraint or provide an explicit way to perform that operation a delegate an interface etc. either way telling the compiler that your template works for int nut not for double does not buy you absolutely anything

8669885
int	double
two int divisions result in an int not a float or double

8669888
integer	fractions
integer division has no fractions so 500 1000 0.5 that is no integer

8669918
int	double
finally long short int double and float are not class types

8669928
post	put
put does not mean update any more than post means insert

8669959
setinterval	clearinterval
my setinterval function works fine but i cannot for the life of me work out why the clearinterval function isn t working

8669978
setinterval	clearinterval
you need to save the value that s returned from setinterval and pass that into your call to clearinterval

8669978
setinterval	settimeout
also it s usually considered evil to call settimeout or setinterval with a string

8669983
setinterval	clearinterval
the clearinterval function should receive an id that is generated by setinterval

8669987
setinterval	clearinterval
pass id of setinterval in clearinterval

8670336
hive	hdfs
in order to implement search on these logs i have thought of this design there is a process running on web servers which creates an inverted-index of logs and cache it in-memory on web servers itself and push to hdfs via flume to be stored in hive when the cache is full this is much like an lru cache

8670358
for-loop	arrays
then you will need a functor which captures your arrays and executes the body of the for-loop

8670374

flac	speex
you send speech audio in flac or speex format and receive recognition and a confidence score

8670796
folder	directory
most filesystems get cranky or slow when you have 10k files in a folder directory etc

8670858
hide	show
you should probably hide the .guns in the second function or if you only want to show them and never hide them you can just use mouseover instead of hover

8670870
super	extends
then i will have to relink all references manually which on the long run will invite bugs when other people extends the code of the super class and forget the copy constructur in the sub class

8670873
mouseover	mouseout
in hover there are two events bounded mouseover and mouseout

8670909
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
by newest browsers i mean today s development versions too like opera 12 google-chrome 17 or firefox 10

8670909
hash	md5
does it mean that i can make any string into a hash but not an established one like md5 or sha1 but some js build in specific

8670914
post	put	post	get	put	get
one solution would be to put backing beans of both the table of items -page and the edit item -page in view scope and then go from the first to the second one directly via a get request using or a post redirect with a request parameter representing the row on which the user clicked

8670917

8670939
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
if you have embedded your uiviewcontroller in a uinavigationcontroller then in viewdidload of the view controller you could for example make the title a uisearchbar that you dragged to the uiviewcontroller in xcode ib and put 2 buttons on the right like this

8670939
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationitem	uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar	uinavigationbar	uinavigationitem
the issue here is the distinction between uinavigationcontroller which manages uinavigationbar and uinavigationitem which you and uinavigationcontroller co-manage

8670950
superclass	subclassing
you shouldn t copy all the references from the superclass instance to the subclassing instance

8670950
superclass	subclassing
btw all these references should not even be accessible from the subclassing if they are declared as private fields in the superclass as they should be generally

8670950
implements	extends
fooadapter could extends foo or better theyr should implements a common interface but that s not necessarily needed

8671002
bayesian	cross-validation
another approach is to impose a prior for your model parameters based on earlier data - one of the simplest ways to do that which does not require full bayesian learning is to add a quadratic penalty to your loss function that penalizes for deviating from the older parameter values with the penalty coefficient tuned using cross-validation backtesting some care should be taken to make sure that the variance-covariance matrix of the older model parameters is taken into account when constructing the penalty

client-side	server-side
configure the client to use that client-side certificate to identify itself and only accept the one server-side certificate you installed on your server for that part of it

8671120
post	put
if i put an absolute url for a post like

8671149
salt	md5	hash	salt	hash	md5
your application should receive that password hash it not using md5 but a legitimate salt hash or bcrypt which is the best solution there and then compare it to the stored salt hash

8671149
hash	salt
therefore your application never stores user passwords so if your password file database got compromised noone s password would be exposed and if you use a strong salt hash bcrypt algorithm noone should be able to brute force the hash to recover the actual password

8671149
hash	salt
if you hash the password on the client and send the actual salt hash to the application you re opening yourself up to a different attack

8671149
hash	salt
instead you want the client to send the password itself and have the server generate the hash based on it so the attacker would not know what to send in an attempt to log in as a user since you cannot take a salt hash and recover the password from it assuming a strong salt hash implementation

8671159
nginx	lighttpd	g-wan	lighttpd	apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd
the benchmarks i have seen indicate that nginx lighttpd g-wan in particular and friends blow away apache in terms of performance but this blowing away appears to manifest more in high-load scenarios where the web server is handling many simultaneous connections

8671298
put	get
when upgrading to rails 3 i assumed the file resolver would put engines plugins in styles but no they all get combined into one virtual path

8671312
tinyint	boolean
is there any advantage of using tinyint 1 over bit 1 in handling boolean values

8671357
decoder	encoder
if you want to deal with the message before it s decoder you ll need a custom message encoder for that that s the component which converts between the bytes in the wire and the message object

8671366
pow	floor
i m trying to make a simple fibonacci calculator in c but when compiling gcc tells me that i m missing the pow and floor functions

8671369
innodb	myisam
bit is supported properly in 5.05+ with myisam and innodb

8671386
pow	floor
add -lm to your link options since pow and floor are part of the math library

8671394
hide	show
if you need to show something different depending on the value create all the objects and then hide the one you don t want to show .visible false

8671409
client-side	server-side
configure the client to use that client-side certificate to identify itself and only accept the one server-side certificate you installed on your server for that part of it

8671423

so far i can get it to delete post however i can not find a way to skip over images or post that were published via techcrunch for example

8671554
int	double
for example if we want to define a template function which we can use int floats double but not strings

8671583
int	double
both int or both long or both double etc...

8671583
equals	compareto
turns out the only fully reliable way to compare two numbers of unknown type at runtime is to convert both to strings and both to bigdecimal and then to use the method compareto and not equals

8671624
int	double
since a short can be implicitly converted to int long float double or decimal

8671631
width	height
later in the application i add a uiview and i need the uiview to take the height and width of the scrollview

8671631
width	height
it only shows part of the screen width 320 and height 460

8671645
min	max
notes min max vs order by and limit

8671667
int	double
it just so happens that 4 and 5 are represented as double in such a way that 32 out of the 64 bits are zeros and these zero bits are the ones that the printf function interprets as an int since you told it to print an int

8671688
int	chars
chars is just an int

8671688
int	chars
to access a single bit in a chars you can do it the same way as any other int

8671703
postgresql	mysql
however for sql server 2012 yes next release postgresql and mysql you can do this

8671726
sorting	filtering
so the paging sorting and filtering of data works locally

8671726
sorting	filtering
if you look exactly what is paging sorting and filtering you will see that it s mot more as changing of some parameters of jqgrid and reloading of the grid locally

8671726
sorting	filtering
so the paging sorting and filtering work locally only because the reload of the grid works locally

8671727
post	get
i would suggest passing in a post or get variable in your ajax call that indicates to the script that the request is from ajax

8671732
gridbaglayout	boxlayout
in the example below i have a jpanel with boxlayout which contains another jpanel with gridbaglayout

8671793
put	get
i know if we don t put bracket it will show error but want i want is to get the explanation why bracket is needed

8671863
int	double
an abstract class extended by all classes that represent numeric primitive types such as byte short int long float and double

8671866
post	get
i ve read several post on so on similar subjects but was unable to dissect and get my code to function the way i want it too

8671889
integer	unsigned
therefore i have chosen the data type to be an unsigned integer

8671907
pull	push
also not that the multi device interaction of the android maven plugin also works for push pull install and running tests

8671913
int	chars
since a chars is an int type it would be stored in the same way as a regular int would be

8671949
vb6	vba
to sum up it works fine with the vb6 client but not in the vba actctx client

8671956
for-loop	loops
return false breaks from each loops in jquery just like break in for-loop in plain javascript

8671966
nsindexpath	nsindexset

8672012
firefox	safari
i have following script and it works fine with firefox and safari

8672074
union	distinct
2 if you don t do #1 union causes a distinct

8672101
switching	screens
our web site does nothing with the actual browser window size like switching browser into full screens mode

8672147
width	height
althought i cant see anything wrong with this code but i think you dont need to set gravity because wrap_content height will automatically put linearlayout at top and left and right is not the case because both spinners are of half width of screen

8672175
google-chrome	firefox
my attempt to use html comments in a non-standard way worked in google-chrome but failed in firefox

8672175
opera	firefox
both browsers parse the html correctly not sure if ie and opera would too but firefox downloads the nojs.css in all cases without actually applying it when js is enabled

8672177

8672269
serializable	deserialization
wpf bitmapimage serializable deserialization

8672279
setinterval	settimeout
instead of repeatedly calling settimeout with slightly-different values you could setup a global variable to track the current iteration and use one call to setinterval instead

8672279
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval is like settimeout except it will keep running indefinitely - you don t have to call it over and over again

8672281
width	height
i ve tried setting the height property in my mainwindow but this doesn t work changing the width property of the horizontal slider works though

8672313
expandablelistview	expandablelistadapter
i m trying to make an expandablelistview but i don t know how to retrieve the info of some methods from the expandablelistadapter so here is my code

8672332
pylons	pyramid
- pylons pyramid they say lot of things which i have no clue about

8672339
pop-up	dialog
so in my aspx page currently i have the jquery that shows the dialog in the center of the page it masks the aspx page into whole white and then displays the the actual content as a pop-up window but i would like to show the pop-up closer to the mousehover without masking the aspx page

8672362
setinterval	settimeout
other than that if you want to not block other js from running then you need to use the settimeout setinterval method of implementing this loop

8672376
gif	png
jpg gif png and tiff.

8672439
textinput	textfield
use the textfield class instead of the textinput class

client-side	server-side
configure the client to use that client-side certificate to identify itself and only accept the one server-side certificate you installed on your server for that part of it

8672453
width	height
i also agree with mrtsherman if you set a width or height to a specific pixel it is going to limit you to those constraints

8672467
mouse	keyboard
i ve had problems with keyboard mouse doing different things with comboboxes before but that had to do with certain events not firing

8672471
hide	show
i know that it may be difficult to see the actual problem without looking throughout the whole script but i m curious if its a little buggy for anybody who has done a hover function and use show and hide

8672533
jobs	cron
is there any server support i need to take into such as cron jobs or such

8672582

8672622
windows	wow64
in windows 7 64bit these 32-bit applications will run i assume using the wow64 emulation layer in windows

8672636
post	get
if you get it working make sure you post the answer to your own question

8672652
hide	show
you should use classes or unique ids to find the elements you want to show hide and you should make your hover event more specific

8672662
setinterval	clearinterval
use setinterval to start and clearinterval when you reach your max

8672686
set	bag
i think that the bag product has been created with a specific attribute set then someone changed the attribute set to another and another again

8672711

maven	pom.xml
if the project you re building is using the android-maven-plugin you want to set the dex mojo configuration in the maven pom.xml file eg

8672809
decoder	encoder
i can see that srt codec is supported as decoder and encoder however i am not sure what is used for mp4 and mkv subs encoding and whether i need to switch it on or compile separately

8672832
typemock	moles
the only option is to use some more advanced technology which will allow you redirect method call to some other this is provided only by commercial typemock isolator and ms moles but that would lead to the same problem as you are trying to do at the moment testing assumption about code you don t own

8672880
google-chrome	firefox
it works with ie 8.0 google-chrome and firefox and tablets

8672881
ready	each

8672909
post	get
if you get this working i d encourage you to write a technical blog post on your experiences

width	height
in that case you may need to calculate the width and height of the container div which holds the image and then divide it by two to locate the center and place your image there

8672964
google-chrome	firefox
i am working on a website which works fine in google-chrome and firefox but doesn t display right in internet explorer all versions

8672964
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox

8672992
post	get
create a page template and use the following code to get a random post

8673015
integer	unsigned
again it makes sense to have a way to clearly and concisely specify that this literal is intended to be treated as an unsigned integer

8673015
integer	unsigned
the next most likely cases are that the user intends it to be a long integer or an unsigned int or unsigned long

8673032
put	get
to get the first five elements that were put onto the stack then i would do the following

8673145
width	height
with your current code you are creating caps of half of the image height and width - this leaves you with a stretchable area of 0x0 pixels - so you get nothing in the middle

8673155
versioning	upgrade
i think the new versioning may use a writeable bitmap just speculation for the page that is transitioning out - there was atleast 2x speed increase with the upgrade toolkit and memory issues were all but eliminated

8673198
maven	pom.xml
logging section of maven pom.xml usually looks like this

8673263
post	get

8673378
g++	gcc
i do not get the same results using mingw and g++ which is weird isn t it as wingw is a port of gcc

8673389
width	margin
this will reduce the left position property by 50 and reduce the width of the margin auto

8673451
width	height
if your 4 blocks are identical in height and width you could do this

8673470
put	get
however i cannot get eclipse to use the -noaudio value i put in the default emulator options field

then per the other answer when they deploy to maven central you can just change the version in your own project pom.xml

8673561
solaris	sunos
based on my experience with redhat rel version 5 and solaris sunos 5.9 5.10 linux process memory footprint doesn t increase gradually instead it seems it grabs a large chunk memory when it needs extra memory and use them for a long run

melt	reshape
i have a data.frame that looks like this i used reshape melt to get data from wide to long format

8673599

8673700
post	get
i get these errors in the log when trying to post to album_id photos

8673716
getchar	strtok
lex and yacc are nice if the format is rather complex but otherwise either strtok or getchar + switch is probably the way to go

8673746
yacc	bison
the unhelpful answer is don t do that write a parser properly maybe using lex and or yacc or bison

8673762
post	get
use post redirect get

8673768
put	get
when clicking div1 -div1 will get focus and put to front setting div5 back one step

when you have a local web server you could set the workspace to a new folder in the servers directory or web root when the project should be in the main directory

8673800
lisp	scheme
certainly a function subroutine could be written to replicate the if behaviour i think it is actually a function in lisp scheme

8673820
lisp	scheme
in programming languages of the lisp family scheme comes to mind if is an expression meaning that it returns a value and is implemented as a special form

8673865
hide	show
however if you go to that url after about 5 seconds the content finally hide and show the correct content

8673879
selecteditem	selectedindex
usually the problem when the aspxcombobox s selecteditem selectedindex is incorrect occurs when the aspxcombobox.valuetype property is specified incorrectly

8673907
put	get
ruby has some stuff that makes dealing with yaml files super easy i need to write a blog posting on this so you can put something at the top of your script that calls a method to get the config info and then set the browser type accordingly

8673921
client-side	server-side
this is really nice if your development style is mostly server-side and you are happy not to have to bother with the details of making it all work client-side

8673927
zlib	quazip
at least some people here want to build quazip which requires zlib

8674018
pbkdf2	hash
i m trying to securely store a password in a database and for that i chose to store its hash generated using the pbkdf2 function

8674018
hmac	pbkdf2
i know that pbkdf2 is implemented using hmac sha1 so that is why i chose as algorithm in the last method the pbewithhmacsha1 which i took from the bouncy castle java docs

8674038
post	get
what i notice right away is that it is sending a get rather than a post although i specified a post on the ajax request

8674038
post	get
however am not sure why it is doing a get rather than a post

8674061
filesystems	ntfs
basically you can enter any descriptive fields normally into your database but the actual blob is stored in ntfs governed by the sql engine and limited in size only by your ntfs filesystems

std	ostream
while maybe your classes are too complex for this i found the easy thing to do is use the std ostream and just write out standard compliant xml this way

8674226
decoder	encoder
in directshow you choose new unique video subtype identifier which is guid so you can really get a unique one you create encoder and decoder filters you register them properly with directshow intelligent connect and you are good to go

8674226
decoder	encoder
encoder and decoder filters are com objects registered to do certain transformation of video data

8674226
decoder	encoder
as you are interested in video encoder decoder fitlers only you might want to prefer writing a directx media object dmo instead

so your intuition that a jited system should consume memory somewhere between that of a compiled-language and a fully interpreted-language isn t correct anyway

8675877
cpython	pypy
if you ve actually done any comparisons i m guessing from your question that they would be between pypy and cpython

8675877
cpython	pypy
i know many of pypy s data structures are actually smaller than cpython s but again that has nothing to do with the jit

8675877
cpython	pypy
if the dominant memory usage is program data structures then i wouldn t be at all surprised to find pypy using significantly less memory than cpython whether or not the jit was enabled

8676272
hide	show	mouseover	mouseout
given that you want to simply show the element on mouseover and then hide it on mouseout you should also use mouseout to define the desired behavior you want when the mouse is removed

8676272
hide	show
since your desired behavior is definite we ll just use show for when the mouse is over it and hide when it is removed

8676273
width	height
it does not happen inside of a canvas because a canvas does not take these properties into account when performing layout of its children so they get the minimum size based on properties like width height minwidth and similar properties of their children

note the backticks around get in order to use it infix which is necessary here because the rules for an alphanumeric identifier are different from operators operators are made of symbols are are infix by default and to write them without arguments or use them prefix you put them in parentheses

an alternative for graceful degradation would be to use the href to point to the show hidden div displaying normally by default and having javascript hide it where javascript is available

8677038

to accept input data in situations where there is no mouse relying only on keyboard we wrote some javascript to put the cursor in the concerned field

8677382
getter	setter
in that class i had created an integer variable and set an getter and setter function for that integer.

8677384
stdout	stderr
one of the reasons you report debug information to stderr rather than stdout because stdout might be sent down a pipeline and your diagnostics would go with the actual data confusing the subsequent phases of the pipeline

portrait	landscape
checks if the ipad is portrait or landscape and displays the popover media picker accordingly

8677462
map	quadtree
at this level you basically split the map into 4 sections and make each section a child of the quadtree

these 4 children contain higher resolution data of its parent

8677462
post	put
as a follow-up to this post i will try to add links to many of the concepts i put in here

8677476
implements	extends
if constvalue has to be used in a utilclass without naming of ifc class name we can implements extends those

8677494
np-hard	np-complete
a problem is classified as np-complete if it can be shown that it is both np-hard and verifiable in polynomial time

8677519
implements	extends
i think the argument is that you don t need to extends or implements a constant class or interface now that we have static imports

8677519
implements	extends
that is to extends or implements the type that defines the constants

8677564
preorder	postorder
now write its preorder and postorder lists

as other mentioned it s better to deal with such scenarios on client-side instead of server-side

8677921

i know i can put objects into common lisp hash tables created with make-hash-table but i couldn t find a way to get a hash of an object like hashcode of java or hash of python

8677940

the advantage of such a usage will be on server side where you serve static.example.com from a fast server like nginx while keeping the example.com proxied to apache

8677970
width	height
its area is minimum for each angle and its height its width

8677993

folder	directory
your project might be in a very deeply nested folder sometimes vs have problems compiling projects that exists in a very deeply nested directory

integer	unsigned
because the exit code is only 8 bits and it s treated as an unsigned integer if you return a negative value it gets turned into a positive one -1 becomes 255

8678255
int	chars
the return type of main is int rather than short or chars because there s no particular benefit in making it a smaller type particularly at this point in history decades after it was decided

put	get
when i put dev url and preview url into facebook input box or there can get my meta info

8678369
getter	setter
in my opinion the important thing to realize is that you cannot do anymore with dependency injection than you can with getter and setter but the only place you can use getter and setter is in the code that creates the new object

8678380
int	double
double it.error 1 int it.d 2

8678420
width	height
although after adding this the it stopped autoresizing you can work around by adding height and width parameters

8678434

the select element has a box-sizing of border-box whereas the input element has that of content-box

create getter and setter

8679911
width	margin
if you want center an element width margin 0 auto you need to set the width

stdout	stderr
dr when debugging print to stderr not stdout other people might suggest logging to a file instead and or allowing runtime options like enabling disabling printing file style threshold ect

8680062

google-chrome	firefox
now the problem is in ie7 browser the abs element is covered by the next rela element but it displays well in other browsers like firefox google-chrome ie8

8680195
cout	cin
i am thinking but am not sure that the reason that foo is not being inputted is because after you set cin s buffer to cout the line

8680200
cout	cin
so with std cin.rdbuf std cout.rdbuf you are asking to cin to do its input using the streambuf of cout which probably is not ready for doing input

8680218

note that i ve set the width and height to 100px in the above code and you should change it as appropriate

8680548
client-side	server-side
i have both server-side and client-side validation to check that this date is in range

8680548
client-side	server-side
the server-side validation works fine with parsing the datetime string and validating it but i am having a problem with client-side validation for browsers which natively support the datetime picker

8680548
opera	safari
as per the comment in the above code this works in opera 11 desktop but not in safari on the ipad

8680548

i have a for-loop over an arrays

8680686
put	get
when i put into my application.rb and restart the rails server i get an error that looks like

8680801
width	height
i only do this once because changing the height width of a canvas actually erases all drawing

8680811

a is the parent directory and has two parallel children folder b and

8680832

8681132
post	get
check out this post for the exact behavior i am trying to get around

jason mccreary s answer is good if you have a fixed width container but if you want to fix the margin size then your current idea of setting a px or em unit for your margins is just fine for centering

8681218
folder	directory
your development machine however is serving up pages locally and has a different directory structure for mapping to files and folder

8681218
folder	directory
the initial in your link css styles.css tells the server to go to the root directory of the server and start looking for the folder and files from that point .

8681218
folder	directory
but there is no css folder in the local server s root directory

8681227
put	get
but then allow a put on that same synchronized uri to replace the redirect with the transferred entity which would then be returned in subsequent get responses

post	get
personally i prefer to get a signed request of the javascript sdk send this to the backend as a post var and then decode this signed request there to validate the call.

8681416
for-loop	loops
how about if you loops through it with a classical for-loop

8681423
width	height
you can limit it by width or height property

8681423
width	height
in this case width and height will automatically adjust by situation but not great than you specify

8681439
hide	show
then i just got the closest element that is a parent of the current input element and hide show the elements with class anon nut maybe you need something different

8681441

that way you should be able to detect the parent li and then just get all of it s children to reorder

8681455
disk	ram
however building a compiler be it gcc or clang requires a lot of resources disk space several gigabytes and also ram cpu time and some of your time and efforts

8681579
mouseup	mousedown
if you create a isdragging boolean instance field which you set to true in the mousedown and false in mouseup then you can use the mouse move event to detect whether the object should be moved or not

8681587
disk	ram
it tries hard to avoid doing that swapping pages to disk is very slow because the disk access time is in dozens of milliseconds while the ram access time is in tenth of microsecond

8681593
for-loop	arrays
i am wondering if javascript has an enhanced for-loop syntax that allows you to iterate over arrays

8681602
mouseup	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown
you ll need to use a combination of mousedown mousemove and mouseup events

8681602
move	drag
in mousemove you check to see if the button is still down and the cursor has move further than systeminformation.dragsize which indicates that the user is dragging rather than clicking and start the drag operation if needed

8681629
submit	submission
i know the php works because the correct alert pops up when a username is taken or not but i cannot get it to submit the form when the response is yes without it submission when the response is also no

8681903
opera	google-chrome
so it works with opera and not in google-chrome or ff.

8681928
disk	ram
by the way there is a difference between keeping a cleartext password in memory and erasing it from there as soon as possible or better locking that region in ram or having encrypted swap and writing that cleartext password to disk

8681943
put	get
when i put this method on the base class and call it through a concrete class transaction.getlatest i get an error

8681948
temporary	tablespace
they sometimes require more resources like more temporary tablespace but your distinct cursor is probably already sorting the entire table on disk anyway

8681950
min	max
also see array_count_values or alternatively compute the min and max inside the counting loop

8681975
hide	show
what you can do is set the rootviewcontroller as a tabbarcontroller and add a tab for your login screen but make sure to hide the tabbar initially after the user login you can remove the tab programatically and show the tabbar

8681999
put	get
basically this allows you to put your response into a contain that has all of these nice methods that you want and if you simply want to get the wrapped response you can just call the wrapper s get method

atof	strtod
you can use strtod instead of atof

8682396
width	height
if you remove the height and width properties it will do just that

8682413
jobs	cron
but since cron jobs often start a few seconds after they re scheduled to run you shouldn t be testing for equality with 06 00 00

8682431
width	height
what the problem is most likely the result of is either you are not assigning a width and height to the body tag you are naming your image incorrectly using the incorrect extension for your image or the path to your image is incorrect but there is also a possibility that you need to add a width and height

8682504

margin	height	width	height	width	margin
basically all you need to do is give your modal a fixed position top margin 50 left margin 50 and then offset top left by 50 of your modal height width repectively

8686514
width	height
i am trying to set the size of my image using getlayoutparams height width but the problem is all my numbers are store in values folder

8686571
opera	firefox
but firefox 3.5 and above opera 10 and above i haven t tested below 10 and internet explorer 8 and above render it like this

8686615
submit	submission
you should write your form submission to submit both user ids to your controller with an indication of the winning user

8686628
width	height
everything was going fine until i added some divs that were positioned relatively and had width and height to the absolute div pop-up

8686645
chunked	transfer-encoding
after hours of struggling reading every possible related article i came across this restlet discussion and noticed that indeed i do have transfer-encoding chunked on the http header of the response

8686645
chunked	transfer-encoding
i tried the proposed solutions override clientresource.torepresentation didn t do any good so i tried restlet 2.1 as susggested with clientresource.setreâ questentitybufferingâ true no luck there either but i am not convinced my issue is related to transfer-encoding chunked at all

8686651
strlen	strcmp	strlen	strcpy	strcpy	strcmp
i overheard sometime ago a discussion about how when creating a templated string class that you should not use strcmp strcpy and strlen for a templated string class that can make use of utf8 and utf16

8686651
unsigned	short
this is where utf8 will be a unsigned char and utf16 is an unsigned short

8686661
background-repeat	background-image	background-repeat	background-position	background-image	background-position
background-image background-repeat and background-position among other things will be implicitly set to their default values when you leave them out in the shorthand property

8686674
strlen	strcmp	strlen	strcpy	strcpy	strcmp
the reason you can t use strcmp strcpy or strlen is that they operate on strings whose length is indicate by a terminating zero byte

8686675
strlen	strcmp	strlen	strcpy	strcpy	strcmp
strcmp strcpy and strlen will return incorrect results for strings like that because they operate under the assumption that strings are zero-terminated

8686678
post	get
for some reason whenever i run my code i get a nullpointerexception i will post the logcat

8686726
post	get
i am trying to submit a simple post form to a website to get past the form screen and download data from the site

8686744
submit	submission
try to do your ajax handling after clicking the submit button instead of doing with jquery form submission perhaps you re submission the form data through ajax only

8686744
submit	submission
i seems you ve to submit the form from the validate function s submit callback handler submithandler to avoid the redirection after submission

8686746
google-chrome	firefox
nevertheless the code works fine in google-chrome and browsers powered by webkit engines but it doesn t work in firefox i haven t tested other browsers yet

8686777
versioning	upgrade
they are actually improving this to look more like wpf however with syncfusion one issue is when you upgrade to a new versioning it always breaks previous versioning based code

8686795
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
there is no way short of an activex control of some sort which won t work in firefox google-chrome safari opera etc.. to render the iamge people see

8686836
uiview	subviews
i have a uiview that has a subviews

8686836
uiview	subviews
then when i use i need it to go back to the uiview with the subviews not just the subviews that presents the modal view

8686848
cos	sin
x r sin q cos f

8686853
strlen	strcmp	strlen	strcpy	strcpy	strcmp
with that said the reason you can t use strcmp strcpy and strlen for your templated string type is that they all operate on null terminated byte sequences

8686853
strlen	strcmp	strlen	strcpy	strcpy	strcmp
so strcmp strcpy and strlen are all specialized versions of algorithms that can be implemented more generally

8686882
switching	screens
switching firefox into full screens mode it seems that the top bar is the cause for the offset so when it s not visible there is no offset

8686925
post	get
however today i found if the request which cause exception is get it works if it is a post then nothing rendered it just return 404 to browser

8686936
versioning	upgrade
btw you are using the old versioning now deprecated of google maps api ...you should upgrade to v3

8686939
mvp	presenter
as i understand it mvp is a derivative of mvc where the model and the view are loosely or completely decoupled and the presenter replaces the controller and acts as the bridge between the view and the model

8686949
hide	show
but when i modify properties of this record and hide the form window the grid does not show updated values

8686981
put	get
also when i go to my form page directly and not as a link through the parent window if i manually put a get variable into the url it still gives me the same errors which leads me to believe i m just missing something basic

8686999
post	get
should i have post request to push ids to appointment form or should i use get request to create a new form

8687276
prng	random
periodically add new random material to the prng seed by making a call to

8687293
children	parent
in this case you can also read more data given a parent read all the children to fill up the cache faster

8687295
int	double
i think i have read somewhere once that an intermediate long double type is used but this still wouldn t clarify why the converted value is dirty because a conversion from int to double for doesn t have any similar effects i think

8687305
implements	extends
below servicebound is a callback that i have implements in the connectedactivity class so that classes that are extends the conntectedactivity can take action once the service is bound

8687312
hlsl	glsl
on a side note i m adding in vector property syntax similar to hlsl glsl vec1.yxz + vec2.xyz

8687325
google-chrome	firefox
this will also modify the trusted sites used by firefox and google-chrome so you don t get the warnings on them either

8687335
width	height
this is a bit of a shot in the dark but i d assume that you could parse the png header to retrieve the width height of the image take a look at this rfc for png details

8687379
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
and i try to backspace for remove mylink html tag it doesn t work in firefox but it works in google-chrome opera safari and explorer

8687492
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
i have placed clientaccesspolicy.xml and crossdomain.xml files in wwwroot folder

8687506
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i think most probably you have a uinavigationcontroller in your main window it can be a uitabbarcontroller etc but if you have a uinavigationcontroller in your main window then you can check the top view controller of your uinavigationcontroller by using or you can also check for uinavigationcontroller s viewcontrollers stack that returns an array of all view controller s you pushed in uinavigationcontroller and can get the last object of that array which is your top view by using

8687506
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
if you have a uitabbarcontroller in your main window then you can get the instance of uinavigationcontroller if its there by using and can do the above steps to get the top view

8687523
google-chrome	safari
check it in a google-chrome or safari

8687586
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested this on google-chrome firefox 3.6 explorer 8 oper and it works fine

8687594
migrate	staging
i did bundle exec rake --trace db migrate on the staging server and got the following error messages

8687626
google-chrome	firefox
i tested it in firefox ie 8 and google-chrome and was able to remove with backspace but the user experiance is different in firefox and other browsers

8687637
opencv	cimg
i m working on robot vision system and its main purpose is to detect objects i want to choose one of these libraries cimg opencv and i have knowledge about both of them

8687641

the purpose of the edt is to process any events that may occur due to io mouse and keyboard events

8687735
post	get
gordonm s post is a good one to get you started

8687746
setinterval	settimeout
or change setinterval to settimeout which will fire itself unless exception is thrown like for example cannot send data to disconnected client

8687749
free	strncpy	strlen	strncpy
when you need storage for a new string strncpy it to free and increase free with the strlen

8687802
int	chars
int instead of chars

8687803
width	height
on each device the camera will scale itself to fit the resolution as good possible while keeping the ratio between width height

8687803
width	height
then it will be scaled by the camera-to-device-screen scaling which changes from one device to another but the ratio will remain constant - the game will not look like a bad scaled image on devices with a different resoltuion that the camera width height ratio

8687817
int	chars
assuming 32bit int 8bit chars and a litte-endian environment say x86 arr will be like this in memory

8687838
int	chars
this is because an int is 4 bytes long whereas a chars is only 1 byte long

8687838
int	chars
so when the int array is cast to chars you iterate over it byte by byte or chars by chars not by four bytes int by int

8687856
min	max
we return a full set of data from all columns in table2 as well as the additional newmin and newmax which are populated by the min and max functions on the subquery column price that has the limits applied

8687856
min	max
this now gives a final result of item count totalavg min max for each item

8687867
superclass	subclassing
so i have done a superclass that i call account and then two subclassing that i call savingsaccount and creditaccount

8687889

teamcity	jenkins	cruisecontrol	teamcity	cruisecontrol	jenkins	hudson	bamboo
if you didn t use continuous integration before and do not where to start there are plenty of choices cruisecontrol also cruisecontrol.net and cruisecontrol.rb hudson jenkins bamboo teamcity continuum etc

8688038
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly on internet explorer and firefox but does nothing in google-chrome

8688059
post	get
it sounds like you ll want to get rather than post because you re presenting a form rather than immediately creating the record

8688076
bugsense	acra
if you can t get it reproduced i suggest you take a look at acra and bugsense

8688085
free	malloc
instead i ve used malloc and i free the memory in the caller function once it s no longer needed

8688087
for-loop	arrays
but i think this algorithm would not be very efficient when the number of curves increases because i have to store all the points in the arrays and i have to run for-loop to draw each curve every time i go for modification

8688123
super	self
super parent2 self .__init__ x y would call object.__init__ x y

8688127
bash	zsh
your current shell should support this kind of substitution bash and zsh do

8688147
d3.js	protovis
so you can then write r server pages that return json-encoded data that you can feed to protovis - or if you want to get right up to date to d3.js which is protovis++ and made of win

8688158
children	parent
unspecified - meaning that it will make whatever decision it makes according to the parameters of the parent children device size etc.

8688166
children	parent
eventually all the children were updating the file at the same time and i had to restart the parent

8688170
dbcontext	objectcontext
this is fed into dynamic data which as i discovered uses the dbcontext s internal objectcontext to which i have access when casting to iobjectcontextadapter

8688170
dbcontext	objectcontext
the dbcontext s savechanges is not called the objectcontext s savechanges is used instead

8688183
integer	unsigned
check the type of n is not of an unsigned integer type

8688183
integer	unsigned
the result of an object of unsigned integer type when checked if greater or equal to 0 is always 1 true

8688204
public	protected
but if the class is public and the readonly member is public protected or protected internal then no warning for you

8688204
public	protected
edit for a moment you might think that the compiler refrains from issuing the warning in the case of public and protected members because it is reasonable to expect that derived classes might initialize the field

8688204
public	protected
edit2 if my memory serves me well java gives all the proper warnings in all cases regardless of whether the uninitialized final member is public protected or private and regardless of whether the class containing it is public or visible only within its package

8688214
requestfactory	gwt-rpc
more of that we read about such options like gwt-rpc an older version of requestfactory and restygwt

8688344
libjpeg	libexif
i get the x-resolution and y-resolution using libexif because libjpeg doesn t support this says 72 dpi and i use tiffsetfield to set the corresponding field of the tiff to be generated with no error occurred

8688359
jqxhr	deferred
however if you can guarantee running with jquery 1.5 or later then a better method is to just have gettweets return the jqxhr object and then you can use deferred methods in the client code

8688361
width	height
there you can choose width and height for your applet

8688363
hide	show
i call hide function when document ready on a specific that has display block and visibility visible by default we show it by default and we try to hide it with jquery

8688480
requestfactory	gwt
originally requestfactory was created for gwt

8688480
requestfactory	gwt
the upside of requestfactory is that is seamlessly works with gwt and android

8688491
comparator	comparable
string implements interface comparable so overrides comparator method thus you can compare two strings

8688502
public	protected
public and protected member can be accessed outside the assembly scope and by the class consumer and the developer might actually want the value of the variable to be its default

8688521
fontfamily	font-size
but you can make text in span and input elements look the same with the usual css caveats of course by explicitly setting their fontfamily and font-size

8688587
put	get
e.g if i comment out the json_encode 1 and put random html code instead of data in my success part i get results displayed in my browser

8688706
freemarker	velocity
jsp velocity and freemarker are not template engines with your meaning of a template engine

8688708
int	chars
the result of adding java chars shorts or bytes is an int

8688708
int	double
for example for adding there are instructions iadd for int ladd for longs fadd for floats dadd for double and that s it

8688708
int	chars
to simulate with the smaller types the compiler will use iadd and then zero the upper bytes of the int using an instruction like i2c int to chars

8688739
int	chars
an implicit conversion is performed a primitive narrowing conversion from int to chars

8688766

viewdidload	viewdidappear
your suspission is correct it is very usuall for the viewdidload and viewdidappear methods to be called in the same run loop which means that you will not receive any notification before viewdidappear

many-to-one	one-to-many	many-to-many	many-to-one	many-to-many	one-to-many
consequently the direct many-to-many association disappears and is replaced by one-to-many many-to-one associations between the 3 participating classes

8691762
qstring	qbytearray
qstring has both the ctor with the qbytearray and the char so that is exactly the same

8691810
hide	show
if you just want to show hide the button then try binding the isvisible property

8691826
int	boolean
additionally in java but not in c c++ the and || operators apply only to boolean values -- you cannot use or || on an int eg

google-chrome	firefox
this is how it looks in firefox google-chrome the expected display

8692026
int	chars
you re trying to display chars as if they were int

8692026
int	chars
either change your chars array to an int array very easy or every time you display the data cast it to int tedious

8692030
free	malloc
given just a pointer value there is no portable reliable way to determine if it was allocated by new by malloc or if it even points to something on the free store as your first method shows the pointer passed may actually point to an object on automatic storage

8692072
google-chrome	safari
the following works in desktop safari and google-chrome but not their mobile versions

8692383
oncreate	setcontentview
requestwindowfeature must be called before you call setcontentview view in your activity s oncreate

8692386
try-catch	exception-handling
the first thing that comes to mind is to wrap the entire thing in a try-catch statement and throw exception-handling instead of using the if else blocks

8692392
try-catch	exception-handling
with this approach you will find that you do not need to add many try-catch blocks you will tend to use them at the point of integration with services such as filesystem network etc ... but your business logic is almost always free of exception-handling handling mechanisms

8692411
ubuntu	linux
now we started a new project on linux ubuntu and for that we use svn tortoise

8692413
avaudioplayer	avfoundation
you will need to use avfoundation probably avaudioplayer to play the song

as discussed in how to use tables concepts editors and renderers a table s default renderer is a jlabel and the default editor is a jtextfield

8692438
valgrind	memcheck
if you can compile your code on a supported platform you should certainly give valgrind memcheck tool a try

8692451
free	malloc
it s interesting that majority preference was to insert custom hooks into malloc free and then add even more code for custom hooks into operators new delete

8692451
free	malloc
it already has full reporting and aggregation of statistics which is something you d have to write on top of just intercepting malloc free

8692451
free	malloc
detecting malloc free leaks which occurred in someone else s code not specifically the dll under your control

8692455
getter	setter
shouldn t the getter setter be defined something like

8692479
realloc	malloc
i wrote my own mymalloc myrealloc and myfree and overloaded new and delete so that they would call my functions. then i wrote malloc and realloc macros which invoked mymalloc and myrealloc passing them __file__ and __line__

8692481
rss	feed
so i m putting together an rss parser which will process an rss feed filter it and then download the matched items

8692490
implements	extends
2nd way would be if you dont want to re-create the svg then i guess create a rectangle in your class which extends sprite keep the rectangle dimensions such that it wraps the sprite and then implements the collides with function with the rectangle instead of whole svg

8692513
maven	pom.xml
i have a maven project that was created from a pom.xml file as described in the following link

8692517

disk	ram
i am actually interested to know the api used to create a ram disk

8692521
disk	ram
i wish to extract the archive into a ram disk and pass the third party the path to the respective directory on that ram disk

8692539
hide	show
then you can just hide the grid element or show it

8692567
disk	ram
there is no api to create a ram disk per se

8692567
disk	ram
now if for some reason you cannot rely on the presence of a ramdisk on a system and you absolutely need the fastest performance possible then i see no option but to install a third-party perhaps freely downloadable perhaps even open source ram disk use it temporarily and then uninstall it

8692582
disk	ram
that is i ve never been able to do what you might want to bring the database into ram from disk and then point mysql at it and expect mysql to understand it for example i don t believe that mysql can grok an idx file that used to be on disk and is now in ram

8692591
put	get
at this moment when user calls create record action i save new record get its database id generate record number using this id then put it to the edit form

8692596
hash	md5
say that your outdated hash method is md5 and you want to replace it with the more secure sha1 this is what you do

8692596
hash	salt
a user logs in you hash its password with the new method sha1 and salt

8692596
salt	md5	hash	salt	hash	md5
1 you hash with the old method md5 and salt

8692596
salt	md5	hash	salt	hash	md5
a if a match is found corresponding username and password and method md5 you hash the password with the new method sha1 and salt and update the database accordingly

8692636
nsstring	nsdata
convert utf-8 encoded nsdata to nsstring

8692669

8692670
versioning	upgrade
only when you are ready need you pay to upgrade to a fuller versioning

8692752
ienumerable	icollection
if the signature return type of get is not an icollection then the first will not work if it is not ienumerable then the second will not work

8692765
post	get
to get round this you could just select the data from the post table and then distinct it

8692768
udp	tcp
i tried looking into proc net tcp and proc net udp but they don t have the process name or process identifier like netstat displays it

8692805
int	boolean
in the mvertical is true condition of the onlayout boolean changed int l int t int r int b method of slidingdrawer or whatever variant of slidingdrawer you re using you should find the following line of code.

8692805
int	boolean
likewise if the sliding drawer is set to slide horizontal right-to-left or right-to-left in the mvertical is false condition of the onlayout boolean changed int l int t int r int b method find the following line of code.

google-chrome	firefox
this function shows my body resolution in google-chrome my 1350x651 in firefox 1509x20 and in internet explorer nothing

8692902
width	height
for example a device of size 480 x 800 of high density will results in screen of 320 x 533 it divides by 1.5 both screen width and height and for screen of size 240x320 of low density it gives 320x426 again it divides by 0.75 both width and height

8692902
width	height
using a timer to query the screen s width and height prior to applying some css is unacceptable since on different devices different time intervals are needed 300ms 500ms - how can i apply css with different screen sizes

8692911
hash	md5
the platform has built-in functions for hashing md5 sha1 etc but not encryption so what i thought i d do is simply hash the data concatenated with some secret data to ensure that it was generated by my system and not an attacker

8692927
ienumerable	ilist
thanks for help with explaining to me about ilist and ienumerable

8692927
ienumerable	ilist
does the foreach need an ilist or and ienumerable

8692966
ienumerable	ienumerator
count extension method works for all objects that support ienumerable and since ienumerable itself does not have any means of reporting item count it may have to iterate over ienumerable instance using it s ienumerator which can be a real performance hit if called many times

8692966
ilist	icollection
however if you look into count implementation you ll see that it is optimized for icollection types both generic and non-generic at least in fw4.0 meaning ilist and are also optimized and if your object implements icollection which reports item count in count property count method returns item count without iterating through collection

8693025
post	get
i would like to get the id of a class that is created in a while loop the id of the class being the id of the user who made that post and then send the id to php

post	put
more importantly in this case i think post is more appropriate than put

8693510
post	put
post is used to create new resources while put is used to create or update named resources

8693759
textview	imageview
the layouts are somewhat heavy - a few imageview textview a linearlayout and a relativelayout - so i started thinking about performance

8693765
uiview	subviews
this still applies but i believe you need to take it a step further and have the parent uiview use the hit testing technique that sergio described on each of it s subviews that are siblings to the overlay and have the parent uiview manually invoke a do something method on each of it s subviews that pass the hit test

8693777
int	double
i have tried int long and double so far

8693790
put	get
i tried to put it in getnextelement but couldn t get that to work either

8693791
width	height
you should not set a canvas width height through css

8693829
inherited	subclassing
if you inherited ordinarily b a c a then the class d b c has two subclassing of type a namely d b a and d c a

8693829

tex	sweave
each report is generated by executing a sweave script and then compiling a pdf out of the resulting tex file

8698314
tex	sweave
for instance if there is an error when executing r cmd sweave weekly.rnw it exits but still generates a tex file which i have checked cannot be stopped and this tex file would not compile correctly in pdflatex pdflatex weekly.tex command would hang and the shell script will not move to the next r cmd sweave daily.rnw

8698357
lxml.html	beautifulsoup
but if you are allowed to store whole tree into memory you can use lxml.html which is faster than beautifulsoup

8698365
portrait	landscape
i am a little confused about your question but what i think you are trying to ask is how to change your view if the screen is in landscape or portrait orientation

8698365
portrait	landscape
without seeing your code it is hard to tell you exactly how to do it but the general idea at least how i do it in my code is that you want to split your code into two parts one that is in landscape orientation and one that is in portrait orientation

8698365
width	height
you can tell the difference by seeing if the screen height is greater than the screen width

8698386

perhaps surprisingly chars constants in c are of type int so

8698476
joomla	smarty
now instead of having these articles be relatively static pieces of text in joomla database editable by joomla s logic i have my separate php script the actual web app directly output whatever html or text or smarty - whichever abstraction level is best into the corresponding article text record inside joomla s database

cos	sin
now calc can be given any name and will be a function that returns a coordinate probably as a tuple of x and y given x sin î and y cos î

8698577
memcached	apc
use apc or memcached and more traditional approaches to scaling out

8698578
16-bit	64bit
placing the kernel at lower addresses will reduce the range of addresses available to applications ex 16-bit app in 32-bit mode or 32-bit app in 64bit mode and or complicate their memory management

8698631
post	get
this example post is not sufficient to get the data to work display themselves in wordpress neither in the admin-post-editor nor the front-end for the user

8698662
accessor	properties
dot syntax translates to a call of the appropriate properties accessor method when it s applied to object pointers

8698662
width	height
more likely though the contentsize property is a nssize and nssize is a structure with width and height fields

8698675
floating-point	fractions
of course even using a nice round angle you re not going to get a fractions out of the squared sine and cosine functions because they return floating-point numbers

8698682
google-chrome	firefox
this is code working fine in ie8 but getting failed in firefox and google-chrome browsers

8698722
width	height
fill_parent match_parent and it means that it takes the width or height which ever property it is being specified as of the parent container

8698722
width	height
wrap_content means that the height or width takes on the height or width of the child

given the quality and length of bluetooth hid profile specification usb hid one and tooling available and actual device specifics i guess trial and error will take you further

8698838

now this works fine for google-chrome but shows scrollbars for firefox

8698859

post	put	post	get	put	get
your issue may be because you are trying to correlate crud create retrieve update and delete semantics with the http specification rest verbs get put post delete head with the following incomplete mapping

8698966
put	get
however put indicates something is to be put on the server and when there is an empty body it is invalid and should always get a 400 response

i just used rows to show me a date and i could easily use nextuntil - but it got a little more complicating after breaking it down into several tables each representing a month

8699122
cpu	affinity
the linker is however complaining that the pthread_setaffinity_np is not found as far as i understand the linker is looking for the reference in the wrong pthread library usr lib libpthread.so which doesn t include support for cpu affinity

8699127
awt	swing
1 since as of the jdk 6 update 12 and jdk7 build 19 releases you can seamlessly mix heavyweight awt and lightweight swing components but i don t suggest mixing awt with swing

8699127
awt	swing
2 its hard change look and feel for awt components i never saw good one by default is there look and feel that came from native os look and feel is about usage swing jcomponents

processors affinity is handled both inside the pthread library often packaged with libc and inside the kernel because it is related to the scheduler

8699184
next	except
here is what i have so far and it s working perfect except it needs next and prev button

8699184
next	except
this is working fine except it only displays page numbers and i want to know how the next and prev controls can be integrated with this

8699192
qobject	qwidget
while good advise for c++ in general answer 1 is actually wrong for a big part in qt qobject and with it all widgets since qwidget derives from qobject

8699192
children	parent
rule there is to always allocate qobjects on the heap if they have a parent because qobject features a parent-based garbage collection when the topmost qobject-parent gets deleted it will ask all its children to delete themselves recursively

8699243
comparator	comparable
to actually do your sorting you might want to make your fooditems implement comparable aswell and copy paste your actual comparator logic in it

8699250
rss	feed
it could have been my mistake or it could have been faults in the installation but i have found that my code crashes if i attempt to access certain folders such as rss feed

if run the application on my pc hitting space or the left mouse button on my keyboard gives a button click

i want to make a dialog pop-up when the checkbox is checked but i can t find a method that is called when that checkbox is checked

8699327
wordpress	joomla
same question for drupal wordpress joomla

8699352
width	height
if you express width and height in fixed units such as pixels you will achieve what i m thinking you need

8699376
width	height
it might be a bit less efficient but it calculates the width and height by itself every time the data is changed

8699423
fputs	fflush
echoed line to be output by calling fflush after each call to fputs

8699423
stdio	fputs
stevens speaks of line buffered output because people use fgets and fputs with stdio

when we saw bookmarks improvements push pull bookmarks on remote repo and track current behaviour activated by default we decided to use

8699675
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i ve spent ages stuck on this using the tab bar template without storyboard i can easily switch between tabs and switch between views within each table however when it comes to swapping between a uitabbarcontroller and a uiviewcontroller whatever code i keep trying won t work

8699698

8699766
ubuntu	linux
i am trying to install make pyqt v4.9 using python v3.1 on a linux machine running ubuntu 10.04

8699812
unsigned	short
i then referred the c99 specification - 7.19.6 formatted input output functions and couldn t understand the correct format specifier when using the length modifiers like short long etc with unsigned for int data type

8699821
width	height
any component that requires some dimensional computation for its initialization won t work in a hidden tab because the tab panel itself is hidden via display none so that any elements inside won t report their actual width and height 0 in most browsers

8699826
unsigned	short
unsigned short

8699848
codeigniter	kohana
i ve just started having a play with kohana coming from codeigniter and straight php

8699853
integer	unsigned	unsigned	short
h a following integer conversion corresponds to a short int or unsigned short int argument or a folâ

8699853
integer	unsigned	unsigned	short
so to print an unsigned short integer the format string should be hu

8699878
google-chrome	firefox
i hacked together an alternative approach that achieved a much higher fps 60 or more under both google-chrome and firefox

8699878
google-chrome	firefox
this roughly matches the difference that you are seeing between firefox and google-chrome 3 fps vs

8699925
width	height
width 100 height 100 start angle 0 swap angle 130

8699926
for-loop	loops
you have to change the value in the list itself so there is no other way then to do it in a for-loop unless you are allowed to make a new list then you can use linq which will loops in it s own code

8699975
inherited	properties
through code i can acess the properties of the productviewmodel class from productdetailsviewmodel view but when i set the datacontext of my productdetailview to producdetailsviewmodel class and bind properties uri for instance which is define inside the inherited class binding seems not occurs

objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
see documentation for serializable interface as well as objectinputstream and objectoutputstream

i believe it s not possible to show the keyboard without the user touching a text input element and triggering click mouseup or mousedown

8700040
awt	swing
awt swing

8700043
swt	swing
both the netbeans platform pure swing but good looking and adaptable look feel and eclipse rcp swt do

8700050
autofac	castle-windsor
then you should definitely consider using a di ioc container like structuremap castle-windsor autofac or unity

8700073
jdk1.6	jdk1.5
i encountered a difference illustrated below when drag-and-dropping an url from a browser onto an application which needs to support jdk1.5 jdk1.6 and jdk1.7

8700079
jboss	glassfish
i don t know about glassfish but jboss uses an embedded tomcat so you might get comfortable with it somewhat easier

8700083
versioning	upgrade
also upgrade or post upgrade issues may occur if these files are not available in the new versioning environment

8700142
awt	swing
awt - don t use it at all swing was designed to solve issues with awt

8700142
swt	swing
swt is claimed to be faster than swing although in modern versions swing is also fast enough

8700151
swt	swing
there are significant differences between swt and swing

8700151
swt	swing
back for your question swt is also portable like swing but for each platform you have to use a different library which uses the platform s native implementation

8700169
awt	swing
since it is very confortable using predefined objects and drag and drop them from a palette and in most cases it is so hard to override basics methods then you need to add another custom api for basic methods that are implemented by default in awt swing

8700169
awt	swing
all the java custom frameworks are based on overriding methods that comes with awt swing

8700211
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the arrow of each combobox is displaced in all browsers i tried firefox google-chrome opera

8700237
hide	show
in one of my pods i have a usercontrol which bears a back button.once i click it means i need to hide the existing pod and have to show some other pod.for that i have hardcoded some method in mainpage.xaml

8700240
switching	screens
plays even with the screens locked and with the ring silent switching set

8700259
division	multiplication
let s redo interaction 2 but with division instead of multiplication

8700278
sequence	permutation
an additional problem occurs when the fisherâ yates shuffle is used with a pseudorandom number generator or prng as the sequence of numbers output by such a generator is entirely determined by its internal state at the start of a sequence a shuffle driven by such a generator cannot possibly produce more distinct permutation than the generator has distinct possible states

8700291
folder	directory
as the asset directory is read only because android .apk file is read-only so you can t write anything in asset folder file you have to first copy that sqlite database file into your application s internal storage directory then you can modify your database file

8700317
hide	show
alternatively you may want to have the fragments listen to an event of sorts which tells them whether they should show or hide the layout in question

8700347
gtk	gjs
i am writing a gtk app using gjs gnome javascript bindings

8700386
opera	firefox
this link sheds more light on the issues firefox 4.0 beta â as well as ie and opera â do not send name value for input type â imageâ

8700391
getter	setter
in gettarebybarcodeform which extends the actionform the following getter and setter methods are there

8700396
pull	push
as i switch between machines i will push and pull changes to keep the two dev machines in sync

8700430
put	get
cache can be implemented as an actor so that interaction with it put get operations would take place through message passing

8700432
gridview	rowdatabound
but i can t get it to add a row i tried it on rowdatabound and then databound event but they both aren t working here is my code if someone could show me how to dynamically add a row to the end of gridview not footer that would be cool anyway here is my code that doesn t work

8700438
post	get
and controller has the classic post and get functions compatible with json to call and update the page

8700453
inherited	properties
or you can set the basedir-path of the root in a properties so it will be inherited

8700510
jasmine	qunit
also if you re using resharper you might like to look at their integration with qunit there s every chance they ll integrate it with jasmine too

8700628
atomikos	bitronix
if i use a different implementation of the transaction manager such as bitronix tm or atomikos and not the default provided by the container is it just enough to inject the new tm into usertransaction object

8700654
put	get
ideally you want to put all your code inside a scoping function so you don t create global symbols and if we do that we can just get the element once and then use it in the event handler because the event handler we ll create will be a closure over the context of the scoping function don t worry closures are not complicated

8700768
glulookat	glrotate
i tried to use some other function instead of glrotate glfrustum glperspective glulookat applying skewing matrix but i couldn t make them work properly

8700796
integer	unsigned
always returns maximum unsigned integer value

8700798
jobs	cron
the path i now chose is easy to understand i end up with a list of resolving domains and - when needed - i can check those using curl on demand or using one or more cron jobs on interval

8700879
getter	setter
if you want to assert if setter getter or methods have been called use instead

8700907
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
from my computer using my account and my sister s account firefox google-chrome - we both see all of them in opera without login i also see all of the applications

8700941
nsmutablestring	nsdata	nsmutablestring	nsstring	nsstring	nsdata
something always nags me that it s best to use an nsdata vs nsmutabledata or nsstring rather than an nsmutablestring

8700942
setinterval	settimeout
javascript s settimeout or setinterval can do this for you

8700945
inherited	subclassing
as friend relationship are not inherited you don t have to worry about b s possible subclassing

8700966
post	get
i guess there s an easy sql query to get a list of authors and post per month for each of them

8700967
folder	dir	folder	directory
of course on the second computer net dir is pointing to the right directory in the shared folder

8700967
paradox	bde
if i use share folder and run both program my and original on the same computer and configure bde to use the shared folder connection from c# to paradox database can t be opened

8700972
getter	setter
property is a key word useful to create setter getter methods automatically for that field

8700977
post	get
ok i have a rails 3 application and when i try to do a .post request to a rails action i get prompted to relogin ...this might be related to the authenticity_token or the way rails 3 handles post or remote true ...but honestly i really dont know why its not working...here is my code

8701013
inherited	properties
because at sometimes if your class makes a reference to some other class or inherited from other class that has the properties with same name you need to avoid name clash by using this

8701020
children	parent
problem is collection mapping on a must filter children based on checking if one of two a associations is the parent one

8701025
versioning	upgrade
i would strongly suggest to upgrade to a recent qt versioning though if the project allows it

8701037
google-chrome	firefox
then it doesn t work at least in google-chrome ie and firefox

8701089
width	height
then i want to double the image width and height

8701107
hex	binary
you should almost always use base64 or hex to represent arbitrary binary data in printable text

8701119
google-chrome	safari
this works in ie8 and up as well as google-chrome and safari however in ie7 it just ignores the nth-child bit and therefore doesn t apply my css

8701121
hide	show
other searches on google show the same approach you hide somehow the div and you load the content into it again and display it by chaining the operations needed

8701122
mouse	keyboard
you can also ask the user if possible to apply some random keyboard or mouse input

8701162
put	get
put the index of image view to get the image view object

8701173
hide	show
i want that exact effect to show and hide my div

8701181

are you using a mamp wamp or real webserver with php

8701201
fadein	fadeout
consider fadein and fadeout methods

8701214
getter	setter
i would like to manually type out the accessor getter setter for msomeint but when i press space after public above the caret jumps to the beginning of public myclass

8701274
width	height
note before the fade in your s height width should be both 0 to see the effect

8701281
lightopenid	hybridauth
i have not used lightopenid only hybridauth

8701284
width	height
when the div that triggers the animation is clicked we grab the current height and width of the window to figure out the initial starting position for the growing div as well as the position it should animate to

8701319
maven	pom.xml
with tycho all you need is a pom.xml and you usually will not change this information which is generated via maven

8701328
hide	show
button to show hide the right view and window resize accordingly

8701328
width	height
left one main always-on and non resizable in width it can resize in height

8701328
width	height	hide	show
right one show hide can resize in width height must have always a min width

8701328
width	height
when right is hidden main window min width height equals the left view

8701331
postgresql	mysql
for your db you probably don t want to use sqlite for the scalability problems you mention - instead mysql or postgresql maybe

8701359
ppl	tbb
you can find easy implementations in tbb and ppl

8701365
viewmodel	caliburn.micro
as you can see it is bound to a viewmodel using caliburn.micro but i think this is unrelevant

8701425
submit	submission
one thing to look for event handlers on your page s bound to elements or to things that cause form submission tags with type submit or submit elements and other things like that

8701434
versioning	upgrade
you need to provide explicitly or hidden in your code db upgrade mechanism and - thus implement something like db versioning chain

8701459
rss	feed
alright so i m trying to get the next feed page from a feedburner rss feed

8701460
google-chrome	firefox
but firefox and google-chrome is working fine

8701462
width	height
jquery has width and height properties available for the object you select

8701471
google-chrome	firefox
however as pointed out by max and erturne in the comments when javascript is written as part of an extension add-on to the browser the regular rules about same origin policy and cross-domain requests does not seem to apply - at least not for firefox and google-chrome

8701516
width	height
use element instead and the key is to give it proper width and height

8701516
width	height
put the correct image width and height and it should work fine

8701517
int	chars
the int is represented by a array of unsigned chars

8701517
integer	unsigned
in my case this is a problem because the variable base10 is of type unsigned integer of 32 bits

8701534
width	height
set a height and width to your image

8701539
daemon	cron
every time your code gets any kind of control over the machine check if your cron daemon is running classic pid file and start it if necessary

8701590
selecteditem	selectedindex
when the selectedindex is updated selecteditem remains the same and vice versa

8701666
wadl	wsdl
cannot determine if the service is of type wsdl or wadl

8701698
children	parent
an arbitrary program such as your bash program cannot change the working directory of the parent process as that would pretty much break all existing processes that spawn children

8701763
trie	dawg
clearly either a trie or a dawg would be ideal to store these

8701763
trie	dawg
i would suggest therefore you implement a trie dawg and use it to store all of the hashes in the first array

8701767
int	chars
so far what i have done is turn the string into an array of chars and then convert the chars into int by using

8701767
int	chars
taking the first element of the new chars array and converting it to a int

8701829
versioning	upgrade
assemblies that have been upgrade to 4.0 from previous versioning have level 2 transparency by default

8701832
parseint	stringtokenizer
you can also use stringtokenizer to split the string into substrings and then use parseint to convert them into integers

8701908
union	distinct
you should to union both columns and then filter for distinct values

8701908
union	distinct
after test union operator and reread mysql union operator documentation by default mysql filter for distinct values

8701910
folder	directory
if you haven t changed the server path and it thus defaults to eclipse s workspace metadata then the tomcat s work directory is not in tomcat s own installation folder but in the path as shown in the above screenshot

8701926
implements	extends
just store string s in a sortedset may be extends treeset and provide implements your own get int i method where you iterate till the ith element and return that element

8701927
wadl	wsdl
i tried it with new soapui project wizard and putting that urls in initial wsdl wadl

8701949
uilabel	uitextview
i ve a storyboard with a uiscrollview which contains two uilabel a uiimageview and a uitextview

8701954
union	distinct
in mysql union selects distinct rows by default

8701967
x86	64bit
it s called program files on 32-bit windows systems but on 64bit systems it s called program files x86

8701974
google-chrome	firefox
this sample rate might be lower as only google-chrome and firefox are supported

8701992
post	get
but basically you want every method to be called through a post instead of a get and you would send a soapheader with every http call

8702049
versioning	upgrade
there was no upgrade notification and market only displays the old versioning

8702051
ssl	https
the app works great under ssl but when i change the schema from https to http using a response.redirect the request get a timeout i am stuck with it any idea is welcome

then your client itterates through both data sets as a sorted merge easily matching the children to parent as they are in the same order

8715735
for-loop	loops
the issue is that c for loops don t work the way you think they do as evidenced by the fact that you can initialize a for-loop with

phpunit	simpletest
i m really really baffled that simpletest still is considered an alternative to phpunit

8715966
phpunit	simpletest
subjective phpunit provides much nicer code coverage reports than simpletest

a few things to note about one-to-one relationships they are more difficult to master with ef than one-to-many and even many-to-many relationships

8716283
hash	md5
it can be that md5 calculator is making the md5 hash of file content + other properties ex author last process date etc.

8716283
hash	md5
you may try to do alter these properties and make another hash to see if the result is equal between before and after using only md5 calculator

8716316

specifications for ecmascript versions 3 and 5 at least both explicitly declare a string to be a collection unsigned 16-bit integers and that if those integer values are meant to represent textual data then they are utf-16 code units

8716338
superclass	subclassing
you can inadvertently break subclassing by changing a superclass

8716349
children	parent
given a collection of collections it allows you to work with the children of all parent collections at once like this

8716396
move	drag
if not cpanel just move it to the folder through the same basic operation it is a question of drag and drop

8716397
prepare	execute
with these outputs in hand you prepare your dynamic query using the string add parameter values using the dictionary and then execute the query against your rdbms source

8716421
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i fixed them and test it in firefox ie google-chrome and safari and it looks fine now

8716442
width	height
when i place it there it takes 100 of the width and 100 of the visible i said i m using scroll bar height

8716483
move	drag
what i want this code to do is when i press and drag the red ball on the screen i want it to move with the mouse cursor this code does the job and is partly taken from sun code so it is suppose to be efficient but yet if i move the mouse too fast it stops draging the mouse.

8716570
entities	entitymanager
if this is the case you can try calling refresh after fixing your refreshobject method to return the refreshed object and then reapply the changes or evict clear the entity from the entitymanager at appropriate times so that entities are reloaded from the database

8716576
width	height
your image has width and height attributes on it

8716608
inherited	properties
i would assume it inherited from frameworkelement which has a minheight properties

8716641
put	get
my guess would be to put each box into a div and then adjust each div s margin-left and margin-top properties to get them to all line up

8716672
uilabel	uitapgesturerecognizer
you could just set userinteractionenabled to yes on it then add a uitapgesturerecognizer to the uilabel to detect when someone taps on it

8716690
min	max
if you use ib you can set the min and max values for a slider so use 0 1 respectively

8716752

put	get
if you re using it to do the mangling of java s symbols get rid of the -optimize directive from your proguard.cfg and put -dontoptimize instead

8716828
min	max
though i tend to avoid unions and would just select the min and max together

8716834
post	get
your person is presumably a non-view model and therefore when you have a valid post back you get the person to save it s data or whatever and the extra viewable information is irrelevant at that point because you are no longer in a view ui part of your app

8716839
min	max
i have a property float a and i want to interpolate between two values say float min and float max over some time interval float t seconds.

8716897
hide	show
the previous developer made all q a to show and hide using server-side and is static on the page

8716908
backgrounding	multitasking
well an application can run in the backgrounding and apple perfectly accepts this however the user will obviously be be able to close the application or should be able to via the multitasking bar and this will end the application

8716908
backgrounding	multitasking
so an application can run in the backgrounding so long as the user can quit it when close it from the multitasking bar however it cannot continue to run after the user closed it via multitasking - if it does continue apple will reject the application

8716942
public	protected
if dispose false isn t going to do anything that s a very good indication that neither your class nor any class derived from it should include a c#-style destructor nor override finalize and the disposing argument should be regarded as a dummy whose purpose is to give the protected dispose method a different signature from the public one

8716947
post	get
each browser will handle that correctly without client-side scripting and it does not break the get post semantics

8716968
put	get
plus this will get hairy deciding which slot to put the new signup in

8716995
folder	directory
unless the file should also be stored in the bin folder copy to output directory should be left set to none

8716998
nsmanagedobjectcontext	nsmanagedobjectmodel
1 i declare nsmanagedobjectmodel nsmanagedobjectcontext and nspersistentstorecoordinatorin contentcontroller.h

8717060
width	height
i have images in a panel that are sized down with width and height and need them removed when the image is dropped

8717116
dictionary	map
once you know which way you need to map you either use the original or the auxiliary dictionary for the lookup

8717118
dictionary	map
you would have to create a separate dictionary for it and use that method to map the key values backwards

8717124
ravendb	db4o
in an app on which i m currently working i just replaced db4o with ravendb

8717135
sms	tropo
it uses tropo to add voice and sms to drupal 6 s built-in poll module

8717143

moving devname from protected to public doesn t change a thing

8717189
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
seems to work fine back quite a few versions in google-chrome safari and firefox but not at all in ie8 or even ie9

8717208
for-loop	arrays
that script needs the try block as you can see because the logic of the for-loop is very poor it will often overrun the streamitems arrays and probably has a race condition when removing the hidden-tweet class

8717239
clang	llvm
i don t think clang llvm does much but i could be wrong here

8717285
free	realloc
moreover you must update this number every time you use realloc or free

8717313
mouse	keyboard
in the situation above the parent control is a tcontrol it creates several sub controls in my example above all three have their own window handles and thus windows can display keyboard focus when you hit tab and handle mouse focus as part of windows s common controls library s functionality

8717313
mouseup	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown
there are more sub-tasks than this to accomplish if you wish to build a control yourself i recommend you study existing controls such as tstringgrid and tcategorybuttons in the vcl source code to see the mousemove mousedown and mouseup handling code you will need to do the things you are trying to do

8717337
screens	tablet
but for smaller displays or tablet i wanted to take advantage of the media screens queries to detach the side column and stack it under the main column

but when it s stacked under the main it becomes wider and i wanted to show both iframe side by side and hide the selecting button

8717354
google-chrome	firefox
in my case same code worked fine on firefox but not on google-chrome

8717462
hash	salt
i wanted to know if the process of hashing a hash would help stop attacks to it brute-force i think when used with salt as well

8717462
hash	salt
from what i can work out my code would be secure because it stops rainbow table attacks by using salt and stops brute-force attacks by iterating the hash

8717481
post	put
you ll have to resort to json for example combined with the put or post method

8717488
hash	salt
in one of my apps i salt and hash the username and password together to create a unique token

8717506
margin	height
what i want to do is to resize the div that holds the images so that the div always fills what s left of the height of the browser window except a 25px margin at the bottom that s set on body

8717515
hash	salt	crypt	salt	crypt	hash
using crypt in conjunction with crypt_blowfish a.k.a bcrypt you can do input your password and salt into the function and get a finished hash after iterations and everything

8717527
post	put
if you want to post your whole query here i can refactor it but as it were you need to put the alias outside the subquery

8717566
width	height
if you dont know how to get the width and height of the mobile phone screen let me know

8717582
ienumerable	ilist
from my reading i think i could have used ienumerable instead of ilist since i am just looping through stuff

8717590
min	max
i used it to zoom in on a group of points and just calculated the min max points and was good to go

8717641
getter	setter
because the public accesor methods are inherited you can invoke getter setter methods on this

8717641
getter	setter
and make corresponding public getter setter for all of them

8717644
folder	directory
point its physical directory to website1 that we just copied into the new folder on the root section 1 step 1

8717652

also in httpd.conf make sure that .htaccess is actually the name apache expects for access files

8717778
portrait	landscape
so it s working in portrait and landscape really well

8717798

8717983
min	max
also i use php s min and max functions so that it doesn t matter which order the dates are specified

8718014
filtering	grouping	sorting	grouping	sorting	filtering
firstly let me say that i know that says strings can only be used for storage and retrieval and that they can not participate in expressions be used for filtering sorting or grouping .

8718061
google-chrome	safari
most of your functionality will likely work if you browse to your www folder using google-chrome or safari

8718075
google-chrome	firefox
i have read a little about google-chrome extensions but i have not found any documentation on an api exposed by google-chrome that is analogous to com in ie or xpcom in firefox

8718176
folder	directory
i ran the rails g active_admin install in the parent mountable engine directory and the folder mycode testingengine app admin does exist with the default dashboard file so im not sure where to go from here

draggable	droppable
i have an issue with a jquery draggable and droppable area on a site i m building

8718292

i m using upstart to launchd a daemons to run a node.js using express and connect-redis http and https server in the same node .js file per

8718348
hash	salt
out of this i created a script which access the ajaxscript first gets the time hash or encrypts the same time with a good known salt and password and delivers these two values to the user

8718409
post	put
i found that my page worked a lot nicer though if i put the hiding showing of the placeholders in an asp.net ajax updatepanel so the page wouldn t post back

8718450
paradox	bde
when paradox bde in your case accesses a table it places a lock of one type or another on the table by creating and making an entry in a special lock file in the table directory

8718486
folder	directory
i have also included the sub directory web-inf and classes and lib in this jsp folder

8718504
google-chrome	firefox
on google-chrome it works fine but on ie and firefox it s not working.

google-chrome	safari
right now both safari 5.1 and google-chrome 16 print out a o could be a zero

8718557
haskell	scheme
or construct new data structures and scheme based on haskell existing map and set

8718614
post	get
on the first page user would see only updated post so i thought when page administrator insert s a post i will render a .html file with updated newest post s and user s will get redirected there where all post are there and everything is fine no php execution no mysql query s against a large database

8718634
disk	ram
if you have enough ram on your machine then you could set this pretty high and maybe there is a way to get the jvm to use disk swap space so it could be insanely high but i do not know how if this is possible

8718636
realloc	malloc
just start with a decent size malloc then realloc as you go if needed

8718636
realloc	malloc
you should probably check the result of malloc and realloc

8718659
getter	setter	put	get
i have a few model classes that extend they define getter and setter which wrap the map s get and put methods

8718675
calloc	malloc
you dont need many malloc s one calloc is enough

8718696
move	drag
and one day it might keep you from reusing certain windows somewhere else like in another program or just in another part of the same program since they need the windowmanager class which in turn needs all other windows so you can t move this one window somewhere else because it d drag all the other windows along

8718697
post	get
ajax calls aren t -technically- diffrent than normal post get requests and the target is always has to visible to user browser you can t make your application secure by security through obscurity approach

i ve figured out how to get the pictures side-by-side but there is a tiny space between the columns that i cannot get rid of.i am brand new at this all so i don t even know how to post code here without it rendering so i will post a snapshot of what comes up- and code when i figure that out too

8718856
hide	show
i tried inserting a reset button that successfully resets the form data and attempts to reset the bar graph but really just performs a show and hide and the problem persists

8718895
post	put
put your html code into a form tag and try to post data back to php page

8718895
post	get
ajax works in a similar way there is a processor on the server side and the only difference is that the form doesn t get submitted via post page reload but it s submitted using javascript

8718904
hide	show
a toggle just does a straight hide show animation by changing the opacity of the element slowly until it s gone

8718941

8719029
pop-up	dialog

8719127
google-chrome	firefox
i ve come up with the following solution which worked well in ie google-chrome and firefox

8719150
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried it in mac and windows - safari ie firefox and google-chrome but no they all show the scrollbars

8719603
hid	keyboard
i m trying to write a custom driver for a keyboard hid if it matters under windows 7

8719624
gridbaglayout	springlayout

8719626
express	node.js
i m using node.js and express to handle http requests and responses

8719927
chmod	mkdir
try a chmod post- mkdir

8719947
hash	md5
in such cases i recommend using a helper field where you can store md5 or any other hash mechanism to store hash value of combining all your fields in your dedupe rule then before insert you need to generate hash for new values and check if it s already exist in your table by querying on your helper field

8719969

the workaround would be to simply have your mdb delegate to a sessionbean of any kind as stateless stateful and singleton all have requestscoped tests

8720158
width	height
i have a circle say radius of 10 and i can find the outer bounding rect easy enough since its width and height is equal to the radius but what i need is the inner bounding rect

8720187
pop-up	dialog
here you could have at least perhaps a dialog pop-up and say something on the lines of

8720196
stdout	stderr
on another note you may also redirect stdout stderr

8720239
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
newer ie and google-chrome safari opera and firefox don t seems to have a problem with this

8720248
post	put
the android end the app seems to encode the information into a url which is then added to a bundle and put in an http post

8720251
google-chrome	firefox
you could do this with event.clientx event.clienty or event.pagex event.pagey something similar to those not completely sure just did some quick research but those seemed to work in google-chrome ie and firefox

8720254
google-chrome	firefox
in both google-chrome and firefox the hover and active state css properties can only be viewed when the element is hovered or clicked

8720275
typebuilder	reflection.emit
i m trying to implement this pattern using reflection.emit typebuilder

8720285
union	distinct
note the union operator selects only distinct values by default

8720333
width	height
3 how to ensure that each div remains a square so the height is exactly proportional the the width which is a percentage of the width of it s container

8720386
getter	setter
the getter and setter are usually only for other classes to use so i see no reason why you cannot just use mystate uninit

8720398
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
what i m trying to achieve is to use custom made filters with controls like dropdownlistfor textbox and checkbox on radgrid that uses needdatasource event to bind the data

8720446
uiview	subviews
so i thought the simple solution would be to place the uitableview inside a uiview so that the adbanner could also be a subviews to the uiview a peer to the table view

8720446
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
i was expecting viewwillappear and viewdidappear but not only do those nslog statements never get called the ios simulator never displays my uitableview either which is reasonable given the situation

8720453
n-gram	words
the bigger problem is that those words mappings and the n-gram following each of those mappings would need to be stored somewhere which would greatly outweigh any savings of the actual compression.

8720492
portrait	landscape
he shows how to add iad banners to the top of tableviews in both portrait and landscape mode

8720567
getter	setter
the reasons are that it forces you to access the ivar via the property setter and getter or use the dot-syntax self.foo rather than directly

8720579
google-chrome	firefox
windows browsers ie google-chrome firefox are not respecting the old us daylight saving time rules for dates prior to 2007

8720579
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox for osx return the correct value so it appears to be an issue with browsers making a windows api call

8720600
hide	show
when that message is received hide the previously visible view randomly select the next one to show and show it

8720626
hide	show
it just show up in the imageview and when i set the animation it hide the image the fade it in.

8720725
getter	setter
this snippet also uses the debuggerstepthroughattribute so that the debugger will not enter the getter and setter but this should be removed if you don t want that effect.

8720748
versioning	upgrade
then i upgrade my azure project to versioning 1.6 and selected the latest azure os after deploying

8720794
integer	unsigned
i have found that mersenne twister mt19937 is a widely used rng that generates good 32-bit unsigned integers and that implementations have been done to generate apparently good double-precision floats generating a 53-bit integer

8720796
hash	salt
passwords should generally be hash ideally with a salt rather than encrypted so that they can not be decrypted

8720796
hash	salt
then later to check if a user entered their password correctly you take whatever they entered and use the same salt and hash function and see if it matches the hash you have in the database

8720796
hash	salt
when bob visits that url the site verifies that the reset token is valid and allows bob to choose a new password which is then salt hash in the same way as the password he lost

8720810
width	height
if you want the whole windowedapplication to scroll enable scrolling on the windowedapplication in the properties tab or add a canvas that is full width and height

8720830
imageview	viewswitcher
i ve implemented a similar effect before but i used a viewswitcher with 2 imageview rather than a single imageview

8720854
adt	hierarchyviewer
with adt 9.0.0 all those views disappeared in eclipse and apparently moved back to the hierarchyviewer

8720872
google-chrome	firefox
you won t see -moz styles in google-chrome nor -webkit styles in firefox

8720873
hide	show
one approach would be to start with a hidden drop-down in all the appropriate places and then just show and hide them based on user actions

8720931
children	parent
i know that css can select individual children of a parent but is there support to style the children of a container if its parent has a certain amount of children

8720993
screens	hdpi
however if android grabs a difference size sprite because it detects a different dpi ie from ldpi hdpi etc then the sprite will appear to be bigger on the note relative to the screens size than it would on the tab

8720996
ubuntu	linux
i m using ubuntu 10.04 64bit linux and a logitech c600 webcam

8721002
udp	tcp
udp instead of tcp

8721016
children	parent
edit i read your question a little differently - there are a couple other ways to style the parent not the children

8721022
fixed-point	fractions
the representation itself has enough precision for at least 8 decimal places and as a fractions of equatorial arc is good for distances of around 0.14 metres so the limitation is not the fixed-point representation

8721035
folder	directory
my settings_dev.py file is sitting in the same directory as my settings.py file and my app is sitting in a folder called login

8721038
rjava	jri
you may want to use stats-rosuda-devel to discuss rjava jri javagd-related issues there.

8721051
getter	setter
i assume your abstractentity base class is using __get and __set magic methods instead of proper getter and setter

8721085
versioning	upgrade
you can actually test the browser flash versioning in javascript so there really is no point in loading flash to tell the user to upgrade flash

8721086
cmdlet	start-job
this example uses a script block but you can also use a powershell script using the -filepath parameter of the start-job cmdlet instead of the -scriptblock parameter

8721099
portrait	landscape
i m facing orientation problem in the loading mask when i rotate my device to landscape from portrait

8721107
nstextfield	nsimageview
each cell contains several nstextfield an nsimageview and an nsbutton all of which are bound to various attributes of the objectvalue of the table cell view

8721107
nstextfield	nsimageview
the nstextfield and nsimageview behave as expected

8721175
inherited	properties
what the inherited member message means is that the custnum properties of the customer class is no longer accessible from the frequentcutomer class

8721196
hide	show
the javascipt uses jquery to hide the element but you can use the other examples show here to do it just with javascript

8721201
mvp	presenter
with mvp you have a model which represents your data the presenter which is responsible for formatting your data to locales i18n etc.. and your view which are the actual gui widgets

8721215
documentfilter	jtextcomponent
if on the other hand you wanted to check text before it has been committed to the text component you d add a documentfilter to the jtextcomponent s document

8721269
inherited	properties
the class frequentcustomer already has the properties from customer inherited even though you haven t specified them explicitly

8721269
inherited	properties
this means that you don t need to specify the properties custnum in the frequentcustomer class it already had it inherited

8721271
iprincipal	iidentity
if you don t want to implement dozens of membershipprovider methods roleprovidermethods and profileprovider methods then just implement iprincipal and iidentity and just do what you need to do

8721271
hash	salt
the sqlmembershipprovider does can at least store hash salt passwords

8721282
width	height
it works when the outer div has specific width and height set in pixels like

8721282
width	height
but it fails when the height and width are percentages like

8721350
width	height
i think that your problem is that your center of rotation shouldn t be width 2 height 2 -- it s not that simple

8721350
width	height
instead think of the image residing in the left upper portion of a large square the length of the square s side will be the image s width or height whichever is larger

8721465
width	height
based on the fact that you have width and height of 100 declared i m going to assume that you re not expecting anyone to have to scroll here

8721561
portrait	landscape
i also have to make sure that the values take into account left landscape and right landscape device orientations portrait is the default so no calculations would be needed for it

8721566
udp	tcp
however a if you have reliable deliver requirements you might ends up reinventing a portion of tcp ip s wheel and b keep in mind that certain networks corporate firewalls tend to block udp ip while allowing tcp ip traffic and c even udp ip won t be exact real-time

8721670
multiplying	add
this is pretty simple thanks to the fact you can add and or multiplying lists

8721711
put	get
if you put date first then the data is still ordered properly but the rows needed to satisfy the query are likely spread out across the datafile s which would require more i o to get

8721788
versioning	upgrade
i do not think it is necessary to upgrade to a newer versioning of the server for streaming 16 9

8721800
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i m using normalize.css in html5 boilerplate and noticing firefox 9 on os x renders fonts differently than every other browser i m testing with google-chrome 16 safari 5.1.2 opera 11.6 all behave the same

8721807
post	get
or post it here and get an interpretation

8721823
tinyint	boolean
i have tried to replace boolean with bool bit tinyint 1 but it doesn t seem to make any difference

8721834
folder	directory
when you update the application anyways you ll lose what was in the original .exe folder but you can migrate the data directory over to a new version of the app

8721848
equals	tostring
now the class demo has implemented interface and has not implemented the equals and the tostring

8721865
equals	tostring
the class demo just inherits the equals and tostring implementation from object

8721865
equals	tostring
in the case of your code that implementation comes from object since all the classes implicitly extend object which provides default implementations for equals and tostring among other methods

8721865
equals	tostring
also it s completely unnecessary to declare equals and tostring in an interface so you re better off with this definition

8721913
multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract	subtract	add
the computer had a built-in square-root instruction and we built a simple program to demonstrate the computer doing 16-bit add subtract multiplying divide square-root on a tty

8721931
filtering	grouping
a having clause is used to filtering based on aggregated non-group values not to filtering the rows involved in the grouping

8721939
puts	gets
since puts doesn t yield to the block you end up writing the string representation of your enumerator to and the block never gets called

8722008
free	malloc
actually malloc and other c runtime heap functions are module dependant which means that if you call malloc in code from one module a dll then you should call free within code of the same module or you could suffer some pretty bad heap corruption and this has been well documented

8722008
free	malloc
using heapalloc with getprocessheap instead of malloc including overloading new and delete operators to make use of such allow you to pass dynamically allocated objects between modules and not have to worry about memory corruption if memory is allocated in code of one module and free in code of another module once the pointer to a block of memory has been passed across to an external module

8722014
hide	show
is there any reason you can t just use hide and show

8722016
equals	tostring
object defines equals and tostring so you can use override with them but not with say the function show

8722018
hide	show
you can use hide and show to achieve the same effect but the elements will stay in position

8722067
uiview	subviews
how do i archive uiview which has uiimagview and uiimage as subviews of it

8722083
width	height
try removing height width from table imgs

8722117
button	marquee
i am trying to figure out if it is possible to start stop the marquee when a user presses a button

8722139
nsstring	nsdata
first you should convert your string to nsdata to use jsonkit to parse it then you can find the value of the key you want finally jsonkit can convert it back to nsstring

8722182
post	get
when i do this and post data for name and type - i get a doesnotexist error

8722190
versioning	upgrade
after that future versioning of the haskell platform can be upgrade to cleanly simply by installing them

8722191
tpagecontrol	tframe
i have a tpagecontrol with 3 tabsheets each containing a tframe

8722215
width	height
it seems that when the view displays the layer it resizes the layer to the width of the browser view so what i put in width for bounds made no difference to the result however it does honour height

8722299
hide	show
if you are using jquery to show and hide things it has no bearing on seo

8722318
width	height
one of the common reasons for the web page to appear crumpled in mobile is because they are designed for browser width and height and not mobile versions.simple example see the difference in facebook page on browser and on phone

8722369
docx	xlsx	doc	rtf
i am searching any kind of tool which can be convert any kind of extension of them doc docx xls xlsx jpeg jpg txt pdf rtf into pdf file in asp.net code like aspose tool but its too much costly i want same functionality like aspose tool but not much expensive

8722383
std	ostream
std endl is grossly overused and does something different than most people think it does in addition to inserting a newline character n it also flushes the std ostream

8722389
glut	glew
i used the makefile provided to compile and tried to run the file i had many problems with including the libraries glew glut glm but i fixed them after putting the libraries in the cygwin directory

8722389
glut	glew
people on other sites have said to initiate glut before glew but i couldn t find where init glew was run

8722389
glut	glew
after all the library issues had been fixed it threw many issues about multiple declarations and also undefined references to gl glew and glut commands

8722389
g++	gcc
by the way when i said i tried g++ in the command prompt i also tried gcc but also same errors

8722410
pull	push
your developers can now push or pull to vendor in this example

8722460
integer	fractions
the other number classes like float fractions and even integer implement the method addtointeger

8722478
agile	sprint
in our project we are following agile practices sprint

8722485
vsto	add-in
if you spreadsheet file has to be downloaded from server you can use epplus on server to generate spread sheet it will be much faster than vsto than you can use wcf from add-in in excel app to upload the data

8722550
folder	directory
you can copy a file in all folder of a directory by using following command

8722550
folder	dir	folder	directory
dir ad b s - is a command to view all folder and sub folder of a directory

8722563
jar	war
doing a mvn package and see if the spring jar is in your war

8722564
equals	gethashcode
if you only need to do this for one property override the equals and gethashcode methods in test

8722596
post	get
and on later post backs it should get from cached html

8722603
google-chrome	firefox
use firebug for firefox or google-chrome s developer tools or your favorite browser s equivalent to play around with the cookie

8722642
client-side	server-side
you deploy the new gwt app and you want the new server-side to respond to the old client-side

8722650
mouseover	mousedown
the img2.gif is displayed during mouseover and img3.gif is displayed on mousedown

8722694
portrait	landscape
in your info.plist file make sure that uisupportedinterfaceorientations ipad or uisupportedinterfaceorientations exists and has the portrait and landscape orientations your app supports are listed

8722699
public	protected
a field method or constructor of a class may be declared using at most one of the public private or protected keywords

8722699
public	protected
a member that is not declared public protected or private is said to have default access and may be accessed from and only from anywhere in the package in which it is declared

8722770
implements	extends
if your goal is to stop the thread itself then you may want to have periodictask extends thread which is not recommended unless you have a good reason to do so or have periodictask implements runnable

8722774
button	checkbox
the checkbox is actually a button with an image overlaid on it as an icon

8722816
udp	tcp
you ll need to understand the basics of tcp ip and http possibly udp and the protocols involved with yahoo s chess systems or posses a tool to work around them a brief search leads me to believe there are few if any

8722845
stdout	stderr
for stderr and stdout to go to the logfile

8722864
folder	directory
define your xml the following way and place it in your drawable folder under the res directory

8722875
post	get
my guess is that you dont have any file browser apps which can handle get content intent on the emulator though if you post the log can come to conclusion clearly

8722897
int	double
js only has one number type floating point numbers ieee-754 double so generally speaking no distinction is made between int and decimals

8722898
postgresql	mysql
i am using sqlite mysql and postgresql

8722917
getter	setter
you should use setter and getter for the hashmap

8722921
int	double
this means declare fptr_t as pointer to function int returning pointer to function double returning float fptr_t int â double â float

8722927
versioning	upgrade
upgrade your intl extension with a newer icu versioning 4+

8722966
post	get
note avoid using the last option getvar 2 because it first checks the post data and then also checks the get data looking for your specified parameter

8722966
post	get
it should only be used when you are not sure wether the parameter is coming along the get or post request data

8723008
pop-up	dialog
i want a modal dialog to pop-up on page load ideally only the first time a person visits a page but i know nothing about cookies and will perhaps look into that later

8723065
getter	setter
define their getter and setter and you can access each element of each row in jsp like this

8723094
hide	show
i want to hide one view and show the other based on when the uisegmentedcontrol is pressed

8723167
zlib	quazip
i got quazip zlib and compile it and then i can make quazip.lib file

8723170
width	height
this works in ie9 but not in chrome it set the height and width to 0 once i resize it

8723200
children	parent
when adding a child object i can use that strategy to reset a property on the parent object to get the parent s view to refresh - which i want to as it shows an aggregate count of its children

8723202
inherited	properties
the arrayadapter simply calls super to avail the inherited properties and both methods getitem and getcount

8723203
portrait	landscape
basically when you load the site in either portrait or landscape it auto scales to fit in the view

8723203
min	max
this is using default behavior as i don t currently have a max min scale size set in viewport meta

8723211
int	chars
i believe the reason you see false is because the toast errors out when you supply an int instead of a chars sequence

8723216
onkeyup	onkeydown	division	multiplication
if we pressed the division symbol and multiplication symbol in android soft keyboard then the onkeyup and onkeydown in android is not working

8723248
portrait	landscape
problem here i facing is if i first change the orientation to landscape and click on textfield its working fine but if i first click on textfield in portrait mode and then changed to landscape left right its not working

8723249
hide	show
instead add both of your views as subviews of the controller s root view and hide or show then as needed

8723252
switching	screens
i assume you re saying that if you scroll down switching cell gets scrolled off screens and then you scroll back up switching cell gets scrolled back on screens then the state of the switching isn t preserved

8723253
jobs	cron
emails are sent as cron jobs in moodle

8723266
portrait	landscape
when rotated from portrait to landscape it layouts the view in a very different manner from the portrait layout with a fancy animation

8723293
jobs	cron
for setting up cron jobs have a look at this link

8723305
pthreads	fork
update i recently had reason to do this in a pthreads way with minimal fork which lead to this script the last printf there outputs the command line used to invoke the script which you should be able to copy-paste in order to invoke it with equivalent arguments

8723308
width	height
if this is indeed the case i was planning on using a byte width height explicitly supported and then just perform necessary logic on the user end

8723350
width	height
i ve tried setpreferredsize and setsize but for some reason the joptionpane is sticking with the same width and height

8723423
portrait	landscape
so if you first click on textfield in portrait mode and then changed to landscape this method is invoked first

8723474
post	get
into the state_n.phtml pages use the following code to get your get or post variables

8723476
nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue
use synchronous nsurlconnection api with nsoperationqueue

8723476
hide	show
the idea is to show the network activity indicator start a network request let the main thread s run loop spin and hide the indicator when the request is complete

8723477
subclass	abstract-class
i disagree with your stipulation that it s not a good idea to create a concrete child class just to test an abstract parent. i do this quite often when testing abstract-class and usually name the concrete subclass after the test to make it clear

8723511
iboutlet	ibaction
in a non navigationcontroller based application i have take a uibutton and the ibaction and iboutlet are properly defined and connected

8723519
google-chrome	firefox
if you try that you get identical behavior in google-chrome and firefox and it matches the firefox behavior for after

8723595
uitableview	uipageviewcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uipageviewcontroller
it looks like an uipageviewcontroller with 2 uiviewcontroller each with his own uitableview but i would have to download and install to be sure of what i am saying

8723631
ant	maven
build your war you can use maven ant build it from eclipse - whatever you chose

8723639
metaclass	subclassing
non-strict subclassing of the metaclass of all its bases

8723715
width	height
csvwindow window.open com csv +csvfilename datacsv toolbar yes location no directories yes status no menubar yes scrollbars yes resizable yes width 790 height 450 screenx 50 screeny 25 left 50 top 25

8723744
int	double
basically if i was using an int or double i would have just use int.parse etc

8723748
portrait	landscape
the application actually starts up in landscape mode but when i log the size of the screen in the viewdidload method of the rootviewcontroller it gives me the sizes for portrait mode

8723753
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
you should use uinavigationcontroller s for the tabs of your uitabbarcontroller

8723753
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
then to present a new uiviewcontroller you want to push new it onto the stack of your uinavigationcontroller

8723755
superclass	subclassing
you might be able to subclassing uigesturerecognizer override the target-action methods to save the registered pairs in a collection you can then expose to users of the class and then call the superclass implementations of those methods

8723760
xslt	xquery
i think you would find the xml easier to process not just with xsd but also with xslt and xquery if you changed the design to

8723788
int	boolean
now in the onprogresschanged seekbar bar int progress boolean fromuser method do the following

8723807
client-side	server-side
i am now working on mouse implementation for the both client-side phone and server-side smartbox

8723812
jruby	mri	jruby	rubinius	mri	rubinius	ironruby	rubinius
there is a need for such a specification because there a several different ruby interpreters matz s ruby interpreter called mri is the de facto standard but there are also rubinius jruby ironruby macruby hotruby .

8723841
for-loop	arrays
i m trying to create a for-loop that does the exact same thing as this code quests is an arrays

8723850
arp	tcp
the important parts are mibopen which opens dev arp and pushes the tcp streams module onto it and mibget which actually requests the connection information

8723892
moq	typemock	moq	moles	typemock	moles
maybe try a mock object framework like rhinomocks moq or typemock isolator for example or an isolation framework like microsoft moles

8723903
google-chrome	firefox
it works in google-chrome and ie but not working in firefox

8723938
installation	upgrade
most setup authoring tools include a mechanism which retrieves the original installation path and uses it during an upgrade

8723963
interpolation	splines
i used a cubic splines interpolation as curve fittting i ported this one

8723985
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
this should be used for real application versioning upgrade thinking about existing users and their application installation

8723990
versioning	upgrade
the implementation should use this method to drop tables add tables or do anything else it needs to upgrade to the new schema versioning

8723997
oncreate	setcontentview
call this asynctask from oncreate of channelvideolistactivity after setcontentview method call as new taskclass .execute

8724073
put	get
if you put the names and values in a dictionary you can easily get the values by name

8724086

google-chrome	safari
here is a screenshot from google-chrome 14 it also happens on google-chrome 16 and safari 5

8724133
width	height
i tried to set a fixed width and height instead of a flex number but then the charts completely disappeared

8724141
width	height
also checkout the scope of variable width height you are using it inside the resize function but it isn t readable there...change your code to something like this

8724220
csv	tsv
i have used linq to csv library in several projects to load and manipulate csv tsv etc files

so if you are simply swapping views you can do it right in one of your viewcontrollers but swpaping a controller with another uiviewcontroller with uitabbarcontroller should be handled in a higher level app delegate

8728962
pull	push
it s okay for gitolite-admin repo i can pull and push

8728972
maven	pom.xml
i am getting a missing artifact org.springframework.security spring-security-parent jar 3.0.7.release compile error in the pom.xml when i add the maven dependency for spring security but when i remove that dependency the error disappears

spaces	delimiter
i did find one more bug your code never reads the last character if there is no spaces or a delimiter

8729129
instances	transient
hibernate throws an transientobjectexception with the message object references an unsaved transient instances - save the instances before flushing tag

8729130
client-side	server-side
if both url s return the same content then you will have duplicate information in your caches whether server-side intermediary or client-side and these can get out of sync between the two resources especially if they are cached at different lifetimes

8729133
equals	gethashcode
when you have a single primary key property in your domain nhibernate will use the value returned by the property as the key value calling gethashcode and equals on the value using the primary key much like you would use it in a instance

8729133
equals	gethashcode
if you haven t overridden equals and gethashcode on your type to use your composite key values it does not reflect the equality used by the data-model two rows being equals if they have the same primary key and nhibernate cannot be certain it is tracking the correct entities

8729208
min	max
however if you are trying to find the min max of a single array and break up the work amongst multiple threads then you probably wouldn t want to instead have the main process the results from each thread for the overall answer

8729214
free	malloc
to allocate arrays dynamically you can use malloc and to free them use free as follows

8729218
width	height
where the image width and height are stored

8729235
onmousedown	onmousemove
i created a teventobject to provide onmousedown and onmousemove events for twebbrowser

8729320
getter	setter
create a custom setter getter

8729337
coalesce	nullif
coalesce will leave the result of nullif unchanged if it is not null otherwise 1 will be returned

8729339
width	height
the reported textview width and height are a lot bigger than the actual text

8729339
width	height
one would expect the textview width and height to be tightly wrapped around the text

8729344
box-sizing	border-box	children	parent	width	border-box
as i need the children to have an exact width 50 from the available space taking regard for the padding of the parent div i use box-sizing border-box

8729344
box-sizing	border-box	opera	google-chrome
this works fine in opera but in google-chrome the box-sizing border-box or even -webkit-box-sizing border-box is silently ignored

8729344
width	height
the two red boxes should be square and the blue box should be 200px in width and height

int	chars
int scanf const chars format ...

8729412
super	implements
if the class has many initializer one of them is chosen as designated and all the other should be implements by calling it not the super

8729469
getter	setter
also make sure you have either synthesize d the ivar in the implementation or have provided both a getter and a setter for the ivar

8729488

paul you just need to put the properly sized image in your ldpi mdpi hdpi and xdpi folders

8729508
mouse	keyboard
i m injecting keyboard and mouse events which are comming over the network into my qt application and use qcoreapplication postevent for this

8729564
int	double
dividing an int by an int and storing in a double always stores the rounded int first

8729578
width	height
it does however also prove that you can t determine the width and height for m based on m only the aspect ratio which in the long run for this application is fine as it s mapping from an arbitrary resolution to another arbitrary resolution and the absolute size is not important

8729601
post	get
your controller could determine if it was accessed via get post and handle it accordingly but that doesn t feel right

8729611
int	double
double can represent every possible int value without a rounding error

8729631
folder	dir
but in that install dir there is no whoosh folder

8729665
post	get
pressing on next previous buttons user gets another 5-10 controls which is dynamically built and added to the survey page - trivial asp.net get post and data entered selected on previous bunch of controls page is saved to database

button	checkbox
the number of asp.net controls inside user control number of radio button inside radiobutton list which in its turn sits in user control number of checkbox inside user control etc

8729675
put	get
i would like to put a breakpoint in the file without having to break the code with a deliberate error and i thought it was possible to get up a list of currently loaded dynamic files and put a breakpoint in one of them but if i search on such things as dynamic and cshtml i get nowhere

8729679
int	double
the type of the expression is determined by the arguments before it is stored so as other answers state an int divided by an int yields an int which will only then be stored as a double

8729691
barrier	scheduling
this will prevent reordering of instructions after the memory barrier call to before it but that will not prevent thread scheduling from deciding that the loop should have another go round before the writer thread actually performs the write it s not a locking or synchronization mechanism

8729747
primefaces	richfaces
i recently had a similar issue and handle primefaces richfaces events with a similar listener style

8729791
boxlayout	grouplayout
one thing that i m having an issue with in all the layouts i ve tried boxlayout flowlayout borderlayout grouplayout is that i want to hide one of my elements but i want to leave a blank space of the exact size in it s place

8729794

if this doesn t work try giving the container fixed dimensions height width

8729877
tiff	png
you can export your spritesheet in png tiff format and also it supports cocos2d spritesheet .plist format

8729958
int	double
temp v are long int so cannot represent floating point numbers like 0.65 simply change their type to double which can

8729972
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
since you ve indicated mvvm tag solution would be pretty straightforward - just bind control to a data by exposing data items whatever by viewmodel so any data updates would be automatically dispatched to view via bndings if you would provide inotifypropertychanged inotifycollectionchanged by a viewmodel

8730001
pop-up	dialog
if you click on a group to edit a jquery ui dialog pop-up with the attributes and permissions of that group

whereas can be a simple character vector containing one string for each folder needs to be a list so that some of its elements can themselves contain several elements the files in a directory

8730231
accelerometer	gyroscope
using accelerometer and gyroscope basically and maybe other sensors you can do the trick

8730259
rmdir	chown
i ve tried rmdir and chown but i keep getting permission denied

8730259
rmdir	chown
i ve been simply trying to chown it to my user name so that i can delete it from the command line instead of trying to write some recursive rmdir function

8730289
equals	gethashcode
i would actually say that for any struct one should always manually code an override of equals and gethashcode along with implementing if it s at all likely that it could be used by someone as a key so i certainly wouldn t use it just to avoid doing so

8730289
equals	gethashcode
tuple.create makes it easy to compose them and the overrides for equals and gethashcode are pretty reasonable

8730289
equals	gethashcode
in some cases it can also be suitable to use anonymous classes as keys only within the context of a given method of course and here the overrides for equals and gethashcode are pretty reasonable too

8730293
coalesce	isnull
you should fix this using coalesce or isnull

8730310
octal	decimal
then use parseinteger x 10 to make numbers out of them the 10 is needed so that a month 09 is treated as decimal 9 not invalid octal 9

8730320
jquery	anythingslider
i have jquery tools tabs and in each of the panes of this tab bar i have placed an anythingslider

8730374
versioning	upgrade
it s not backwards compatible with x but that s why knockout changed to a major versioning upgrade 1.2 to 2.0 -- there are breaking changes

8730399
put	get
on each iteration you put an advance in and stop when you get it out again

8730418
width	height
so given a width x and a height y my array has x y elements

8730418
width	height
if width is 4 and height is 3 and i have

8730426
uibezierpath	nsbezierpath
both uibezierpath ios and nsbezierpath mac support the nscoding protocol

8730428
ssl	https
if you want to use x509 certificates on that level you need to dig into java https client certificate authentication java client for the x.509 secured web-service and on the server side securing weblogic server configuring ssl

8730485
pop-up	dialog
i was wondering wether it is possible to redirect someone to a different tab url after using a publish to wall pop-up dialog

8730485
post	get
the redirect must be taken place inside the iframe..so after someone had publish the post to his her wall people get redicted to a thankyou page

8730486
for-loop	loops
i would do this in a for-loop since a while loops guarantees you ll have at least one result and will always run but a for-loop will not run if there are no results

8730506
filtering	grouping
what i mean by a single complete control is a control that displays everything inside displays dimensions kpis fact data allows filtering ordering grouping everything that you want from an olap display page

8730619
int	chars
a more efficient method would involve using the ascii table to convert an int to the desired alphanumeric chars

8730625
folder	directory
if you for some reason can t change your current directory structure then you would have to configure exclusions for the default resource folder to not copy the nested profile-dependant folder

8730630
min	max
that s probably what you are looking for you could set the width to 100 first then add the min max width to control it

8730657
inherited	properties
all the above properties + properties from widget.progressbar since its parent is this will get inherited to your progressbar

8730700
int	chars
this means that the data can contain the string-terminating 0 chars the int 0

8730764
serializable	deserialization
i also don t want to use different classes for serializable and deserialization

8730764
serializable	deserialization
the content is just strings from it s point of view but of course not the same for serializable deserialization

8730795
hide	show
the one loop is a showhide loop to obviously show and hide the div s when clicked on or rolled over and the other is a little loop to keep the active state of the links after clicked on the active div link will have a background color

8730816
getter	setter
i want to override the getter and setter in my objc class using arc

8730852
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
i have developed a winforms application in c# that can make any window top most by selecting it from dropdownlistfor and toggle a checkbox

8730857
width	height
it is easier and more stable by using float there if width and height is known and you want square cells

8730857
width	height
since table layout have the ability to break the assigned css width height it is better not using it unless it is table-like structure or you want to contents expand the container - so your

8730857
width	height
important in width height is not working

8730868
getter	setter
if you are going to implement your own getter and setter you ll need to maintain an internal variable

8730875
subtraction	addition
addition and subtraction for pointers works in accordance to the pointer type

8730889
aggregate-functions	sum
if you want to use an aggregate-functions as sum to group the result-set you have to use a

8730903
post	get
in this case you need to pass signed request from list.aspx to view.aspx page either via post or get method by attaching whole signed request as querystring to url

8730920
multiplying	add
then for each digit of the number to be converted starting with the most significant and going to the least significant 1 multiplying the running total by the base of the source number and 2 add the digit to the running total

8730920
addition	multiplication
now all you need is algorithms to do the multiplication and addition and you can actually do both at once

8730924
getter	setter
as jeremy suggests you need to implement them such that the setter actually assigns the value itâ s called with to an instance variable on your class and the getter returns the value of that instance variable

8730966
width	height
likely what you are trying to do is set minimum width for dock windows when they are docked to left or right or minimum height if they are docked to top or bottom

8730993
add-on	jsctypes
the best way to avoid compatibility issues with firefox add-on when using binary code c c++ is to use jsctypes

8730993
xpcom	jsctypes
to avoid this long-term problem with compatibility i would make a port of your c++ code to jsctypes from xpcom a hard requirement for the contractors you are working with

8731024
vsto	add-in
create a simple vsto powerpoint 2010 add-in with 1 toggle button inside the ribbon

you don t have to worry about marshalling basic types like int or boolean though you can just return them directly from your c++ cli layer to the c#

8731039
mp3	wav
i m using shinemp3encoder to encode a wav to a mp3 from

8731039
mp3	wav
basically it converts a bytearray wav to a bytearray mp3 or mp3encoder.mp3data in the code

8731039

when i run the code it goes through all the steps converts the wav to mp3 and then says that it saves but doesn t with no errors

8731049
dictionary	map
table an implementation of a map dictionary collection stack

ssl	https
if you don t want to edit the default cacerts you could define an alternative truststore by setting system properties like explained in java client certificates over https ssl

8731072
post	put	post	get	put	get
the link_to method will fallback any method post put and delete to get corresponding to the show action when

8731072
post	put
instead of link_to you could try to use button_to which creates a form allowing put post and delete methods without javascript enabled

8731140
post	get
you can also parse signed request by using json see my answer in this post you will get more idea about it

8731173
tapestry	wicket	jsf	wicket	jsf	tapestry
go full-on with a component-oriented framework like jsf 2 tapestry or wicket

i am able to get all twitter post of a specific hashtag in php

8731313
namedtuple	dictionary
instead of moving to full dictionary you can try using a namedtuple instead

8731313
namedtuple	dictionary
namedtuple instances do not have per-instance dictionary so they

8731315
int	double
12 is resolved to an int not an int - and there s no implicit conversion from int to double

8731315
int	double
just because there s an implicit conversion from int to double and another from double to double doesn t mean there s one straight there

8731316
int	double
int isn t automatically wrapped in a double

8731323
google-chrome	safari
this is true in ie8 google-chrome safari

8731367
getter	setter
one possibility is that if you do have an interface that defines getter setter you could add

8731458
portrait	landscape
you might have one for the portrait and so your program runs fine but when you rotate your device the os probably looks for the view in the landscape folder and doesnt find the view so declares it as missing

8731460
folder	directory
solution could be to make symbolic link in current folder that points to your images directory and then point your .htaccess rule to this file

filtering	grouping
so if you consider each section as a filtering grouping the number of grouping could be dynamic but the number of filtering per grouping would definitely be dynamic

8731485
filtering	grouping
i ve figured out getting the data for these filtering grouping and am not too concerned with gettting them displayed in the view

google-chrome firefox seems to handle these and fixes them but ie isnt so it hiding the content as it hasnt seen the first comment closed

8731514
interpolation	splines
for arbitrary values i d propose some sort of splines interpolation

8731514
interpolation	splines
now just use splines interpolation of your choice to create a smooth curve and once you have the curve you can get values on your 100-1000 scale

8731514
interpolation	splines
if you don t want to implement any complicated splines interpolation you could just take a linear one meaning that for any point of your slider between 0.0 and 0.25 you linearly interpolation between 100 and 200 between 0.25 and 0.5 interpolation between 200 and 300 and so on

everything works fine in firefox and even in ie7 but google-chrome has some weird problems

8731828
put	get
if you forget to put a frob back in the pool the gc will get to it eventually. by pursuing a pooling strategy you cause the gc to eventually move all the frobs to the generation 2 heap instead of creating lots of collection pressure in the generation 0 heap

8731902

i have just spent a lot of time working with tlistview in view style mode vsreport and i find it is even more limited than tstringgrid for example it provides no in-place edit support

8731984
hash	salt
btw i know i should add a salt 256 bytes in this case to the hash text before hashing it

8731989
client-side	server-side
it internally handles things like paging and sorting so you wouldn t have to worry about reconciling your client-side and server-side code manually between otherwise mutually exclusive plugins controls frameworks

8731989
client-side	server-side
the main thing to keep in mind is to have a clear line of separation between the server-side code and the client-side code

8731989
client-side	server-side
have a separate server-side handler for responding to ajax requests and treat it like a web service used by the client-side javascript

8732016
children	parent
if the child forms display the purchased_date and purchased inputs - and you want to set the values of those inputs based on the input values in the parent form - you re going to have to script that on the client side javascript jquery so the children s values get set in response to the parent input s change event or similar

8732016
children	parent
if the child forms do not show these inputs you will have to set the children s attributes on the server side model or controller based on the parent s attributes if you choose to add them to the parent or by using the params sent on the request

i also prefer glfw before glut mainly because glut isn t maintained actively

8734225

libraries like glut glfw etc are libraries that abstract all of these differences

8734240

the problem here is you also have to create a parent that doesn t clip it s children so the view can draw outside its own bounds

8734259

you re reducing the number of multiplication by a factor of 5 since you won t keep multiplying 5 numbers but 2

not long ago if at all it would have been decimal and octal instead of decimal and hex or maybe octal only no decimal

by using the search method on the koala api object i get a lot of results that i put in a results variable

8734586
rss	feed
an easy way to understand this is to think about an rss feed - each entry on the feed is like a section

8734586
rss	feed
if you would add it to an rss feed or it would make sense in that context then it s probably a section

8734586
rss	feed
if it s just a column on a footer then you wouldn t put it on an rss feed so it s probably not a section

i made a separate stylesheet for less than ie9 and in it i have declared width height zoom positioning used all the filters that work in ie..

8734620

8734857
int	chars
if you are only handling ascii chars in the range 0-255 it would be a simpler to just have an int or maybe a long array 256 then read the file in effect a chars at a time of course you d use buffering or nio for speed and increment the appropriate bin

versioning	upgrade
the upgrade software platform can be installed in parallel to existing versioning on the same server

check out the variant that supports failure here and build your lens by passing a setter and getter that do some validation on the datatype to the lens function

8734876
rss	feed

my previous example used settimeout even after you mentioned setinterval

client-side	server-side
configure the client to use that client-side certificate to identify itself and only accept the one server-side certificate you installed on your server for that part of it

8734985
min	max
the nice thing about this way is min and max x and y give you the bounding rectangle so initialiiy you just draw that and get your scaling resizing sorted then draw the points and decorate based on the scaled coordinates

8734985
min	max
just loop through the points for min and max y you already have x as they are order so it s just first and last

8734990
qobject	qwidget
edit note that qwidget inherits qobject

8735017

8735074
viewdidload	viewwillappear	didselectrowatindexpath	viewwillappear
this can be what you call in your didselectrowatindexpath but by moving the actual logic outside of that method you will be able to call in other places such as viewdidload or viewwillappear

8735153
int	double
int is implicitly convertible to both float and double so both candidate methods are applicable

8735153
int	double
however the conversion from int to float is better than the conversion from int to double according to section 7.5.3.2-7.5.3.5

8735159
setinterval	settimeout
one thing to consider is that if you are making asynchronous ajax calls then the setinterval settimeout will continue to run regardless if the previous ajax responses have been called unless if you call settimeout in the response function then the ajax request and response calls will run synchronously

8735478
int	chars
the id variable is a chars and casting that to int gives you the chars code not the numeric value

background-repeat	background-position
normally when sites use gradients as background images they make it so the top of the gradient is flush with the top of the screen by setting background-position 0 0 the gradient repeats itself horizontally by setting background-repeat no-repeat and then they set the background-color of the site to be the same color as the bottom of the gradient

8735546
ant	maven
3 the language s unit tests must be run natively as normal junit tests by the ant and maven junit tasks goals

8735561
sorting	filtering

8735573

8735650
outputstream	inputstream
there is no standard way to create an inputstream which reads from or an outputstream which writes to one but such things would be very easy to write

8735677
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
typically this is caused by projects that require case-sensitive fs and use file names like string.h which clashes with the system on case-insensitive fses which is the default on os x

8735684
rss	feed
one option i m considering is aggregating news from a variety of rss feed and showing the top headlines on the home page as well as specific headlines on more focused content pages

what i would like to do is create a virtual directory called offsitestuff and point it to some location on my c drive like c offsitestuff and then browse to items in that folder like this

8735713
cassini	iis
i know i could do this with a folder within my site and still use iis express or for that matter plain old cassini but this folder will store images uploaded by users and i really don t want to have these images mixed up with application files

8735726
spock	grails	spock	unitils
integration testing spock grails spring and unitils plugin

width	height
the width and height of the mesh are known so it s easy to calculate the vertex indices for a given xy or vice-versa

8735761
put	get
that said -- a real device will probably not get bricked but you will need to use the recovery image to put a working rom back on to use the device again

postgresql	mysql
for example comparing sqlite postgresql and mysql all of them support much of the same syntax but there are also various differences between the bunch

8735827

a wrapper called angle which safari google-chrome and firefox use can translate webgl calls and glsl to either opengl glsl or direct3d hlsl

if there is lot of data exchange then a binary format like protobuf or thrift or avro is better

8735882
post	get
i got the value in the textbox to be included but i can t seem to get the id of that text box into the post

8735889
google-chrome	firefox

8736037
google-chrome	firefox
testing with segoe ui which often exists in different font weight versions on windows systems i was able to make internet explorer 9 select the proper version when using the logical approach of using the font family name segoe ui and different font-weight values but it failed on firefox 9 and google-chrome 16 only normal and bold work

8736041
postgresql	mysql
it looks like heroku doesn t really support mysql and so we are considering using postgresql which they do support

8736062
postgresql	mysql
it should be simplicity itself port the ddl from mysql to postgresql

8736062
postgresql	mysql

8736133
uiview	subviews
i have a uiview which has several subviews that respond to touch

8736163
rvm	bundler
apache passenger is probably set up to use your system ruby 1.8.7-p249 and not the ruby version you are obviously using with rvm and i guess the reason you get the message that passenger cannot find bundler is because you haven t installed bundler using your system ruby

8736163
rvm	bundler
you can fix this either by installing bundler in the system ruby version or by telling passenger to use whatever ruby version you have installed via rvm

8736174
hide	show
i think what you need to do is loop through each element testing if it has any matches to the input word list and then hide or show that element as appropriate

8736220
int	double
there won t be a loss of precision error at all because they re all int in this example - you re not actually adding any double

8736220
int	double
however even if you were adding double to an int then there still wouldn t be because the jls defines an implicit cast for these types of operators

8736235
width	height
the user would be required to select a width then height from separate drop down menus

8736274
int	double
as math.random returns an double which is between 0.0 inclusive and 1.0 exclusive the variable converted will only ever contain 0 as it s converted to an int

8736274
int	double
for more on the casting from a double int see here different answer when converting a double to an int - java vs .net

it works great on firefox chromium google-chrome and safari windows android browser 2.3.7 and firefox mobile for android a.k.a

8740351
firefox	safari
it is really frustrating because something weird is happening where just accessing the variable - ie passing the variable in a function as a parameter or alerting it - causes firefox to have a catastrophic crash safari just has no failure output i m sure the error occurs but it recovers gracefully

you might want to look into either a creating a wrapper type around the static property that can be mocked or b using a framework which can mock static properties - moles or typemock isolator

8740653
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
this works fine - it creates a transparent view on top of the current view and uses uibezierpath touchesbegan touchesmoved etc so you can draw all over the view by dragging your finger around

8740653
uiview	subviews
i tried creating a uiview and adding it as a subviews of the drawing view

8740723
int	double
but that also will not do since you have to limit to only int double while you can only do where t struct which is not the same thing

8740744
for-loop	loops
so you see even in the worst case where you have the while loops run n-1 times in the first iteration of the for-loop you still only get n-1 iterations of the while loops for the entire process

8740798
entities	entitymanager
if you need to restart tomcat to see changes it means that the entitymanager is never closed and reopened and its cache of entities does still contain entities that have been loaded in a previous transaction

8740968
oncreate	onstart
i tried using the oncreate onstart onresume methods but the matrix i get is the default

since i work across two svn repositories and the other one works fine with both versioning of the client i didn t notice the problem until a few days after i upgrade so i didn t immediately figure out the cause

8741669
firefox	safari
i have created an asp.net site which works fine in internet explorer but for some reason some strange things are happening in firefox and safari

8741709
int	chars
testing whether two int are equivalent is usually faster than testing lexicographical equivalence of two strings where your program will have to compare each string chars by chars

8741709
memset	calloc
if you need a dynamically-sized array use a pointer with calloc and reset it with memset as previously described

8741747
hide	show
if you want the behaviour of hide show you should not call window.close on the window at all but hide it by calling window.hide

8741747
hide	show
if you hide show as above then you ll get the window back in exactly the same state before it was hidden

8741754
int	double
the one of the problems of the surf in opencv is very big amount of the type conversions double - float float- int and it takes a time because of frequently calling of these basic functions

8741774
packets	multicast
have the receivers join a multicast group and wait for packets

in python int can be used as boolean values whereas anything non-zero is resolved to true and 0 to false

8741941
hash	salt
for example second hidden field with either signature computed on server or hash of salt value computed on server

8741941
hash	salt
when the data return in the next request to the server it must recompute and compare signature hash with same salt and validate that the passed value and computed value are same

8741941
hash	salt
sure the client mustn t know the secret you are using to compute signature or salt used in hash

8741951
filtering	grouping
the plugin can now cycle its functionality grouping which grouping there are depends on your app - if it is an image manipulation app there might be functionality grouping such as filtering filetypeimport filetypeexport brush .

min	max
it makes last first max min greatest-n-per group easy as pie

8742257
ant	maven
maven definitely has better integration with flex than ant

8742257
ant	maven
even though there are popular and supported bundle of readily available ant tasks called flex ant tasks available both with the open source flex sdk and with flash builder also i should point out that ant might more also good choice if you re perplexed by maven complexity or you need build automation for simple small-to-midsize project maven turns out to be more mature and more appropriate choice

8742274
portrait	landscape
i am trying to play a video in landscape view while rest app remains in portrait orientation

8742757
opera	firefox
jsfiddle tested in opera ie9 ie8 and firefox without any problem

8742810
serializable	deserialization
i personally don t like it too much as in case of changes applied to the object serializable before like add remove properties change types function parameters or its sequence will lead to deserialization failure

8742835
wav	flac	wav	ogg	wav	aiff	aiff	ogg	flac	ogg	flac	aiff	mp3	flac	mp3	ogg	mp3	wav	mp3	aiff

8742866
serializable	deserialization
on startup after deserialization old state check for change- files if they exist this was a crash and we have to work them up then do a new serializable and delete changefiles

8742900
getter	setter
i m trying to implement some automated getter and setter for php objects

8742905
profiling	benchmarking
and then i d do some benchmarking profiling to check if the only changed values versionn really is faster better than the update all values version

8742909
width	height
width 1000px height 70px

8742909
width	height
it gets better when i either display less controls at a time higher height or only a part of them decreasing the listview or boxview width

8742917
nsstring	nsdata
to be exact i used the - nsstring base64encoding from to jimmy rig it for now but i will most likely implement raw writing of nsdata bytes into bson format and see if that will cut it

8742922
post	get
edit offtopic of the question this answer is incorrect but this question has already been answered in other post so to avoid delete this one i will use this same regex other way for example in perl could be used like this to get same result as in c# increment last digit

8742956
getter	setter
i have read something about the layout of the combo box property and tried changing that also stepped through the getter and setter of the property to ensure it is not clearing down which is not as it will bind to the text box

8742967
pull	push
you push your master aka stable and typically on pull request if it looks ok you would pull into your master

8742972
cobertura	jenkins
now when i run cobertura cobertura on the parent project the classes that are already gone are still listed in the coverage report on our jenkins ci

8742976
ubuntu	linux
i have a question regarding shell scripts the environment is linux preferably ubuntu

8743032
apache	nginx
even better would be a frontserver apache lighthttp nginx redirecting traffic to the right server behind based upon domain names

8743056
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this approach works with the latest firefox google-chrome safari -

8743064
getter	setter
otherwise eschewing getter and setter alltogether might be advisable

8743094
sum	coalesce
to deal with the null problem you need to wrap the sum in a coalesce

8743129
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the issue here is the menu works fine in firefox but in other browsers like google-chrome ie safari etc the text box comes below the menu

8743146
int	double
if you use int instead of double the normalization and centering of coordinates by some fixed constant could be useful for some distances and bad for others

8743150
gridview	objectdatasource
i was wondering if the onrowupdated event only fires if you use a objectdatasource because im using my own class as a datasource and when i update a row in the gridview it fires the onrowupdating event but not the onrowupdated event so i can t test the affectedrows or exceptions can someone explain this mystery to me

8743167
httpconnection	downloading
i think you can use httpconnection to downloading and process to run it

8743173
prop	each
needless to say each product has more than one prop which is kept in the producthas table

8743190
post	get
if you post another question explaining the problem you re try to solve you ll get a more pythonic way of doing it

8743199
vsto	add-in
i want to open an excel or powerpoint document with office 2010 or 2007 with a vsto add-in

8743201
post	get
i ve been knocking my head against a wall for two weeks now poring over the net poring over stackoverflow and repeatedly testing and failing to get a script together to post an event to a fan page

8743227
post	get
i think you should get rid of the post rendering in the update.php

8743268
octal	decimal
it s probably octal notation which needs three digits to properly express the decimal values 0 to 255

8743282
put	get
what i would suggest though is that you consider rearchitecting this to use aspectj and put a cut point in your parent call to collect the information you really want before you get too low in the stack

8743304
qtip	tipsy
don t reinvent the wheel use a jquery plugin such as qtip or tipsy

8743327
hide	fadeout
also note that fadeout simply hide the element it sets display none and doesn t remove it from the dom

8743334
hide	show
or you could maybe hide the recent files then show them

8743335
children	parent
by default in resque the parent process forks and the children processes create a new connection to the database

8743373
width	height
as long as i could see the design got the required images and the with and width and height of everything was written down somewhere

8743389
subtract	add
at this point all you need is to parse all durations and add or subtract them to calculate the total duration and then format it the way you want

8743401
udp	tcp
so just produce any packet tcp http or udp which will contain it

8743413
width	height
i have scrollview with width and height fill_parent and i implemented simpleongesturelistener like

8743422
std	ostream
std ostream does not have a default constructor this

8743459
int	chars
because chars and chars pointers are treated differently than int when it comes to printing

8743459
int	chars
to get the results you desire cast your chars pointer to a void pointer and cast your chars to an int

8743482
put	get
when we set opacity say p to layer 1 we can put 0.5 or 50 and get a whitish red color say color value x

8743565
queue	fifo
it would be possible to queue the requests up and processes them fifo but this would not scale well when you have hundreds of requests queue up and each request takes 100ms to process

8743580
submit	submission
and when i submit the form ajax submission it sends an http request to for example the path even if the current language is de note the part

8743624
google-chrome	firefox
this code works fine in firefox but in google-chrome it triggers the submit twice where the first time the request.isajaxrequest returns true and the second time it returns false

8743667
chown	chmod
also be sure to use chown and chmod recursively on the entire repository

8743689
button	checkbox
if this doesnt work try creating a hidden submit button and make the checkbox click it on change

8743705
width	height
your problem is that you re not calculating the width height to a correct aspect ratio

8743705
width	height
so to get a 1 1 proportions you would need a width of 134.735 pixels for a 173 pixel height

8743795
spaces	delimiter
spaces in particular make sense to forbid as spaces is used as the delimiter between the element name and each attribute

8743813
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
so i have styled my menus and they now work great with google-chrome safari and firefox but not ie i have a basic horizontal list loaded from a datasource with 1-13 items in the dynamic lists attached to them

8743813
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox now after the menu is styled the dynamic menu items are appearing properly below the static menu items

8743852
post	get
my domain object does not keep the values that are not explicitly referenced in the jsp file between a get and a post operation on the same controller

8743853
getter	setter
in your entity the column annotation should only be used on your getter not on your setter as well

8743906
serializable	deserialization
it seems that the serializable and deserialization required when transferring the entities back to the master instance hampers the performance

8743917
getter	setter
if i access the variable test only through synchronized getter setter it works as expected

8743939
move	drag
i need to exclude the thumbs from touch manipulation because currently when the user move the thumb with his finger all the shape is move instead of resizing it with drag delta at the thumb

8743972
put	get
the reason i thought it may be fixed is if from outside the testdata ptr x.getdataptr you try to put fixed you get you cannot take the address of an already fixed expression

8744044
width	height
you can transform an a-tag as block element and give them a height and width

8744048
udp	tcp
just in case you want to have 2 ports unless its not a tcp eg udp

8744064
chunked	transfer-encoding
mode block server gse transfer-encoding chunked error errors domain global reason parseerror message parse error code 400 message parse error

8744065
packets	pcap
there was a possible simpler scenario where all packets from pcap file are read into memory but this could lead to problems with large capture files

8744112
width	height
setbounds methods are called afterwards with a width or height less

8744166
folder	directory
if you don t see the app directory either you didn t install correctly or your in the wrong folder on your system

8744191
tiff	png
i am attempting to use ghostscript to convert psd tiff pcx...files to png file

8744219
client-side	server-side
you appear to be confusing server-side client-side scripts here

8744284
cgpoint	cgrect
i would suggest looping through the buttons and check if the cgpoint is within the cgrect of the button

8744285
mousemove	mousedown
i tested a few events and it isn t picking up mousedown events but it is picking up mousemove events

8744288
many-to-many	one-to-many
the relationship may be one-to-one one-to-many or many-to-many - one student is enrolled on many courses and similarly one course has many students

8744309
google-chrome	firefox
this code works fine on google-chrome but doesn t on firefox and ie

8744309
google-chrome	firefox
once again it fails only on firefox and ie google-chrome does submission plus redirection fine

8744338
min	max
what we re using here are called aggregate functions. in this case it s sum but it could be max or min or avg or whatever

8744348
public	protected
it works fine with public methods but not with private or protected methods in the same class protected because i have some standard pre built methods to add to the base class

8744369
free	malloc
i don t see why malloc free and or vector types wouldn t work either

8744376
gif	png
i tried to upload jpg png gif file types but codeigniter always shows that the type is application octet-stream

8744413
inherited	properties
the msdn says that the textbox dependency properties isreadonly is defined with the metadata flag inherited

8744419
folder	directory
i don t want end users to see the first 2 folder in my directory since they re not used often anyway

8744568
hash	salt
so i m talking about the passwords used to connect to the database not the passwords in the database which for clarification i have hash with salt and pepper

8744568
postgresql	mysql
if someone has a suggestion from the database perspective having the ability to restrict users to select insert delete update etc and not allowing drop and truncate as examples my primary concern is making sure i am sql neutral as i plan to eventually migrate from mysql to postgresql this may or may not be relevant though if it is better to mention it

8744602
hide	show
but it is better to hide the errors from being displayed as it show some vital information about your setup not just the home admin part

8744643
getter	setter
lastly .net accesses properties without gets and sets so object.property is both the getter and setter compared to java s object.getproperty and object.setproperty

8744745
folder	directory
it will require specifying all the folder which require full rebuild if directory content has been changed

8744766
jquery	anythingslider
i am using the anythingslider jquery plugin with the touch events

8744798
folder	directory
i do have directory in the root folder which i do not wish to remove the trailing url but i can add a ignore rule for those

8744803
implements	extends
if your xml file is in other formats you have to make your own resource loader by extends reloadableresourcebundlemessagesource and implements your logic to parse the xml file by overridding its loadproperties resource resource string filename

8744808
button	checkbox
both pages have some input fields like checkbox radio button dropdowns

8744860
public	protected
to support this answer i have written a test program that demonstrates the invocation of public protected and private class methods

8744860
public	protected
someclass.cs - contains three methods of each of the visibility modifiers public protected and private

8744865
notepad++	jedit
try opening it in a good editor like jedit or notepad++ and see what the editor tells you it is then specify that encoding instead of utf

8744883
put	get
might not be totally relevant but i put it here so you can get an idea about what the data looks like

8744902
asterisk	pbx
it might also be that your pbx is based on asterisk - an opensource solution for pbx.

8744903
nunit	mstest
using nunit or the mstest framework you can use an attribute on your test method declaration to specify that you expect an exception

8744954
int	chars
not really chars and int are implicitly converted

8744954
int	chars
you can look at a chars in this case as a smaller int

8744954
int	chars
programatically there s no difference in this case unless the input string is very long in which case the chars will overflow before an int does

8744969
int	chars
in fact even a chars literal enclosed in single quotes for example n is of type int but is implicitly converted to a chars when assigned or compared to another chars

8744979
int	chars
the code treats c as an int variable in c chars is basically a very narrow int

8744993
int	chars

on the example you give you first try to retrieve a non-existing value on the list as you do python first retrieve the third index 2 element on the list then proceed to get the element named a on that object - therefore you have to implements your automatic extends behavior to the __getitem__ method as well like this

8749643
innodb	myisam
my database contains +200 gb in innodb tables which i don t want to be stored in the ram and 10 tables 100 mb which uses the myisam engine

8749679
textview	imageview
however ultimately i would suspect that you could be successful with just a relativelayout as the outermost then the imageview and four textview as direct children

8749713
contour	imshow
here are some examples on how to use pcolor imshow and contour in basemap

8749729
centos	linux
play 1.2.3 on windows 7 local and linux centos 5 prod

another solution add checkbox to each entry and use a single form with only one submit button

8749742
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in safari firefox google-chrome and ie9 compatibility mode

8749762
htmlcleaner	jsoup
you can also use jsoup instead of htmlcleaner

8749771
post	get
as a result i just need value fields of selected options without post get sendings to php script

8749908
hide	show
if i get it right you want div element to show if you are over it and hide when the mouse is not over

8749948
post	get
the name problem will exist for both post and get so make sure that all the items are named differently

8749982
maven	pom.xml
i looked at the maven pom.xml files and i ve been reading about deployment descriptors but i don t seem to be making in progress

8749994
post	get
when making a post to subscribe to facebook facebook issues a get with the callback url with the following query parameter

8750021
google-chrome	firefox
tested this works for me in ie9 google-chrome and firefox

8750030
min	max
the device-width and device-height media query features along with their min max prefixes essentially provide the screen resolution of a mobile device

8750030
width	height
the orientation media feature is portrait when the value of the height is greater than or equal to the value of the width mdash

8750030
portrait	landscape
so max-width in portrait mode becomes max-height in landscape mode

8750083
put	get
if you think by this a website can get slow could you please tell me where exactly should i put my css images and javascript files in

8750087
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox it works perfectly but not in ie surprise

8750099
width	height
it seems that if the linearlayout containing the seekbars uses weights but for the default width or height is not specified 0px or 0dips the seekbars in the emulator slows down

8750102
hide	show
i just want to hide the other divs when i make my one selection and just show that one div

8750142
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
or see case-insensitive file.equals on case-sensitive file system

8750188
inherited	properties
another possibility is to write a new qml component that inherited from text an sets some properties by default

8750240
getter	setter
so i would make the various view-model property setter getter simple adapters on the wrapped model objects

8750244
ilist	icollection
which i can be cast to return ilist or icollection but not as a collection

8750249
rss	feed
for handling rss feed

8750252
google-chrome	firefox
using your developer console in google-chrome or firefox should be really useful in figuring out how to overwrite or determine the cause

8750288
ilist	icollection
my reasoning is that ilist icollection and their concrete implementations permit modification of the list returned from grob which you probably don t want

8750301
cherrypy	cheetah
so im doing a bit of web development and due to some restriction set by my employer i need to use cheetah and cherrypy

8750309
width	height
before i call gvlayout to calculate node coordinates i have to set node width and height for each node in the graph

8750309
width	height
i just don t want to use string-based apis like agsafeset because i m processing bunch of nodes in a loop and prefer to set width and height values with nd_width pnode and nd_height pnode or directly as pnode- u.width and pnode- u.height

8750309
width	height
p.s. i use graphviz solely for layout i do custom rendering so all i need is calculation of nodes and edges coordinates in pixels given nodes width and height in pixels

8750402
min	max
one thought i ve had is to use the h-value in the appropriate dimension to buffer the min and max coordinates of each dimension and pre-derive the extent for the kde output

8750421
inherited	properties
you can see inherited properties events and methods at the bottom of a kind s description

8750426
keydown	keyup
but i believe you can only kill the form submission with keydown not keyup

8750433
tablet	mdpi
most of the other tablet 7 inch and 10.1 inch tablet are mdpi

8750467
disk	ram
step 02 create a ram disk

8750467
disk	ram
step 05 mount the ram disk onto var lib mysql memorydb

8750471
hide	show
then the easiest way is to just hide the text box and show the dropdownlist instead

8750506
hash	salt
to that end there is the rfc2898derivebytes class which is slow and can be made slower and may answer the second part of the original question in that it can take a password and salt and return a hash

8750581
versioning	upgrade
the problem was probably due to using an earlier build of xcode or inconsistencies in xcode from having upgrade from earlier versioning over the years

8750608
touchesbegan	touchesended
the key is to override touchesbegan as well not just touchesended which is what i m really interested in

8750609
carrierwave	fog
i would only use fog if another gem such as carrierwave dragged it in

8750692
hide	show
i m looking for a java script sample or jquery sample that show or hide a div based on weather the div has value

8750736
width	height
if the element s width and height are explicitly set to 0

8750748
folder	directory
if the folder containing the interesting files are subfolders of your dated directory you can use a nested loop

8750767
subtract	add
this will perform a set difference in effect subtract input from compare and returning what is left over which we can then add to the results dictionary

8750820
jax-ws	jax-rs
i ve tried injecting the webservicecontext as mentioned here but it does not seem to work probably because it is part of the jax-ws specification and we are using jax-rs

8750848
put	get
this does put it in an array but when trying to access the first data set i get data1 instead of data1 data2

8750856
backbone.js	javascriptmvc
to look at frameworks like extjs javascriptmvc or backbone.js

8750866
partition-problem	np-complete
seems like it is np-complete and reducible to subset sum problem or more precisely to partition-problem

8750895
versioning	upgrade
likewise you can change the versioning numbers if you ever need to re-run upgrade scripts but make sure you understand the consequences of running setup upgrade scripts a second time if you do

8750897
versioning	upgrade
i would like old clients to continue to work correctly against a upgrade versioning of the server

8750916
std	ostream
actually if you want to change color using ansi escape codes you can just create suitable color manipulators and use them with an std ostream

8750923
put	get
if this is not complete enough or you can t get this code to work drop me a comment and i ll help you out or put up a js fiddle

8751029
vim	emacs
i don t know if emacs or vim are worth it since i ll still mostly program in eclipse

8751036
folder	directory
since virtual device emulator settings and configurations are written in this folder the sdk tools avd manager in this case has to be able to write in this directory

8751067
http	spdy
spdy is basically a variation of http s that accelerates web page load time

8751103
nsurl	nsstring
- you would be safer doing the objective c calls which take nsurl s or nsstring objects

8751148
ienumerable	iqueryable
the example is meant to keep the question simple in reality i have a complicated projection that i want to keep as an iqueryable prematurely converting to an ienumerable won t work

8751190
folder	directory
it will create the directory and then it places the git repo that .git folder and then checkout the master branch files into it

8751209
icmp	tcp
i don t believe you need to worry about unclean disconnects -- when the client machines are abruptly removed from the network your server will eventually get either tcp fin packets or icmp destination unreachable messages which will trigger the close event in your server and allow you to clean up

8751219
width	height
the smaller width shows up as expected but not the height

8751238
liferay	web-inf
liferay has a file named portal-developer.properties as template in web-inf classes

8751253
post	get
make sure that your ajax calls are made using post and not get if you want to keep using

8751307
xslt	xquery
it lets you use techniques for text xml manipulation like xslt xquery and regular expressions you can also build your own plugins

8751323
ubuntu	centos
i work exclusively with centos so i am not sure what the name of ubuntu s package manager is but i m pretty sure tzdata is standard across distros

8751358

8751392
dozer	jackson
jackson library not enough mature for now.so rendering model object problematic.it provide a few annotation and filter to customize rendered json but not enough.so i suggest you create new java classes for just views and map domain objects to this view class using dozer framework end return this view classes in responsebody

8751544
readonly	temporary
since it would be annoying to forbid the use of any and all methods on structs in readonly context--even those which don t in fact modify this --compilers instead handle method calls on readonly structs by making temporary copies of the structs and running the methods on those copies

8751544
width	height
struct fancyrect public int left top width height

8751605
google-chrome	firefox
if you open it in firefox and then in internet explorer google-chrome you should see what i mean and this is in regards to the two areas below the content view our projects and news

8751626

the following creates an off-screen canvas that is the same width and height as your image and has the image drawn on it

8751667
width	height
height to width ratio

8751667
width	height
filtering images by a height to width ratio eliminates a large percentage of junk

8751667
width	height
min height and width

8751667
width	height
filtering images based on an absolute minimum height and width that both dimensions must pass as well as a slightly larger value that at least one dimension must pass helped filter some junk

8751671
profiling	instrumentation
you won t always attach it to a running process i find that s more common to start a process in the debugger although there do exist tools such as instrumentation that will profiling a running process

8751671
profiling	instrumentation
instrumentation - profiling your application look for memory leaks

8751706
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

8751719
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
edit after testing this on opera safari firefox and google-chrome it looks like setting the volume to 0 will still preload the resource

8751746
versioning	upgrade
run nodetool scrub upgrade to the latest cassandra versioning in your release series and check for bad memory

8751751
hide	show
it is possible to adjust the u v mapping algorithm to minimize the effects or hide the seams in outside of the primary line of sight but it the sphere is rotated they will show up somewhere

8751792
dns	spf
in practice you have to add something like the following txt and if possible the newer spf dns records

the problem i m getting is when there are two draggable elements on the droppable

8751866
draggable	droppable
how can i check if there is already another draggable element on the droppable so i can cancel the fade effect

8751866
draggable	droppable
i want the droppable element to fade only when the last draggable element is taken off

8751879
std	ostream
can t really say for sure without seeing the source code of that function but since it s a null pointer exception via std ostream i would bet that you re trying to send a null string to std cout or some such

8751900

note i ve seen this question but i hope to avoid using sbt even though it s the scala way to do things because we ve got a giant java codebase that s only barely converted over from ant to maven

8752026
setcontentview	findviewbyid
you need to uncomment this line without calling setcontentview layoutid using findviewbyid layoutid will return null which is why bback is null

draggable	droppable
in that case you could keep track of which or at least how many draggable went over your droppable but didn t went out

8752389
vim	emacs
if you wish to learn vim or emacs then print yourself the vim or emacs quick reference card

8752389
vim	emacs
in fact i d recommend learning vim or emacs even if you wind up mostly using a more modern editor simply because they exist when nothing else does

8752389
vim	emacs
there was an issue with bash s vi mode in which it ignored the arrow keys for ages which forced people into using vim for editing and emacs mode in bash but now set -o vi works correctly in bash

8752402
folder	directory
i have been trying to create my own plugins and so far nothing seems to work for me let s assume i am going to have my plugins directory under the application folder which i think is the default location

the code i have got allows me to do all this but with only one link that toggles the show and hide which isn t very useful as i need the hide link to be at the bottom of all my content now

8752806
width	height
make sure you always use fill_parent or wrap_content for your width and height attributes

8752806
width	height
in case of percentage based width s use linearlayout for your layouts and use layout_weight attribute for giving the width or height

8752806
width	height
remember to give width or height as 0dp if you are using layout weight attribute

8752837
subtract	add
it s a simple implementation of a queue with the member functions add subtract and print

the and send a get request not a post request

8752878
required	placeholder
this is clearer and simpler no need to know what std bind does or what the std placeholder are for more flexible it can support any expression not just parameter binding required no support headers and will probably compile a little faster too

8752881
ready	each
so the get_temporary_buffer could be intended to be a bigger-than-you-would-need chunk of memory that is allocated once perhaps there are many chunks ready for accepting multiple requests and each time you need memory you just get one of the chunks

8752891
children	parent
the trick is to then delete the parent nodes and all their children without throwing a fatal error

8752934
range	minimum
you can also specify minimum and maximum range m being the minimum and n the maximum

i believe the default for webkit browsers safari and google-chrome is subpixel-antialiased

8753235
post	get
get requests are simply requesting a readonly version of data a post request is implying that you are making a change to a certain url so it s possible that the api allows get requests without authentication but requires authentication on the post request

8753257
post	get
you need to read about post and get processing in php

8753257
post	get
for the html side you just submit a form and specify which of the two methods get or post you want to use

range	min
as we know 01 is nothing but the day min range in any month we can simply hard-code it

8754012

8756670
hash	salt

8756736
uiview	subviews
the problem i m having right now is when i click the savedismiss button it only removes the subviews that i called previously on addclientvc but it didn t remove the transparent background i have created as a uiview

thirdly use a better hash than md5 for passwords

8756994
portrait	landscape
you can use the same xib but have two different views one for portrait and one for landscape

8756999
portrait	landscape
if your uis for landscape and portrait are radically different then it would be a more acceptable approach

8756999
portrait	landscape
but you could easily just use a single nib with two views inside it one for landscape one for portrait instead

8756999
portrait	landscape
the accepted design pattern that apple put forward is your view controller manages both landscape and portrait orientations and either adjusts its view using autoresizing masks and also hooking into the various delegate methods triggered upon rotation to add remove animate views or replaces the view with something else

8756999
portrait	landscape
if your landscape portrait views are quite different i d recommend having a single nib with two views inside it one for landscape one for portrait and adding removing those two views inside your view controller when you detect rotation

8756999
portrait	landscape
standard practice is always quite difficult to define and perhaps some people will disagree with me but i certainly haven t seen any apps that use two nibs for their landscape portrait orientations and i haven t seen any apple sample code that does it either

8757302
int	boolean

8758814
getter	setter
so if you have a page that displays a form an image and a login box the backing beans will have getter setter pairs for the data that needs to be exposed or changed in the view

8758814
getter	setter
would one backing bean exposing methods and getter setter pairs for all components on this page be legal and correct meaning that i don t do any wrong in the same way as making 3 backing beans

8759201
.htaccess	httpd.conf
you can then diff the successful unsuccessful request to try to narrow down the issue if bad requests always fail and good requests always succeed when re-requested from fiddler regardless of which network computer they are issued then it is likely a server side issue .htaccess or httpd.conf setting sensitive to one of the request attributes

8759223
portrait	landscape
one in portrait and the second one is in landscape format

8759233
int	chars
i have a array of structs returned from pinvoke and it returns the array fine if the struct just contains int or float but when i try to return an array of chars it starts to get messy i have tried with returning an intptr but that has not been successfull

8759274
int	chars
so next up you have an int of 0 and then a string 14 chars in length

8759290
int	chars	unsigned	short
the chars array might also work because the chars in c# logically represents an actual single chars intended use something c doesn t really have short of unsigned int types

8759308

8759531
conio	ncurses
i wrote it using the windows conio library but i m fairly sure this should be applicable to ncurses

8759535
min	max
unfortunately linq does not have a min max operator for strings so although the sql might support this linq does not

8759542

8759617
int	double
so if you re creating a arraylist of int float double etc

8759650
equals	gethashcode
as a rule of thumb if you override equals you need to override gethashcode as well but this is not necessary in your case as the default is what you are looking for

8759679
equals	gethashcode
if you only want references to the exact same instance to be equivalent you are fine and need do nothing but if you are using your type as a key and you want equivalent instances to be considered equals your class must implement equals and gethashcode

8759679
equals	gethashcode
for example in this case mytype does not need to override equals or gethashcode because it is only used as a value and not as the storage key

8759679
equals	gethashcode
your custom type is the key and thus it would need to override equals and gethashcode

8759679
equals	gethashcode
the gethashcode is used to determine which location it hashes to and the equals is used to resolve collisions on the hash code among other things

8759739

i have written encoder decoder for tobjectlist you will have to do the same for your objects and embed the class name somewhere

8759961
hash	salt
i currently salt and hash the email and password into 1 40 char token

8760002
viewdidload	viewwillappear
your problem seems to be that your using the viewwillappear method instead of the viewdidload

8760051
spaces	delimiter

i m using jquery mobile to generate a select menu which hide show columns of an html table

8760105
getter	setter
on the other hand in my practice it s not a good thing to use built-in as getter and setter with a syntax of function set somevar value void

8760105
getter	setter
it hardens refactoring very much because when get in many time by just not knowing that some variable is a setter or getter

8760105
getter	setter
of course because it s not a common use in as community such ide s like flashdevelop doen t support such getter and setter generation

8760106
for-loop	loops
alternatively you could just iterate over the part you want with a for-loop instead of a foreach loops

8760109
udp	tcp
i have this tcp server running because udp server was able to accept large packets but isp blocks my udp packets even i have public ip and static services

8760109
udp	tcp
but now decided to change it to tcp but i have a large stack now to replace with udp to tcp

8760109
udp	tcp
none is allowing me to handle large so that i can switch from udp to tcp

8760118
keystore	jks
openssl is capable of producing a pkcs#12 file .p12 which the default java security providers should be able to use as a keystore directly although keytool in java 6 and above is capable of converting them to a jks store via -importkeystore

8760130
nsdateformatter	nscalendar
i found a way to adjust this to make sure we are using the gregorian calendar with nsdateformatter and specifying an nscalendar with the first date of the week to be monday like the following

8760130
nsdatecomponents	nsdateformatter
however to be honest i wouldn t like to use that along with nsdatecomponents i would rather use the nsdateformatter but overall it would be cool to fix the first example which gives me a false weekdayordinal value

8760165
for-loop	loops
to be much more specific i need a for-loop or an idex to loops first over all rows and per row over every collumn.

8760169
udp	tcp
tcp and udp are different

8760174
lgpl	maemo
they also say that usually the lgpl version is ok for symbian maemo or meego development

8760182
gridview	objectdatasource
rather than using an objectdatasource and then binding a gridview to the objectdatasource that works but i need more freedom to customize the form

8760206
equals	gethashcode
anonymous types provide overridden equals and gethashcode methods which are defined in terms of the equals and gethashcode implementations of the properties

8760257
put	get
i get my answer put it here for anyone have same asking.

8760274
rss	feed
i have a custom django-command that reads and rss looks for new feed and if any new feed is found i push it pusher.com to my webapp hosted in heroku heroku.com

8760294
google-chrome	safari
this happens in google-chrome safari but when the window is resized the .news-item elements retain their original width rather than adjusting it to fit the resized images

8760313
codeigniter	yii
if you want to develop your own mvc framework you can but i strongly suggest you to first learn the mvc frameworks which already available with lots of options i.e codeigniter yii etc

8760318
post	put
you could download the page with atlassian cli and parse out the section of html you want to modify put that in your wysiwyg and then inject it back into the downloaded html and post it back

8760352
implements	extends
since the interface extends ienumerable you have to implements the methods declared on both

8760362
maven	pom.xml
i suspect you need to add the libraries to your maven pom.xml file

8760377
ienumerable	ienumerator
the other comes from ienumerable and returns ienumerator

8760412
width	height
the width and height of imageref are actually w 768 h 780 so the ratio should be max 0.781 0.769 0.78

8760412
width	height
dividing the width or height by the desired size as in cgimagegetwidth imageref 600 etc. fixed the problem

8760418
hide	show
you could add a dependency property to the user control that you want to use as a data template a dependency property named type for example and depending on that property you can change the layout of your user control data template - for example you could have multiple grids inside your user control and you could show and hide them depending on the type

8760442
oncreate	onstart
suppose there are two activities a and b and activity a calls activity b through startonactivityresult intent 200 then your activity goes to background and activity b is called oncreate onstart onresume depends on what you have overridden

8760442
oncreate	onstart
in this case now ie activity a the call will be onactivityresult - onstart - onresume but your oncreate will not be called as it is only called when you call a certain activity

8760465
google-chrome	safari
i m looking for something more updated to include safari 5 and google-chrome

8760474
maven	pom.xml	ant	maven	ant	pom.xml
i ended up writing an ant task that modifies the pom.xml and changes the version in the file before maven script is triggered

8760489
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome firefox and ie9

8760547
tiff	png
try using a grid or tiff file instead of a png

8760550
opera	firefox
firefox leaves offsety undefined and opera sets it to 1

8760603
udp	tcp
you don t mention if you re using udp or tcp however i suspect you re using tcp in which case it will handle any interruptions on its own -- provided the connection doesn t get torn down

8760654
opencv	vlfeat
according to this so answer to a similar question you should look at opencv and vlfeat

8760668
archetypes	dexterity
dexterity arguably has more better documentation than archetypes see plone.org products dexterity as well as my book professional plone 4 development

8760670
typeerror	traceback
traceback object or none a typeerror exception is raised

8760684
udp	tcp
if you are talking about on the same network you could use a udp broadcast which is picked up by the device which contains the remote ip which then sends a response to the android handset with it s own tcp ip address

8760747
profiling	instrumentation
i found this paint app and used the profiling zombie instrumentation on it

8760760
pop-up	dialog
other modes including the default mode wmode window wmode direct and wmode gpu require us to hide your flash object when dialog pop-up chat tabs and ticker flyouts occur

8760807
google-chrome	firefox
i have a flex application that when i update on the server i can see the changes in both firefox and and google-chrome but i.e continues to show the application before the change.

8760828
uitableview	uisearchbar
the only problem is that if i search and then click on cancel without deleting the text from the uisearchbar and then go back to previous view controller and then go to that same view with uitableview and uisearchdisplaycontroller it crashes with this being written to the log

8760848
uilabel	uibutton
when i run the same code with a uilabel instead of a uibutton i can see the label

8760887
spaces	delimiter
in awk by default the delimiter or field separator is spaces one or more

8760916
folder	directory
i also tried deploying my application via the tomcat-manager and it says that the application was deployed correctly but it doesn t come in the tomcat application listing but the folder is also created in the webapps directory and when i try to access in the browser i get the same error that before

8760923
int	chars
create hashmap with keys as a chars and int count as value

8760949
int	chars
you could parse the string and create a so that the int value in the map represents how many times the chars c the key in the map appears in the string

8760972
squash	merge	squash	branch
a squash merge performs the merge then records it as a regular commit without the merge branch as a parent

8760972
squash	merge	squash	branch
looking back at the first diagram after you do your squash merge have all the private contributors reset to that point rebasing any other branch they might have

8760974
width	height
i chose an array as opposed to a list arraylist or some other container because once the width and height of the playfield are set they do not change

8761014
int	chars
a simple but intuitive way that i have done this in the past is to cast the chars as int and then just use an array

8761034
openni	kinect
this being said you can t use openni and kinect for windows

8761072
getter	setter
to make a derived provider that stays up to date with changes to grapharray you can either add listeners to grapharray or if the grapharray is only set and not modified you can get away with breaking the variable out into getter and setter something like this untested code

8761083
int	chars
so sizeof array will give you the size of the pointer pointing to the first member no matter if the array is int float or chars

8761088
put	get
that way you only have to put the string format logic in one place and it will get applied to all of your views

8761093
profiling	instrumentation
you probably need to use profiling - leaks instrumentation for detecting leaks

8761110
getter	setter
this makes sense since the property declarations syntax sugar are compiled into a field plus getter and or setter methods add remove in my case which reference the field

8761117
textview	imageview
wrap the imageview inside relative layout and add textview on top of it | bottom right

8761151
folder	directory
my problem is that i want to make a script in php which will list all files recursively from specyfic directory in users home folder

8761161
inherited	properties
i just ran into a similar issue and my answer was to make a new control which inherited from hiddenfield and gives it a cssclass properties

8761175
int	boolean
i use the casting of the isactive field from int to boolean as an example

8761194
hide	show
so my code just creates inline-diff on a per-word basis of a string using html tags so css can hide show that which was removed added

8761211
mp4	webm
so for some bonus points the method now accepts a string which you pass the video format you require mp4 x-flv or webm

8761213
treemap	linkedhashmap
hashmap linkedhashmap treemap all implement map

8761278
put	get
either put c properly into namespace a by moving the namespace to the header file and fix c.cpp to use that namespace or get rid of namespace a

8761290
gridview	rowdatabound	gridview	sqldatasource	sqldatasource	rowdatabound
i am using visual studio 2010 and sql server 2008 and populating my gridview with sqldatasoure .and inside itemtemplate of gridview there are some dropdownlist which are again being binded with sqldatasource and on rowdatabound event am assigning selected values for these dropdownlist

8761382
width	height
in other words the example you provided is a rectangular plot with the height width and the height and width are chosen to make the width-of-one-change height-of-one-box

8761425
width	height
consult the plug-in doc-o and pay special attention to the dimensions section height width etc. and consider specifying a value of 100

8761460
multiplying	multiplication
then you multiplying them in a specific order order matters in matrix multiplication to transform your model as you wish

8761514
vbscript	jscript
you can even mix legacy vbscript and new jscript code in your existing classic asp apps if you re mindful of a few quirks

8761514
vbscript	jscript
n.b. i m only interested in comparing vbscript and jscript

8761557
vbscript	jscript
not many people use jscript for classic asp most prefer vbscript

8761632
google-chrome	firefox
below html displays menu in same line for firefox latest version google google-chrome browsers but in ie9 it it show them in separate lines

8761632
google-chrome	firefox
i am not sure what i should do to fix this i tried several properties but didn t work as it works in firefox google-chrome

8761633
portrait	landscape
all fail to consistently get the drawing area especially when switching from landscape to portrait layout

8761633
portrait	landscape
printablearea does not seem to ever change when you switch from landscape to portrait

8761633
width	height	portrait	landscape
in a preview it always shows portrait width height so i have to check if it is a preview and i have to manually swap the width height when it is a landscape

8761646
google-chrome	safari
ply use google-chrome or safari

8761666
filtering	grouping
how do i use the grouping filtering in ssrs to further filtering my mdx results i can t do the filtering in the mdx itself

8761706
integer	unsigned
when we say hash function i find it means converting a sequence bytes of keys to 32bit or 64bit unsigned integer in most articles for example see this

8761722
int	double
the second suggestion is this - what about about creating a custom class which wraps an int array to handle this which uses a similar double algorithm or quadrupling to generic to handle resizing but starts at say size 256

8761722
int	double
you could add object int id s to this out of order as fast as you like and it won t double too often

8761725
rtp	sip
i m trying to evaluate a tool called ohrwurm which claims to be able to corrupt rtp traffic between two sip endpoints

8761725
rtp	sip
for those packets which are sip grab the rtp port numbers out

8761725
udp	rtp
for those packets that are udp and between the two rtp ports grabbed earlier fuzz the rtp contents

8761730
hide	show
i also have a function set up that hide the photo description when the mouse is inactive but show the description when the mouse moves

8761787
vbscript	jscript
instead of switching the page language to javascript i leave it at the default vbscript and then use a block for my jscript code

8761793
mouseover	mouseleave
i created a .slidedown .slideup effect on a div based on mouseover and mouseleave

8761837
imperative	declarative
but is declarative about a piece of knowledge not imperative

8761837
imperative	declarative
so if we were giving imperative instructions to our waiter we might turn our declarative information about peas earlier i dislike peas but i ll sometimes eat them in salads into a command waiter if entree has peas in salad then serve entree else if entree just has peas then don t serve entree

8761863
punctuation	words
you ll need to do something about punctuation though if you don t want those attached to your words

8761890
hide	show
it would be cleaner to create a panel object with an internal reference to itself and a set of show and hide methods and then attach that to the namespace - at least then you don t have to worry that the problem is the scoping of your closure

8761891
client-side	server-side
you should always perform adequate server-side validation on inputs regardless of client-side validation

8761928
versioning	upgrade
am i correct in saying that if the site is currently versioning 1.0.0.0 it will be upgrade to v 1.0.03 executing both logica and logicb above

8761946
min	max
my problem is that i couldn t find out how to get the dimensions of the clicked country min max x y coordinate so that i can properly scale it to cover the available screen area

8761976
addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication
just like in school multiplication and division have priority over addition

8762054
versioning	upgrade
from what i m aware of we had to upgrade svn on our servers to be compatible with the latest versioning of ankhsvn

8762057
joptionpane	jdialog
another issue maybe finding the ok cancel buttons in the hierarchy of components since the jdialog is created through joptionpane and you haven t a reference to the buttons

8762060
width	height
the height and width work

8762082
ant	maven
you may also want to make sure if your build script ant maven or your ide didn t remove relocate that messages.properties coz it is not .class from the resulting jar file

8762097
ubuntu	linux
i don t care if it s for linux ubuntu or os x

8762124
udp	tcp
only change that i want to make is that instead of having a tcp concurrent server i want the server to be udp server

8762152
for-loop	arrays
all this arrays does is list the files after that a for-loop will get each file one at a time read them and the contents will go into another arrays

8762181
webclient	webrequest
if you want to download from a website then you can use a ssis script to download the files either via webclient webrequest or through the http connection manager

8762181
webclient	webrequest
you could also use the more straight forward webclient but i found i had problems using the webclient to download really large files that i was able to avoid with the webrequest webresponse approach

8762184
post	put
there must be a way to collect the http params from the post put it in a list and set the list in the bean

put	get
i have successfully changed the margins and sizes to get the histograms where i want them but i m not sure how to tell mpl where to put the xlabel and ylabel

8762372
int	chars
just in case i ve also tried ctb iobase writev chars âˆ buf size_t len unsigned int timeout_in_ms with timeout set to 100ms and i ve still got program hanging in the same line

8762414
children	parent
i would engage in a little code reorg the find children construct is extremely awkward and i would re-label my html to not require wandering around the parent structure

8762420
subtract	add
this is the starting point of pointer arithmetic you can add or subtract values with pointers as long you don t move off the array well you can move up to right after the array

8762438
hide	show
i want the uinavigationcontroller to only show up in the left half of my ipad app and i would also like the ability to hide it at times

8762450
websphere	ibm
the rational rose product was pretty much superceded by rational requisite pro with a large portion of the functionality focussed on java being folded into ibm s websphere application development platform now referred to as rad i believe

8762457
qdialog	qwidget
however when the user closes that qdialog and the one underneath becomes visible the qwidget showing the count shows the old value for a split second before it then updates to the correct value

8762457
qdialog	qwidget
i know that the qwidget underneath has the correct value before the other qdialog is shown but i can t seem to get the dialog to update before it s visible

8762464
config	ini
if using shiro s ini config you set the securitymanager s cachemanager property like any other bean property

8762487

postgresql	mysql
for some reason i m using mysql locally and have postgresql on my heroku app

8765955

for-loop	loops
below is where the issue is...when a bullet object is erased the program exits with a segmentation fault...now i understand why this is happening since the vector size is changed while it s in loops but i can t figure out how to fix it...i added the break thinking that it would solve the problem since only one bullet can be 0 at a given time anyway but it doesn t...i initially had the if statement in the last for-loop after the update function but i put it in its own for-loop so i could use the break

subtract	add
if the sign bits match then we are going to actually subtract if they dont match then we add

8767315
subtraction	addition
computers perform a subtraction by using addition logic inverting the second operator on the way into the adder and asserting the carry in bit like this

8767315
subtract	add
if you are writing a program to synthesize the floating point math your program can perform the subtract you dont have to do the invert and add plus one thing over complicates it as we saw above

8767315
subtract	add
3 being a subtract operation if the sign bits are the same then you perform a subtract if the sign bits are different you perform an add of the mantissas

8767315
subtract	add
5 normalize the number shift the answer to the right or left the answer can be 25 bits from a 24 bit add subtract add subtract can have a dramatic shift to normalize either one right or many bits to the left until you have a 24 bit number with the most significant one left justified

8767324
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
the uinavigationbar is mainteined across different views only when you set a uinavigationcontroller that manages an viewcontroller

8767324
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
if you don t set a uinavigationcontroller then you can put a uinavigationbar in your view through programmatically or visually editing your aboutviewcontroller.xib in xcode

8767352
free	malloc
and you should delete and free all blocks previously allocated with new and malloc otherwise you ll leak memory and probably make your program unstable it will fail to allocate more memory at some point and exert unnecessary pressure on memory in the os possibly slowing down other programs or making them unstable as well

8767362

8767428
width	margin
using width auto will allow the left margin while letting the div fill the remaining width

8767431
clang	llvm
the problem with doing that is that you have to realize that there are many tuning knobs on a compiler and compilers are constantly evolving and different compilers say gcc llvm clang and visual c c++ are completely different

8767454
hide	show
in .net i could use panels to show hide controls and i m looking to do the samething in android

8767831
folder	directory
i used a test folder to hold files from a directory on the localhost machine however

8767838
writetofile	nsdata
perhaps pdf_val is an nsdata containing the pdf in which case you can send it the writetofile atomically message

8767858
filtering	grouping
this is particularly problematic because i need to know what the media grouping is as a client requires that a search can be filtering by the grouping meaning the level 1 folder for each pdf in meda

8767869
wav	ogg	mp3	ogg	mp3	wav
i also tried different formats of sound like mp3 ogg wav but still there is same problem

8767876

8767881
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction
it is not clear why you always do a division even when the operation is an addition or subtraction or multiplication

8767900
subtraction	addition
scala needs to compile the methods on value classes into the java byte codes for addition subtraction etc

8767930

ubuntu	debian
put this in place of the server section in an existing config file unless using debian ubuntu or other system where the server configurations are split into their own files

8768101
post	get
maybe you could post a bit more code of your getview method that would probably help to get a better answer

8768107
ssl	https
the reason i am asking is because it seems facebook apps if hosted on local server needs ssl mandatory whereas none of the above websites have ssl https

8768152
getter	setter
i dont want setter methods just getter methods like getkeepscreenon etc is enough.

8768156
width	height
i believe that your confusion stems from the fact that the crop coordinates by default are relative to the original image and the width height values are the scaled size of the image

8768156
width	height
if you don t need an exact width and height you can use mode max instead

8768201
google-chrome	safari
but it does on google-chrome ie safari

8768248
filtering	grouping
you can filtering data set and grouping in ssrs report filtering after result obtained from mdx

8768339
int	chars
a few apis primarily in the chars class use 32-bit int to represent code points as individual entities

8768381
folder	directory
for example i made a tool that downloads nearly 1000+ folder sub-folders and so on from a sharepoint document library site and at the same time it logs name of folder with the number assigned to the folder just to let you know the only reason i am doing this is because the directory path gets too long if i give folder the name they should have and i cant download them

8768388
gridview	detailsview
and i listed the possble answers as a b c and d when the user chooses one of them for example c the gridview will show the result the user s answer as a number which is 3 not as a letter while the detailsview will show the correct answer as c

8768422
int	chars
strings are utf-16 encoded and can give you 16-bit unsigned chars or code points of type int

8768448
cos	sin
and you let ios calculate cos and sin out of the angle again cgaffinetransformrotate does that

8768477
iboutlet	ibaction
ibaction and iboutlet is just used to let xcode s interface builder ib know that there s a function exist

8768477
iboutlet	ibaction
generally if you create your code programmatically without using xcode s interface builder you do not need iboutlet or ibaction anymore

8768507
width	height
this width of the button is auto and the height is 100 to cover up the textbox

8768552
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout or setinterval are easy and probably the most obvious ways

switching	screens
the problem is that sometimes if you move fast among screens some sprites are not being rendered sometimes they are it depends on how fast i switching between scenes

8768583
post	put
by redirecting from one to the other you allow a put post or delete request to invalidate the cache of a single canonical uri

8768583
post	get
use 307 instead of 302 so that historic clients don t change post to get

8768616
x86	64bit
nowadays i always write code with 64bit portability in mind and therefore i d replace those with the get setclasslongptr and get setwindowlongptr macros which automatically resolve to the correct function call depending on if you re compiling for x86 or x64

8768616
children	parent
the win32 model is such that parent always own their children and it is thus their responsibility to handle events

8768641
qapplication	qwidget
there is sth like this and after download i would like to setenable true for each button but i can t run method from mainwindow in this if couse i get qwidget must construct a qapplication before a qpaintdevice

8768851
width	height
to avoid reflows use the width and height attributes for the rows and columns to ensure the browser renders the container table correctly to begin with

8768851
width	height
this also means setting width and height on the img elements

8768860
width	height
from my experience background images tend to load faster altough images with height and width specifed can load faster but i don t think you have that option

8768887
int	chars
returns the result of interpreting leading chars in str as an int

8768897

textarea	textbox
triggers can be images or links and each trigger must refer to an input field textbox or textarea with

8768918
children	parent
the initial expression b will be executed in every children and parent process running at this level

8768918
children	parent
at level 2 due to fork â b executed by m and c1 we have m and c1 as parent and c2 and c3 as children

8768983
hide	show
edit to hide all divs and show a specific div

8768986
int	boolean
the value 0 is an int type and the false is boolean type hence the data type does not match here and condition will be true

8768999
google-chrome	firefox
you would need to use an activex control or browser plugin firefox google-chrome etc to check if the client is installed

8769024
hide	show
3 in the javascript function hide all divs with the visible class and use the id of the label to find and show the correct div

opencart	concrete
remember that these tricks will only work if the default option is the one you want or if you force opencart to autoselect one concrete option

8769070
atoi	atof
but since result is generic i can t use any method like atof and atoi etc

8769117
superclass	subclassing
you can put all your shared stuff together in the superclass and use them in the subclassing simply calling the methods on self

8769124
onmouseover	mouseout
it s hard to implement such menu using pure js because onmouseover onmouseout events are fired when mouse move to the child element in menu when your mouse moves from main element to submenu mouseout will fire

8769124
mouseleave	mouseenter
you should look for some implementation of mouseenter mouseleave events

8769147
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu

8769148
setinterval	clearinterval
i guess it should even be possible with a do while without the setinterval and clearinterval

8769176
int	double
it takes int s and double s

8769202
portrait	landscape
i defined dynamically all gui components.when the cntrl+f11 is first pressed the layout updates correctly to from portrait to landscape

the problem is that parent actuially has three children a textnode containing a new line after parent opening tag the actual child and yet another textnode with newline after closing child tag

8769256
persistent	transient
what persistent does is to make a transient entity attached to the entity manager

8769369
strdup	malloc
solution allocate memory using malloc or strdup

8769371

i came across on problem with validation when hide show control through javascript

8769523
hide	show
my javascript function as per below hide show on some condition

8769531
inherited	properties
it ã s however possible to add classes with the same properties names as long as the second is inherited from the first.

8769536
ant	maven
i would also suggest using some kind of build tool ant or maven ant is already suggested and is easier to start with or an ide that handles the compilation eclipse uses incremental compilation with reconciling strategy and you don t even have to care to press any compile buttons

8769536
ant	maven
the drawback is that it has a steep learning curve and if maven plugins like to suppress errors - another thing is that quite a lot of tools also operate with maven repositories like sbt for scala ivy for ant graddle for groovy

8769563
client-side	server-side
i am now in the position where have have two .php files one for the server-side validation and now one for the client-side

8769563
client-side	server-side
i want to keep both client-side and server-side validation but i do not want to keep multiple files which contain duplicate functionality

there you are able to create as many movable parent nodes as well as children which is typical for a nested set shy

8769767
apache	nginx
yes you can deploy your opa application behind apache nginx haproxy ... as you want

8769808
pull	push
i am trying to build something that enables to push to ftp so you at least pull and push to ftp

8769826
xslt	xquery
a solution in xslt would work too but if you are not already using xslt then using xquery makes more sense here i guess

8769827
public	protected
in all cases a member can be injected regardless of its java access specifier private default protected public

8769833
stdio	fflush
this is os-specific but typically on modern platforms open files will be closed and their in-process stdio buffers fflush

8769853
padding	overlapping
that way you can put a padding on the li to stop the a from overlapping the arrow

8769884
button	checkbox
when we click on any of these three button there should be contacts along with a checkbox for selecting multiple contacts

8769894
multiplication	modulo
for any non-prime modulo there s always the risk that your modulo results in zero which will of course cause the entire multiplication to produce zero

8769912
put	get
what you do to get the shaders into the copy bundle resources build phase automatically is simply to put all the shaders in a common folder or folder tree

8769915
int	boolean

8770181
next	except
to get this behavior i also bound the displaydate property of my calendar to my selecteddate property and this gives me the expected behavior except when i click on the gray dates of the previous or next month

8770181
mouseup	mousedown
apparently clicking on a gray date causes the selecteddate to be set on mousedown and again on mouseup which causes a selection of a date two months away

8770237
mouseover	mouseenter
if mouseenter on image submenu should slide up from the bottom and when mouseover submenu should slide down

outputstream	inputstream
use the correct type of buffers either reader writer for character streams or inputstream outputstream for byte streams

8770304
folder	directory
files are added to repositories via upload.the files are stored in the sub folder of web root. this is not an issue since it is to be run in a local network among trusted users .i have to add an option to view raw code or at the least download them.my current idea is to implement it using the standard apache directory listing

8770319
typedef	struct
unfortunately these types are typedef struct types i can t seem to find any way to forward declare them

8770358
hide	show
the menu is usually associated with the main form so setting form1.menu nil will hide it and form1.menu mainmenu will show it

8770392

i have a google maps with height and width 100 in the css

8770428
int	chars
and 15 chars are way enough to store an int

8770523
for-loop	arrays
a common approach is to store the size in a variable and use it as upper bound in your for-loop often functions that expect an arrays have an additional parameter to get the size of the arrays

8770567
google-chrome	firefox
i suggest you use either firefox or google-chrome

8770618
width	height
p.s this example is not perfect.it is just a sample of how to use a custom icon.preferably for the icon use dimensions 18x18 which is the dimensions of icons used in jqm framework .in that case you dont have to override the width and height styles

8770619
min	max	range	min	range	max
sample works even if i dont set min max range

8770625
screens	tablet
i am trying to create an application for tablet that has a main screens with three fragments each containing a list

8770629
min	max
you ll need to show us the calling code to the min max macros

8770629
min	max
it sounds like you re either trying to use the result of min max as incorrectly or you ve passed a token a or b containing an unexpected comma

8770664
folder	directory
i have a mostly-working piece of code to read a directory output each folder name and count the files and the total size of the files in that directory

8770709
post	get
in order to handle uploads check for a post request and get the file from files parameter

8770766
nsdatadetector	nsregularexpression
i cannot tell you how it works â the fact that nsdatadetector inherits nsregularexpression may suggest that it uses a set of regular expressions but i honestly doubt that the detector for date-types uses information that is sprinkled throughout longer blocks of text so that it appears more likely that there is some natural language clustering and processing going on under the hood

8770792
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i tested this in google-chrome safari and firefox

8770810

you probably need an extension method for your enum to get the display attribute that you put on your enum options

8791426
pop-up	dialog
if you want a file save dialog to pop-up when someone requests the export url you have to use

8791429
width	height
it is an image rather than a background image and they use a javascript function called from the onresize event to set the width and or height of it to the full width of its containing div

8791440
oncreate	ondestroy
in oncreate i set isrunning true and ondestroy false

8791451
implements	extends
class myentitydaojpa extends abstractdaojpa implements myentitydao

8791470
getter	setter
what you could do write a class with a boost share_ptr member variable and optionally write getter and setter for that member

8791473
profiler	yourkit
we selected yourkit profiler for .net in my company as it was the best value price vs

8791507
dbcontext	objectcontext
the entitydatasource control needs an objectcontext database first context not a dbcontext code first context

8791518
stdout	stderr
i m not sure that this is related to the problem but when redirecting stderr to the same pipe as stdout you should use as explained in the documentation

8791536
post	get
with this 2 methods i get every attributes of post in my views

8791536
put	get
in my console if i put after create a board post.first i get

8791536
put	get
in normal model i get user id for example in create action of controller i put post.user current_user.id or post.user current_user

8791537
factors	matrix
the trivial way to do this is to compute the svd decomposition of the matrix set the smallest singular values to zero and compute the low-rank matrix by multiplying the factors

8791569
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have a simple html 5 video on a page that works in google-chrome and firefox but not in safari

8791592
int	double
get a random int in range -1000 999 and add a random double in

8791616
range	min
here is a general function you could use to linearly rescale a number between zero and one val01 to a different range min

8791621
qspinbox	qslider
i want to connect a qslider to a qdoublespinbox but while the code compiles fine and runs for simple qspinbox it doesn t work for qdoublespinbox

8791628
public	protected
the local variables inside a method can not be declared with visibility modifiers public private protected or default only the attributes of a class can use those modifiers

8791634
google-chrome	firefox
it looks fine to me in google-chrome but the outline of the triangle looks messed up in firefox

8791634
google-chrome	firefox
i m using firefox 9.0.1 and google-chrome 16

8791634
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox i get odd artifacts around the triangle that don t appear in google-chrome or ie9 for that matter

8791641
width	height
know the width and height of the image loaded

8791641
width	height	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i am able to get the image width and height just fine in firefox google-chrome opera

8791641
width	height
but in ie8 i always get image width and height as 0

8791701
rsa	aes
strangely the rsa java cryptoapi interop solution requires the message to be completely byte reversed in order to work with java but aes does not expect the key or the message to be byte reversed

8791716
for-loop	loops
you could also use a regular for-loop you can iterate lists that a for-loop uses within loops itself unlike a foreach loops

8791721
switching	screens
switching to 2.2 framework which has better compatability with screens resolutions and densities

8791771
getter	setter
the getter and setter of the property ensure that memory management is handled correctly

8791771
getter	setter
the only time to access the ivars directly are in init dealloc and getter and setter

8791888
width	height
you don t have to deal with that specific titlebar height and border width

8791907
put	get
your number is several orders of magnitude larger than that and as such when you try to put your input into the int variable something happens but i can tell you what doesn t happen it doesn t get assigned the value 1231231231231236

8791914
put	get
this way you can do a very nice organisation and when it comes to get one static file if you put the rules above at the very beginning they ll be filtered properly and never redirected to index.php

8791943
superclass	subclassing
it requires subclassing to have special knowledge of their superclass

8791966
int	double
qslider and qdoublespinbox take different types of arguments in valuechanged setvalue qslider uses int and qdoublespinbox uses double of course

8791967
post	put
current version is afaik v 3.0 - according to this in the earlier version it was ok to use post for such an operation but this is no longer recommended instead put should be used

8791989
google-chrome	firefox
the selenium webdriver classes come with several drivers one for each supported browser type ie firefox google-chrome

8791996
antivirus	mcafee
personally it was my antivirus mcafee who was using that port

8792019
persistent	transient
my intuition is that transient properties would incurr less overhead than persistent properties because they do not need to be persistent and read from the database so converting them to persistent properties will likely only make things slightly worse

8792037
google-chrome	firefox
where as google-chrome and firefox seem to work just fine

8792054
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately there is only limited support for these in google-chrome and firefox and essentially no support of these in ie9 and below

8792061
converter	multibinding
but you could change the way you handle this by creating only one converter but passing both the original value and the selection status via a multibinding

8792063
put	get
i want to get the first and last name of any person who is special or very special so that i can then put those names into labels and wherever i like as i wish

8792067
for-loop	arrays
you could create a arrays of jradiobuttons and then use them in for-loop traversing each button one by one and then recording its answer

8792095
postgresql	mysql
in mysql for example the following would select 20 rows beginning from row 40 but this is mysql-only clause edit it seems postgresql also allows this

8792128
oncreate	setcontentview
then in oncreate test whether the notitle extra is present in the intent and make the appropriate call to requestwindowfeature before calling setcontentview

8792138
put	get
i have this treepanel and i want to call this.getid method of mainpaneltree from inside expand all button but all i get is method undefined.i tried to put scope this in config objects but no success

8792267
post	get
if using get isn t an option then one thing you can do instead is use post but save everything in a cookie or session variable for you to retrieve on the previous page if pagination breadcrumbs are used after submitting the form

8792274
clang	llvm
clang can translate cuda not complete or opencl to llvm

8792281
post	get
so yes you are correct to use post for submitting your form and get is not recommended in this case

8792303
subtraction	addition
these alus will complete integer addition subtraction and or comparison in a single clock cycle cache misses will of course take longer but depend only on the size and memory layout of the data not signed-ness

8792308
width	height	min	max
as a side-note here though the radsplitter control relies on the radpane s to have a specific size set hence the min max height width etc. and you might want to look into just having a regular element as the top panel and then only use the radsplitter on the bottom half

8792312
pop-up	dialog
dialog pop-up i click on the browser click back on dialog and dialog disappears behind the browser

8792320
hash	salt
you should only be storing them as salt hash

8792327
onclick	onfocus
i know this can be done easily with js but i m not sure what event i should call it on onfocus and onclick won t work because the user might simply click on the sibling name field but not enter a value fill in something but later on clear it out etc

8792341
int	double
nowadays the optimizations made on chip look out what superscalar out of order processor with speculative execution means and by the compilers make those kind of differences assuming they exist which i don t really for signed unsigned comparisons but optimizations like value range propagation and strength reduction may have an influence so context dependant that a measurement in the desired context is needed as it will have an influence on the result i ve had code where putting some int variables as double make it performs better on some machines worse on others

8792363
ubuntu	linux
i am using g++ 4.2.3 on linux ubuntu 10.04

8792374
width	height
this print width and height but exif properties is about 40 in cgimageproperties.h in imageio.h library file and i don t know how to print all at once

8792399
integer	unsigned
the comparison instruction cmp on x86 32 64 is the same on both signed and unsigned integer data types

8792399
integer	unsigned
increments decrements addictions subtractions on integer data are also not aware of signed or unsigned data types due to the 2 complement

8792508
debian	centos
on debian i don t know centos off the top of my head assuming apache2 the location is

8792511
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
you can use monodevelop webmatrix visual studio express but i suggest sharpdevelop its open source

8792613
folder	directory
instead of returning the new name of the folder to the program the dialog returns new folder directory

8792642
i2c	spi
i have developed small drivers on wince and worked on spi i2c interface from application opening reading and writing driver

8792697
google-chrome	firefox
tested it on firefox google-chrome and ie7 and up

8792754
folder	directory
in the public directory i have a few folder that need to serve js files as the index

8792766
folder	directory
i also have a directory folder with many picture in .jp2 format xxxx.jp2

8792805
hide	show
winforms uses a trick to still support hide it actually destroys the native window and re-creates it when you call show again

8792815
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
this is the code but it s not working on ie8 7 ie9 google-chrome firefox safari opera are all ok

8792852
children	parent
the background is i have to scale a parent usercontrol and its children and at the same time trying to avoid the too-smart-for-me xaml

8792852
width	height
from the new and previous size both provided from the event parameters i calculate the ratios for width and height and apply them to each child element thus resizing them

8792852
width	height
at this point the old height and width are both 0 or nan respectively

8792863
google-chrome	firefox
ie10 looks like fully interoperable browser so if you deliver ie-specific code you should probably stop doing that and treat ie10 the same way as firefox or google-chrome

8792871
png	ico
but while this works fine for any text files it fails completely for any binary files png ico etc. i also don t like having to specify the mime-type like that

8792872
mousemove	keydown
i think this is as close as you ll get add mousemove focus keydown and scroll listeners to your body element and expect the page to be visible for another x second timeout where i have no idea what reasonable values for x may be

8792919
width	height
try setting your iframe height width to a percentage

8792947
post	get
i ve implemented a simple mechanism whereby i hash the user password sent as post get parameter and store it in a database

8792947
hash	salt
i ve read about several mechanisms starting from simple http authentication using a salt hash which i m using implementing access tokens to the seemingly complicated oauth authentication

8792965
google-chrome	firefox
this behaves normally in desktop browsers firefox google-chrome however on an ipad the screen is resizing before this window appears and everything appears shifted to the top left of the screen

8792974
content-disposition	content-type
in order to suggest that a browser download a file rather than displaying it you can leave content-type text csv and add the header content-disposition attachment or to change the filename in the save as... dialog

8793006
post	get
what i want to accomplish is get all the post but one for every user postedby column the date must be the latest and of course show the comment

8793014
actualheight	actualwidth
i m not sure of the best approach to your question but you might find the actualwidth actualheight properties useful

8793016
button	checkbox
when a button is clicked first all data in the table is getting deleted and for every checkbox that is checked the id is inserted in the tabel again

8793016
button	checkbox
if i check a few more of the checkbox and click the button again all all rows are getting deleted and then my thought was that the checkbox that is visible false

8793057
ssl	https
a number of browsers support pkcs#11 for https authentication that is using pkcs#11 for client-certificate authentication as part of the ssl tls connection as part of https

8793059
overlay	z-order
intuitiveness will drive you to z-order your prioritized view after the less-important one in the xml - but as i ve said previously the first one to grab the pixels stays so make sure you define the smaller view first and then overlay it with the bigger one

8793071
folder	directory
i also have a directory folder with many picture in .jp2 format xxxx.jp2

8793131
public	protected
with this approach you are keeping the external public interface separated from the internal protected interface intended for child classes

8793181
google-chrome	firefox
it works great in firefox and google-chrome as well as ie8 but does not work in ie9

8793191
integer	fractions
in case you don t know returns the integer part of the given number and sends the fractions part to the address given as a 2 argument

8793225
google-chrome	safari
sometimes in google-chrome and safari navigation drops out of the header

8793243
put	get
i know one way to pass information to another page in javascript is to use a get request and put everything on the url

8793257
ssl	https
the facebook oauth2 implementation requires that you use ssl https which means that other people cannot see that token unless you explicitly give it to them outside of the browser itself or using an evil plugin as noted

8793312
profiling	debugging
just use profiling to see what data ef sends to stored procedure and use that data separately to test debugging only stored procedure

8793313
width	height	portrait	landscape
here i only set the width and the height is taken care of by vflexbox and changes depending on the orientation landscape portrait of the device

8793314
width	height
to avoid that you would have to specify the width and height for the input in absolute units for example pixels

8793320
width	height
you will have to set a fixed width and height of the input as well and keep it the same no matter if the input has focus or not

8793320
width	height
if your doing it all with javascript you could get the initial calculated width and height of the input and assign it as inline css

8793323
width	height
you can assign width and height style properties to the input element

8793323
google-chrome	firefox
firefox 9 and google-chrome 15 which suggests a fair degree of compatibility

8793323
width	height
same principal but if you want to query the width and height and now that you ve told us you re using jquery

8793323
google-chrome	firefox
live example - as with the one above works in ie6 firefox 9 and google-chrome 15

8793452
mef	prism
mef ioc or prism

8793453
singleton	facade
i m working on a project where one of the co-developers and previous developers use a singleton facade for just about every page of class that has a lot of method calls inside of it but that don t actually maintain the data

8793453
singleton	facade
now i have certain issues with the naming convention and the fact that they have the singleton inside the same class as the facade and the fact that the facade isn t really a facade

8793479
int	chars
warning format s expects argument of type chars but argument has type int

8793516
for-loop	loops
would it be better to parallel the outer for-loop so that the code within is run for multiple learners at a time as opposed to parallel the code within loops so that the different windowing approaches are paralleled for a single learner

8793540
charindex	substr
using some creative substr float and charindex logic i came up with this

8793564
stdout	stderr
you should redirect stderr and maybe also stdout from your subprocess to the parent process or to system.err system.out

8793610
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout and setinterval are not particularly kind to battery life and cpu consumption

8793621
gmp	bigint
all solutions i did already found are either painfully slow fgint bigint mybigint ubigints i386 cpu specific sdpbigint or implemented in c mpir gmp

8793650
int	chars
int is 4 bytes varchar size depends on the chars encoding

8793677
width	height
you can use php available functions in php to determine the image resolution height width

8793690
post	get
i ve tried just posting there but i get a 301 moved permanently header and if i set curlopt_followlocation to true the request follows but seems to lose the post data - i get nothing at the far end using this file_get_contents php input

8793706
post	get
you can execute show table status to get a better idea and probably post it here so we can analyze it together

8793740
getter	setter
what the compiler ends up doing there is implementing a new getter setter pair for the subclass

8793740
getter	setter
this is distinct from the previous getter setter pair that were implemented for the same property in the superclass

8793740
ivar	subclassing
here viewforrootvc is the ivar from the subclassing

8793740
ivar	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
the superclass is setting its ivar called viewforrootvc not the ivar with the same name generated in the subclassing

8793740
ivar	subclassing
this in turn uses the ivar in the subclassing and so everything works although i think this is not ideal.

8793740
getter	setter	ivar	subclassing
and because ivars are by default protected that ivar is also visible in the subclassing so both sets of setter getter end up using the same ivar

8793740
getter	setter
the right fix imo is let ivars be private to a class synthesized ivars are hidden and therefore effectively private and have subclasses reference the property getter setter as needed

8793781
jboss	glassfish
application servers such as tomcat jboss or glassfish we re running clustered jboss.

8793809
google-chrome	firefox
this doesn t seem to be browser dependent either as i tried ie8 firefox 9 google-chrome 17 on the windows xp computer and ie9 firefox 9 and google-chrome 16 on the windows 7 computer and the outcome is the same on all of them in that it works on 7 but not xp

8793818
post	put
i m not sure how you want to implement this though you could put it in the post template or perhaps make a shortcode to use it

8793823
mouseup	mousedown
when sending two messages at very close interval think 30 - 40ms for example sending a message at mousedown on a button and one on mouseup the two messages arrive at 200 to 300ms of interval on the server

8793830
post	get
it s the type of http requests being received by your controller which defines whether it s a get or post operation

8793830
post	get
the model used to populate a view for a get or capture form data for a post will be the same type either way

8793903
bindparam	pdostatement
this means you will now have a pdostatement object on which you can call bindparam and execute

8793904
regasm	regsvr32
i read online that i had to register the dll i ve tried doing this both with regsvr32 and regasm

8793905
chmod	mkdir
normally you can create a directory with mkdir mermissions to chmod 777 so you can delete this directory from ftp without a root user and this dir will bee fully writable via php

8793915
rss	feed
choose a rss feed

8793915
rss	feed
then the items in the rss feed that s all in a nested list

8793936
jtable	jlabel
the default string renderer in a jtable uses jlabel so this should work

8794018
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the code seems to work fine in both firefox and google-chrome but not in safari

8794089
xlib	xcb
i found some tutorials using xlib however i would like to use xcb

8794125
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
while other browsers like ie8 opera 11.52 safari 5.0.4 and google-chrome 16.0.912.63 don t have this issue and every page opens normally

8794178
draggable	droppable
from my research i see that jquery ui has draggable and droppable which do the work at 80

8794215
outputstream	zipinputstream
i am trying to return a zipinputstream containing two different outputstream as a javax.ws.rs.core.response stream

8794249
slideup	slidedown
i m trying to create something like the jquery slideup slidedown function that uses css3 instead of jquery to optimize it for iphone

8794253
ubuntu	debian
i have two servers debian squeeze 32 and ubuntu 11.10 server 64

8794253
ubuntu	debian
update 2 i m not sure if this may apply but under debian i m working in a regular console while ubuntu is being accessed by ssh

8794303
setinterval	settimeout
the simplest way to do this is to use settimeout happens once after a delay or setinterval happens every so often

8794306
hide	show
it show the proper way to do this by implementing the dialogbox.caption interface and then adding an event handler to your caption implementation for the included close button that hide the dialog box

8794329
mef	prism
prism in turn will use mef or unity

8794352
paradox	bde
paradox including support by the bde was able to deal with tables in subdirectories quite easily

8794375
ienumerable	iqueryable
the service operation is not seen as iqueryable but just as ienumerable

8794379
x86	64bit
i am loading the 64bit visual studio tools c program files x86 microsoft visual studio 10.0 vc bin amd64 using invoke-batchfile in my powershell profile

8794400
quad	uniform
i don t know if a geometry shader only if it feasible of course would be the best approach the cost of drawing a line strip using a single quad would be the shader uniform setup for each line composing the strip

8794403
mdpi	hdpi
but if it too much of a hassle then it might be worth to just save png copies of your graphics in a few different resolutions and use them in the ldpi mdpi hdpi folders

8794407
yacc	bison
you re the one programming yacc bison actions for the rules and also the error handler

8794446
cpu	processors
i did order a new processors that will move the cpu benchmark from 1700 to 7800 according to cpubenchmark.net

8794450
installation	upgrade
i have an openerp 5.0 installation with a few custom modules that i wish to upgrade to openerp 6.0

8794464
x86	mips
this code happens to work on mips because the jal instruction does not push the current value of the program counter to the stack unlike the x86

8794465
haskell	scheme
most languages with closures scheme haskell ml and so on close over the values in the lexical scope

8794483
public	protected
keep in mind that this is still a public tweet provided that the authenticated user is not protected

8794506
projectile	angle
i have made a pygame physics simulation-- a projectile motion but it lacks interactivity like accepting angle of launch speed etc

8794517
serializable	deserialization
the reason is for serializable et deserialization

8794517
serializable	deserialization
because when deserializing a class that was serializable it would have to go through the constructor which is impossible in deserialization process because it s not part of the usual code path

8794529
for-loop	arrays
initially i was thinking of iterating through the results arrays using a for-loop but this was not working due to the fact that the results were not loading in time before capturing the screenshot of the chart

8794557
accessor	properties
to do what you propose i suppose you override the accessor for the delegate properties so that you could intercept any calls to -navigationcontroller willshowviewcontroller animated and resize the child view controller

8794634
integer	unsigned
mysql has an unsigned qualifier for integer types

8794701
plot	heatmap
as joaquin mentions in the comments you can also simply plot imshow hist to see the full range of values heatmap rather than 0 or 1

8794712
tablet	galaxy
i m maintaining a sencha touch 1.1 application and i m trying to resolve an issue that we ve noticed on android tablet specifically the samsung galaxy tab s android 3.1

8794713
gridview	objectdatasource
i have an objectdatasource that is binding to my gridview just fine

8794763
google-chrome	firefox
i have a menu div that appears just fine in ie9 and firefox but in google-chrome and ie8 the contents of the div are not following actual div itself when the div is moved

8794784
int	chars
i have a table with structure id int pk entryid int date int region chars location enum views int

8794800
folder	directory
since in your case news is a directory the second rewritecond isn t being met therefore it simply attempts to access the folder and gets a permissions error

8794801
intersect	contains
the different only matters if you have a path that intersect itself or contains multiple closed subpaths

8794835
post	put
put the code on the header of single post only no landing pages or about pages p

8794896
button	right-align
in you case here if you want to right-align that green button just change the one div to have everything right-align

8794897
google-chrome	firefox
after dumping everything in the object i could see that google-chrome was getting different data than firefox

8794909
google-chrome	firefox
the weird thing is that this error occurs on ie 9 and google-chrome 16 but not in firefox 9

8794914
innodb	myisam
i don t think that switching from innodb to myisam will increase the speed if the innodb is not misconfigured

8794939
implements	extends
that was a lot of code but the good thing is that new types can be added without affecting existing functors just extends the shim as long as the functor was implements with a template

8794942
width	height
for simplicity i have not shown them above but div #container has css width height properties generated on the server side to precisely wrap img #picture

8794942
width	height
#image_label is assigned this same width but has no value assigned for height

8794972
nsstring	nsdata
maybe my google skills are garbage but i couldn t seem to find how to convert nsdata of html to nsstring

8794989
client-side	server-side
if you don t want to use javascript on the client-side then you are ultimately bound to do it on the server-side

8794992
direct3d	gdi
you must call the id3d11devicecontext omsetrendertargets method on the device prior to direct3d rendering after gdi rendering

8794992
direct3d	gdi
you can not use any direct3d drawing between getdc and releasedc calls as the surface is excusively locked out by dxgi for gdi

8794992
direct3d	gdi
however you can mix gdi and direct3d rendering provided that you call getdc releasedc every time you need to use gdi before moving on to direct3d

8794996
versioning	upgrade
i ve got a new database here and it s an upgrade versioning from oracle 10g to oracle 11g - the main problem is with lob columns and everytime any function returns a lob as result the new database won t return strings like the old one did

subscript	superscript
many characters like ellipses quotation marks long hyphens apostraphes superscript and subscript will all be encoded incorrectly as boxes and strange text characters when we are submitting the web page.we need to make a regex expression which will check for these characters

8795009
getter	setter
the user class - a pojo - has a attribute with getter and setter and a public method user#removefriend friend f

rss	feed
i was asked to make a view that would display a rss feed of certain parts of the website and i don t understand how to do this

8795156
post	put
just put that whereever you need it within the individual page or post template and it should pass the numerical value of the month

8795185
min	max
there is a requirement to enforce min and max width of the leftbarbutton on navigation bar

8795207
google-chrome	firefox
if by chance you were using ie to test the first case and possibly firefox or google-chrome to test the second case then that may be the cause

8795237
width	height
since it is an iframe setting the width height of the outer div will not reset the iframe width height

8795237
width	height
you have to explicitly set the width height of the iframe

8795237
width	height
also the player inside the iframe has its own width height set when iframe loaded so even if iframe is resized the player will not be resized

8795237
width	height
due to domain constriants you can set the players width height

8795246
post	get
the blog post looks a little outdated but you should be able to easily modify it to get it working with whatever version of codeigniter you are using

8795282
multiplying	add
so you have to multiplying the left value by 2 32 and add it to the right value

8795282
multiplying	add
here we would multiplying by 10 3 to add them together this is a mathematical fact not a guess so trust me on this because it would look like this

8795282
multiplying	add
multiplying b by 2 32 and add to a

8795348
gif	png
it supports resizing cropping padding rotation png gif jpg output borders watermarking remote urls amazon s3 ms sql amazon cloudfront batch operations image filters disk caching and lots of other cool stuff like seam carving

8795380
maven	pom.xml
really you need a separate tool from maven to adjust the versions so you don t depend on the pom.xml file to run correctly

8795415
post	get
i don t know why you get that exception and the post is hard to read due to the bad format but if your problem is the line

8795431
min	max
and i want to be able to change the min max and the value for which the two handles are on based on the results of an ajax call

8795431
min	max
where my min and max are contained in two hidden divs with the class start_price and end_price

8795494
min	max
also to set the value of the slider you have to use the same syntax which you are using for setting min max values

8795572
int	chars
operator does not exist chars varying int

8795579
onmouseover	onclick
you could also get screen properties via the screen object and if it s a smartphone attach the dropdown state to the onclick event and if not to the onmouseover event

8795600
qtreeview	qstandarditemmodel
i have a qtreeview 100 rows with qstandarditemmodel 10 columns

8795626
strstr	substr
since strstr stops searching its first argument when it finds a nul byte and you re sending nul bytes with your client it s likely the last recv is putting something like 0 0 0end in your buffer so strstr considers it a zero-length string and doesn t find the end substr

8795656
range	infinity	division	multiplication
however in expressions of the form where the multiplication produces a result that is outside the double range but the subsequent division brings the temporary result back into the double range the fact that the expression is evaluated in a higher range format may cause a finite result to be produced instead of an infinity

8795700
post	get
i have found only one previous so post that seems related to mine though i dont even get the one debug after an eclipse restart that went unanswered

8795713
floating-point	integer
so even if the underlying value is a float if there s no actual non-zero floating-point numbers it ll print like its an integer

8795734
jerkson	jackson
i ve not used jackson scala module but the behavior is the same in jerkson so i ll hazard a guess as to what s going on

8795734
jerkson	jackson
i m fairly certain there s not a way to get jackson scala module or jerkson to return deserialized json with native scala collections

8795806
rss	feed
i am reading this tutorial on fetching rss feed using php simple xml

8795889
post	get
took me a couple of hours to get this working so i thought i d post my solution so it saves someone else some time in the future

8795894
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
rendering issues exist with firefox google-chrome and safari

8795894
google-chrome	firefox
i know for firefox and google-chrome there are ie add-ins that allow you to run the report in a firefox google-chrome tab

8795911
post	get
i m trying to use the cookies i get in a response to my post method using httpclient 4.0.3

8795932
int	boolean
the input parameters in the tutorials we ve found are typically scalar values int boolean or strings and not complex structures or objects

8795940
width	height
if i increase the size of the imagecontext all i get is more height and width but still starting from x 0 and y 0 where i would want it to start from x -5 y -5 or something like that

8795950
comparator	icomparer
in your case you should either create an icomparer object or have your stuff object implement comparator or if possible

8796021
hash	md5
md5 creates a hash of it

8796043
width	height
that icon that is popping up is an image tag without a valid source attribute or valid height width attributes

8796043
width	height
the most probable reason you only see the icon in internet explorer is because the other browsers don t show an icon when an image cannot be found unless you specify width and height attributes for the image

8796088
width	height
the map container requires a width and height to correctly display the map but it seems the animations are interfering with the values

8796088
width	height
the map works when the browser is resized as the width and height are correctly set and the resize event is raised

8796091
lisp	scheme
this is not out of any difficulty using clojure just in the fact that clojure is gratuitously inconsistent with common lisp and scheme

8796105
solrj	rsolr
so if you want to use embedded solr you ll have to use solrj or somehow adapt sunspot to use solrj instead of rsolr

8796116
colorbox	jcarousel
i have problems laying out the jcarousel pager which i m using along with colorbox on a drupal site

8796120
operands	decrement
the increment decrement operators can be applied before prefix or after postfix the operands

8796183
recvfrom	datagram
you are correct that a single call to recvfrom will return at most one udp datagram

8796183
recvfrom	datagram
so never assume that a sendto will necessarily result in a recvfrom and try to keep your datagram small less than 1400 bytes is fairly safe less than 512 bytes is very safe

8796226
freebsd	linux
you ll probably get better results if you compile your code in 64-bit mode supported on linux osx and freebsd but not windows yet since 64-bit address space is much more sparse

8796239
free	malloc
remember how much care it took to deal with malloc free or with threads

8796264
cgpoint	cgsize	cgpoint	cgrect	cgsize	cgrect
a cgrect is made up of cgpoint origin and cgsize size

8796265

8796370
imageview	imageswitcher
i was inflating the imageview in the imageswitcher from xml layouts but this doesn t seem to work

8796382
udp	tcp
this is one of the trickier differences between tcp and udp

8796383
for-loop	arrays
if you would move the declaration of your arrays into the for-loop all would go as expected

8796389
requestfactory	gwt
however we would like to send whole entities from the server to the client serialized by the gwt requestfactory

8796390
int	double
you shouldn t implicitly cast double to single precision float ing point just like you can t implicitly convert from long to int because you ll lose precision

8796396
udp	tcp
in tcp this is built into the transport protocol that s one of the differences between tcp and udp

8796396
udp	tcp
in udp you are forgoing the overhead of tcp but if you need reliable messaging your server is still sending something back to the client

8796401
udp	tcp
as an additional note my suspicion is that you d need to indulge yourself in some pretty sophisticated benchmarks before you could conclude that udp is actually going to have higher performance than tcp for web services

8796401
udp	tcp
i suspect that the reason udp is available as a transport binding is not because of any superior performance characteristics but to provide an alternative for the corner case of scenarios where tcp for whatever bizarre environmental reason isn t available

8796409
width	height
if your #image_wrapper doesn t need to be a specific height or aspect ratio you can take inspiration from the responsive web design movement and allow the image to scale its width to 100 of its containing element

8796451
public	protected
public protected package private and private

8796453
rss	feed

8796454
post	get
i need to get post by custom category id sort by custom field value and with another custom field if this field exists

8796504
interpolation	splines
whether splines or linear trapezodial interpolation is a better fit will depend heavily on your problem

8796554
postgresql	mysql
my first instinct is to check that the index is actually in place on the heroku side but i m not sure quite how to do that - in any case i have a feeling it s more to do with the fact that mysql and postgresql don t do things quite the same way

8796609
hide	show
loop through all checkboxes to make a list of the classes to be show then loop through the elements checking each one to see if it has one of those classes and hide or .show as appropriate

8796623
hide	show
you can then hide all and show the ones that meet the selector

8796642
min	max	range	min	range	max
it just occurred to me to make the above more efficient is to use the first table command to generate the data itself as well and not just find the max min of the plot range

8796645
integer	fractions
add the integer fractions parts of the months to get a correct value

8796667
jlist	jtree
combine that sample code with the swing jtree tutorial and a reference to the treeselectionlistener interface which is the equivalent of the listselectionlistener which i used in my answer since that code uses a jlist instead of a jtree and you should be able to complete your requirement

8796680
button	checkbox
i am using a simple prop call to change the state of a jqueryui toggle button aka checkbox using this

8796682
ceil	floor
but my problem is this k-means produce clusters of roughly the same size where i need the clusters to be exactly the same size or to be more precise i need them to have a size between floor n k and ceil n k

8796709
rss	feed
i would like to have a lotus notes email auto-generated and sent to a specific lotus notes account whenever new items are detected via an rss feed subscribed to on the ui sidebar

8796711
put	get
datetime type is not modified by mysql meaning that if you put a date in the database you get the same

8796711
integer	unsigned
by default an unsigned integer is int 10 meaning you can store numbers up to 4294967295 but it s limits are not fixed so we can easily change int 10 int to int 16 bigint

8796730
post	get
no post get values are never null

8796740
nsurl	nsstring
i declared two nsstring and nsurl variable in interface of my controller

8796742
put	get
the trend is to put most production functions in the cloud or at least start that way until you get too big or need some services they can t provide

8796779
rss	feed
i m creating an rss feed for a site

8796791
trie	tree
instead there comes a point much earlier where a trie or a ternary tree become better options

8796826
width	height
each of this images should be placed in any inline-block container which has a static width and enougn height for images to scroll up and down

8796855
width	height
the width of the resized image is correct but no matter what i do the height is 75px

8796873
rss	feed
as the rss feed reader in the sidebar is an as is component you can t modify what you would like to have is not doable

8796889
google-chrome	safari
my guess is that the more recent version included with google-chrome as opposed to safari 5.1 can do inference for constructor declarations like

8796896
width	height
this would stretch the height but you can change it around easily to work the other way and stretch the width with something like this which is i believe what you want to do

8796904
fileoutputstream	printwriter
every time i write to a file do i close the fileoutputstream and printwriter after each iteration of the loop or is it more efficient to keep them open and close them when the thread terminates

8796935
junit	testng
i couldnâ t find a way to run it as testng tc on aix env so i tried to run it as junit tc using junit runner

8796936
shadowing	named
the identifiers are derived from the generator s input so i m concerned about named collisions specifically unintentional shadowing between scopes which the generator can t detect

8796951
post	get
after our silverlight application makes it s login post the next get that we send fails with a notfoundexception

8796951
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i have tested now with silverlight 4 as well as google-chrome firefox opera and safari and ie9 sl5 is the only bad combination

8796951
content-length	content-type
notice that the content-type and content-length are identical even though

8796951
content-length	content-type
you aren t allowed to use content-type or content-length on a get

8796951
post	get	content-length	content-type
you get redirected back to the index page and that get still contains the content-type and content-length from the post and so it fails

8796969
portrait	landscape
it will be used on phone browsers so when the orientation flips from landscape to portrait the javascript subtraction needs to stay true whilst allowing the percentage widths to adjust

8797002
post	get
so thing is i want the post which contain the link to get deleted from there after a limited time

8797023
python-mode	pymacs
i install pymacs manually the python part and i use the pymacs package in the elpa s python-mode it contains pymacs.el then this two conflict i remove the pymacs in python-mode it works well.maybe you are the same error.or you should check your python version

8797042
inherited	properties
i have a very simple class that has a single properties and which inherited inotifypropertychanged

8797116
gmp	bigint
however based on your comments you might be looking for a bigint library like gmp

8797120
integer	unsigned
your question is a bit unclear but intmax_t is the largest signed integer-valued type and uintmax_t is the largest unsigned integer type

8797122
post	get
you would need to build your own framework to wrap up the http get post delete commands to the graph api

8797149
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

width	height
now comes the cropping part shows a different part of the image with the correct width height

8797207
touchesmoved	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesmoved
i don t know why you didn t split the method and put the code into the touchesbegan touchesmoved touchesended methods

8797211
integer	unsigned
the data type with the longest printed string is a signed data type unless you have an integer type that has a maximum unsigned value that is one digit longer than the maximum signed value

8797211
int	chars
for example a 4-bit int unsigned would be at most two chars unsigned or one chars plus the negative sign when signed

8797245
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome connection is good

8797329
google-chrome	firefox
you should realize that under firefox and google-chrome the socket.io module works fine because they use the best of the best websockets

8797335
memcpy	malloc
i am not going to use ctypes memcpy malloc etc

8797339
post	get
the reason you get an undefined value is because you post to a non-valid jquery mobile page

8797361
profiling	instrumentation
it is however mentioned in the opengl es analyzer one of the instrumentation available when profiling from xcode

8797457
mosync	marmalade

jqgrid	jquery-ui-autocomplete
i need a jquery-ui-autocomplete that only does one call to the server then stores locally and uses the returned array in subsequent calls in a jqgrid

8797482
setinterval	settimeout
the first parameter to settimeout or setinterval needs to be a reference to a function or a string but you don t want to use the string syntax

8797535
versioning	upgrade
encouraging people to upgrade to newer versioning of tls and ditch ssl actually would help here

8797535
versioning	upgrade
it seems here that ssl tls is victim of stagnation when it comes to versioning upgrade

8797535
versioning	upgrade
this is of course more problematic than other pieces of software because the remote party which may be an online customer you have never met would often have to upgrade their versioning of ssl tls too

8797569
versioning	upgrade
also make sure you downloaded the correct upgrade package related to your previous versioning

8797583
content-disposition	content-type	content-disposition	content-length	content-length	content-type
each of the parts can have its own headers describing the content of the part content-type content-length content-disposition etc

8797587
width	height
i have a cck content type which is composed of node title color width height comment

8797594
inherited	properties
i would suggest first checking what inherited this properties is following and if you still have problems i would then create separate divs for help and instructions where instructions has a different right margin

8797605
gtk	gdk
i wonder if the extra gtk and gdk in your add-system-includes might be the problem

8797608
post	get
i saw this previous post but i have not been able to adapt the answer to get my code to work

8797618
put	get
it reuses the same http commands used for serving web pages head put get etc.

8797628

in order to get value equality you need to either pass an to the contains extension method which does the equality or override equals and gethashcode for the equality.limit type

8797715
children	parent
unfortunately did not work then i tried invoking click on all and any of the divs parent children of the above code with no luck at all

8797727
margin	height
set an interval to verify it a couple of miliseconds later until the height is restored and the lower margin is correct

8797731
cpython	pypy
so how is it possible for pypy to be faster than cpython also becomes fairly obvious

8797778

8797854
getter	setter
the backing field can be manipulated in the getter setter to meet validation and verification requirements without affecting other bits of the library or assembly

8797854
getter	setter
so as a general rule you can initially declare your properties using the automatic syntax with a view towards fleshing them out with getter setter when intervention is needed

8797855
folder	directory
it includes both local and roaming active directory folder

8797860
persistent	transient
in hibernate every non static non transient property field or method depending on the access type of an entity is considered persistent unless you annotate it as transient

8797893
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
as another alternative you could write it using fileoutputstream to a temp file as created by file#createtempfile so that you can obtain its size by file#length and use fileinputstream to stream it directly into the outputstream of the response the usual way

8797904
width	margin
just create two div s as columns around both sides then set both those sides to a specific width then play around with the padding and margin til you get what you want

8797906
width	height
i would like to play around with coding an application that could capture a desktop or section of a screen height and width variables for resolution and stream those to an rtmp server rtmp server.com live

8803887
width	height
building on your comment the image will distort as it will draw the image into the rectangle specified and if the new dimensions are not the same aspect ratio the width height as the original image then it will appear distorted

8803887
width	height
you need some logic to ensure that your new width and height have the same aspect ratio for example

8803887
width	height
you will likely want to put some extra logic in there to either create a new width given the height or new height given the width depending on which dimension was the largest change

as long as your pojos are annotated with stateless stateful it should be fine

8804724
translation	globalization
i m not 100 sure that with globalization you refer to translation though

8804729
libjpeg	libpng
edit the reason this questions seems to arise often for opencv as opposed to other libraries is that it changes rather dramatically and fast between versions and many of the operations are not so well-defined well-constrained so you can t just rely on it to be a black-box like you do for something like libpng or libjpeg

8804733
emacs	gedit
i tried opening the resulting file worldcitiespop.txt using gedit and emacs

8805167
preventdefault	onkeydown
handle onkeydown then preventdefault on it

8805175
octal	decimal
chmod traditionally takes numerical values in octal so if you want to enable all access rights you use 0777 decimal value 511

8805175
octal	decimal
you re passing in 777 and parsing it as a decimal value with atoi so you end up with octal value 1411 which is probably an error because it s greater than 0777

8805178
preventdefault	onkeyup
just add an onkeyup down-eventlistener to your html page and if the pressed key is that you want to ignore you just preventdefault

look which is this width calculate or use a tool like firebug and then calculate the 3 1 aspect ratio and apply a height in pixels

8805276
firefox	safari
it s not very clean because it uses an image but its author says it works for firefox 3.5 safari 4 and internet explorer 7 8

8805276
width	height
you should look which is the width of your div for different windows width calculate the aspect ratio in each case and apply it to the height

8805334

portrait	landscape
but when i launch my application in landscape mode views are not adjusted instead they take positioning of portrait view

8805399
portrait	landscape
but again when i rotate in portrait and then landscape it works all right

8805405
button	checkbox
like the comments say you re better of getting serialisation to work with radio button than messing around with checkbox

when i get filechannel from fileinputstream i found i can use position method to freely move file pointer

8805516

you can put that in a httpd.conf or in the root .htaccess but really consider removing all .htaccess it s bad it s slow it s sad that you do not have access to the real configuration files

8805528
hash	salt
i would suggest that for passwords at least you can use a one-way hash you can make it a lot hard to brute force attack the hash if you make use of a salt

8805528
hash	salt
ideally a separate random salt should be used for each password password+salt hash

8805528
hash	salt
you need to store the salt as well as the hash but it can be stored in plain-text as it is not cryptographically secret

8805536

8805715
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome has some support for it and i think firefox might have some now

8805725
post	put	post	get	put	get
from an interface design standpoint you want user-agents to make post and put and delete more difficult than get or at least distinctly different so that users can rely on that difference to hint when their actions might cause a change in the resource state because they are responsible for those changes

8805752
pull	push
this is rather earlier than doing it solely on push pull but might be useful to you

8805808

8805915
button	checkbox
bare in mind that i m listening to checkbox but is should be perfectly straight forward to adapt to a radio button group

8805927
width	margin
you can apply a margin to offset one column to another columns width but i find that to just be messy and there could still be problems with poor css implementations in browsers as much as i say i don t support ie6 anymore it s still used by our visitors enough to need to support it

8805927
min	max
your 2 columns will re-size with your browser until you hit the min max pixel value

8805935

8806356
processors	hyperthreading	cpu	processors	cpu	hyperthreading
the sort being likely to be bound only on cpu and memory there probably won t be much to gain after 1 thread per core or at most 1 thread per virtual processors if hyperthreading

8806358
google-chrome	firefox
it will fail on due to the trailing comma where firefox and google-chrome will ignore the error

8806387
free	malloc
otherwise you assign the same pointer to all elements of ptr leak the malloc ed memory and try to free things you haven t malloc ed

8806388
src	attr
you could extract the src attribute directly from each image using the jquery attr function append characters to it like _b and is it on hover

8806395
memcached	apc
plus you should be able to cache any of the heavy lifting in something like apc or memcached based on a user identifier rather than session reducing the work required to recreate a session while ensuring authentication verified in each request

8806399
pull	push
theyâ ll also set the branch up to track origin experiment so push and pull will be to and from that remote branch

8806940
min	max
i assume 10.1.2012 means january 10th thus your slider would have min 0 and max 9

8806947
accessor	properties
in a properties accessor yes those are the same

8806952
for-loop	arrays
you should store all your image views in a list or arrays implement the onclicklistener rather than using it as an anonymous inner class and add them in a for-loop something like this

8806970
google-chrome	firefox
but this innertext is not supported in any other standard compliant browser firefox google-chrome

8806978
width	height
now the svg files have a viewbox with fixed values in pixels and then width and height set at 100 to make it possible to scale the image by scaling the wrapping object element

8806978
width	height
so i use jquery to set the width height isn t needed for most browsers at first to 50

8806978
width	height
the only thing that seems to work in safari is to set it to a fixed pixel value for both width and height

8806978
width	height
these get fixed pixel values in width and height which doesn t work for scaling in most browsers i have learned

8806978
width	height
so i have search-replaced the width and height attributes using xpath to 100 values

8806978
width	height
so here s one where i have done both the save for web and devices to try to fix the artboard and also changed the width and height to 100

width	height
and here s one different image with the width and height values changed to 100 but without doing the save for web and devices command

8807035
hide	show
try this using jquery toggle method which can take a boolean flag whether to show or hide the element

8807038

8813428
vbo	vao
in general a vao just stores attributes and all their settings bound vbo stride offset etc. and automatically binds the attributes when bound

8813509

8820062
min	max
you should then search between the last valid value and the next factor of two to find the true min max value but this gives you a good starting point

if uipopovercontroller causes you some kind of problem i d put the sidebar in its own uiwindow and float that over the main window

8820345
uiview	uiwindow
another thought that comes to mind and i ve used in the past is a uiview that you add to directly to the uiwindow from any view will get you the main one

8820345

so to produce same hash string and compare with input you have to know what the salt text is for a given user

8820660
hash	salt
then using this salt text and password coming from login you should generate apr1-md5 hash

8820660
hash	salt
so you can send salt and text and get password hash

8820660
hash	salt
if password is correct the newly created hash string by using the salt text in password.txt will be the same with password.txt

i m actually trying to calculate the distance between the max and min point in the x and y coordinates for the mkmappoints

8821120

8821444
hide	show
when image is clicked it hide the image and show a gif loading bar

8821444
hide	show
after script is run it should hide the gif image and show success message

8821456
folder	directory
by default it will look in a folder called views from the directory the script is

8821459
inherited	subclassing
in this case i suggest having a base abstract activity and two concrete inherited subclassing

8821459
superclass	subclassing
doing that is in my opinion a lot better than having a concrete subclassing to a concrete superclass that can lead to many problems and is usually difficult to debug

8821463
spaces	delimiter
basically i have a field which contains some codes delimiter by a spaces like so abc def ghi

8821519
width	height
now the container completely fills the width and height of the document and just scrolls the scrollable portion of the page while keeping the sections that op wanted available

8821521
folder	directory
the stylesheet is located in the ckedit_custom folder which is in the site s root directory

8821531

why don t you base64 the parameters and put that in the get request and do a simple

8821717
pycharm	komodo
i tried using emacs and komodo but finally settled for pycharm

8821748
min	max
any points x for which c_m x is positive are candidates for a local min max

8821748
min	max
you can do this in a way similar to binarys search if you want more points make m min + m 2 and if you want fewer points make m max + m 2 adjusting min and max accordingly

8821788
getter	setter
it works great for pod types although the declaration syntax is of course not nearly as terse as c# but i can t think of a way to have the getter return something other than the stored object type likewise the setter must take exactly the stored type

8821798
junit	mockito
i use junit and mockito

8821822
put	get
if i put try catch block i get _jsonobject def is not a jsonobject _ exception but execution doesn t continue

8821838

inherited	properties
if you are working with wpf and mainwindow inherited window then you need to set something within the content properties

postgresql	mysql
it was never designed to be a full-fledged database solution but rather a speedy database to handle data for which larger database solutions like postgresql and mysql would be overkill

8822212
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it only works in the newest versions of firefox google-chrome safari and ie

8822233
int	boolean
then you can use setitemchecked int index boolean checked on your list

8822317

in google-chrome firefox it works well but in ie when i over the li element of the menu it disappeared

8822337
width	height
apply the styles regarding display display float width height to the li element instead of the anchor

8822354

8822455
hash	salt
if the data is sensitive you ll probably want to keep it server-side or hash it with a salt and then insert the hash value into the script

8822455
hash	salt
of course this hash is rather unusable client-side because you must not include your salt in anything client-side this would defeat the purpose of obfuscating the data in the first place

8822530
width	height
to fix this you will have to calculate and set the dimensions the height and width of the layoutparams of your button views calling buttonview.layout will not do this

8822541
post	get
see this post for more details and great examples on how to get started

8822551
int	chars
1 if the only values that can be stored in this field are the five specified in the query it might make sense to replace the chars field with five int fields each a flag for the specified condition - ie

8822558
hash	md5
other hash functions such as sha-1 also have hash collisions although it is much less likely than md5

8822590
sorting	filtering
everything works fine - the data is loaded in the table sorting and filtering is working etc

8822601

you can t give it a width of 100 and a margin and expect it to not push out the parent div

8822792
folder	dir
now even after i delete the file when i go to localhost a page is shown which was the index page when c99shell.php was present in the folder which is different from the one which is currently on my www dir

8822792
folder	directory
now if i make a folder inside the www directory and then create new files then when i go to localhost folder_name i get the correct files

8822800
width	height
if you can t make sure you set its width and height properties to 100

i understand i can try to put my json object into a query string and call my .ashx page but the json object could get large so i m trying to use the request.form of a post

8822855
post	get
if i make a post to the .ashx file from jquery and send my json object through i get a response which contains the data in a string rather than getting a .csv

8822864
put	get
to get past your current compiler error you ll need to put the directivehash.put end new endstatement

8822897
post	get
when i post to the graph api i get back an error or the id of the post

8822959
public	protected
the first point rules out locking on anything that is either visible or which could be made visible a private instance that is returned by a protected or public member should be considered public as far as this analysis goes anything captured by a delegate could end up elsewhere and so on

8822997
getter	setter
have setter getter for these fields on your class

8823071

opera	firefox
i ve made this sort of form in css html the form itself works but the awkward thing is that in only opera and firefox the background image lostpass.jpg is shown fully

8823323
google-chrome	safari
other browsers like safari google-chrome rockmelt only show partially..i m obviously doing something not really right here s the code

8823419

cfstring	nsstring
i understand this is a bad idea and won t be pursuing it so please refrain from pointing this out but along the way i discovered that classes such as nsdictionary and nsstring that are toll-free bridged with core foundation counterparts such as cfdictionary and cfstring do not call -dealloc upon final release

8827989

i changed the uinavigationcontroller in the storyboard to point to a basic uiviewcontroller and then for that to have a button that segued to another uiviewcontroller

8828031
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
that is when i remembered that i was programatically filling in the objects in the uitabbarcontroller and that i wasn t invoking the uinavigationcontroller but skipping that and invoking the uitableviewcontroller

8828057
submit	submission
that s because the submit event is called over and over again but is preventing the submission because of preventdefault

i noticed this in safari firefox and google-chrome

8828141
ant	maven
so you re stuck with two options use ant or maven but from what i ve read maven is not all that good with modules either or set up individual run configurations for each of the modules and link them directly within fdt via the launcher chain tab in the run configurations panel

8828153
client-side	server-side
however the user who asked that question only needed client-side hooks and i m looking for a git host that allows you to configure server-side hooks

8828154
pop-up	dialog
i want a jquery ui dialog to pop-up and halt when the admin user clicks on the delete buttton asking for confirmation

8828154
pop-up	dialog
the problem is that the jquery dialog window did pop-up but instead of halting and waiting for user to react it soon disappeared

8828201
int	double
so my code is full of typecasts between int s float s and double s

8828215
google-chrome	firefox
both firefox and google-chrome display the red line so i assume it is rendered as intended

8828241
superclass	subclassing
i always assumed that you need to use virtual in the superclass and override in the subclassing if you want overriding of a method however i tried removing the keywords and the program compiled fine

8828250
uiview	subviews
i have a toolbar object that inherits from uiview and is a subviews of canvasview on the bottom of the screen on an ipad app

however icons do not show in webkit based browsers on mac os x google-chrome 9 and safari 5 when there is only one preceding space

8828431
int	double
converting between float and int is relatively expensive whereas converting between float and double is cheap

8828431
int	double
float double and int multiplications have the same performance use the right type of number for your app no worries

8828438
folder	directory
remember if you remove the folder name from directory it won t be explore by os.walk

8828443
typebuilder	reflection.emit
i would point you to the msdn documentation for typebuilder for an example of creating a type using reflection.emit

8828444
opera	firefox
short of intercepting the back button and then applying the effect you want to achieve with jquery this is quite likely by design for firefox opera tested in v11.60 on windows xp and

my client has a mac and has tried with google-chrome and safari and i have linux and have tried it in google-chrome and firefox

8828586
spaces	delimiter
from your description of the format it isn t clear to me if the string and what follows the string are delimiter by a whitespace spaces tab etc.

8828605
dictionary	map
oh and even if they were not the order of elements in a php array a map or a dictionary is up to the implementation so while you ll get the id with php is allowed to shuffle the array around

8828741
min	max
the min is 0 and the max is 100 and i coded it so that if the value reaches above 100 make the value equal 100

8828753
width	height
i m trying to figure out how to get the x and y coords of the frames of an animated sprite sheet by giving it the frame width height rows columns and framecount

8828757
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome and safari do not have this problem

8828757
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the above works fine as stated in firefox safari and google-chrome

8828824
width	height
i am running into the following problem i give my function a height and width of 300 and 200 respectively

8828824
width	height
now the original images are not that ratio so i would like to be able to resize the original to a maximum width of 200 or a max height of 300

8828824
width	height
so for example if i have a 1200h x 1000w image i want to resize it to a height of 240px and 200px because in this case 200px was my maximum allowed width

8828824
width	height
and if i had an image that is 480h x 300w my new image would be resized to 300px height and 187px width because 300px is my maximum height and this brings me below the maximum allowed width

8828875
folder	directory
how do i get it back like i dont want the folder i want the files in the folder the whole eclipse directory set-up thanks so much

8828897
put	get

pop-up	dialog
my problem seems to be the notifications i sent via the app requests dialog using the sdk don t seem to show up in the notifications pop-up in the native facebook android app but i can see them fine if i login via the facebook website

8828958
squash	merge
well you can use git rebase -i to enter interactive rebase mode where you can pick which commits you want to keep which you want to merge squash and which to completely remove so the changes applied by that commit are removed from the repo

8828973
ostream	istream
i consider this overload to be pretty dangerous the istream one even more so than the ostream one actually consider the following

8828973
std	ostream	ostream	istream
the above example might look contrived but it shouldn t be too hard to get into this situation in generic code or when passing the to a function that provides an lvalue and an rvalue overload and stores the std ostream or std istream in different ways according to the overload

8828979
getter	setter
i ve tried many things here such as creating a getter and setter that passes the value onto the notepad class but have discovered that they don t work due to the setup of my program

8829012
put	get
but i get invalid or mismatching start and end times no matter what time i put in there

8829037
postgresql	mysql
in mysql this is an incredibly difficult problem but in postgresql oracle it is relatively simple and can be solved with windowing functions

8829038
hide	show
the current code only show enddate s datepicker and it will hide when i click the other input

8829068
getter	setter
since there is only one elvis you could have made weight a static variable with static getter and setter

8829075
width	height
if you know the width and height of the frames how many frames per row there are and which frame you want than getting the x and y coordinates is fairly simple

8829078
cpython	pypy
there are several approaches for it from using numpy cpython a c extension running your program using pypy instead of the standard cpython and even take a look at corepy - what you should not do is to have a numeric intensive task running in pure python if performance is an issue there

8829098
gridview	sqldatasource
i want to pass a appsetting value and sqldatasource value into gridview to generate a url for user to click

8829117
postgresql	mysql
i understand that the group_by selector is understood differently by mysql and postgresql thanks to questions posted here

8829117
postgresql	mysql
however try as i might i can t get the following seemingly simple query to work with the heroku postgresql db while it works fine in my development mysql environment

8829119
put	get
the problem occurs when i try to get them back as i put them into the dictionary with the code below

8829121
subtract	add
with the code i have below i can manually add 1 to var1 and var2 or subtract 1 when needed save and refresh the browser to get the effect i am looking for

8829157
uitableview	uisegmentedcontrol
consider placing a uisegmentedcontrol with 3 segments on the top of the main uiview and placing a uitableview below it

8829162
width	height
i ve run into problems when using single quotes instead of doubles and also when not setting the width and height of the top svg element

8829174
webclient	webrequest	webclient	httpwebrequest
while using any of webclient webrequest or httpwebrequest like so

8829180
int	chars
so i was thinking that instead of using an int type i could store their value in a short or even better in a chars and access and compute the values on the device using the same type

8829202
inherited	subclassing
but the certain way he subclassing it gives us a pattern that can be used without subclassing you can define a class that holds an dictionary and an array but inherited from nsobject

8829210
int	chars
you need to scan the string to find the u part then extract the following four chars into a separate string then use integer.parseint string s int radix with a radix of 16 to convert 00c1 to an int and then cast that int to chars

8829256
min	max
not specifying min or max leaves the result ambiguous which is why postgresql rejects it

8829297
diffmerge	winmerge
i like sourcegear diffmerge cos it s free but araxis beyond compare and winmerge will all work just as well

8829315
folder	directory
example which copies all xml png and json files from one directory to another maintaining folder structure

8829321
implements	extends
if so you can create an abstract class and then extends it implements an abstract method you created

8829329
pull	push
push vs pull is not much different as far as cpu load on the server as far as i know

8829330
put	get
i put in the correct info and get an invalid login also if i don t put anything in there i get an invalid login

8829332
maven	pom.xml
when building a jar maven writes the pom.xml and a pom.properties file into directory

8829332
maven	pom.xml
maven will substitute in the version read out of the pom.xml and your application then just needs to read the version.properties resource and query the version key

8829336
portrait	landscape
i would like to display a uitableviewcontroller within a uipopovercontroller but the catch here is that i would like to have the uitableviewcontroller displayed in a landscape orientation even though the viewcontroller which is displaying the uipopovercontroller is in portrait orientation

8829340
rss	feed
i m using rapturexml to parse an rss feed from usgs

8829394
jquery	curvycorners
my understanding is by doing the above i m using curvycorners only for that specific selector and nothing else but that messes my other page that uses another jquery plugin multiselect dropdowns

8829435
ant	maven
integrate your old ant build in maven you can call directly some ant snippets or complete ant build from maven

8829435
ant	maven
this would yield you a hybrid build system which is probably not the best but still would allow you some leeway in your migration process and manage older ant scripts slowly migrating slices of functionality over to maven

8829435
ant	maven
not that it s not necessarily bad per say to have a mix of the two just that maven provides a lot of hard wired or quasi hard wired configuration convention that the ant script could interfere with

8829435
ant	maven
drive your maven build from ant you can also do the opposite that is drive the maven build process from ant thus keeping control on how you call your other system

8829435
ant	maven
by integrating the right things such as properties or filter you can ensure maven generates the necessary artifact from a specific project that you can use at later time within your ant script

8829451
google-chrome	safari
with safari and google-chrome in the example if you select without opening the drop down and i press a letter key on the keyboard the value in the select box if rotating among the value that begin with that letter as expected

8829495
children	parent
i realized that to preserve the order as given by the op and as i needed neither a simple queue as jon used nor stack would work since all the parent objects would be yielded first and then any children after them or vice-versa

8829565
rvm	bundler
from usr local rvm gems ruby-1.9.2-p290 rails3tutorial gems bundler-1.0.21 lib bundler runtime.rb 68 in block 2 levels in require

devices with screens ldpi mdpi and hdpi

8829597
margin	height	width	height	width	margin
i seem to have found a weird edge case where it seems that a child element is using the parent width as a top margin percentage instead of the height

8829597
width	height
if so why would the height ever derive from the width

8829618
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
you should just append new url to astr inside loops and split it into arrays after the for-loop

8829637
portrait	landscape
actually iam forcing my phonegap app for android version to be in portrait mode only but i was given requirement that one screen is to be in landscape mode

8829645
inherited	properties
if you want gamma and beta to share some properties methods without inherited then choose another pattern such as encapsulation or composition and use interfaces

8829649
mouseleave	mouseenter
i make it work using mouseenter and mouseleave check this fiddle

8829710
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
it s work when i play in notebook safari firefox but not work when i play on ipad2 safari or samsung galaxy opera

8829822
nsstring	nsdata
if the arrayâ s contents are all property list objects nsstring nsdata nsarray or nsdictionary objects the file written by this method can be used to initialize a new array with the class method arraywithcontentsoffile or the instance method initwithcontentsoffile

8829875
spaces	delimiter
change the comma and spaces in the line set the text item delimiter of applescript to to return

8829897
requestfactory	gwt
starting with gwt 2.4 requestfactory interfaces must be validated before they can be used by the requestfactory server code or jvm-based clients

8829915
single-quotes	double-quotes
also try to use single-quotes when writing regex patterns because double-quotes allow escape sequences and single quotes won t interpret escape sequence

8829923
google-chrome	firefox
it breaks the sandbox model -- javascript in google-chrome firefox etc. executes in a security sandbox and there are lots of things it can t do

8829967
eigenvalue	diagonal
a â a diagonal matrix with a s eigenvalue on the main diagonal

8830061
subtraction	addition
due to the existence of the date time and datetime cross-type addition and subtraction operators i would think that this is fine so long as it is well defined

8830061
min	max
i was going to suggest the following as well but time has very specific min and max values for hour minute second and microsecond thus requiring a silent wraparound of values or returning of a different type

8830079
lsp	principles
this is generally speaking a violation of many oop principles one of them being lsp or liskov substitution principles

8830097
put	get
my main problem is to get the webpages url out from the intraweb web application and i do not want to put all the browser s storage code inside the template files

8830105
portrait	landscape
while changing the orientation from portrait to landscape my widget size is reducing

8830114
qtkit	quicktime
i m trying to use qtkit to convert a list of images to a quicktime movie

8830115
hide	show
but it only show and hide the very last cell s textfield

8830117
getter	setter
have fields with getter and setter to represent each column

8830143
portrait	landscape
also make sure to test in portrait and landscape unless if your app is limited to a single app including transitions mid activity

8830173
qpainter	qimage
the easy way is to grab the image in opencv and display in qt using qimage and qpainter - the 24bit rgb888 format of qimage is compatible with opencv s cv_8uc3

8830214
windows	wow64
on windows this is achieved via the wow64 subsystem

8830214
x86	64bit
in visual studio a program compiled for x86 is a 32-bit program and a program compiled for x64 is a 64bit program specifically an x86-64 program

8830228
post	get
the delete is not a supported option for button_to only post and get are

8830238
portrait	landscape
since for portrait and landscape mode i have different layout so i am changing layout in onconfigurationchanged method

8830238
portrait	landscape
but the problem is when i change orientation my spinner is recreated so if spinner is open in portrait mode it get close in landscape mode.my requirement is if it is open in any mode it should be open after orientation change.can you please let me know how to handle this situation

8830253
hide	show
that s why you show hide the only text field

8830265
width	height
all the width and height just for demo you should use your onw values as required.

8830287
x86	64bit
visual studio will run on x86 and x64 systems and is capable of generating 32-bit and 64bit programs regardless of the os platform

8830315
apache	nginx
another possible reason is that you use rvm on your local machine but for servers for example passenger + nginx apache rvm may not work well actually i m always getting errors using passenger + rvm

8830318
google-chrome	firefox
it works well in google-chrome firefox ie8 ie9 but it doesn t work in ie6 ie7

8830319
letter-spacing	fontfamily
now the first selector is for any heading with common properties such as fontfamily letter-spacing etc

8830338
allocator	stl
yes that is one of the purposed designs of the stl that memory allocated by one allocator can be deallocated by another

8830415
backbone.js	javascriptmvc
however if you re going to be doing this a lot and the changes to each instance are complex i d look into using a javascript templating system or an javascriptmvc framework like backbone.js

8830416
width	height
always returns a origin height width of zero i suspect because it did not synthesise correctly

8830489
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i d suggest setting the delegate to nil in your viewwilldisappear implementation and setting it in viewwillappear instead of viewdidload

8830494
put	get
we don t need to manually append a as whatever we put in that part of the expression will automatically get appended to the list so the final expression is

8830511
post	get
all get s and old-school form post from application a to b connect to the same session #202 on session b

8830520
hash	md5
then compute the md5 hash of

8830520
hash	md5
to validate it remove the hash from the end compute the md5 hash by concatenating what s left with the secret and if the hash match the field hasn t been tampered with

8830570
put	get
i get a out put like this

8830577
pop-up	dialog
but i also want to pop-up a jquery dialog window when the jquery user input validation fails

8830577
pop-up	dialog
the problem is that the jquery dialog window did not pop-up

8830626
google-chrome	firefox
in my tests in google-chrome firefox and internet explorer the issue did not happen calling the code below in a page with external javascript files

8830628
http	spdy
anything that you do with http is more or less equivalent with spdy and neither is really anything but an implementation detail of your soa work

8830666
public	protected
so in rails 2.x you mark those as protected or private something not public

8830751
hide	show
after reloading the tableview check the condition in cellforrowatindexpath either pass the value of self.editing to textfield which makes it hide show

8830752
width	height
i set the height and width of a div by calculating window.height and window.width properties and then assigning the values to the div

8830765
google-chrome	firefox
it looks fine in firefox and google-chrome

8830769
screens	tablet
fragments should help make the code more re-usable and support tablet views and smaller screens views phones easier

8830772
getter	setter
i have been taught to always use getter and setter

8830784
put	get
so i d like to capture that myimage text and use it in my new string - then get rid of all the cid stuff and put the standard path in

8830828
getter	setter
the idea of getter and setter are to control access to variables in a class

8830828
getter	setter
if you didn t use a getter and a setter you would have to track down every use of the class and convert there

8830828
getter	setter
if you used a getter and a setter you can just change those methods and everything that uses the class won t break

8830851
put	get
i put my button in the table view cell but i can t figure out how to get it set to the proper class in the file owner

8830860
portrait	landscape
and also the simulator automatically change to portrait and automatically return to landscape mode

8830873
getter	setter
there is nothing wrong with using getter and setter - just be aware that by using them and making them all public you re exposing your variables and in a way violating encapsulation

8830873
getter	setter
this is what the article you mention is trying to warn of - don t just automatically generate getter and setter for all private instance variables

8830873
public	protected
think about what you want to expose to other classes and at what level private protected public so that you re exposing only as needed

8830909
getter	setter
like u can get user entered data from form by using getter and u can use the same data to insert into database by using setter and vice verca

8830930
inherited	subclassing
basically you only want to use inherited to enforce an is-a relationship - what this means is that your subclassing should be substitutable for your base class in all situations

8830931
mouse	keyboard
keyboard shortcuts galore - i seldom touched the mouse while developing using phpstorm that s what i didn t like about coda

8830959
post	get
if you were using .skip and .take to get a paged list of blog post you were already doing it right

8830968
uiview	subviews
how to reposition uiview keeping its subviews at same position before reposition

8830968
uiview	subviews
when i move the uiview its subviews are also getting moved.how can i avoid that

8830984
arraylist	treeset	treemap	treeset
the persistent collections injected by hibernate behave like hashmap hashset treemap treeset or arraylist depending on the interface type

8831007
for-loop	arrays
i m assuming you re setting these values by key and then trying to iterate through the arrays with something like a for-loop - but while you can set values by key because in javascript an arrays is just another object these values won t be available in standard arrays iteration and the length of the arrays will still be 0

8831007
post	get
the .ajax method expects an object containing key value pairs and sends them to the server as a get or post parameters

8831011
parentviewcontroller	modalviewcontroller
i got dismissmodalviewcontrolleranimated to work properly on the following setup but am confused as to why it works on self the modalviewcontroller rather than the parentviewcontroller

8831022
getter	setter
getter setter tend to expose the implementation details of your class to the outside world

8831022
getter	setter
thus you will need a car class and so you expose getter and setter for the fields

8831022
getter	setter
the issue was you were solving the wrong problem with those getter setter

8831056
mouse	keyboard
these types of errors may be handled using controls like regularexpressionvalidator or code that handles the keyboard mouse stylus input

8831087
jqgrid	jqxgrid	jqgrid	datatables
my best 3 options are jqgrid jqxgrid and datatables

8831121
post	get
now if i post a request using this code the count displayed beside the apps and ganmes does get increased but when i click on apps and games to see the request sent from my site it doesn t get displayed in the list

8831124
nsstring	nsdata
if the input is an int float bool nsstring nsdata or nsdate then the easiest thing to do is to store these values in nsuserdefaults

8840219
g++	gcc
i include a lib header file that uses some c++ features such as class definitions stl string vector so i have to compile libape-spidermonkey.c using g++ instead of gcc

8840451
urllib	httplib
however i highly suggest you use requests instead of using urllib urllib2 httplib

8840479
versioning	upgrade
in short if you upgrade you versioning this issue will go away however each task will be executed serially and not concurrently

8840501
int	double
consider the following example where i have typdef ed foo to be an int and a double in the two separate functors

you can rename an extension file from .xpi to .zip extract the install.rdf file and hack the min max compatibility version though which has worked 100 of the time for me

8840577
folder	dir
howerver your best option imo is to just create a dir for your app in appdata folder and store your content there.

8840601
post	get
it connects using urlhttpconnection not by javascript s submit or ajax methods such as get or post

8840627
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
on mac it work perfectly on google-chrome safari and firefox

8840633
jobs	cron
i thought of creating cron jobs to run a message script at those specific timestamps but that seemed wrong with thousands of jobs an hour

8840650
put	get
either put your code inside the get function where you have your alert showing the correct value or make the request synchronous you ll have to look up the jquery docs because i don t use jquery

8840652
put	get
you cannot put it after the get function because it will execute too soon before the results are known

8840693
width	height
autosize is for inline ajax and html type of content where width and height are auto determined dimensions are taken from the incoming content

8840912
qpushbutton	qslider
now i would like to realize the functionality with a qslider instead of the qpushbutton

8840916
getter	setter
auto-implemented properties must auto-implement both the getter and setter

8840940
google-chrome	firefox
i am checking it in firefox and google-chrome and see that in google-chrome spacing between letter is larger than in firefox

8840947
keydown	keyup
to move the selected column use the keydown or keyup if you prefer event and place your code there

8840959
public	protected
instance variables declared in the implementation are implicitly hidden effectively private and the visibility cannot be changed - public protected and private do not produce compiler errors with the current clang at least but are ignored

8841017
postgresql	mysql
i think it s the same way with .net framework you could reference an assembly of postgresql or mysql databases and build your app based with theses libs using ado.net npgsqlconnection mysqlconnection npgsqlcommand mysqlcommand etc... to do your crud operations

8841049
button	checkbox
i need to show a checkbox or radio button checked or unchecked based on a boolean value

8841049

i m trying to pass into a stored procedure a string of words delimiter by spaces and what i d like to do is to execute selects on those words such that each subsequent select queries the result set before it

8841117
min	max
the reduce phase is all about aggregation counting averaging min max etc

8841120
post	put
so as long as the digits are at the end of the column value you can easily extract the numeric value from the column as such stackoverflow will not let me put the word union in a post - replace uuu with union

8841133
post	get
you seem to be navigating by post instead of by get

8841143
for-loop	loops
surrounding this with a for-loop and for each counting the iterations of the while loops it seems that one needs to generate on average 4.5 permutations for every valid one and 6.2 if cycles of length three are not allowed either

8841158
button	checkbox
actually i want it to make it that i can have different functions attached to each checkbox that when a user selects a checkbox or another and clicks the submit button it triggers the specific functions

8841164
jboss	weblogic
our team make migration of app from jboss 4.2 to weblogic 10.3.4

8841164
jboss	weblogic
and on jboss this works fine but on weblogic getresource return null in this case

8841210
spaces	linefeed
when using your second regexp however with the i flag removed it gives me the results i d expect if the entire text of the tested string consists of white spaces tabulation carriage return or linefeed then that entire string is returned

8841226
jboss	weblogic
on jboss this works fine but on weblogic getresource return null in this case

8841254
inherited	subclassing
they behave somewhat unintuitively with respect to inherited if you set such a variable in a base class and set it again in the subclassing then you will change the value for all classes in the hierarchy

8841336
client-side	server-side
you would probably want to filter the results out on server-side to reduce bandwidth and client-side load

8841380
width	height
i want the width and height in the player function be inalized with the width and the height of the image when the onload function is called

8841382
clearance	devise
the best way is to use devise clearance authlogic or another gem and use the examples for them

8841382
submit	submission
submit the form standard form submission and if the password change works change what you display next time around preferable through simple flags set in the controller that control what the view shows in the view form

8841382
hide	show
submit the form ajax and if the password change works use javascript say jquery to change what the view is showing - hide the password fields and show the other fields you want again setting simlpe flag to control the display in the.

8841382
hash	md5
for other readers of this answer the op probably already knows this if the password is hash for security md5 and i ll assume it is then you can t know what it is but you can hash an attempt and compare to the hash version stored in the database and if they match the user has provided they are the same

8841441
move	drag
you could make it so someone could just drag the mouse around and move the map

8841450
hash	salt
secure hash and salt for php passwords

8841458
gmail	hotmail
i made an html email which is displayed perfectly fine in gmail but with some strange hotmail errors

8841458
gmail	hotmail
this works perfectly fine in gmail but the problems occur in hotmail and since i m working on an apple without office i can t even check outlook..

8841460
hash	salt
hash values password + salt because it would take too much space

8841491
draggable	droppable
to be more specific my plugin uses jquery ui draggable and droppable

8841495
ready	each
contents of each page into the dom as you navigate and the dom ready

8841499
firefox	safari
firebug in firefox and developer tools in safari also all do this i just don t know the exact terms for them.

8841541
put	get
now when i do print statements in my console i get the correct values but then when i put on my template it only shows me the last value

8841549
versioning	upgrade
what you did set is some variable that is supposed to tell the javascript script that is used to embed the swf what minimum versioning of the player is required to run the swf this has no effect on the swf itself it s only for user s information you should set it in such a way that in case users have older versioning of player they will be told to upgrade

8841553
superclass	subclassing
every instance of subclassing is also an instance of superclass

8841567
maven	m2e
i have successfully installed configured the m2e maven plugin for eclipse along with android sdk and adt

8841570
yslow	pagespeed
to clarify the terminology used by yslow and similar tools like google s pagespeed

8841574
put	get
otoh it might be more convenient to put them in especially if they sometimes require some tweaking to get working here we have all manner of problems getting the maven and webtools plugins to cooperate

8841612
free	malloc
as we know the free function knows how much of the memory is to be free from the malloc d memory by using a prefixed integer value stored just at the back of the malloc d pointer

8841639
daemons	systemd
yes the code will probably need a gui systemd to run - won t be a daemons

8841648
hide	show
it even uses a sliding effect to hide and show the advertisements in the bottom of the screen

8841671
google-chrome	firefox
it works with firefox and google-chrome without any issues but not in ie 8 not sure about other versions

8841683
jobs	cron
1 running scripts as cron at on windows jobs

8841683
jobs	cron
2 running custom executables as cron at jobs

8841688
portrait	landscape
this means they will be applied to the current page size in software and reflect the actual page dimension portrait or landscape

8841688
portrait	landscape
because these are hardware measurements they do not rotate when you set the page to landscape portrait

8841688
width	height
the two lines that determine available width and available height are what i think you were looking for in your question

8841688
portrait	landscape
those two lines take into account whether you want soft margins or hard margins and whether the print document is configured for landscape or portrait

8841688
width	height
i used math.floor for the easy way out to just drop anything past the decimal ex 817.96 - 817 just to make sure the available width and height was just inside the available dimensions

8841688
portrait	landscape
i tested this procedure in both portrait and landscape with both hard margins and soft margins on a dell 3115cn a samsung scx-4x28 and cutepdf software printer

8841688
min	max
either you can prevent the user from selecting margins outside the printable area or warn them if they do or you can enforce some min max conditions in your code when you actually start printing drawing the document

8841688
pop-up	dialog
example case if you set the page margins to 0 0 0 0 in microsoft word 2007 a warning dialog pop-up that reads one or more margins are set outside the printable area of the page

8841706
libxml2	libxslt
the obvious way to solve this is to use an xslt processor such as the libxslt c library that is closely related actually pretty much a part of libxml2

8841717
rss	feed
i m importing a facebook rss feed and many of the posts are missing a title

8841718
google-chrome	safari
instead of alert data i would use console.log data and use firebug or the js console in google-chrome and safari to see what s going on

8841719
hash	md5	crypt	hash	crypt	md5
i ve read a lot of posts on here about crypt md5 hash bcrypt etc and have come to consider using something along the lines of the following to secure the passwords better than they are now

8841719
hash	salt
i will use a combination of hash sha512 and two salt the first salt will be a site wide salt stored in a file such as .htaccess and the second salt will be created for each user

8841795
post	get
if we change this value and save post on controller we get model with the incorrect value but not which we enter

8841805
nl2br	htmlspecialchars
nl2br - htmlspecialchars

8841877
getter	setter
mdsharedprefs class just contains some getter and setter to retrieve write the pref values

8841883
submit	submission
fill out the form and upon submission .click of that form submit it will send the information and hide the div again

8841909
put	get
working xslt to count the # of complete y is so theen i put exactly what works on w3schools into my sp dataview and i get nothing.

8841960
hash	hmac
what you really need is not a plain hash function but a message authentication code such as hmac

8841970
ubuntu	linux
i just built the arm-none-eabi toolchain on my ubuntu to compile the linux kernel for arm

8841988
inherited	properties
in an app that i am writing i use the singleline properties of an edittext inherited from textview in order to make the view multiline by setting the properties to false

8841999
hash	md5
do not nest md5 inside your sha512 hash

8841999
hash	md5
an md5 collision then implies a hash collision in the outer hash too because you are hashing the same values

8841999
hash	md5
md5 hash are prefixed with unless you reinvented md5 hashing then your hash may be incompatible

8842007
accessor	properties
you probably don t want to declare your instance variables in the .h but instead in the .m file no need to make them visible and also have properties accessor with the same name

8842057
setinterval	clearinterval	setinterval	settimeout	clearinterval	settimeout
you should use setinterval clearinterval rather than recalling the function using settimeout

8842076
profiling	instrumentation
everything works as expected and the video gets created properly but when i profiling my application with instrumentation i get memory leaks which i don t really know how to fix as i can t see anything in the detail view which is related to my code all the leaked objects are malloc and the responsible library is videotoolbox

8842091
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox seem to be working fine

8842102
emacs	aquamacs
i use aquamacs 90 of the time to edit r files with ess emacs speaks statistics

8842108
pbkdf2	md5
if it matches password is correct perform the bcrypt pbkdf2 transformation of the password since you now have it store it in the new system and delete the old md5 record

8842140
free	malloc
fixing a leak is to figure out where the extra retain came from or where a missing call to free might need to be inserted in the case of a malloc based leak

8842142
salt	md5	hash	salt	hash	md5
first build a temporary function to create a new blowfish hash from the original md5 hash with a random salt and a prefix so that we can detect this later

8842142
hash	md5
now run all the existing md5 hash through this function and save the result in the database

8842142
hash	md5
it gets the md5 hash out of your database immediately

8842264
width	height
i would like to be able to inspect a uiview instance that may or may not have been rotated from its original orientation by the user rotating the device for instance and determine what the true width and height are

8842264
width	height
true here meaning if a view on a portrait-oriented ipad was 768x1024 before rotation after being turned sideways i would calculate that the new width was 1024 and the new height was 768

8842296
mouseover	mouseleave
i suggest that you use mouseover and mouseleave or the jquery.hover event which is the same to set the ui-state-hover class on the row on which the context menu will be opened

8842319
hash	salt
secure hash and salt for php passwords

8842330
getter	setter
you need to synthesize playeronecount in order to generate the getter and setter methods -playeronecount and -setplayeronecount respectively

8842347
width	height
what i gathered from your comments was that you want to be able to access the width and height from outside the player function and the problem is that you don t know when the width and height are available

8842347
width	height
since you don t know when the image will be loaded and can t have the width and height before it s loaded unless you specify them in the img tag server-side you need to use a function that takes a callback to access the player s width and height

8842347
width	height
basically if the width and height are not known yet the function just puts the callback in a queue

8842347
width	height
when the width and height are determined all of the functions in the queue get called with the width and height being passed to them as arguments

8842361
m2e	pom.xml	maven	m2e	maven	pom.xml
if i keep jsp-api in pom.xml and set it to provided or test tomcat side will fail as the m2e plugin pushes jsp-api jar to maven dependencies which is then included in my tomcat deployed lib

8842385
int	double
by adding a decimal to one of the int java will treat it as a double and not perform int division

8842390
dictionary	map
so a normal map dictionary isn t quite enough since the keys can be duplicated

8842472
int	chars
edit as pointed out in the comments it s possible that sizeof chars sizeof int

8842484
width	height
the example deals with the height but is the same using the width

8842505
int	double
and you might want to consider using double instead of int â that is

8842514
pop-up	dialog
what i d like to do is when that hyper link is clicked i d like to return in a pop-up of some kind alert pop-up jquery dialog etc the data that the info link would return if navigating to that page

8842519
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uitabbaritem	uitabbarcontroller
i suggest you take a look at the uitabbarcontroller uitabbaritem and uiviewcontroller class references and read up on the relevant properties

8842527
children	parent
the disadvantage of this way is that for existing parent the whole collection of children will be loaded into memory before a new child is added and later saved to the database

8842527
children	parent
if this is the case many and increasing number of children for each parent then the might be useful

8842590
extjs	gxt
i m trying to create a fairly simply gwt app using the gxt framework and am doing this based on the ebook extjs gwt 2.0 beginners guide

8842593
int	chars
if that chars isn t whitespace or 0 then the input string wasn t a valid int

8842598
width	height
adjust the top and left margins byy half the height and width

8842682
fadein	fadeout
fadein and fadeout are both functions

8842692
metaclass	subclassing
within one class hierarchy metaclass must be subclassing of each other

8842692
metaclass	subclassing
that is the metaclass of component must be a subclassing of the metaclass of otherobjects

8842702
children	parent
nor do you need to call dispose on any of the children as disposing a parent will do that for you

8842737
width	height
i would like to play around with coding an application that could capture a desktop or section of a screen height and width variables for resolution and stream those to an rtmp server rtmp server.com live

8842737
width	height
ability to select height width selection of desktop or entire desktop and stream live to that channel as if i was using flash media live encoder

8842766
m2e	pom.xml
instead the m2e plugin uses the configuration in the pom.xml to create equivalent configurations in eclipse

8842789
width	height
i.frame cgrectmake x y width height

8842792
post	get
below i provide links to recent post that i believe will help you get started

8842794
width	height	portrait	landscape
the key here is that if the simulator device is in landscape mode and then you start your program self.view. frame or bounds retrieves the portrait height and width

8842814
ienumerable	ilist
ilist and list do not define their t as out while ienumerable does

8842814
ienumerable	ilist	put	get
put a simpler way you can only get back t from ienumerable but you can put in t to ilist because of this ienumerable doesn t care if you are less specific but ilist does

8842855
stdout	stderr
if you want a really whacky dirty yet quick solution run your function in from multicore - it suppresses stdout you can add multicore closestderr if you want to suppress stderr as well

8842856
int	double
or you could take advantage of the fact that all numbers int float double it doesn t matter with an exact value of 0 are treated as false other constants treated as false include or - see here

8842889
ati	nvidia
as for hardware i have dual boot ibm thinkpad 64-bit quad core with an integrated nvidia 3100m card and an intel core 2 duo imac which has an ati radeon

8842890
screens	tablet
this will allow me to pre-configure the tablet for our customers change the screens background to our logo etc

8842899
tlbimp	tlbexp
also for building in general you should be able to use tlbimp or tlbexp to create a tlb file that you can use for building assuming the point of registering is just to be able to compile successfully and not to run specific tests

8842908
google-chrome	firefox
tested with ie9 firefox and google-chrome and it all worked fine

8842921
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i have a uisplitviewcontroller with a uiviewcontroller as master and a uinavigationcontroller as my details controller which contains an actual detailscontroller as it s rootcontroller

8842921
portrait	landscape
funny enough if i rotate to portrait then back to landscape the methods gets called properly from then on

8842957
vbscript	jscript
to let you compare jscript and vbscript code dealing with the same problem

8842957
vbscript	jscript
in .htas and .wsfs or .wscs you can mix all installed activescript languages vbscript jscript perlscript pythonscript rubyscript ... by using the script tag either inline or via the src attribute

8842991
listview	gridview
i m working on an android application with listview gridview

8842992
versioning	upgrade
the latest versioning will offer to upgrade a 2008 project to 2010 it shouldn t be terribly hard to write a powershell script to do that via command line

8843000
hash	salt
what i do is store a cookie with the client s id username and password salt and hash

8843002
stdout	stderr
basically the at the end means redirect anything from stderr which is 2 to stdout which is 1

8843002
stdout	stderr
since stdout is redirected to a file you should now see the stderr stream in the file

8843060
width	height
i use a set width of around 300px which works fine but dynamically size the iframe s height to the size of it s content a blog post

8843101
google-chrome	firefox
in browsers that support the html5 history state api firefox google-chrome this works flawless

8843158
width	height
i commented the width part of the above function as you re specifically asking about the height

8843171
listbox	icollectionview
i am binding a wpf listbox to a icollectionview which is grouped

8843185
put	get
what is more using reflection or casting to untyped list you can put any object into list and in both codes you ll get classcastexception

8843187
versioning	upgrade
however if you were to upgrade your license to pro then the pro versioning will take the files from your temp directory and re-generate the .meta files as they are seen in svn

8843213
viewdidload	viewwillappear
you might be able to do this on viewwillappear instead of viewdidload

8843226
rss	feed
i am writing an rss feed with wpf and one of the feed is a custom feed created by wordpress

8843282
strcpy	strncpy
my best guess would be that strncpy instead of strcpy would fix your problem it sounds like something has overwritten your next pointer somewhere late in the list and too long a string in in would do that for sure

8843285
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
note that supplying string that doesn t represent any of enum values throws illegalargumentexception but in your present code you have potential nullpointerexception at runtime enums.valueoffunction returns null if the enum constant does not exist and i suppose you are aware of it if you weren t you are now

8843315
width	height
i wonder if an issue with trying to calculate width and height

8843315
width	height
so according to the millennial documentation it is recommended that you don t set the height or width but let the sdk optimize based on the device

8843332
min	max
select ala_date min ala_date max ala_date ala_type partmsg

8843332
min	max
select ala_date min ala_date max ala_date ala_type

8843332
min	max
it is now only showing 1 record and the min and max only are the same and the count is 1 instead of 2

i have no problems in ie9 firefox google-chrome safari or opera

8843357
for-loop	arrays
i am using a for-loop to iterate through a list of arrays that all have the same name expect a different number at the end

8843365
profiling	debugging
my problem is that i can t try debugging the new profiling page facebook italy

8843369
free	malloc
i was talking with a grad student that had broken malloc free working on the largest file of genetic data ever attempted in one pass

8843381
post	get
so if you call then it will attempt to instantiate a class called newscontroller and if it s a get request then the get method of that class or post for a post request and so on

8843436
for-loop	loops
in example sendp method included in for-loop which is slower than making other loops to send packets

8843436
for-loop	loops
performance tip in python using for loops is too slow use map instead if you would like a speed like a for-loop in c ref

8843436
winpcap	scapy
if my guess is right you are sending a video stream packets in this case i would use a winpcap if i am sending an 1 mega pixel video or scapy in other cases lower size per frame

8843445
rss	feed
the method fetches some info from an rss feed

8843465
width	height
all of them have the same width but different height

8843478
udp	tcp
udp is not point 2 point protocol like tcp so using one server socket bind to specific port you can handle hundreds of clients

8843493
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i reworked the code to use fb.login and now it works in ie and not in any other broswers google-chrome nor firefox safari is untested

8843493
google-chrome	firefox
it pops up and auth goes fine in firefox and google-chrome but window hangs on

8843498
pop-up	dialog
you can allways use a simple and let the user select open in the open or save dialog that will pop-up in the browser

8843514
lxml	beautifulsoup
they are many xml parsers available in python like beautifulsoup lxml

8843526
maven-surefire-plugin	pom.xml
at first it was saying no goals needed for this project so i added the maven-surefire-plugin to my pom.xml to bind the test phase to the maven-surefire-plugin test goal

8843590
draggable	droppable
the solution i found is to extract the code which sets the draggable s and or droppable s into a separate function which can then be reinvoked by the ajax response after it reloads the relevant part of the page

8843610
nowjs	node.js	express	nowjs	express	node.js
here is an example of an app using node.js and the modules express jade and nowjs

8843610
apache	nginx
with either nginx or a node script acting as a reverse proxy in front of this script and apache

8843612
jar	manifest.mf
the list of libraries is specified into the manifest.mf file of the main executable jar

8843614
backbone.js	javascriptmvc
if not then i d write it in js but take a look at some mvc frameworks such as backbone.js or javascriptmvc etc

8843638
jtree	jtable
in connection with thread jtable as a jtree node i put jtable to jtree but jtree view isn t rendered correctly on start_up how can i setpreferredsize for jtable because preferredscrollableviewportsize shrinked jtable with rendering tableheader + one row one row remain hidden but after expanding node s treerenderer change and repaint the setpreferredsize to the expected dimension

8843657
jtree	jtable
2 if i put jscrollpane with jtable to the node directly without using jpanel as parent then jtree view isn t correctly rendered after start_up for more info please see my question put jtable in the jtree

8843766
equals	gethashcode
in all how does an equals and or a gethashcode have a bug

8843766
equals	gethashcode
if the relationship between gethashcode and equals is not as above

8843766
equals	gethashcode
with the overrides on attribute the equals does have the reflexive symmetric and transitive properties it s gethashcode does match it and the documentation for it s equals override is

8843770
entity-relationship	diagram
entity-relationship only has 5 thingies but they re really all one needs for entity-relationship diagram

8843793
width	height
the easiest way to clear it is ctx.clearrect 0 0 width height

8843796
nsoperation	nsblockoperation
my simple workaround is just to subclass nsoperation or nsblockoperation without overriding anything and then do something like this

8843797
kerberos	ldap
besides ldap it supports kerberos 5 and the change password protocol

8843799
subclass	abstract-class
even though your myclass can not be instantiated directly because it s an abstract-class abstract is a subclass of myclass

8843825
super	abstract
i have a class that has a private member variable that is assigned when it is instantiated however if it is used in an abstract function that is called by the super class s constructor the variable does not have a value

8843854
post	put
you re using put but the share api requires post as the method

8843863
metaclass	subclassing
as unutbu puts it within one class hierarchy metaclass must be subclassing of each other

8843863
metaclass	subclassing
that is the metaclass of component must be a subclassing of the metaclass of otherobjects.

8843863
metaclass	superclass
but this should do what you want and some more - you just have to inherit all your metaclass from basecomponablemeta and call the superclass in the hyerarchy through the metaclass __superclass attribute

8843864
clang	llvm
i would definitely look at clang llvm

8843871
superclass	subclassing
the superclass constructor runs before the subclassing constructor hence it would only be natural that the statement is executed afterwards

8843884
hide	show
the list will show and hide upon focusing and blurring the input

8843892
rss	feed
i need to call an rss feed using basic authentication

8843904
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
so far i can t get it to work on safari or firefox or opera on my mac

8843904
firefox	safari
safari sits on a blank screen and firefox gives me this error

8843931
put	get
i still get an error like however since 3rdparty.ifetch is a generic type i don t think i can ever put a code contract on it specifically

8843975
profiler	yourkit
here is tree of incoming references to held object obtained using yourkit java profiler

8843980
folder	directory
so i had to manually cut paste the generated files and folder into the directory tree

8843994
moq	nmock
you can then pass your interface rather than your concrete class to a mocking framework i ve used moq but i assume nmock works very similarly

8843995
multicastdelegate	delegation
by default the c# compiler will for each event auto-define a multicast delegation field along with add and remove members which will take the passed-in delegation and add or remove them to from that multicastdelegate field

8844002
width	height
just as simple as editing the resize width height but not stored in a user-friendly area

8844007
maven	m2e
if you use m2e then the standard eclipse compiler will be extended with maven builders so you can use all eclipse compile features

8844013
gmail	hotmail
how to make the preview mode for the email-readers like hotmail gmail for the tinymce text editor

8844029
maven	pom.xml
repository references definitions urls are either in maven settings file or then in the pom.xml

8844029
maven	m2e
code can be compiled with the help of eclipse-maven plugin of which m2e is the most common using maven on the command line or then using maven to generate regular eclipse project files and then normally with eclipse

8844055
google-chrome	firefox
when i do it like this google-chrome 16 and firefox 9 return cannot read property document of undefined

8844105
inherited	properties
domain project domain entities go here i ve a simple personnel class which is inherited from entitybase class entitybase class has a single properties named id

8844126
width	height
i ve got a load of non local images which i d like to render as background images for classes with a width of 500px and height of 330px

8844128
hide	show
however i opted to write the show hide logic myself rather than rely on a subclassed tabcontrol to do it for me

8844128
hide	show
i still feel that it would be possible to improve the show hide logic

8844128
mef	prism
additionally you can control the lifetime of your view whether or not it should be re-used upon subsequent navigation requests what logic should be performed on navigation to and on navigation from events and whether or not navigation should be aborted due to unsaved changes in current view etc. note that prism view-based navigation requires a dependency injection container such as unity or mef so you will likely need to incorporate this into your application architecture but even without prism navigation adopting a di container is well worth the investment

8844129
antivirus	mcafee
in our case it was the mcafee antivirus software on the server repository stealing the file when commited via subversion

8844147
dictionary	map
since json is a parsed as a map or dictionary this should be adequate regardless of the presence of nested jsonarrays and json objects in those arrays explain why json-rpc is better or desired by anything at all

8844194
udp	tcp
if you know that it will be in a lan or something similar then you can consider using udp instead of tcp but then you need to manage way more things by yourself since it is not as reliable

8844215
rss	feed
the yahoo rss feed url format is for search term nascar

8844215
rss	feed
as an alternative you can use the bing search rss feed which have the format

8844254
filtering	grouping
this filtering grouping multiple words together

8844306
centos	linux
i am having this php script that fails to save the session variable when i hit submit in my php version 5.1.6 linux centos system

8844312
hide	show
i ve also added calls to the show and hide functions for the target and curloaded elements to ensure that the check for whether the element is visible will provide the expected result

8844314
portrait	landscape
my adnroid application works well on emulator but running on real android device softbank 003 sh when i rotate the device from portrait to landscape the application stop unexpectedly

8844329
width	height
i found the best way to float a mouse event tracking div over an area is to make the div 1px width and what ever height you need

8844338
firefox	safari
in safari omniweb firefox there s no such problem with the very same codebase

8844339
int	chars
on most platforms signed chars will be an 8-bit two s complement number -128 to 127 and unsigned chars will be an 8-bit unsigned int 0 to 255

8844376
min	max
you have an error in your schema global presentation element cannot have constraints maxoccurs 1 minoccurs 1 you d need to remove them it does not make sense to have min max for global elements those constraints makes sense in context of other elements

8844390
min	max
you d want to use max and min for the initial size of the vector too though

8844408
children	parent
the idea is to organize a tree of acos so that if you allow access to a parent all children are accessable automatically

8844455
post	get
with all the get requests everything works fine but only one call must be in post with a json string and this one doesn t work

8844488
cpu	irq
when one device generates an interrupt the interrupt controller pass this information to the cpu with the irq

8844507
versioning	upgrade
all my phone settings are the same install 3rd party apps true allow usb debugging true and i ve upgrade all my app projects to the latest sdk versioning in netbeans so those aren t the issues

8844524
google-chrome	firefox
this issue appears in both google-chrome and firefox

8844573
inherited	base-class
you can have your functor inherited from a template base-class defined in the top-level scope and then refer only to the base class using mem_fun bind1st

8844579
chown	chmod
generally spoken as for being confronted with the site still remaining the same - after the hard core changes of last night due to my server-admin while chhanging the chown and chmod of the whole site i am musing about all the tiny things and changes i did last week i will try to go through all tiny changes i made

8844663
portrait	landscape
when rotate the device from landscape to portrait will re-create the activity so thread will stop and if any builder is running will cause a error so

8844672
ant	maven
i just finished converting one of our in-house framework projects from ant to maven

8844729
.htaccess	httpd.conf
also check that apache allows processing of .htaccess files for your document root by setting allowoverride all in httpd.conf and or httpd-vhosts.conf

8844750
hide	show
use jquery and the show hide methods

8844784
hash	md5	put	get
you can put some value in the system properties in the start of your application you can get the value from the system db and encrypt the value first like md5 which can not be decrypted easily then compare with your md5 hash written in your application

8844797
hash	md5
md5 will likely be fine in your case and will probably give you the shortest hash length

8844837
uinavigationcontroller	uiwindow
and i also doubt if uiwindow is the place to look for it - the nav bar is part of the uinavigationcontroller

8844837
uinavigationcontroller	uiwindow
not recommended break the entire autorotation machinery of uinavigationcontroller handle the rotation of the view controllers yourself from uiwindow like you are starting to do now

8844837
uinavigationcontroller	uiwindow
either from your subclassed uinavigationcontroller or from the subclassed uiwindow

8844845
median	max	min	median	min	max
what i want is a table for each of the stats -- min max median and the quartiles -- and their values for each group the ones in names

8844852
aptana	radrails
some days after i started using aptana radrails which created a custom project folder workspace

8844858
pull	push
have each developer clone the central repo pull from and push to it

8844860
post	get
get blogs id post id to get details of a specific post for a specific blog

8844867
width	height
if you want an easy fix for this you can try handsetdetection javascript it gives you the ability to set rules and conditions such as screen size vendor os browser display width and height for your redirection

8844870
queue	fifo
you want either a list which will allow you to implement this as a fifo queue or a dictionary if you want to delete and insert at random

8844873
spaces	delimiter
if neither g file nor c string is used then the first non-option argument is treated as a spaces delimiter list of search terms

8844878
post	get
there are not that many options when it comes to submiting data either you use ajax or use the normal http message like get or post

8844878
post	get
using get or post its usefull to let the user now here s moving along a process or when things that happen after or before are different or context change a lot when submitting

8844899
post	get
so you can work with post get receive data like text json.

8844900
post	get
i guess it s because i ve always preferred sending data via post rather than get so the user doesn t see it and it just carried over to my ajax

8844903
ubuntu	linux
i m running 9.1 on ubuntu linux server

8844913
median	max	min	median	min	max
so the table for each of the stats is in each column belongs to a group and contains the min lower quartile median upper quartile and max

8844934
rss	feed
does this mean the person has to login first to access it or will there be some sort of rss feed that keeps getting updated that i can use and read in directly

8844942
width	height
but because the width and height are in a different table i m not sure how to span the relationship write the sql to do this

8844975
int	double
i would like to get one dimensional array from my double int pointer

8845002
pop-up	dialog
if you really want to launch an activity and pop-up a dialog you must set the following flag to your intent first otherwise you ll get an exception

8845033
actualheight	actualwidth
try using actualwidth and actualheight properties

8845050
int	boolean
public boolean addsubclass week week int starttime int endtime boolean weeknumber

8845062
aggregate-functions	sum
by appending an over clause the aggregate-functions sum is turned into a window function which aggregates values per partition while keeping all rows

8845062
aggregate-functions	sum
in this expression sum sum sp.payout over w the outer sum is a window function the inner sum is an aggregate-functions

8845073
folder	directory
the fileinputformat doesn t seem to work i get an exception upon encountering a folder - saying it is a directory

8845095
pop-up	dialog	firefox	safari
unless i ran the selenium server in multiwindow mode safari and firefox would pop-up print dialog

8845191
multiplying	division
i m able to multiplying fine but i m stuck on the division

8845197
for-loop	arrays
any simple for-loop that breaks when it finds an applicable item would be at most o n but would on average be less unless the latter items of the arrays were constantly found to be the matching elements

8845247
avaudioplayer	avfoundation
3 play the ringtone using avfoundation specifically avaudioplayer

8845271
udp	rtp
when udp rtp avp transport is used the packet loss is inevitable due to the nature of udp

8845271
udp	tcp
however dss also supports tcp transport and reliable udp transport which could solve the packet loss problem in the circumstances that the bandwidth from server to client is enough

8845281
post	get
right now i m trying to write my own custom rails routes for my app but for some reason when i write in non-resourceful routes i cannot get post requests or anything besides get for that matter to route to the action that i specified

8845315
hide	show
so in this case we rely on the controller to set the value of viewbag.search then based on that the view can show or hide a specific block of html

8845321
firefox	safari
css works fine and the #divcontainer has a top margin and is centered in firefox and other browsers but not in safari

8845334
post	get
if you want to define both a custom get and a post in one line you can use match

8845334
post	get
match photos show photos#show via get post

8845355
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i ve seen dozens of questions regarding this problem and the answer is always that the uiviewcontroller is not part of a uinavigationcontroller

8845367
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv .

8845415
sorting	grouping
edit actually you could do that expression much better to grouping by a datetime for the start of the month rather than for a string indicating the start of the month as i just showed that would be better for sorting by etc

8845424
width	margin
..the reason is that the inner div s margin can t automatically determine their size unless the inner div has a width

8845481
ant	maven
ant and maven two popular technologies for managing a project both support doing this

8845491
tablet	galaxy
why it failed on tablet xoom galaxy lg sony etc

8845536
google-chrome	firefox
after some investigation it seems this issue doesn t happen in google-chrome is related to newer firefox version 9.0.1 linux

8845541
hash	md5
however in providing multiple hash outputs you effectively remove a lot of those possibilities since for example the number of texts that can produce a particular md5 is intersected with those that produce a particular shax

8845541
hash	md5
think in terms of the md5 hash you have

8845560
rss	feed
on my node.js server i have some json that i need to convert to an rss feed

8845568
post	get
this worked as of a week ago our best bet to get this fixed is to post on so the facebook developers know how big of an issue this is

8845610
folder	directory
which has further sub folder in it.i do not want to copy the files or directory

8845610
folder	directory
if you notice the output the blank space in a directory name are treated as separate directory.which is not correct.so how can i get rid of this problem.i want to create same directory structure as present on source folder

8845620
for-loop	arrays
the second for-loop was thrown in afterwards for debugging to make sure the arrays didn t actually contain two instances of each value

8845621
junit	powermockito
when i write the junit for the method getstudent is there a way in powermockito to mock the line

8845656
inherited	subclassing
if your class hierarchy permits it a base class can define the class constant which is inherited by subclassing

8845674
width	height
the width actually changes but it forces the height to a predefined value

8845691
rss	feed
processing rss feed is more comfortable

8845691
rss	feed
as of the time of posting the only rss feed available on the site are

8845691
rss	feed
resources on rss feed processing

8845704
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
another good idea is to look in the source of css3 generated buttons usually developers only care for firefox safari google-chrome and ie but a sass generated output will be really verbose with a lot of vendor prefixes including ones for opera

8845724
folder	directory
i create a repository inside my root directory which is my httpdocs folder with the following command.

8845724
put	get
once you get mod_dav and mod_dav_svn installed you need to configure your httpd.conf file or put a configuration file under your httpd s conf.d depending how it s configured on your system for it to work

8845752
spaces	delimiter
as you noted the problem is clearly that bash is treating the spaces in the directory names as a delimiter and iterating over each word separately

8845752
spaces	delimiter
then the sed command translates the spaces in your directory names into a placeholder string ### which bash no longer mistakes for a delimiter

8845776
awt	swing
most of the swing objects build off of their awt counter parts our are completely new

8845776
awt	swing
both swing and awt are a part of the core java api so it would be best to start with the tutorial that avd linked you to the java tutorial

8845789
hide	show
i want the button to hide the last two rows when clicked and show them again when clicked again

8845845
facebook	fbconnect
i am integrating the facebook api i.e fbconnect to post message on my wall i have integrated the fbconnect api in it i am getting the facebook login screen but m not getting the post to wall dialog after

8845868
awt	swing	jtree	jtable
swing offers components functionality not available in awt such as jtable jtree support for formatted documents rtf simple html in swing components

8845868
awt	swing
for more information see things that swing provides beyond awt

8845877
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it is well known that the internet explorer javascript engines are way behind in terms of performance in particular ie 8 and older when compared to google-chrome safari webkit or firefox mozilla

8845907
getelementsbytagname	htmlcollection
getelementsbytagname returns an htmlcollection

8845950
hide	show
when you show any one element you need to go through the other divs and hide their elements

8845997
put	get
here you can build your string array in onactivityresult accordingly. i didn t get what you have done in your adapter class to show contact details so i just put strings from string array in adapter.you have to code as per your need.

8846061
lxml	beautifulsoup
while beautifulsoup and lxml both can be used to parse html there is still a big step from there to text that approximates the formatting that is embedded in the html

8846061
macports	homebrew
it can be installed easily on a macos with homebrew or macports and on other nix systems through their package managers

8846092
uiview	subviews
i have one uiimageview as subviews in uiview

8846092
width	height
i set autoresizesubviews to parent and autoresizingmask as flexible height and width

8846106
squash	merge
i could sync each time there is a new commit in repo-a or wait until there are several of them essentially like squash merge

8846145
textview	imageview
textview edittexts imageview etc.

8846181
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have a uitabbarcontroller root view controller with three view controllers once of which is a uinavigationcontroller with a uiviewcontroller containing a uisearchdisplaycontroller and a uitableview

8846181
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
when this uiviewcontroller is pushed the uinavigationcontroller toolbar should slide out and the uitabbarcontroller tab bar should remain visible

8846181
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i tried setting the hidesbottombarwhenpushed property of the pushed uiviewcontroller to true which provides the intended behavior when the uinavigationcontroller is not nested within a uitabbarcontroller

8846181
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
unfortunately rather that sliding the uinavigationcontroller toolbar out when hidesbottombarwhenpushed is set to true the uitabbarcontroller slides out leaving the uinavigationcontroller visible in the pushed uiviewcontroller as the bottom bar

8846181
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the only possible solution i can think of is rather than using the uinavigationcontroller toolbar simply add a uitoolbar to the bottom of the uiviewcontroller view containing the uitableview

8846181
uinavigationcontroller	uiwindow
this will simply hide the uinavigationcontroller toolbar before the push animation starts exposing the portion of the uiwindow that lies beneath the uinavigationcontroller toolbar

8846190
uiview	subviews
if you are not you are leaking every time you alloc-init a uiview and add as a subviews without then subsequently calling release on that view

fgetc	getline
first i implemented the fgetc and getline versions and timed them

8854366
fgetc	getline
i confirmed that in debug mode the getline version is slower about 130 âµs vs 60 âµs for the fgetc version

8854366
fgetc	getline
this was confirmed when i compared my release mode times about 20 âµs using getline and 48 âµs with fgetc

8854366
fgetc	getline
the fact that using getline with iostreams is faster than fgetc at least in release mode runs counter to the reasoning that copying all that data must be slower than not copying it so i m not sure what all optimization is able to avoid and i didn t really look to find any explanation but it d be interesting to understand what s being optimized away

8854366
fgetc	getline
when i did this i was quite surprised to find that using fstream get was quite a bit slower than both the fgetc and getline methods in both debug and release

8854366
next	except
though i haven t tested this i can t see that get does much beyond just getting the next character from the stream_buf except for these sentry objects

8854366
fgetc	getline
but the performance of fgetc improved relative to the getline implementation and became faster

it s kind of like using any other user-controls with a tabcontrol - checkbox.ischecked listbox.selecteditem expander.isexpanded etc all get lost unless they re bound to something

8856713
user-controls	tabcontrol
if this is a one-time user-controls meant to be used with a specific view and tabcontrol which you have control over then just be sure to bind the hours minutes

8856720
rss	feed
the first table will parse items from an rss feed and will have an option for a

8856799
post	get
and if you reply to the first post again you would get

8856865
arraylist	treeset
one thing you could do if the fastest possible access to the kth smallest element were really important would be to use an arraylist rather than a treeset and handle inserts by binary searching for the insertion point and either inserting the element at that index or replacing the existing element at that index depending on the result of the search

8856876
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
ie supplies this info differently than google-chrome firefox safari so probably better if you do use the lib to help cover all the bases

8856893
isotope	masonry
i recently discovered the masonry and isotope jquery plugins

8856899

in order to preserve your layout you ll want to add a width and height to your container div

8856960
width	height
if a div has no visible content in it and there is no defined width and height it won t take up any space on the page which could cause a layout to break

8857008
google-chrome	firefox
it works in ie and google-chrome but in firefox the top-parent div expands

chunked	transfer-encoding
transfer-encoding chunked is specifically designed to allow sending data with an unknown body length for both requests and responses

8857067

this way if you ever need to upgrade your framework s minor versioning just update code and reapply patch linux - - google for details - hopefully there won t be any conflicts and everything will work just fine

8857084
pugixml	rapidxml
it seems to me tinyxml and pugixml are both good options rapidxml is good as well but its interface does not seem to be as easy as the above two as i have to manage data allocations myself

8857085
isotope	masonry
to some people isotope would look very similar to the work you had previously done with masonry

8857085
isotope	masonry
isotope has several features that masonry lacks

8857085
sorting	filtering
as iâ ve mentioned it has filtering and sorting functionality built

8857085
isotope	masonry
masonry is under the mit license but isotope is only free for personal use

8857113
post	get
the idea is that the javascript sends a get or it could be post request to the addcategory.php page behind the scenes passing it whatever info it needs to create the category

8857141
chunked	transfer-encoding
and transfer-encoding chunked headers eg

any column you are selecting that are not used by one of the aggregate-functions sum min etc needs to be listed in the group by clause

8857218

8857259
post	get
also you ll want to be careful to sanitize any get post variables

8857297
int	chars
note that in c# due to the built-in string indexer which returns a chars along with implicit conversion from chars to int the following expression means precisely the same thing whether source is a string or an

8857297
int	chars
this is largely due to the fact that comparing int values is much faster that comparing chars values

8857339
hide	show
the show hide bit is just jquery to show or hide divs that have a login and logout button in them

8857405
google-chrome	firefox
i want my application to listen on browser activity it can be ie google-chrome firefox etc... and get all the media links images movies

post	get
which means the jsp needs to receive a post request and then do an update based on a pile of json data extjs sends read request as get and write methods like store.save are post

8857443
post	get
my plan was to add something in the java to recognize whether it is a post or get request

8857470
post	put
implement the logic in the servlets for both returning json and handling things like post put etc...

8857492
setinterval	settimeout
what you need is a setinterval or a settimeout to trigger your code to call itself a certain number of milliseconds in the future incrementing the css property each time

8857751
addclass	removeclass
as i attempt to removeclass addclass or toggleclass i fight with it for hours to no avail

8857781
inherited	properties
note that in the former process there is no conversion involved you have a type that you would like to treat as another say for example you have 3 different objects that inherited from a base type and you have a method that will take that base type at any point if you now the specific child type you can cast it to what it is and use all the specific methods and properties of that object and that will not create a new instance of the object

width	height
it s easy enough to calculate the top left value for each table as well as calculating the width and height

8857845
express	node.js
i have a node.js express app that i m hosting on nodejitsu

8857926
lxml.html	beautifulsoup
you ll be saving yourself lots of hassle and problems if you use an html parsing module like beautifulsoup or lxml.html

8857931
width	height
also-note i don t ever use image maps so i m not sure that getting their top left width height style properties is possible if not then you can just get the coords attribute and parse it into the proper information

8857985
m2e	pom.xml	maven	m2e	maven	pom.xml
as far as i can tell since this is a maven project my first my maven pom.xml is dictating along with m2e smarts my project build configuration and dependencies

8857994
int	boolean
if a.end is returning a boolean or an int 0 1 that represents if it is at the end of the list or not then a.beg might be returning a boolean or an int 0 1 specifying if it is at the beginning of the list or not

8858005
hide	show
every time you want to set up a new hide show sequence first call .stop on that element then attach your animations

8858005
fadein	fadeout	slideup	slidedown
one other thing to note is that it s easier to pair complementary animations slideup + slidedown or fadeout + fadein

8858048
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
but there is a considerable lag choppiness when tested in firefox and opera works fine in google-chrome and safari

8858073
int	chars
assuming you give ch the type int because a chars cannot represent eof

8858082
everyauth	node.js
i m using an external node.js module everyauth to handle my linkedin api authentication

8858092
hide	show
i can already make it display but when i click on another radio button it show one but doesn t hide the other..

8858110
perl	tcl
only possible and crude way i can think of is to break the huge number into smaller chunk perform your math and join them again or better yet use perl php tcl bsh etc scripting languages that are more powerful than awk

8858126
width	height
your chart clip must fit on a page a4 dimension in pixels should fit in width 559 x height 842

8858126
width	height
to scale a movielclip you can use scalex or scaley but changing the width or height of the container works better for me because pixel values are easier then calculating the scale

8858127
int	double
the conversion may be representation changing like int to double or it might be representation preserving like string to object

8858149
hide	fadeout
alternatively you can use hide instead of fadeout if you would like them to hide immediately

8858351
min	max
i was also confused about how grouplayout.default_size and grouplayout.preferred_size are used in grouplayout.sequentialgroup.addcomponent component c int min int pref int max even after referencing the grouplayout section of the java tutorials and a java.net article titled getting to know grouplayout part 1

8858351
min	max
any other negative value for min pref and max besides default_size or preferred_size are errors and hit asserts

8858351
min	max
the interplay between the sequentialgroup.addcomponent min pref and max sizes wasn t immediately apparent to me from the tutorial

8858360
spaces	delimiter
i am trying to read words and numbers from a spaces and tab delimiter text file

8858362
youtube	vimeo
if not - how would i do this by uploading video to youtube or vimeo

8858363
post	get
however when i try to post comments to the user s wall i get a http 404 error

8858386
pthreads	epoll
epoll 7 summarizes it succinctly epoll scales well to large numbers of watched file descriptors. however poll is a pthreads standard interface so use that when portability is required

8858389
jasmine	qunit
chutzpah runs jasmine or qunit tests in the headless phantomjs browser from the command line

8858395
strncmp	strcmp
you need to use strcmp or strncmp to do that

8858395
fgets	strtok
editorial - you really do probably want to use fgets and strtok or one of its relatives to work through this stuff

8858405
google-chrome	safari
-webkit-calc available in the google-chrome 19 dev build should be available in the next safari

8858420
opera	safari
current solution involves using silverlight and i wish to go plain-js on modern browsers safari mobile safari ios ie 9 opera 11 etc

8858430
oncreate	setcontentview
this should be used with setcontentview r.layout.menu in oncreate

8858495
folder	directory
open a command window and change directory cd to the phonegap-android folder

8858502
google-chrome	firefox
for me on google-chrome and firefox the scrollable div .mid-col-main only becomes scrollable upon resizing the window maximize drag from corner etc

8858547
cvs	svn
it would appear that the days of centralized revision control systems such as cvs and svn are numbered and the overhead of running them seems especially unjustified for a small group or short term project

8858547
cvs	svn
it s fairly easy to setup one server to act as an authoritative repository if you would like to mimic how cvs and svn work

8858571
post	put	post	get	put	get
when for your resource the api always returns the full object event on post put so that when you create a new object you can get the created id on the same request

8858580
portrait	landscape
but when i rotate from portrait to landscape it seems to maintain the same width at least until i touch the screen

8858580
portrait	landscape
after rotating from portrait to landscape

8858583
width	height
i need to specify the width and height of the images it is required on the jquery plugin i m using

8858592
libevent	epoll
in terms of portability - as epoll is linux-specific i would suggest checking out libev and libevent libraries

8858638
ddms	hprof
you can click dump hprof file under devices tab in ddms and get info graphical charts of your heap information

8858654
put	get
first thing i would try is put a try catch block around it and try to get a clue about any possible error code

8858662
oncreate	setcontentview
you have forgotten to call the setcontentview in your oncreate method so your listview is not referenced yet

8858666
apache	nginx
your choice of webserver apache nginx etc do not affect them

8858683
integer	unsigned
lets say i have 1300 seconds in a unsigned integer i would like to take the current date and time subtract 1 300 seconds from it and end up with

8858704
subtract	add
hence to subtract 1300 seconds you need to add -1300 seconds

8858754
x86	64bit
as an example the platform might not support 64bit cas for x86 that was added with the first pentium iirc so it would not be availible when compiling 486 compatible

8858778
memcpy	memset
when debugging i frequently stepped into the handwritten assembly implementation of memcpy and memset

8858799
hash	salt
for privacy reasons you shouldn t send the mac address itself to your server but a hash of it preferably with some salt

8858809
stdout	stderr
when tracking down the close-on-exec details for ikegami s curiosity i think i found that all you need to do is close stdin stdout and stderr yourself if you are simply executing another process

8858811
kerberos	ldap
with ldap nfs and hadoop all supporting kerberos you should look at this solution

8858878
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome has a very nice one and firefox has firebug last incarnations of ie are also quite decent

8858893
g++	gcc
statement-expressions are a gcc g++ extension to avoid repeated evaluation of macro arguments

8858893
g++	gcc
and typeof is a gcc g++ extension also.

8858895
std	ostream
the std ostream objects all have overloaded functions

8858895
std	ostream
can only work if it returns a std ostream class or something derived from it

8858909
post	get
because is all ready an input control and you make a post normally you can get the value by using the request.form in your case this parameter gets your value on code behind

8858916
nsdata	nsjsonserialization
note however that nsjsonserialization is ios5 only so you might be better off using a library like touchjson or jsonkit both of which let you work directly with strings anyway saving you the step of converting to nsdata

8858919
nsstring	nsdata
you need to convert your nsstring to nsdata at that point you can use the method

8858946
spaces	delimiter
what i need to do is automate the task of writing to a new text file that is comma delimiter instead of spaces delimiter extract a few columns from existing data reorder the columns

8859025
mouseleave	mouseenter
note that the .css method accepts a map of multiple properties so you can set them all with a single call - i ve shown that syntax in the mouseenter but not the mouseleave so that you can compare

8859030
width	height
the flowdocument model based on frameworkcontentelement not frameworkelement does not inherit such goodness as visibility height and width settings

8859053
cpu	processors
not only is it more expensive in terms of developer costs designing a cpu is vastly more difficult than writing user-space assembly code but it would increase the transistor count of the processors

8859053
memcpy	memmove
basically the glibc folks say that memcpy behaves exactly as advertised in the standard and some other folks are complaining that memcpy should be aliased to memmove

8859069
xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
no you don t you can use any format you wish except for binary since it comes back as textual data available in jqxhr which is a superset of xmlhttprequest so you can retrieve its response.responsetext property

8859120
ssl	https
what applies to signing also applies to encryption if the middle party the user isn t meant to see what s in the saml message and or if the connection between the user and the sp or idp isn t over ssl tls usually it should be over https

8859146
dictionary	map
what about an object which is used as a map dictionary for certain data types what about a two-dimensional array where the first element of an array defines other data then the rest etc

8859150
ubuntu	linux
i was attempting to setup git-daemon i m on a linux ubuntu setup but i am not having much luck

8859189
google-chrome	firefox
i know the support for this even is patchy but right now it d only be used as a google-chrome extension firefox to come soon after so i d have to tinker with it so it should be okay for now

8859235
getter	setter
think of them as a related pair of getter and setter methods for subscripted elements

8859266
maven	pom.xml
i already asked the opposite question but now i m growing fond of maven and would like to set compiler warnings in my pom.xml that are actually mapped to the eclipse project enabling eclipse to mark wrong lines with warnings

8859269
nsstring	nsdata
first you will need to convert your nsstring to nsdata by doing the following

8859277
width	height
you can change the width of the window and scroll the lower itemscontrols surrounding scrollviewer both horizontally and vertically -- but as soon as you change the height of the window the layout will flip for several seconds

8859282
oncreate	setcontentview
1 you forgot to call the setcontentview method in your oncreate method

8859282
oncreate	setcontentview
since you d see an error in eclipse if the id was bad the most likely cause is that you forgot to call the setcontentview r.layout.some_layout_xml_file in the oncreate method of your activity

8859322
uiview	calayer
what s not apparent on the surface is that uiview does implement calayer s delegate drawlayer incontext

8859332
mp3	ogg
of those three ogg would usually be smaller than mp3

8859338
ubuntu	debian
on debian or ubuntu you could create your own service script by copying etc init.d skeleton into your etc init.d iccubedaemon and edit that file appropriately then symlinking it as etc rc2.d s99iccubedaemon etc.

8859345
post	get
this is typically just a matter of sending some parameter in get request arguments or post data but it could be more complicated

8859355
width	height
use your bitmap width and height to set up the new rects

8859381
getter	setter
i figured i could write some standard routine that has a setter getter that you always use to set get client variables

8859390
wav	ogg	mp3	ogg	mp3	wav
wav files are very large and ogg is regrettably not supported universally so mp3 is probably your best bet

8859393
uiview	calayer
it will show you how to use calayer with uiview to create the pinch zoom effect

8859407
powerpc	i386
i have successfully built sdl framework for powerpc i386 and x86_64 using the following diff

8859408
serializable	deserialization
you could wrap this serializable deserialization in a cfc that you house in the application scope as you suggest above

8859432
put	get
you re calling a webservice to get some info in essence and no apple does not put any restriction on this

8859472
memcpy	memset
in embedded systems it s common to have specialized hardware that does memcpy memset

8859475
httpwebrequest	networkcredentials
i tried to perform a post using a httpwebrequest instance to a web url that requires an authentication an asp.net mv3 standart decorated action method with build-in membership system but providing login and passowrd as networkcredentials in httpwebrequest didn t do the trick

8859477
profiling	instrumentation
run your code through instrumentation start with time profiling

8859486
globalization	localization
these analyses support a novel form of lightweight closure conversion that eliminates most closure slots using techniques such as variable globalization and localization compresses the static backchain and usually eliminates most closures from programs

8859499
getter	setter
you can do this by defining getter setter methods instead of closures

8859503
kerberos	ntlm
among others this includes basic and digest http auth ntlm and kerberos

8859526
inherited	properties
i have a couple of issues with ef 4.2 and the fluent api with code first design approach and base class properties inherited table per concrete type .

8859621
ssl	https
the https connection as always if configured with suitable cipher suites and if the client verifies the server certificate properly will protect the communication and will prevent replays of the http request since the actual http request won t be visible and since another client wouldn t be able to replay the exact same content because it would have a different ssl session id

8859623
hide	show
i can t help but feel that this is all a horrible and unneccesary hack though and you d be better off hiding the scrollbars and implementing them yourself using the delegate methods to determine when to show and hide your custom scrollbar view and the contentoffset property to determine where to position it

8859631
avr	microcontroller
the program is compiled with avr studio 4.18 under windows 7 targeting an atmega 32 microcontroller

8859652
width	height
modified your height and width feel free to change these as you please

8859677
width	height
you must add display inline-block in the element and include the css unit px when setting the width and height

8859688
width	height
instead it looks like the zoom in function only affects the img tags on the page so i d say that probably they are just dynamically modifying the width and height attributes for those tags

8859688
width	height
increasing the width and height of the container div

8859740
lte	traffic	packets	pcap
i m analyzing the tcp traffic behavior in lte network and need to find out those tcp fast retransmission packets in a large pcap file

8859759
superclass	subclassing
main would still need to assign to test using the right subclassing but test itself would be declared to be the common superclass

8859822
rar	zip
i ve created two identical binary files and compressed them using zip bz2 rar and 7z

8859825
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this was working in firefox but google-chrome safari seems to bunch all the elements on the right side of the screen on load and then animate right to left

8859840
for-loop	arrays
when generating a jlabel in an arrays you use the for-loop and say

8859841
uiview	subviews
in order to be more efficient with regards to memory usage and to get smoother scrolling performance you should create a custom uitableviewcell subclass which contains a custom uiview as subviews of the uitableviewcell s contentview

8859897
imei	udid
the udid used to be sha1 serialnumber + imei + wifiaddress + bluetoothaddress

8859905
feof	fread
additionally it seems like this behavior propagates itself into higher-level apis such as fread and feof in c -- and creates a lot of confusion about how to use feof correctly

8859908
google-chrome	safari
on google-chrome safari and internet explorer they re both the proper 15 pixels tall

8859916
onfling	gestures
the gestures recognition went well it toast the right result but the gestures detection onfling won t show the result it won t appear whether in the textview or in the logcat

8859932
multiplying	multiplication
the basic secuential multiplication algorithm takes o 1 space since it multiplying and sum one element at a time

8859969
mouse	keyboard
however any mouse move before a keyboard entry destroys the font settings

8860077
button	checkbox
i am using a jquery plugin for styling html checkbox radio button

8860098

in most ember.js and sproutcore apps and examples i have seen controllers are instantiated at app initialization

8860145
width	height
1st parameter is the image path 2nd is the width and then the height .

8860145
width	height
height and width are optional

8860160
hide	show
deciding whether to leave elements in the dom and hide show them or to create destroy elements on demand depends on the usage patterns of the app

8860160
hide	show
if you expect the user to move quickly back and forth between views hide show can make sense

8860165
filtering	grouping
and simply filtering them as you display the grouping

8860194
spaces	delimiter
that is because the used with cin will only capture the hello phrase and will stop at the first delimiter in this case a spaces

8860216
width	height
the width and height of the wrapper div have to be set to the presets

8860232

i m using devise 1.5.3 cancan 1.6.7 and rails 3.1.1

8860396
width	height
the resolution height and width returned by screen includes the full multi-monitor sizes combined width and length of the displayer buffer used to render multi-monitor setup

8860396
width	height
i ve not check of the mm millimeter width height calls returns the actual physical sizes but if it report combined physical sizes then the dpi computed from dividing one with another would be meaningless to draw a box on screen that can be measured using a physical ruler

8860469
unicode	ucs
from the wikipedia entry about the differences between unicode and iso 10646 ucs

8860489
hide	show
once the user checks-in i want to hide the check-in link and only show up check-out link.

i am trying to capture an image of a uiview with renderincontex but it does not fully capture all of the subviews

8860510
spaces	delimiter
uses split to separate the string into smaller text chunks using a spaces character as a delimiter

8860524
implements	extends
otherwise you will need to implements your own remove method and have you custom adapter extends baseadapter

8860541
integer	unsigned
it is a classical symptom of overflow - for example a 64 bit integer or a unsigned 32 bit integer assigned to a 32 bit signed integer

8860577
hide	show
in ie you ll just get a straight hide show effect but in all other modern browsers css opacity fades will be smoother and faster

8860600
innodb	myisam
so the storage engine of the initially created table was myisam but the tables created by django were having storage engine innodb

8860600
innodb	myisam
this link helped me to find out what was the storage engine for my table and then i changed the myisam engine to innodb using the belwo given command and it is working fine

8860620
subtract	add
i need help modifying it so that upon holding down d it will subtract 4 from the ball.speedmodifier variable and then add 4 upon releasing d

8860620
subtraction	addition	subtract	addition
with my current system for detecting key presses the addition and subtraction of the variable would repeat at 60 fps while i only want it to occur once until the amount is subtract again

8860626
innodb	myisam
the older tables were created using phpmyadmin and the storage engine type for the table was of myisam however the new tables created my django had a storage type of innodb

8860663
valgrind	callgrind
analyze your code with callgrind part of the valgrind suite

8860679
bellman-ford	dijkstra
it is wired you specified to use backtracking algoritm in fact dijkstra spfa or bellman-ford algorithm will be perfect to solve your problem

8860722
google-chrome	firefox
it s a css transitions framework and although i don t do ios development lea verou mentions that she test it on firefox and google-chrome for ios

8860796
for-loop	loops
in the above code the final long type variable current_millis holds the current millisecond maintained by the system which is always less than max_val the size of the long data type in java though the for-loop gets stuck into an infinite loops

8860798

it s easy to setup just drop the min directory in your root folder then go to to add files to the minify url

8860800
width	height
the page s height width and so on are all databound like so

8860810
chown	chmod
try changing the script s owner with the chmod command or give the file you re trying to run more liberal access permissions with the chown command

8860859
ant	maven
it would require writing proper plugins for preprocessing files before compilation phase for ant maven build and a plugin to ide

8860862
superclass	subclassing
whenever you instantiate the subclassing the superclass constructor must be called before the execution of subclassing constructor

8860866
post	get
there s which when run in sapi mode will always contain the method of the http request get post delete head etc..

8860872
stdout	stderr
most probably stdout will be printed after stderr

8860872
stdout	stderr
now stdout will be printed synchronously just as stderr is and the resulting order of printed strings should be the intuitive one

8860872
stdout	stderr	stdout	fflush	stderr	fflush
first piece of data written to stderr causes stdout to fflush

8860882
int	double
however i am solving a slightly different problem where the constraint is the budget price in double not int

8860882
int	double
double is continuous unlike int where i can have 1 2 3 ..

8860882
int	double
i thought of converting double to int by multiply by 100

8860882
int	double
items have a price double satisfaction int value

8860882
int	double
here i can t as budget is a double not int

8860890
portrait	landscape
the only problem i am having is that i am in landscape mode and the accelerometer is reading as it is in portrait

8860904
profiler	gprof
the gnu profiler gprof

8860904
gcov	gprof
gprof and gcov are basically useless on multithreaded programs

8860934
width	height
css3 gradients are background images so they will fill the entire height and width of the block element just as if it were a solid color

8861001
post	get
this is basically what i want to do with the params given in a form i want to do a get post request to a site this site expects an specific url like size xxx and it will give me back a json i want to parse save the data from this json into my rails app when the form is submitted

8861001

8861011
uilabel	uibutton
uibutton will be a subview of uilabel

8861013
int	chars
but it usually doesn t matter because there is an implicit conversion from int literals to the types byte short and chars

8861030
uiview	subviews
and in ibaction i have a uiview as subviews like this

8861039
jobs	cron

width	height
here once the min width is past 768px then the code inside the function would be called so for you the equal height code

8861154
pop-up	dialog
solver considers each intermediate step to be a scenario . you can save each one by giving it a name in the scenario dialog box that pop-up after each iteration

8861157
pull	push
so it very useful that the common subrepo in both projects push and pull from

8861159
pop-up	dialog
jquery pop-up dialog box

8861189
post	get
if that happens then ie has a tendency to send both a get and post request

8861201

an additional side effect of absolute positioning is that the height of the parent element will be uneffected by the height or position of those absolute elements so if those elements are the only children of that #membership div it must have a declared height and width in order to take up real space in your layout

8865693
ati	nvidia
but if you install nvidia or amd ati propriatary drivers it will be those who implement opengl on your system

8865739
hide	show
i also currently have some jquery that makes it so when you click on one of the tags_list filter button it toggles any story_list element to hide or show depending on whether or not the tags_list button is selected or not

8865739

width	height
you aren t setting the width and height on the element itself which means it will scale your lines in funny ways depending how what you ve set in your css

8865836
src	attr
the only problem it seems to have is that while using .ajax on success part the src attr or anything else really like .css applies for one the first time only

8865837
invokelater	invokeandwait
your main method must be wrapped into invokelater or invokeandwait that s basic swing rule to create swing gui on eventdispashthread

is the user only put in as dependency to get something from it

8865913

this means that you can set the width and height to smaller than the contents and the contents will still be accessible when scrolling if they are bigger than the container

8866108
width	height
the children s sizes are unaffected unless their width height is based upon that of this view

8866108
portrait	landscape
if not you will want a layout file for portrait the current one and then an adjusted one for landscape mode

8866125
int	boolean
thomas proposed an int based solution that is identical to the one i have above except that it uses a trick by multiplying boolean values

8866126

8866148
ceil	floor
in the end try to check all of the integer solutions - try to round each value to floor or ceil

8866190

8866741

8866808
button	checkbox
the ui components such as button checkbox listviews and so on serve very different purposes and it is not the place of an activity in it s basic form to know what events those ui elements react to click long-click swipe etc simply because there is no pre-defined set of ui elements that an activity will always host

8868950
mdpi	hdpi
back in android development i had four sets of resolutions ldpi mdpi hdpi and xhigh and behind the scenes android maps the device resolution to any of these four sets is there something similar in lwuit for raster graphics some way to map the dimensions to a grouped set of resolutions

8868970
button	checkbox
now i want to set the enable disable modes of image button based on checkbox status

8868999
free	malloc
while its usually better to use ns objects when you have collections of non-objects it s a trade-off between managing the memory yourself using malloc free or coercing non-object data into a storable object

8869028
min	max
the autoscale property you are referring to is the setting for the xaxis scales its min and max values

8869058
folder	directory
it depends which platform you are running or on which filesystem are remote directory available.if you are on windows just map remote directory using command net use on linux you can mount by nfs sshfs ftpfs fuse or anything else.java just needs to be folder mounted in filesystem hierarchy

8869063
client-side	server-side
i mean client-side then server-side

8869096
multiplying	add
which is just a double that contains the number of seconds - so you would add all the above up into that one nstimeinterval multiplying it by 2 and then you could express any pretty printing with the and and the like in nsdate

8869102
client-side	server-side
client-side validation is nice for your users but server-side is a must

8869113
width	height
slika is the link of the picture sirina is the width visina is height and save is the path to save

i am working on mvc post get requests but i observed some strange behavior

8869228
nhibernate	queryover
from what i read queryover is dedicated to nhibernate and more powerfull for complicated

8869231
int	double
this is the reason that you end up with a decimal number in this case 1 133 0.007 and 1 133 15372 still 0.007 since is actually a remainder operator in c# and not an int modulus otherwise it wouldn t work on a double anyway

8869233
rvm	bundler
both bundler and rvm are tools that is not absolutly necessary to use but they will help you

8869233
versioning	upgrade
regarding what versioning of rails to use i do agree that you should try to use 3.1 versioning if possible but if you find some example application using rails 3.0 you do not need to upgrade it

8869258
mdpi	hdpi
first i put the images on the hdpi folder images on 7.0 plus is smaller and ugly so i copied them to mdpi folder works fine but this would double the size of my apk

8869288
jar	manifest.mf
why some properties of my application should be mentioned in a single and simple .jad file instead of the metainf manifest.mf file of the jar file

8869357
implements	extends
there s no need to extends messagehandler as you can implements both the processing and validation -logic outside of the handler either separately or in a single class that implements both processing and validation

8869384
put	get
when i put the url to logout which was generated to link the user back to the main page which requires login something i have done before with the python version of gae without all the ajax stuff instead of getting asked to login again and then seeing the main page i just get a 404 not found _ah myapp.html

someone can show me how i can set the maximum width height for image

8869469
children	parent
there is nothing wrong with having one query or procedure which returns the children for a given parent multiple times like

8869505
ddms	hprof
edit you can dump hprof in ddms view

8869515
width	height
the solution in the end was to measure the child views and pass in a measure spec forcing them to be an exact width height

8869586
bazaar	cvs
i tested it with gnu emacs 24.0.92.1 cedet version 1.1beta last checkout from bazaar and the last checkout of ecb from cvs

8869591
nsstring	nsdata
however when i start the programe i get an exc_bad_access error at the cell.imageview.image line together with a incompatible pointer types sending nsstring to paramater of type nsdata

8869636
innodb	myisam
if you are not using transactions while storing or updating tables switch table type to myisam its quite faster than innodb with much less overhead

8869648
post	get
i followed all the steps mentioned in the post but still i did not get it and i don t know why

8869652
free	qsort
implementations are even free to implement qsort as a bubble sort but only if they want to be ridiculed and possibly go out of business

8869661
lsof	uptime
psutil is a module providing an interface for retrieving information on all running processes and system utilization cpu disk memory in a portable way by using python implementing many functionalities offered by command line tools such as ps top df kill free lsof netstat ifconfig nice ionice iostat iotop uptime tty

it currently supports linux windows osx and freebsd both

8869673
nsstring	nsdata
incompatible pointer types sending nsstring to paramater of type nsdata

8869673
nsstring	nsdata
an nsstring was supplied as a parameter instead of an nsdata

8869681
stateless	stateful
and finally it makes the application stateful whereas it could stay stateless by having the friend list page simply link to the friend info page by using a link such as

8869685
invokelater	invokeandwait
3 create some threadfactory or implements executor notice output to the gui must be wraped into invokelater in some cases required into invokeandwait

8869699
screens	mdpi
however if you put all you images in mdpi directory only android will scale theme for hpdi screens

8869714
google-chrome	safari
in my case i ve looked at and determined that only google-chrome impersonates safari in the last section

8869724
jasmine	qunit
i m writing specs for different test cases for jasmine and qunit to compare them and they looked the same before i needed to write a test to check if an event is binded to an element

8869772
g++	gcc
you need to compile and link c++ code with g++ not gcc

8869797
apache	nginx
with mod_rails for example settings like passenger_min_instances and passenger_pool_idle_time give you very granular control over this edit nginx version - apache version here

8869825
webclient	httpwebrequest
also look at webclient and httpwebrequest classes

8869832
opera	safari
so do internet explorer 8+ opera safari and potentially other modern browsers

8869906
try-catch	exception-handling
since the catch block will be executed only in case of an exception-handling it really makes no difference if you wrap the for-each loop inside the try block or if you put the try-catch inside the loop s body

8869919
post	get
to get an access token to be able to post to a page s wall see the page login part of that link

8869920
min	max
for example consider a templated cycle class that cycles through values of type type between the values min and max

8869932
getter	setter
netbeans is capable of doing encapsulation but it will just put a list of setter getter functions into the same file

8869950
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
depending on your version of vs you will use wsdl.exe or svcutil.exe from the command line to generate a proxy from a wsdl file on your local system

8870008
free	malloc
one advantage of mmap over malloc i can think of is that memory is immediately returned to the os when you do munmap whereas with malloc free i guess memory uptil the data segment break point is never returned but kept for reusage

8870032
punctuation	words
i need to split a phrase into words digits punctuation marks and spaces tabs

8870035
mouse	keyboard
what it did is reset the selectedindex and selectedtext properties and didn t allow them to change to the new value due to keyboard or mouse input

8870037
google-chrome	firefox
the code works great in google-chrome but in firefox it moves focus and then changes the value on the element just moved to

8870043
post	get
be aware that you are mixing get and post parameters

8870057
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested this on firefox and google-chrome and worked fine

8870086
children	parent
it seems to be out of the static flow but its children namely h2 .newsletter-text and .newsletter-paragraph are all displaying fine yet outside of their parent the white box of .footer-newsletter

8870099
width	height
i m accessing the button s height and width using jquery s methods and via accessing .css height and i get two wrong answers

8870110
google-chrome	firefox
they are tested with the current versions of firefox and google-chrome i can t test with ie9

8870125
width	height
to get the computed amounts for the width height of an element including it s border+padding you can use outerwidth outerheight

8870125
width	height
inner height 46 inner width 186

8870125
width	height
height 46 width 186

8870125
width	height
css height 46px css width 186px

8870166
floating-point	integer
if numerator and denominator are numbers that can t be exactly represented in floating-point 0.3 and 0.1 then the result might not be an exact integer it might be 3.0000001 instead of 3

8870193
min	max
what i try to to is generate an array of random int values where the random values are taken between a min and a max

8870194
portrait	landscape
it s better than add same line to onconfigurationchanged because your app will turn to portrait mode and then back to landscape it will happen only one time but it s annoying

8870219
websphere	ibm
we are doing xml to copybook and vice versa conversions in a middleware system using ibm websphere transformation extender

8870223
folder	directory
the problem is that once i added this rule it disables directory listing but also redirects any call to a specific folder that doesn t contains an index

8870223
folder	directory
before access to a x folder would return a directory listing

8870229
post	put
put render post show instead of redirect_to post_path post in your commentscontroller

8870265
hash	salt
the salt you use to hash the password is stored in the resulting hash - this means there is no need to store it in the database as it can be recovered from the hash

8870268
stdout	stderr
according to the android documentation stdout stderr output to dev null

8870268
stdout	stderr
by default the android system sends stdout and stderr system.out and system.err output to dev null

8870268
stdout	stderr
in this case the system writes the messages to the log using the log tags stdout and stderr both with priority i

8870278
fflush	gets
this create a memory leak for the one androidbuf stream which is however somewhat intentional the stream may be written to after main is exited and it is fflush when when std cout gets destroyed

8870287
google-chrome	firefox
basically flash does not send your cookies or sends ie cookies on firefox and google-chrome etc. so your sessionid is not sent with your upload.aspx request in those browsers

8870319
hash	salt
if all the passwords are hash using a common salt then the attacker can easily find people using common passwords

8870319
hash	salt
on the other hand if every password has its own salt and there are 1 million passwords in the database an attacker must calculate 1 million hash in order to check just one password so it s much more secure

8870369
maven	pom.xml
here s what it looks like when you point to the file using the maven pom.xml editor in eclipse

8870432
width	height
the images in the slideshow have a width and height of 100

8870462
nfa	dfa
re2 would work but i don t know if the python bindings let you tune how large you allow a dfa to be before it just throws away the compiled dfa data and does nfa search

8870510
superclass	subclassing
if they don t the superclass behavior is executed when the method is invoked on a subclassing

8870520
ant	maven
use ant maven or any other build tool that is much more flexible than eclipse doesn t need a gui can be scripted and used by a continuous integration server

8870568
mdpi	hdpi
i found a of information about what drawables to use hdpi mdpi ldpi on stackoverflow

8870604
mathml	tex
however fricas can export the output only as tex fortran mathml html texmacs

8870631
xml-conduit	hxt
if you want to do this for formatting purposes then i would suggest parsing the mathml with an xml parser such as xml-conduit or hxt and processing that instead

8870631
mathml	tex
the main problem you ll run into is that both tex and mathml are going to be describing the appearance of the formula rather than its semantics

8870652
google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to do a userscript for google-chrome and greasemonkey in firefox

8870652
google-chrome	firefox
the request code seems to work in both browsers but in firefox the responsetext is empty in contrast to google-chrome where i get the expected response

8870652
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome this works perfectly but the responsetext is empty in firefox

8870670
post	get
the original client with the get request and even when i modified it to use a post request

8870697
mouse	keyboard
i ve already written a c# program that finds the handle for the process i m interested in and can interact with it by emulating mouse clicks and keyboard strokes

8870749
cpu	processors
the big iron answer is generally one thread per limited resource -- processors cpu bound arm i o bound etc -- but that only works if you can route the work to the correct thread for the resource to be accessed

8870758
public	protected
the abc property must be public protected or internal

8870760
ant	maven
there are many advantages to having ant or maven build your project

8870761
width	height
also in css explicitly set height width for the map_canvas

8870790
post	get
as far as i can see first method is using get method while second method is using post method

8870804
width	height
get the image height or width

8870804
width	height
divide the height or width by the density so you get the length in inches

8870812
accessor	properties
you only need to specify a private access modifier for your set accessor when the properties is more accessible

8870818
jqgrid	jquery-ui-autocomplete
i m using jqgrid in a project and have managed to replace some of the controls on the edit input modal with a jquery-ui-autocomplete control but would prefer something like a combobox

8870836
width	height
specify the required width height and it will scale the image appropriately although if there is too much of scaling.

8870877
x86	64bit
information to see whether you need a x86 32-bit or x64 64bit

8870898
maven	cargo	ant	maven
it is often used to start containers for integration and functional tests especially with maven cargo - maven or ant cargo - ant

8870898
ant	maven
ant tasks and maven 2 maven 3 plugins

8870899
ant	maven
it is often used to start containers for integration and functional tests especially with maven or ant

8870901
post	get
so my goal was seemingly simple get the number of wall post for the day

8870915
dictionary	map
in case you re be creating a list of mutable values such as dictionary or lists and you need them to be distinct you can either use map as you did in the question or write an equivalent list comprehension

8870974
pop-up	dialog
4 start this activity from where you want a pop-up window above tag make your activity as pop-up dialog instead of full screen layout

8870990
fadein	fadeout
check out the jquery fadein and fadeout functions

8871068
tinyint	boolean
also there is a special treatment to boolean types in atk4 models and does not directly correspond to the same boolean type in mysql which is simply equivalent to tinyint 1

8871107
maven	pom.xml
you can use github as a maven repository --this is not the same thing as directly referencing a project and that it has a pom.xml file means only that it s a maven project

8871109
post	get
the result i get as a response is not identical to the stream i see as a facebbok user many post are missing - on facebook page in the news feed i can see much more post than i get back in the response

8871129
post	get
not sure if i understand the question but if the problem is that the form data can come in either as a post or get the solution is to check whether the post data is there

8871129
post	get
if it is use post otherwise take the data from get

8871129
post	get
if the function should do different things depending on whether the form has been sent as post or get then simply make two different functions in the controller

8871152
post	get
this way the server will instruct the client to send a brand new get request on the given resource instead of using the given resource as response for the current post request as will happen with a forward

8871202
rspec	capybara
make them a part of your end-to-end tests preferably using cucumber or rspec capybara

8871214
post	get
from this query you get the stream items for the user as well as the comments object for each of those post

8871223
pop-up	dialog
a dialog will pop-up with parent the widget in which you are using this function

8871223
pop-up	dialog
the default value of the spinbox what you see when the dialog pop-up will be 37.56

8871253
uiview	subviews
in my project i have a simple uiview with a uiscrollview subviews

8871283
int	chars
the first column values are all int the others chars values

8871285
implements	extends
to reduce dependece of class i want to send parameter using generic class to constructor that extends some class and implements interface for example

8871289
submit	submission
but when i go and fill the lastname and directly click to submit button the button moves up without submission and when i click to it again it gets submitted

8871347
button	checkbox
i am trying to read from a dynamically created checkbox on button click

8871455
jar	manifest.mf
i need to read some attributes of manifest.mf that are included in jar file

8871479
bufferedreader	urlconnection
as an aside you should also close your bufferedreader and urlconnection values in a finally block so they re closed even in the case of an exception

8871481
width	height
advanced managers allow to define groups of columns rows which are sized to equal width height always

8871498
min	max
i guess that computing min and max for latitude longitude will not be complicated in your array

8871538
implements	extends
t must extends fragment and implements someinterface

8871538
implements	extends
that would require an object of type t to both extends fragment and implements someinterface

8871549
implements	extends
it s easy if i understand you correct you to have some type t which is extends fragment and implements some interface

8871575
post	get
so i am playing with some async stuff in wpf and i am trying to load a combobox with some xml data i pull back from the stack overflow feeds i am getting the data no problem and i can see that the combo box is populating but i can t seem to get the title of the post

8871587
bash	zsh
when i try and run bash test from my terminal window zsh i get errors saying autoload and compinit commands are not found

8871600
cos	sin
i use sin cos tan but the problem is that since sin cos tan only returns an angle that is always the right side my objects never move to the left side..

8871624
bash	zsh
in your script you re using bash to run a zsh script

8871624
bash	zsh
either change bash to zsh in the shebang line or write the script with bash commands

8871629
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome will let you know that an extension is blocking content but firefox will simply not display it

8871657
cos	sin
you shouldn t be using trigonometric functions sin cos tan etc.

8871691
inherited	properties
i think because checkboxlist inherited from listcontrol and items properties is inherited from listcontrol

8871698
hide	show
i am using below code to show hide my subview

8871698
hide	show
how can i set the subview y-axis value in this code because when the subview gets on the screen it hide my screen header bar and i am using a button to show hide the subview i also want to animate that button so that when the button is clicked button s position should also be changed along y-axis

8871717

strtol	atoi
secure cert coding advises to use strtol instead of atoi read

8871757
getter	setter
i am not new when it comes to these setter and getter i have background with programming specifically java

8871757
getter	setter
in java you use setter and getter like this

8871763
rsa	dsa
generate a new dsa key with ssh-keygen -t dsa if you just have an rsa

8871808
getter	setter
the difference here is that in java getter and setter are simply methods that follow a certain convention getxxx setxxx

8871808
getter	setter
in c# properties are a first-class construct even though they are basically getter and setter behind the scenes

8871808
getter	setter
so c# provides these as a shorthand way of saying you might implement encapsulation later add behavior to the getter or setter but you don t want to break consumers of your class so you are declaring them as properties up front

8871810
getter	setter
in comparision to java where getter setter are simply methods this construct is called a property in c# and is a compiler feature

8871819
rss	feed
i am making an app for my college where we have to parse rss feed and display it

8871819
rss	feed
first of all i want to run it as a service so that it may notify users about new events i.e new updates from rss and how should i differentiate between the old rss feed parsed and the new one so that i can show only the new updates

8871884
qpushbutton	qwidget	qpushbutton	qobject	qobject	qwidget
for qpushbutton the only four widget signals apart from those of qwidget and qobject are the signals inherited from qabstractbutton

8871974
google-chrome	firefox
however i ve noticed that google-chrome and firefox have different interpretations of what a global function declaration is

8871974
google-chrome	firefox
in particular google-chrome is happy reading a function declaration that is inside an if block in the first pass but firefox is not

8871974
google-chrome	firefox
i m using google-chrome 16.0.912.75 and firefox 9.0.1

x86	64bit
if this is the case you either need to get a 64bit version of eclipse or install a 32bit jdk and point eclipse to that in 64bit windows 7 the 32-bit stuff is under c program files x86

8872164
google-chrome	firefox

which means the getproperties method walks up the inherited chain from bottom up when discovering the properties

8872331
chown	sudo
then i ran sudo chown jansensan -r usr lib haxe replacing myusername with my actual username jansensan and then i get an error chown -r no such file or directory

vbo	vao
to answer the second part of your question you either can have different vaos and vbos for different parts of the mesh so drawing separate parts is easy or you can fuse all into one vao vbo pair so you need not call often and use multiple calls to draw individual parts of the mesh as seen in the code above - imagine the first gldrawelements draws the ship and the second draws the turret you just update some matrix uniform between the calls

8872473

don t know why you at least try to use properties in setter but use local variables in getter

8872868
int	chars
you are trying to scan an int but the scanf argument expects an string chars array

8872905
inherited	properties
you should use css properties display not on parent div but on child ones because it cannot be inherited

8873000

all the information i could find out about those types was that integer is signed and has a floating unlimited bit-size int64 and word64 are fixed and signed and unsigned respectively

8873001
hide	show
you create a jquery object for the hover elements with and then use .find on it to search the children objects for the desired objects to hide show

8873020
for-loop	arrays
.each is an internal iterator and i m pretty sure the for-loop will run slower than the enumerable each method that arrays inherit

8873056
children	parent
instead of having unique message ids that are all parent children i decided to have one main thread mid and then have messages in it â which are all defined by the seq sequence number column

8873102
post	get
i m trying to send a post request from a page which already contains a get parameter

8873152
post	put
to keep my api rest-ful i left in the normal handling of put and delete and added this to the post handling

8873152
post	put
it keeps the request method as post and sends the x-http-method-override as put or delete

8873170
put	get
my plan is whenever a get fails the caller then constructs the correct value for the key does a put which does locking relative to other puts and stuffs an object into the array

8873178
vim	sublimetext	komodo	sublimetext
i ve been using symfony since version 0.6 and have used zend studio both the earlier versions and the later eclipse based versions eclipse komodo netbeans vim e texteditor and sublimetext

note 1 from experiences like this i have learned to pick my gems carefully rating how popular a gem is as a pretty good idea of how mainstream and thus how likely to be upgrade for both ruby and rails versioning

8873452
folder	directory
i have set up mercurial on my linux machines not tried on windows yet i have 1 set up an email in the .hgrc and used the very same file on all machines 2 i have done hg init followed by hg add and hg commit -m first commit in all the folder i want to track 3 i have done hg clone home docs media usbname docs and have verified that a clone did indeed get copied onto the usb flashdrive 4 i have tested that adding files and doing hg push media usbname docs does copy the new file into the clone directory onto the usb flashdrive but 5 i created a new directory with some new files and that won t get pushed

fyi the gridview has gravity center stretch mode columnwidth height and width are fill parent

8873508

there is a generator itertools.permutations with which you can gather all permutation of a sequence with a specified length

8873549
oncreate	setcontentview	oncreate	findviewbyid	setcontentview	findviewbyid
that is because you can t call findviewbyid if you don t have called setcontentview which is in your oncreate method

8873584

eventually i would like to be able to track a florescent object with the camera and calculate properties about distance height width etc

8873593
oncreate	setcontentview
and so on and in oncreate after your call to setcontentview do

8873607
nsdictionary	restkit
two obvious ones do not look very promising get the resulting nsdictionary and try to deserialize myself effectively reimplementing restkit or try to dive into restkit source and see if this can be somehow exposed looks tedious and error prone

8873610

i ve tried binding the to the hover mouseenter mouseover sort sortover events with no luck

8873611

int	double
try storing your positions as double and only converting them to int when you need to pass them to the drawing functions

8873691
for-loop	loops
the best you can do to avoid for-loop is to use .each which is a loops written in a more functional way

8873878
bash	zsh
both bash and zsh are derived from the bourne shell whose behavior is standardized by posix so any script designed to work with bin sh is likely to work with either bash or zsh

8873878
bash	zsh
but if you re going to be using both zsh and bash it probably makes a lot more sense to have separate .bashrc and .zshrc files and use each one only with the shell for which it s designed

8873882

because attr_accessor does not link to the ar magic all it can be used for creating transient fields which are not persistent ar does not know of or care about instances variables

8874044
hide	show
the first part of your hover handler with never actually fires so whenever you click your handler assumes that you are not hovering the lists button and therefore hide the menu just for the handler to show it again milliseconds later

8874060

background-image	background-position
i display the icon via background-image with background-position on img tag using sprite icon

8875354

getter	setter
what the article is basically saying is to avoid the getter setter patten when you can get away with it

implements	modifiers
in java all methods are virtual that aren t marked with the private or final modifiers so they are saying that if your code isn t interface to be implements by other classes just access the fields directly

8876540
getter	setter
most likely the reason they point this out is because traditionally the java recommendation has been to always use the getter setter pattern so that your variables can be kept private

8876540
getter	setter
if you re creating an api that other classes will implement then maybe it s worth it to take the performance hit of getter setter

8876540
getter	setter
external classes accessing your class will also experience the same performance gain by accessing the variable directly but at some point you need to do a performance-to-maintainability assessment to see if you are comfortable making those variables public or if it s worth it to take the hit and use getter setter methods

8876591
getter	setter
create property in you action class with same name as the form fields name and provide there getter and setter

8876599

rational-numbers	fractions

to load fullscreen or fullresolution image and compare its width and height is to heavy

8881758
docx	xlsx
you re going to struggle to find a library to do this simply because wp as of 7.1 doesn t include the system.io.packaging namespace which most libraries will depend on to read write docx xlsx etc files

8881780
children	parent
first as far as i know you can t move layout children outside their parent

8881780
width	height
make sure your layout s root node has width and height set to wrap_content

8881780
width	height
next add another layout to your root node framelayout would probably work with a custom drawable for a background or use the one that the default dialog uses from the framework and width and height set to fill_parent or match_parent

8881780
width	height
the problem here is that the phony background needs to have width and height set to relative to the other ui elements so it sort of has to encompass them so it can properly measure its own width and height relative to them

8881786
maven-failsafe-plugin	maven-surefire-plugin
i am confused between the concept of using maven-surefire-plugin or maven-failsafe-plugin to run my selenium tests in integration test phase without running unit tests

8881786
maven-failsafe-plugin	maven-surefire-plugin
i see some examples uses maven-surefire-plugin and other examples uses maven-failsafe-plugin

8881813
persistent	transient
if a clonecopypolicy is used then the object from the persistent context will be cloned into the shared cache preserving the transient fields

8881813
instances	transient
if a instantiationcopypolicy is used then a new instances will be created for the shared cache and transient will not be preserved

8881821
super	extends
i thought of defining a new class newcolor that extends color and throws the modified exception in the constructor but the new class constructor must start with a call to super red green blu and so the standard testcolorvaluerange int r int g int b int a is called and the standard exception is thrown

8881830
bmp	png
i get strange output dependent on the encoder used bmp gives a little maybe 10x10 pixel image of the centre of the image in a sea of black png does the same without the black

8881830
bmp	png
the displayed area looks as if the picture has been cropped by a thumbnail outline just to describe the visula effect furthermore if you then open the png in paint the whole picture is there and displayed but not for the bmp version irfanview cannot cope with either of the files

8881835

if you want to be sure its gone check this directory users insert_your_user_here library application support iphone simulator for your app s folder under the version you re running

8881973
min	max
calculating the max mean min of a chunked version is very simple and efficient if you use a 2d view of the original array and the axis keyword arg to x.min x.max etc

8881988
portrait	landscape
i would like each page to load either a portrait or landscape version of an img depending on the orientation of the device

8882079
serializable	deserialization
you can use ondeserializedattribute and its related attributes onserializing onserialized ondeserializing to create special methods that are called during the serializable deserialization process

8882086
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it s working fine in google-chrome firefox safari iphone ipad but not in android 2.3.6 default browser

8882170
serializable	deserialization
cereal handles both serializable and deserialization but blaze-builder only does serializable

8882184
prepare	execute
also as ilion notes try to prepare the statement just once and then re- execute multiple times with different bind values

8882212

jtable	jlabel
basically the panel is made up of 2 jtable separated by a jlabel just a thick black line

8882398
google-chrome	safari
note partial support in safari google-chrome refers to requiring an outdated gradient syntax to work

8882475
division	multiplication
so you should change the operation order between the multiplication and the division

8882477
lxml.html	beautifulsoup
you should use an html parser such as lxml.html or beautifulsoup

8882500
getter	setter
the problem here is that to enable domain class properties being automatically persistent without having to configure them fields must be properties they have to have a public getter setter pair of the same type

8882500
getter	setter
groovy does this for you when you add a public field - it makes the field private and creates a public getter and setter

8882500
getter	setter
but if you have a getter or setter already it doesn t do that and if they re not both public then they re not considered a property in the javabean sense so the field isn t persistent

8882507

the main problem is that sometimes other variables are between min max ..

8882718
post	get
see this post regarding how to get access to the wordeditor from the active inspector

8882726
url.action	actionlink
even if you don t want to use the actionlink helper you should use the url.action helper to generate your url

8882738
return-value-optimization	nrvo
most compilers implement return-value-optimization return-value-optimization and named return-value-optimization nrvo

8882754
uitabbaritem	uitabbarcontroller
i would like to place all uitabbaritem of my uitabbarcontroller on the left but one on the right

8882798
subtract	add
here you add everything that is larger than today - 7 and subtract everything more than today

keydown	keyup
i also tried to use keyup and keydown but these also didnt work

8883040
post	get
i get all my post like this

8883041
wsimport	xjc
start with xml schema which describes your object model then run xjc or wsimport tools from jdk which would generate you your java classes

8883046
shadowing	named
to assign values to a global variable in your code you ve got to mark it as such otherwise the code would be assigning to a local variable with the same named that would be actually shadowing the global variable

8883051
momentjs	datejs
i am pretty sure momentjs is was inspired by datejs does not extend the native date object

8883069
put	get
at the moment i cannot get the data out as it is not a valid datatype to put into my oledb reader so it must be converted database side

8883108
box-sizing	border-box	height	border-box
looks like webkit s box-sizing is content-box and mozilla s is border-box making webkit s cell-height 242px height + padding + border and mozilla s 200px

8883108
box-sizing	border-box
simply set box-sizing border-box for consistency between the two modern browsers

8883108
google-chrome	safari
while the above fixes google-chrome webkit it does not seem to fix safari 5.1 webkit

8883108
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
here s a new that works in my safari google-chrome and firefox versions

8883113
nsinteger	double
compare the two storing the result in an nsinteger or double as needed

8883122
sorting	filtering
usually there is special logic for converting the data objects into view models including aggregating filtering and sorting

8883136
postgresql	mysql
however i find postgresql to support more sql features than mysql and be more efficient when handling more data

8883154
google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to implement html5 video in a site and for that i m using videojs so far it works great in firefox and google-chrome but my problem comes when i try to play the video with ie9

8883231
subtract	add
i want the change_value to automatically add subtract item.qty

8883250
subtract	add
this doesn t make sense because we are trying to subtract from the nsdate rather than add to it

8883255
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox google-chrome iphone safari etc

8883328
put	get
options 2 put ids into sorted set then use mget to get values out if your keys are hashes then you need to issue multiple hget but the advantage is that you can pull out specific parts of the object that you actually need instead of everything

8883345
children	parent
but since you are not following good practices here and are directly passing your domain models to the view instead of using view models you will have a problem with the recursive relationship you have between the children and parent

8883345
children	parent
you might need to manually populate the parent for each children

8883345
children	parent
but a better way would be to query your database in the post action and fetch the children that are associated to the given parent since the user cannot edit the children inside the view anyway

8883381
mouseover	mouseout
if the events are in opposite order mouseover declared first then mouseout the toolbar will only get the mouseout listener

8883410
decoder	encoder
i can see one trade off of this method being the size of the application since including mylib.h would include the code for the encoder and decoder if the encoder and decoder were separate applications

8883457
user-controls	elementhost
you need to create a normal winforms pane then add a wpf user-controls to it using elementhost

8883482
portrait	landscape
isn t the configuration orientation being changed when i go into landscape as well as portrait modes

8883494
bids	ssis
i would approach this task using ssis providing you have business intelligence development studio bids installed

8883503
width	height
however when i query the elements width height it reports the size of the element before the transform was applied

8883524
docx	xlsx
docx and xlsx files error in the client application

8883535
width	height
since the height width is calculated on the visible viewport the soft keyboard apparently causes the orientation to flip now that the viewport width is less than the height

8883535
width	height
this makes it more flexible across devices regardless of orientation not to mention width height is more widely supported than orientation

8883556
folder	directory
in bitbucket if i try and create a repository into an existing folder i get an error complaining that it is not an empty directory

8883567
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction
i implemented addition subtraction and multiplication and now i m implementing division and mod

8883567
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction
when i test operations on a 108-digit number and a 67-digit number it takes 1.9ms to calculate division much slower than other operations 0.007 0.008ms to calculate addition subtraction 0.1ms to calculate multiplication

8883577
inherited	properties
the properties not implemented by the classes who inherited from the abstract class don t get the correct values

8883605
post	get
well use a get request then or change the webservice method to accept post

8883633
calloc	malloc
the primary use for such declarations is for structures which will be allocated using malloc calloc or other similar mechanism

8883633
int	chars
void test chars new_name int new_name_length

8883648
versioning	upgrade
then when you upgrade use the same settings and your logging will be seamless between the 2 versioning

8883652
actionscript	mxml
i m new to flex i ve tried to do this using a cartesiandatacanvas inside backgroundelements in mxml then using actionscript to draw lines on the data canvas using moveto x1 y1 and lineto x2 y2 which draws a line between x1 y1 and x2 y2

8883682
chmod	mkdir
i m getting a warning for mkdir chmod touch rename and include

8883685
nunit	moq
i m using moq nunit and thinking that autofixture s likeness should get the job done

8883687

if you want o keep this from happening you must specify their width and height

8883696
sudo	passwd
executing sudo -p sudo passwd bash -l -c cp home ubuntu .ssh authorized_keys root .ssh

8883763
lxml	beautifulsoup
for your second part of the question you need to use a third party library html xml parser like lxml or beautifulsoup with urllib to use xpath

8883773
portrait	landscape
the problem is when i click the back button the bar where the title of the carrier and time gets displayed remains landscape for views that is suppose to be portrait

8883821
width	height
another reason is user preferences for border width aero and caption bar height

8883833
listview	gridview
a listview in combination with a gridview however would provide columns already so you just need to create a grid in the second column you could style the headers to be collapsed

8883845
getter	setter
the easiest and safest way is to make the brokerinstruments property getter return an ienumerable remove the setter and add a addbrokerinstrument method

8883846
screens	tablet
on a tablet where you have enough screens size you might have a list of mails on the left side and the actual mail content in the center part

8883876
valgrind	callgrind
if your program isn t taking too long to execute valgrind callgrind + kcachegrind + compiling with debugging turned on -g is one of the best methods of how to tell where a program is spending time while it is running in user mode

8884013

you can then access the child collection and the children of parent with id 1 will be loaded lazily

8884062
opera	firefox
in firefox and opera the div scrolls with the page content until it reaches its end at which point it becomes fixed as the rest of the page continues scrolling

8884102
google-chrome	safari
assuming you re on android iphone safari or google-chrome this is the webkittransform property

8884115
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome the new line character simply converts to a space

8884125
uilabel	uibutton
as long as it doesn t matter which part of your button content gets tapped to activate it s functions you could compose a uibutton along with all the uilabel uiimageviews you need

8884126
for-loop	loops
make sure all work items exit the for-loop at the same time - or better yet put the barrier outside loops

8884128
post	get
is there a way that i can escape from the array or do i need to have a separate post function to get this information

8884132
post	get
i have been making an http post request but i am not able to get the data at server side

8884133
int	double
now maybe you actually passed a double typically taking up twice as much memory as an int in which case printf will just take 32 of those bits and represented them as an int

8884136
hide	show
unwanted flickering effect when using hide and show in jquery

8884138
children	parent
what i d like to do is i d like to pull all the children not only direct children but all of them children of children of children etc. of a specific parent

8884158
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
you could use a custom-made onitemclicklistener that implements onclicklistener

8884197
google-chrome	firefox
we developed an as3 facebook application but unfortunately the authenification popup is blocked in all major browsers ie firefox google-chrome which leads to a high rejection rate for our campaign

8884208
radio-button	checkbox
not really caring what the image was i had my form designer try checkbox grapics instead although leaving the field with radio-button functionality

8884213
getter	setter	put	get
public properties with public getter setter do not get serialized unless i specifically put on them

8884235

filtering	grouping	sorting	grouping	sorting	filtering
i am looking for a javascript library that manipulates arrays of objects mainly for filtering sorting and grouping counts

textview	imageview
here is an example of how you would create a custom dialog with textview and imageview for your thumbnail

8884562
versioning	upgrade
the only way to get rid of it permanently is to upgrade to a java 5 or later-only versioning of your api that returns a parameterized map

8884584
x86	mips
codesourcery is a supplier of open-source sourcery codebench toolchains integrating gcc gdb etc. for arm mips power x86 and other embedded processor architectures

8884610

i would like the scroll to stop on mouseover and start again on mouseout

8884625
int	boolean
the method setvisible1 boolean int is undefined for the type applicationindicator

8884635
int	double
when you do fielda fielda+fieldb you get 5 10 which as an int is truncated to 0 you have to do double division if you want 0.5 as a result

8884674
postgresql	mysql
you should add postgresql to your gemfile since heroku uses the postgresql database instead of mysql or sqlite3

8884681
hide	show
i m trying to do a simple show hide transition for a message div using fx.reveal in mootools 1.4

8884687
rss	feed
i finally have a working script to submit facebook events remotely and have finished tackling the problem of converting my site s events rss feed to the fb events data

8884696
int	chars
for example your real class contains an int however your replacement class contains only a chars array

8884696
int	chars
now on most platforms int has alignment 4 an int must be located at a 4 byte boundary while chars has aligment 1 it cannot have any other alignment without violating the standard

8884703
hide	show
of course you will need to try catch every api call to find out what parts of your app you need to hide show

8884760
int	boolean
the definition reads setvisible1 boolean visible int count so you need to pass a boolean and an int

8884765
gif	png
set the header s content type to image type png gif etc

8884795
persistent	transient
it s only a problem if what you re putting in the database isn t actually persistent data and you re just using is as a transient intermediate step

8884847
public	protected	children	parent
if you want to be able to retrieve their values you need to either make them protected and thus available to parent and children classes or public available to all classes

8884857
width	height
one thing that is always true for absolutely positioned elements is that they will never add height or width to their parent element

8884857
margin	height
also keep in mind that using top or bottom can give you some confusing layout problems with regard to element height and how they push each other down or up in vertical space if you don t account for the increase decrease in positioning either with extra or negative as the case may be height or extra margin or padding for it s parent element

8884879
google-chrome	firefox
this fixed the same stackhash problems i was having with firefox and google-chrome

8884905
accessor	properties
now in order to do that i need in my viewmodel one properties for each enumeration value but i d like to avoid to put 1 hundred properties accessor

8884905
accessor	properties
i know in c#4 we have dynamic properties so in this way i can avoid to write 100 properties accessor but i must use .net 3.5 which has no dynamic properties i cannot use .net 4

8884945
inherited	subclassing
the only reason for declaring instance variables in interface is to allow them to be inherited by a derived class subclassing

8884956
division	multiplication
it strikes me that the former will likely have higher precision because the multiplication is performed on 2 doubles resulting in double precision whereas in the latter the division is performed on a single which is upcast to a double but still only will have the precision of the single

8884958
width	height
start listening to mousemove events to change the width and height object based on the mouse coordinates

8884958
mousemove	mouseup
listen for the mouseup event to detach the mousemove event listener

8885007
post	get
i want to be able to get some wordpress options with the shortcode from the post something like this

8885010
mutators	setter
the problem is - even if the id mutators setter sets a proper value tested with cout and return value the accessor always returns 0

8885025
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
use the debugger included in google-chrome safari or get the web developer add-on for firefox and look at the network requests as they happen

8885027
stdout	stderr
for some reason the output from wkhtmltopdf goes to stderr of the process and not stdout

8885027
stdout	stderr
on a side note if you spawn a process from java you must read from the stdout and stderr streams even if you do nothing with it because otherwise the stream buffer will fill and the process will hang and never return

8885027
stdout	stderr
to futureproof your code just in case the devs of wkhtmltopdf decide to write to stdout you can redirect stderr of the child process to stdout and read only one stream like this

8885085
width	height
mobile devices often cannot support textures bigger than 2048 pixels width or height

8885137
pop-up	dialog
at this point the dialog pop-up requesting the proxy user pass

8885156
pdcurses	ncurses
you might also want to check out unicurses which wraps python s native ncurses module in linux and pdcurses in windows

8885156
pdcurses	ncurses
unicurses has the benefit of maintaining a style of usage which is consistent with ncurses and pdcurses

8885245
firefox	safari
the autoplay works properly on pc in ie and firefox but does not work on ipad 2 in safari

8885253
implements	extends
expanding on the answer by comenk you can extends the database class and implements various methods by which to achieve your goal

8885284
gridview	rowdatabound
as you re using you could hide your column s using the rowdatabound event of your gridview

8885284
gridview	rowdatabound
if your gridview is created programatically add the rowdatabound event handler

8885299
google-chrome	firefox
i ve seen there is much conversation about how to get the current zoom factor in the browser but i haven t found out why this snippet works in firefox and not in google-chrome

8885299
google-chrome	firefox
but when i do ctrl+mousewheel in firefox the zoom event is caught by the handler and not propagated whereas in google-chrome the handler seems not to be called and the event is then propagated

8885314
next	except
the page i am forwarding them to dumps out the session variables onto the page except by the time you get to the next page the session variable doesn t seem to exist

8885336
post	get
this stackoverflow post details a number of ways to get the handle of the currently executing module

8885337
width	height
the idea is to get the offset width and height of the elements and see if they overlap

prepare	execute
as stated in documentation escaping string is not necessary for prepare and execute statements

8885564
prepare	pdostatement	prepare	execute
calling pdo prepare and pdostatement execute for statements that will be issued multiple times with different parameter values optimizes the performance of your application by allowing the driver to negotiate client and or server side caching of the query plan and meta information and helps to prevent sql injection attacks by eliminating the need to manually quote the parameters

ubuntu	linux
however when compiling in linux ubuntu it crashes unless i remove the updating of the count out of the constructor

8885650
width	height
i don t really understand why there seems to be no width height at that earlier point

8885656
min	max
so sqrt is of course worse than custom random function might be better for you pi should be cached in loops min and max should probably be avoided as well no idea about trigonometry and logarithms speed

8885758

8886014
integer	unsigned
i am trying to write a function in c++ which takes two 64 bit unsigned integers and returns their difference in a signed 64 bit integer

8886014
integer	unsigned
it seems to be a bit complicated because of the overflow situation - since the inputs are two unsigned positive integers if the absolute difference between these two is greater than maximum signed value int64_max then the difference cannot be transmitted through a signed integer

8886024
put	get
the feedback form definition lives in a file called feedback.admin.inc so i had to also put a to get it to appear

8886094

8886293
inline	inlining
if i m going to inline for performance reasons i ll profile before inlining

8886303
folder	directory
very very important because asp.net 2.0 tries to dynamically compile any classes it finds under the app_code directory of an application at runtime you explictly do not want to store classes that you compile as part of your vs 2005 web application project under an app_code folder

8886320
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome on os x 10.7 64 bit the max string length is 17740 whereas firefox seems to handle the very large string with no problem

8886320
integer	unsigned
another problem i found is that the max message length that can be sent in websocket hybi-17 is 2 64-1 or max int in an unsigned 64 bit integer but javascript can t even handle numbers that large in its number format

8886826
hide	show
show and hide are not animations when they are not given a duration

8886826
hide	show
since show and hide are not being place on the animation queue delay is not delaying the hide causing it to immediately hide

8886826
hide	fadeout
you can either give hide a duration even 1 will do making it nearly instant but placing it on the animation queue to now be affected by delay or you will need to use settimeout or some other animation like fadeout

8886840
put	get
if you set the plus the above code you would get a window that has a complete custom drawn title area which you can put whatever you want into

8886910

it should be usually an array an object a simple int preferably a model constant or a boolean

8887062
post	get
the whole reason a user likes a page is to get wall post from them

8887066

since the base class contains a getter for this property you would be best to remove the field and setter method and just use the getter to access the authentication manager in your code

8887092
stdout	stderr
the resulting pdf output should be available in stdout and any other messages or stats in stderr

8887116

you can avoid this by changing the string parameter in the html function and for example use removeclass and addclass

8887667
typedef	struct
while you are at it you can specify a typedef struct union that will let you specify the value in dollars cents whole dollars only and cents remainder only

8887682
disk	ram
unfortunately redis can t operate with data sets larger than the amount of ram you have it only writes to disk reading is for restarting the server or in case of a system crash and scaling has to be done by you and your application

8887690
ubuntu	linux
if you are running on ubuntu or debian--or maybe linux in general--it now seems you must create the environment variable zend_tool_include_path

8887690
ubuntu	debian
to manually install the latest version zend framework on ubuntu debian this is what i did after downloading zf and extracting it to temp

8887724
nfa	dfa
after that it can translate the nfa to a dfa

8887724
nfa	dfa
when i parse the rgex mentioned above the parser creates a nfa with 7 states - after conversion there are only 3 states left in the dfa

8887724
nfa	dfa
do they not translate the nfa to a dfa

8887733
cocos2d-x	libgdx
both cocos2d-x and libgdx use box2d to manage physics but the way they manage animations is independent from that

8887759
versioning	upgrade
hi i wanted to upgrade my versioning of mono so that i would be able to use certain .net 4 features

8887776
post	get
you should specify that the form submits using a get http request rather than post and specify the action that you wish to redirect to so that you do not have to use redirecttoaction

8887797
apache	nginx
you could write a redirect in apache or nginx to redirect to a different site based on that header

disk	ram
this means that a modern ram database does not copy pages from disk image to ram when it reads data

8887992
post	get
you can do this by inserting a form element and appending the data you want to post or get into hidden fields and triggering the submit event

8887993
children	parent
i have a parent class and subclassed the two children foo and bar

8888027
pop-up	dialog
otherwise the same page can be viewed in jquery dialog with just the content area of that page is displayed in pop-up window

8888036
ssl	https
short of wrapping the entire site in a ssl protocol the only other option for this would be to have the pop-up form be an iframe that points to another page with the form that resides on an https connection

8888046
for-loop	loops
of much greater importance however than optimizing how your for-loop iterates loops and breaks is modifying what it does on each iteration

8888164
submit	submission
i want to block the form from submission to a different page.now if you hit enter it submit to a different page

8888177
setinterval	settimeout
also if you wish to execute closer to exactly 5 seconds you d need to a setinterval or recursive settimeout and examine +new date

8888185
submit	submission
the important part being e.preventdefault which prevents the form submission when it s submit event is triggered

8888230
put	get
i am running this and no matter what i put for the path name i always get it exists

8888240
min	max
the manual says it s supposed to use the min and max values in the data but this is obviously not the case here

8888254
submit	submission
you might also want to prevent the form from submission although it seems to submit to the same page since the action attribute is empty

8888261
inherited	properties
rather than inherited a new type just extend the existing type partial class adding your own silverlight only properties - in this case isselected

onresume	onpause
in your onpause method record where the user is looking so that your onresume method can position the view at the place the user left off

8888508
uiscrollview	autoresizingmask
to your second question ymmv but in my experience uiscrollview doesn t seem to pay attention to the autoresizingmask attribute of its subviews so you wil have to manually keep your uibutton pinned towards the bottom of your uiscrollview as you change its size -- wherever you set the uiscrollview s contentsize is the spot to adjust your uibutton s frame

8888524
typedef	struct
because you have typedef that defines command_stream_t as pointer to struct that means your variable ptr is actually a pointer to a pointer to a struct

8888539
put	get
- i can t get the program to figure out where to put down the parentheses correctly and i can t get it to identify the beggining and end of the parentheses using a stack

8888543
typedef	struct
if you want your ptr to have the type then you should change your typedef from to typedef struct command_stream command_stream_t

8888595
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller

if you want it to strictly snap to the min and max of the data specify

8888699
uiview	subviews
on the other hand even if one of your or the libs object has the uiview as a subviews i think your uiviewcontroller will never viewdidunload and therefore never dealloc

8888710
spy++	sendmessage
i am using spy++ and see that the control i have has the decimal that matches the hex after conversion of course in spy++ and i see the parent window matches as well so i have the intptr for a label and intptr for the form window but my sendmessage is not working to change the text in the target application

8888710
post	get
another approach may be may be to do something like this post but what is the control id and how do i get that

8888714
int	double
for that i am advised to use int instead of double and then later convert it to a dollar value when i print out the statement

8888718
int	boolean
all that i need is 2 arrays of floats 1 int and 1 boolean that are shared among the entire workgroup so all 100 work items

8888828
ubuntu	debian
the cryptcat package on ubuntu and debian provide a nc 1 -like functionality with twofish built in

8888938
width	height
thus when a container only has child elements which are float ed the container will not take the height or width of its children

8888938
width	height
to make this work intuitively meaning making the container take the width and height of its children you can either float the container or use one of the several methods for clearing floats

8888962
postgresql	mysql

jboss	glassfish
i have been learning gwt and hibernate together for the last few weeks and wanted to throw up a demo on a local glassfish server that is what our web app server is going to be although if i cannot find the answer to this issue i may look into tomcat or jboss

8889510
folder	directory
here s some things to take into account - i am new to hibernate as well and am not sure if i have set up my persistence.xml file correctly - it is in the meta-inf folder in the root of my src directory

8889510
jar	war
also this only happens when i deploy to the server before i do that i use a google compile i jar up my src directory and add it into my war lib directory then run an ant script to war it all up then manually deploy it onto glassfish

8889510
jar	war
i then ran the jar.sh from a command line moved the new jar file into my war web-inf lib directory exported the whole project as a war file and launched it to glassfish and it actually worked

8889599
pull	push
since we have a few build servers pushing to the same heroku repository sometimes a push of latest bits from a build server will throw a message saying i need to pull latest before committing and pushing

width	height
therefore the width of the bar is the income range such as from 0 to 8.8 for the first bin and the height of the bar is the quantity of people divided by the width

the cluster is 12 nodes 8 core with 24gb ram and 2tb disk each configured for 8 mappers 8 reducers 6 6 on the namenode

8897142
int	chars
the chars is not being promoted to int due to the control string

8897142
int	chars
the chars is working as an int because all data that is less than 4 bytes when passed to printf is bumped up to 4 bytes which is the size of an int because of the cdecl calling convention of variadic functions the point of this is so that the data that comes next will be aligned on a 4-byte boundary on the stack

8897151
uilabel	uitextview
i altered this to contain a very long string and replaced the uilabel type with a uitextview

8897166

again it s not really leaking memory like a c malloc where you forget to free that section again

8897231
int	double
int promotion rules are applied on arguments of int types and float arguments are converted to double

8897231
int	chars
s is a chars and is converted to int

8897231
int	double
now the conversion specifier f expects a double but the type of the object after the default argument promotion is an int so it is undefined behavior

8897262
opera	firefox
reproducable on firefox 9 for windows and opera 11 for linux

8897278

this absolute position placement is the way my ajax framework implements the hide show of some widgets

8897309
lxml	beautifulsoup
okay so in the comments above you said that you didn t care about what js from a site might do to the dom- so to answer the first part of the question you need to parse the html using lxml beautifulsoup or one of the other dom-producing python html parsers

8897312
uilabel	uitextview
it s possible if you just swapped uitextview with uilabel that the frame is not large enough

8897343
glut	glfw
using gtk+ you should neither use free- glut nor glfw

8897397

8897537
dictionary	map
using the id from the mapped_seq_id dictionary i can now map sequences to functions

8897713
mockito	jmock
i am not familiar with mockito because i use jmock but the general approach of writing tests with mocks is the same

8897713
getter	setter
the easyest way would be adding a getter and setter to set that filed in the test

8897718

2 what fromintegral does is convert any integral type like int int64 or int into any num in this case double

8903099
int	double
the end result is an array indexed by int int with values of type double which is presumably what you wanted in the first place

8903099
int	double
2 as for why int and double are picked rather than any other integral or fractions this is due to haskell s defaulting mechanism

8903099
int	double
basically if you have an ambiguous numeric type in your program it s first tried with int and if that doesn t work because the type has to be fractions which as we ve established int isn t double is tried instead

8904205
width	height
there is the pygame.rect.rect class to which you pass x y width height to instantiate

to link c++ code you need to use the g++ command not the gcc command

when compiling the gcc command knows that it s compiling c++ code because of the .cpp suffix but it s a good idea to use the g++ command anyway

8904736

jar	war
you might have configured your debug settings for a particular project in your workspace in eclipse which is deployed in jboss as jar or war if the breakpoint is inside code that may be inside some other project jar war which may be a dependency of the project for which you configured your debug settings then eclipse would not be able to find the source code

cpu	hyperthreading
most of the time most threads aren t doing much anyway which can be seen from the fact that most of the time cpu usage on most systems is below the 100 mark hyperthreading skews this the internal scheduling within the cores means a hyperthreading system can be fully saturated and seem to be only running at as little as 70

8908374

8915790
xslt	xquery
the ability to evaluate xquery to dynamically create xslt is pretty powerful but does impose a little more cognitive overhead

8915805
pop-up	dialog
so when we click on the cell a cellactivation operation in the code behind for that view is called which then calls a method in the view model to .requestnavigate to the view that is registered for the secondary pop-up region thus launching what appears to be a dialog over the existing application

8915805

cpu	hyperthreading
1 a hyperthreading technology enabled cpu core has two set of cpu state and interrupt logic

8916723
cpu	hyperthreading
3 if the cpu state maps to process state i believe marc is correct that multiple process application can even benefit more from hyperthreading technology

8916789
cpu	hyperthreading
no a hyperthreading cpu core still only has a single execution pipeline

8916789
cpu	hyperthreading
hyperthreading was intended to allow the cpu to continue executing one thread while another thread was stalled waiting for a resource or other operation to complete without leaving too many stages of the pipeline empty and useless

8916789
cpu	hyperthreading
this goes back to the pentium 4 days with its absurdly long pipeline - a stall was essentially catastrophic for efficiency and throughput and hyperthreading allowed intel to keep the cpu busy doing other things while it cleaned up from the stall

8916791
width	height
this lets you set any of the shape properties directly positional coordinates height width and radius in the case of a rectangle

8917847
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
supporting browsers are ie safari firefox google-chrome

8917858
int	double
now that we have a suitable allocator we can go back to our original template class and replace int with double

8917897
integer	fractions
so when you do a b this fails way before it even realises that int and integer are not instances of fractions â since takes two arguments of the same type it can t possibly work

8917912
google-chrome	firefox
it should be okay in firefox google-chrome and ie9

8917959
cashapelayer	cagradientlayer
if you really just want a simple shape that can be drawn by a core animation layer like cashapelayer or cagradientlayer you should just use a core animation layer and a cabasicanimation to animate the layer s frame

8917971
int	chars
but what happens if the the columns one wants to search on is not a factor or chars but rather is an int

8917980

maven	pom.xml
this means that a plain maven pom.xml file with no additional dependencies will build a javafx application

8918191
ant	maven
however i have successfully built javafx 2.0 projects using maven in the past by using a system scoped dependency on the jfxrt.jar and optionally invoking the javafx ant tasks from maven

8918191
maven	pom.xml
after running the above command add the dependency to the jfxrt.jar file to your maven pom.xml and your project compilation should resolve all javafx api references

8918191
ant	pom.xml
if you extend the javafx application class and you want your application packaged for deployment via webstart browser embedding or as a javafx installation aware clickable jar then you should adapt your pom.xml file to execute the relevant javafx 2.0 ant tasks - demonstrates such an adaption

8918214
min	max
therefore i have to find the max and min of each column

8918238
post	get

8918384
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox

8918423
google-chrome	firefox
this works in ie8 and firefox 3.6 but google-chrome 16 prints the original content not the printable content

8918489

8918513
google-chrome	safari
but there is one bad bad thing the rendering of central part of border-image is a kelly hell there is a difference not only between webkit and mozilla but even between the safari and google-chrome so i added a lot of hacks there

8918530
inherited	subclassing
model inherited won t automatically return the subclassing instances -- if you ask the orm for foos it will give you foos

8918532
nsstring	nsdata
i understand why when going from nsdata to nsstring you need to specify encoding

8918532
nsstring	nsdata
however i m finding it frustrating how the reverse nsstring to nsdata needs to have an encoding specified

8918532
nsstring	nsdata
so i just wanted to ask if the following is correct when converting nsstring to nsdata

8918620
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this needs to work in all the major browsers google-chrome firefox ie safari

8918625

8918737
qgraphicsview	qscrollarea
instead of a list or qscrollarea i am just going to take a qgraphicsview and paint my own objects into it

8918792
textview	imageview
traditionally one uses the viewholder pattern to hold the subviews of a list item textview imageview etc not data setting and getting the score from within the holder - what s happening is that you set the value to zero at position zero scroll down to the 6th item on a 5-item screen the 0th item gets re-used for position 6 and it pulls the existing value from the holder attached to that listitem in this case a 0

8918822
pull	push
if we were to use the changegroup hook then it would cause cyclic behaviors because the hook is run during a pull push or unbundle

8918824
free	malloc
similarly you might ask why you can t use malloc to allocate memory placement new to construct an object and then delete to delete and free the memory

8918824

as the other answers say it defines two typedef one named work_t that refers to struct work_tag and another name work_p that refers to

8918954
typedef	struct
if you want to define a name for a truly opaque type where code that uses it doesn t take advantage of the fact that it s a struct or a pointer a typedef is a good solution

8918954
typedef	struct
c does not. note that if a struct work contains a pointer to another struct work you can t use the typedef name inside the definition

8918956
htmlcleaner	jsoup
for that take a look at htmlcleaner jsoup html parsers

8918975

maven	m2e
therefore in you eclipse indigo you have installed m2e whereas your old maven projects in the older eclipse version were created with m2e according to your right-click description

8919049

php sends only a value when the checkbox radio button is selected

8919523
postgresql	mysql
there is no limit 1 condition thats mysql postgresql in oracle you need to specify

8919581
put	get
thus the methods put get will use locks no matter how many threads exist in your program

8919585
superclass	subclassing
there will be a one-to-one relationship between the superclass entity and each of the subclassing entities

8919629
profiling	instrumentation
have you verified with instrumentation new relic the ruby profiling and other tools that this second lookup is really what is killing your performance

8919632
getter	setter
you will also need class with getter and setter method in order to convert db elements into objects.like in the above code gettext is our getter method which is getting elements from database and returning it here

8919655
instances	transient
so i will be refactoring my app to now make these simple instances methods on the sub-class for my managedobject entity and just return the results as i can see no real benefit to making them transient properties

8919655
getter	setter	persistent	transient
one that is transient and is the true representation of your object for which you write getter and setter and another that is most likely a binary data type that is only used internally by the core data entity sub-class for persistent the other objects value s in a storage object

8919656
onresume	onpause
because of this i really need to make sure that the onresume and onpause events are handled correctly

8919656
onresume	onpause
my assumption is that one of the events onpause or onresume is not being run so the accelerometer is being registered twice or unregistered twice

8919694
width	height
i m using the absolute.layoutparams method to give width and height to them but i get deprecation warnings

8919713
keydown	keyup
you re already listening on keydown and keyup events - there s nothing else you can do unfortunately

8919723
width	height
i want to have a element on my website that i would like to be 100 height and width of the window even after resizing

8919767
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox this works fine but in google-chrome not all of the elements are being updated to reflect the new padding

8919776
width	text-align
i have a problem with the text-align justify inside a paragraph with format and fixed width because i want the paragraph text in html to appear totally justified like it would happen with a ms word file

8919824
qtableview	qabstracttablemodel
i have a qtableview that i implemented with my own model subclassed from qabstracttablemodel

8919842
width	height
so you need to make sure that all the elements above your div also have a width height of 100

8919916
folder	directory
thats just a simple dos or batch command to make a directory with the date and to move all .png files into that folder

8919931
getter	setter
pocos in the c# client are conventionally serialized using servicestack s fast json serializer where only properties with public getter are serialized and public setter to get de-serialized back

8919946
client-side	server-side
however while you can use a combination of server-side and client-side scripting to make this work this would probably become very slow and use a lot of bandwidth

8920002
client-side	server-side
configure the client to use that client-side certificate to identify itself and only accept the one server-side certificate you installed on your server for that part of it

8920012
filtering	grouping
i realize that my example is very simple but in real life it can become more complicated involving filtering or grouping

8920050
pop-up	dialog
pop-up a dialog box

8920061
rmdir	mkdir
the build process removed the directory rmdir s u target and then recreated it mkdir u target

8920061
rmdir	mkdir
the build process unfortunately checked only for rmdir failure not mkdir

8920061
folder	directory
changing the current directory finally deleted the folder and another go at build set everything right

8920077
put	get
i can get the list to work as intended if i put it in the footer after the document has been executed but i don t want it there

8920085
uninstall	upgrade
i also had to uninstall an m2e scm connector in order to upgrade it

8920085
maven	m2e
claszen most of the info is here m2e compatible maven plugins

8920085
maven	m2e
execution information is defined in a file - src main resources meta-inf m2e lifecycle-mapping-metadata.xml - see m2e compatible maven plugins for format

8920092
int	chars
i ve tried converting to a string and gather that chars and have this ridiculous function that tests the int length number of digits and adds just the end digit to another list and some comparison code

8920096
width	height
also note that the proper way to set the width and height of a view is to do so via the layoutparams

8920096
width	height
you shouldn t have to set the width and height manually as you do in your second example

8920105
libs	buildpath
basically you need to add your libs via project property java buildpath project

8920112
x86	64bit
running this on a 64bit windows the program is compiled for target x86 though

8920120
accessor	properties
this allows you to access properties are are not legal for the dot accessor notation

8920123
jruby	mri
jruby is faster than 1.9 mri matz ruby interpreter the standard in certain areas

8920152
move	drag
when they are on top of each other at 0 0 even if i try to drag the handle attached with the .sidecar2 black one it always move the slider with red attached to it

8920183
atomic	interlocked
if you need to write to a pointer which is shared between threads use either or the not yet official gccs atomic intrinsics or windows interlocked or wrap all accesses to that pointer in mutexes

8920191
viewdidload	viewdidappear
i can confirm with nslog that the vc is calling viewdidload and viewdidappear but the map property of the vc is null

8920256
punctuation	words
i think my answer s caveat about notion of one words in the original answer covers problems with punctuation solution choose a different regular expression but the zero and one words cases are a problem

8920270
sudo	passwd
the reason i m using echo passwd | sudo -s for most of the commands is because this script is being run from the script menu in mac os x

8920270
sudo	passwd
the terminal window does not open to address sudo passwd prompts

8920276
keydown	keyup
what i am doing is using keydown and keyup events inside a winform

8920276
keydown	keyup
the idea is to start emiting a frequency through the speaker in keydown event and then stop it in keyup event

8920351
for-loop	arrays
it s a bit tricky since you ll need to use two indexes but only a single for-loop one index for iterating over the input arrays and the other for iterating over the output arrays - the index for the input arrays gets incremented as usual for every step of the iteration but the index for the output arrays gets incremented only after adding a new even element to the output

8920358
dictionary	map
therefore when we look at the rest of the code that makes up this function we know that the parameter map is equal to the rooms dictionary and start is the string princess_lives_here

8920400
pop-up	dialog
there s no indicator for when this alert dialog pop-up and if the user confirms so i can t reliably pop-up an unavailable message in these cases

8920412
button	checkbox
here i have two issues asp checkbox and asp button

8920412
button	checkbox
similarly my asp button and asp checkbox functions aren t localizing

8920412
button	checkbox
the entire page is localized except for this button and checkbox

8920417
google-chrome	safari
if you re using safari change the google-chrome in the first line to safari change the word title near the middle to name and change the word execute on the third-to-last line to do

8920457
google-chrome	firefox
but this happen only in google-chrome but not in firefox

8920481
youtube	vimeo
the problem i am finding is that i am embedding youtube vimeo clips iframes within the scoller which works fine except for the fact that the mousewheel scroll doesn t work when the mouse is over the iframe

8920498
filesystems	hfs+
by default hfs+ is case-insensitive so -e must be as well since it uses filesystems primitives to do the check

8920498
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
having -e be case-sensitive on a case-insensitive filesystem would be perverse and evil

8920500
width	height
the class for this div should have a background image your arrow plus height and width to cover the select size

8920500
margin	height	width	height	width	margin
height width padding color font margin and border is all optional for the select but you need to make the background of the select transparent and add -webkit-appearance none and -moz-appearance none to keep the default browser arrow from appearing

8920529
udp	tcp	udp	rtp
quicktime player does not support rtp avp tcp transport and it s rtp avp udp transport does not include nat hole punching

8920529
tunnel	wan
thus the only feasible transport is http tunnel in wan deployment

8920598
filesystems	hfs+
the lack of case sensitivity is due to the filesystems you are using hfs+ not the perl functions -e and open nor the underlying stat 2 and open 2 system calls

8920598
filesystems	hfs+
the hfs+ filesystems is not case sensitive by default

8920598
filesystems	hfs+
however you may elect to create a case-sensitive hfs+ volume when initializing a new filesystems using disk utility diskutil or newfs_hfs etc. just select the â œcase-sensitiveâ version

8920605
exif	jfif
most jpegs are jfif or exif format which do not use rgb

8920614
for-loop	loops
so until end of execute for-loop it print only one line because for-loop have not bracket it loops only one line

8920616
width	height
you re not meant to change the desired size by altering the width or height properties of the size object you get you change the size by providing a new size object

8920624
min	max
the findbugs utility supports some command line options such as -effort max -effort min that can effect the results

8920652
rss	feed
well its been a long time the question has been asked but anyway google sms channel does not have an api so you wont be able to get the feed programmatically but if you know the account user you can ask him for rss feed and parse them using .net or something

8920666
g++	gcc
say gcc -v or g++ -v to print out verbose information about the environment

8920680
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i m building an app with a uinavigationcontroller where i push a uiviewcontroller and ibactions on one of the classes can cause another instance of the first type to be pushed

8920686
min	max
i understand that the initial question was what is the fastest way to get min and max values in a datatable object this may be one way of doing it

8920691
portrait	landscape
the first observation is that my app doesn t like being changed from portrait to landscape or vice versa

8920723
ip-camera	rtsp
i m trying to grab rtsp mjpeg stream from ip-camera realtime as described in boehme using_libavcodec.html but ported to newer version

8920728
division	modulo
the modulo works on remainder on division of integers

8920792
min	max
as you can see the sort by takes the min of all values in the array and sorts on that whereas the sort by takes the max of all the values

8920802
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
works in ie google-chrome safari and firefox tried with latest versions

8920803
ubuntu	linux
i have a script that compiles fine on linux ubuntu 11.04 but not on os x lion

8920820
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
the reason why i m not just putting all the code in touchesmoved is because i m calculating the offset from the touchesbegan

8920822
width	height
on the website i am making i have a navigation bar at the top of the page that is 43px in height and in an attempt to not have to edit it for each individual page that i make what i did is put an iframe below it at 100 width with the navigation buttons targeting the source of my iframe

8920822
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
and i need this to work cross browser in ie google-chrome safari and mozilla preferably in opera also but that s not a necessity

8920841
setinterval	settimeout
i ve looked all over and from what i can tell i need to use the setinterval or settimeout function

8920855
inline	inlining
and if you make it static and suggest inlining or force it inline as a macro definition you can even bypass the cost of a function call

8920865
free	malloc
edit so rob s comment put me on the right track but i m getting malloc double free errors because the method with the color adding is called multiple times before a new drawcolor is assigned

8920876
comparator	comparable
so it could be to keep the remove behavior consistent even if a comparator is used or the objects in the priorityqueue implement the comparable interface equals does not depend on any comparison except the base equals property of the object

8920878
hide	show
grab the window.onload event hide the div immediately then call settimeout to show it again

8920915
mouse	keyboard
now these two services have no custom service api email update or really any kind of function for updating status messages other then using a mouse keyboard and browser

8920923
min	max	range	min	range	max
i am in the need of changing the range min and max value of the numberspinner dynamically according to the selection made through some filteringselect

8920938
setcontentview	findviewbyid
if you haven t attached these views by using setcontentview yet findviewbyid will return null because there were no matching views present to find

8921001
children	parent
if the node itself must be dynamically loaded next prev parent and children only contain the path to another node s data not a reference to a node object tell me and i ll update the answer just need to change a little the places for loading unloading

8921046
int	boolean
you should implement the boolean equals object and int hashcode for the item class because then you can simply invoke the contains object method of the list to find if a matching item exists in the list

8921051
google-chrome	firefox
so far i ve only tested firefox google-chrome but it appears that you can get the current css height via js

8921098
perl	tcl
i installed sl4a which eventually gave me a sandboxed perl python tcl lua enviroment

8921104
powerpc	i386
there should be a line there reading universal_archs powerpc i386 ppc64 x86_64

8921135
tooltip	scrollbar
if you are trying to have the tooltip window pop up over the browser s scrollbar then no you can t do that afaik

8921186
post	get
next i created the logic for the edit actions get and post

8921186
post	get
in the post method we get a string parameter that tells us which checkboxes were checked

8921225
outputstream	inputstream
however there are other class like inputstream outputstream which can be use for same purpose

8921225
outputstream	inputstream
i saw question regarding inputstream outputstream class with httpconnection

8921228
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
as a final suggestion instead of using an index ed for-loop to loops through your full arrays you can use java 5+ for-each enhanced loops syntax and simplify your indexing needs

8921251
des	aes
i m trying to implement some basic aes des encryption decryption in small apps

8921344
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
i need a clarification that is it possible to open a url in google-chrome and opera browsers like safari in ios from ios application

8921367
qtcore	qtgui
instead of writing from pyqt4.qtcore import ...use from pyqt4 import qtgui qtcore

8921392
fastcgi	scgi
the web server connects via a protocol like fastcgi or scgi

8921399
sudo	passwd
you may try sudo npm express install and then enter your passwd of your system account

8921419
fileoutputstream	filewriter	fileinputstream	fileoutputstream	fileinputstream	filewriter
filereader for example uses fileinputstream while filewriter uses fileoutputstream

8921420
int	chars
i ve added the backticks around the column name and removed them from the snumber value since it s an int rather than a chars column

8921423
srp	principles
one purpose of such implementations is to encapsulate the query logic in the repository and not one query like single responsibility principles srp would suggest but a couple of queries and thus violating srp

8921449
width	height
the images are at of a maximum of 800px width so height might be more if its a portrait image

8921522
post	get
i was try to find out this not getting related post this issue is based on the third party app so where i get openid app for google app engine or need to do in different way

8921541
getter	setter
i have solved this problem by having the super class with getter and setter function for storing and retrieving shared preference variable

8921568
google-chrome	firefox
this code works fine in google-chrome but it doesn t produce audio in firefox

8921601
outputstream	inputstream	dataoutputstream	inputstream
datainputstream dataoutputstream isa inputstream outputstream

8921601
outputstream	inputstream
inputstream and outputstream are the most generic io streams you can use and they are the base class of all streams in java

8921601
int	double
instead of just simple unformatted bytes you can read bytes int double float short utf-8 strings and any mixture of that data

8921601
outputstream	inputstream	dataoutputstream	inputstream
a datainputstream dataoutputstream has a reference to an inputstream outputstream which it reads the raw bytes and interprets those bytes as those previously mentioned data types

8921608
uipangesturerecognizer	uibutton
in my application has some uibutton and this buttons respond to uipangesturerecognizer

8921770
hide	show
you can show hide a tooltip by using code like

8921813
centos	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	linux
mapr can be installed on many versions of red hat enterprise linux centos ubuntu oracle linux and suse

8921813
centos	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	linux
red hat enterprise linux centos ubuntu oracle linux or suse

8921813
vmware	virtualbox
download the mapr sandbox for vmware or virtualbox for free

8921824
min	max	minimum	max
if you want to get the min max values in x_mtx globally use numpy s min max instead which returns the scalar minimum over the entire matrix not just each row

8921827
fputs	gets
in the computer lab at school we wrote a program using fputs and the compiler returned an error gets is a dangerous function to use and a similar error for fputs

8921837
jobs	cron
if you need to have a particular task run frequently consider using cron jobs provided by the server os and not actually part of php

8921866
mouseup	mousedown
when you lift your finger mousedown click mouseup events are fired immediately in that order

8921900
versioning	upgrade
we re using the free versioning of buildmaster and may upgrade to enterprise once we use it for other projects

8921969
width	height
you can use setbounds to specify x y position and width and height

8922018
google-chrome	safari
and it works in browsers google-chrome and safari but when running on devices such as an ipad getselection doesn t return anything

8922037
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
but you should always loops an arrays with a regular for-loop to avoid accidentally including custom-added enumerable properties

8922058
for-loop	arrays
for arrays you can use normal for-loop

8922071
hash	salt
i was hoping to get cake php 2.x s field type mapping to change password field from a salt sha1 hash into a varchar field to unhex hash in sql so i can store the password in the binary 20 field

8922109
cvs	svn
you do not need cvs server on local machine cvs svn command-line client is enough

8922141
instances	transient	persistent	transient
persistent makes a transient instances persistent

8922156
width	height
i mean when height width is zero

8922156
width	height
when height width decrease to 150px with the help of animate function then i want that my div will be fadeout completely

8922175
rtp	sdp	rtp	rtsp	rtsp	sdp
for that i am writing a rtsp server which will stream through rtp protocol using sdp

8922181
width	height
it s as if express is putting a large div-wrapper around all of my content and restricting the height width

8922253
post	put	post	get	put	get
get and post requests work perfectly but the put and delete requests return 404 errors

8922282
portrait	landscape
for orientation change you can preserve your activity s data even after the orientation of the screen has changed from portrait to landscape and vice-versa

8922282
portrait	landscape
you need to make a separate layout xml for the landscape orientation keeping all the elements same no of views and their ids as they were in the portrait layout xml

8922302
getter	setter
although you are probably right that getter usually just return the value the same logic applies to them as to the setter

8922309
getter	setter
and this class has its own setter and getter as well

8922309
inherited	properties
the output will be cinstance serialized according to the properties of c and what it inherited

8922309
getter	setter
however i like the properties are being serialized to be according to the setter getter in i1 only the cinstance properties represented in the i1 interface

8922323
portrait	landscape
if my pdf page settings is landscape then layout automatically shows landscape not portrait

8922339
websphere	ibm
we are working on an ibm websphere mq application and we use jms api to operate the message

8922376
submit	submission
to simulate the submission of a form you can send the same post request that your browser will send to the site once the submit button is clicked

8922409
keydown	keyup
its better to use keyup keydown event cause the change event only fires when the textare input was changed and the element lost its focus

8922410
post	get
first choosing between get and post a user can simulate any kind of request so post will not help you there

8922410
post	get
for your case of retrieving some sort of post get is appropriate

8922416
getter	setter
you can have a getter setter in your routebuilder class

8922432
getter	setter
then i created an employee class with name and salary as its field with getter and setter

8922439
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the user clicks on any button of the browser back button refresh home button... google-chrome firefox amd opera on linux but triggered when click on adress bar

8922439
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the user uses shortcuts f5 ctrl+u... tested on google-chrome + firefox + opera

8922439
keydown	keyup
so i recommand you to use in addition keyup and keydown events on your input and textarea forms

8922450
domxpath	domdocument
i am using php domdocument and domxpath

8922467
hide	show
use the siblings selector and slidetoggle will show or hide the dom based on it s current state

8922505
width	height
with the above code it is warpping text when the column width of column with index 1 is changed but not increasing the height of each row

8922520
keydown	keyup
when this happens in ff the only thing that shows up in the keydown keypress and keyup events is the alt option key leaving no indication of which letter key was pressed

8922520
google-chrome	safari
this is not a problem in google-chrome or safari as their key events expose more keycodes - enough that i know what keys were pressed

8922536
disk	ram
if you will not be able to store all values in ram you can use shelve module from standard library to store and acess items from disk and you can apply interface whit interpolation on it if required

8922544
rubygems	bundler
before bundler using rubygems you would achieve much of the same effect doing require rubygems

8922623
uiview	subviews
at some point of button action i add subviews of second uiview to first uiview

8922623
uiview	subviews
so i want to that if there is just first uiview than it could rotate but if i add subviews of other uiview it don t let rotate

8922626
google-chrome	firefox
it s free and many browsers support it internet explorer 6 7 8 9 firefox 1 2 3 google-chrome 1 2 3 4 5 etc.

8922632
qtcpsocket	qtcpserver
note that qtcpserver nextpendingconnection return qtcpsocket so instead of taking that new connection you create new qtcpsocket with nextpendingconnection as parent

8922635
implements	extends
now use the modules - the ugliness is having to use an include and extends statement to allow me to pass a set of symbols to a class method which will then be implements in an

8922648
domxpath	domdocument
demonstration of both methods using php with domdocument and domxpath

8922649
int	chars
if i add at least one utf8 chars the resulting type is otperlanglist which is logical as strings are just lists of int in erlang and then i can use its stringvalue method

8922724
javassist	cglib
now that we have javassist and cglib spring hibernate ejb3 if you prefer are perfectly capable of instrumenting your classes as framework developer likes

8922745
getter	setter
this may not be the best kind of question suited to stackoverflow but i m only after an answer that best describes why programmers sometimes don t use setter getter for properties in the case of property injection di

8922745
getter	setter
i always use the setter getter approach but i have seen some pretty established frameworks using the propertya approach interspersed with the propertyb approach

8922748
sorting	grouping
as stated in manual hidden columns values are indeterminate but in practice it usually picks up the first row walking the index used regardless of sorting specified by order by as sorting is performed after the grouping

8922765
comparator	comparable
in your case it might be a two-element string array. write a comparator or implement comparable for the custom object that simply compares the elements from the first array

8922774
folder	directory
in the history of the parent directory there is no information there is not comment mentioning that the folder is deleted

8922828
getter	setter
you should use getter and setter because they allow you to control the interface to your objects

8922828
getter	setter
some languages allow you to have a field scoped as public then if you need to add a getter setter later on you can do so without changing your object s interface i believe c# does this but correct me if i m wrong

8922838
django	web2py	pylons	web2py
use some web framework like django web2py pylons tornado etc

8922842
virtualenv	setuptools
you don t have to create a symlink at all the so called files in the site-packages directory of the virtualenv will act as a symlink on python well actually setuptools level

8922857
maven	pom.xml
i have a git repository that contains a bunch of top-level maven projects each sits in their own sub-directory with a pom.xml

8922857
maven	pom.xml
formerly with subversion i was able to set up a jenkins job for each project that would checkout only the project source and run a maven build from the pom.xml

8922857
maven	pom.xml
refers to the pom.xml for the maven build

8922860
width	height
use the getheight and getwidth methods to get your game view s height and width

8922860
width	height
define all your game object dimensions relative to your view s height and width

8922868
onresume	onpause
any activity lifecycle callbacks oncreate onpause onresume

8922879
int	boolean
adjacency matrix meaning if you got n nodes then you got a matrix of n by n with matrix i j indicates if there is an edge between the nodes usually with a boolean or int if you want weights

8922926
getter	setter
you might have found getter setter to be bottlenecks for your cpu-bound code causing you to optimize for performance instead of design

8922926

8924376
multiplication	exponent
with quaternions it is just multiplication summing up the exponent of the sh base functions expressed as quaternions

8924376
cos	sin

so templates give you more inlining because there are more copies of the sort code each of which can inline a different comparator

8925617
memcpy	qsort
another example with sorting - qsort takes an integer parameter saying how big each element of the array is and when it moves elements it therefore must call memcpy or similar with the value of this variable

8925639

the reason i m asking this is because when i inherited from an abstract-class i cannot access a private field from the subclassing the only way s around this as far as i can tell is to either make the field public or create get set methods to access the field.

8926834
multiplying	division	multiplying	multiplication	division	multiplication
declare a variable or constant with the inverse value and multiplying by it effectively changing the division to a multiplication

8926859
getter	setter	public	protected
best practice is to use getter and setter possibly protected or public

8926859

if using getter and setter seems like over kill because all your implementations will be developed with the abstract class itself in the same package or module you can use protected fields

8926894

in handlers onclick onchange etc. you don t have to use the prefix

8926936
onchange	onblur
onmousedown to add that class onchange that other class and onblur last class

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
for this we are using the default .load function and this works perfectly in ie9 firefox safari google-chrome opera.

8927922
put	get
the first i think creates the get object request after initiating the array to put the object in arrayimages it gets the count from arraypointer

8927930
put	get
it would work fine if the user would choose a date but if they did not choose a date that i would get an error which is why i am trying to find a way to be able to put a null value

8927955
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontroller classes are examples of container view controllers provided by uikit

8928080
nsoperation	nsrunloop
the nsoperation s are busy downloading data - and whilst they are busy there is code to wait for the downloads to complete in the form of nsrunloop s and thread sleeping

8928107
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested in latest google-chrome v16 and firefox v9

8928173
g++	gcc
i am using a wind river compiler 4 gcc c and g++ c++ and it compiles all my projects without any problems

8928173
g++	gcc
for the c-code gcc there are no problems and i can run the analysis but for the c++-code g++ i got a lot of errors

8928181
versioning	upgrade
also i don t know what setup script and with what versioning should i include to upgrade the existing review_detail table with this extra field

8928216
subtract	add
used in internet protocols makes it very easy to modify a packet without having to compute the checksum on the whole packet you can add and subtract only the changes against the existing checksum

8928255
int	boolean
i tend to use an int rather than a boolean as your field for storing the disposed status because then you can use the thread-safe interlocked class to test if dispose has already been called

8928255
atomic	interlocked
using interlocked ensures both the assignment and subsequent read are a single atomic operation

8928267
maven	pom.xml
if building with maven make sure your pom.xml contains

8928280
hash	md5
the second would be to serialize each object and hash the file or do some sort of md5 checksum on it

8928281
uiview	calayer
you will need to use the uiview that contains the calayer to handle the touch events there is no built in touch events for calayers

8928303
twig	smarty
the extensible nature of the way twig templates work as opposed to something like smarty means that you are likely to use includes less by design - but there can still be use cases where it will be the easiest way of avoiding duplication in your templates

8928333
integer	unsigned
note that the unsigned integer is different from the signed integer

8928369
put	get
according to situation i get the html of content from the database and put it to the page

8928373
serializable	deserialization
most serializable are designed to ensure that data retains its integrity during serializable and deserialization not to produce a consistent serializable format

8928376
int	boolean
those type of indexes are very good for boolean int columns

8928396
ready	each
your app must be ready to handle each scenario permissions granted and revoked properly

8928399
post	get
you are passing parameters using get method so it never finds your controller action if you specify it to be post

8928421
google-chrome	firefox
some versions of google-chrome and firefox also have this restriction

8928468
maven	pom.xml
then include in into pom.xml with the statement maven should have properties plugin enabled

8928484
wakelock	powermanager
look here for more information on powermanager and wakelock and here for more information on services

8928505
calloc	malloc
but instead of 100 i have just 50 allocated by malloc or calloc before that

8928602
try-catch	exception-handling
enclose the code in a try-catch block and i get this exception-handling

8928613
mef	prism
check out mef and prism

8928613
mef	prism
prism is a pattern that leverages dependency injection and works great with mef to load libraries dynamically

8928615
width	height
on it i want to find the width and height of it even before i draw the text on the canvas

8928634
google-chrome	firefox
use the dom inspector in google-chrome or ie or firebug for firefox to make sure

8928637
try-catch	exception-handling
using it you can create try-catch block and try to access to unknown data x 79 in try-block and if memory is not allocated in it exception-handling was generated

8928660
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it works in firefox and google-chrome but in opera i get the wrong selection

8928684
robocopy	xcopy
i have thought on programs like xcopy or robocopy

8928715
integer	unsigned	128bit	64bit
you can store an unsigned int 32 bit as a signed long 64bit and make sure the value is preserved for the full range but an unsigned long seems to require a 128bit signed integer to store which of course isn t supported by coredata

8928745
infobox	infowindow
i think you have to create a custom infobox overlay to change anything other than the content the google maps infowindow is if i m not mistaken just a scaled image

8928778
put	get
what i don t get it is if i put and infinite loop to my thread myform createnewprocessthread my application is not affected by this infinite loop at all since it is a seperate thread

8928886
awt	swing
id like my program awt or swing to add controls like text fields automatically

8928905
getter	setter
suppose i have a class with a private property and associated public getter and setter

8928905
getter	setter
i want to test with phpunit that the property gets the correct value after the setter has been used or that the getter returns the correct property

8928905
getter	setter
of course i can test the setter by using the getter to see that the object is storing the correct value and vice versa for testing the getter

8928905
getter	setter
i created a property getter and setter

8928905
getter	setter
but i made a typo in the property name so the getter and the setter don t actually manipulate the property they re meant to manipulate

8928936
folder	directory
basicly i need a tuned down directory listing system that scans for folder and creates links inside a php file with the folder name displaying the images inside

8928963
puts	gets
at schedule intervals a script gets all the new values in core operates on them and puts them into a third table core_details

8928977
free	malloc
of course you have to worry about malloc ing and free ing the value

8928987
google-chrome	firefox
note that the above code works perfectly in ie firefox and google-chrome

8928997
comparator	comparable
like the sort method i want to be able to take a comparator so i don t want to force e to be a subclass of comparable

8928997
comparator	comparable
so in the constructor that doesn t take a comparator i want to verify that e implements comparable

8929017
getter	setter
to explain some things about reader writer aka getter setter methods in ruby

8929028
innodb	myisam
i had a mix between innodb new tables created by south and myisam old tables from the import

8929028
innodb	myisam
developing on a windows machine all defaults in the mysql config had the default table type as innodb import was from a linux server where default was myisam

8929074
free	malloc
you could thus overload hook malloc and free with a function that simply calls the real malloc function and stores the information how much was allocated yourself somewhere by over-allocating and using the first word or whatever you like

8929147
pop-up	dialog
i would like to have mysql table data to be printed on jquery ui dialog pop-up when i click a message link in a frontpage

8929158
cout	cin
i ve got a piece of source code for a console app that uses cin and cout for input output

8929158
ostream	istream
i am pretty inexperienced with the whole streambuf business never made console apps in c++ and so far it appears i have to reimplement a complete istream and ostream object

8929174
post	get
it looks like it lets anyone execute php code that is passed in as a q parameter in a get request or any code in eval param of a post request

8929176
width	height
i want to resize images that are bigger than the window but i keep getting 0 width and height when i try to get the image size

8929179
post	get
q get argument or the post eval argument

8929182
folder	directory
i use this snippet to fetch a list of the folder in my banners directory

8929193
google-chrome	firefox
this does not happen in firefox and google-chrome i get no alert when running it there

8929223
int	chars
int socketfiledesc int sendmessagetoclient chars msg int socket

8929248
width	height
this will force the anchor tag to take the full height and width of the .desgn_bx element so it will still be clickable

8929257
min	max	range	min	range	max
to get the changes between the first and the last changeset on the branch hg status will implicitly use min branch your-branch and max branch your-branch when you give it a range of revisions like this

8929272
children	parent
parent in tablea have children in tablea

8929289
getter	setter
your class exposes a contract in this case - ability to alter and retrieve name via getter and setter

8929311
filtering	grouping
basically your controller action will get a command class as an argument that will list your filtering grouping sort and paging info

8929332
post	get
i know this is super late but an easy way of fixing jquery ui autocomplete for codeigniter is by modifying the autocomplete portion of the js file to set the ajax type to post instead of get

8929332
post	get
this should change your autocomplete to use post rather than get

8929351
width	height
try this it loads the bitmap then gets the height and width then you just have to draw it

8929392
hash	hmac
hmac sha1 is a keyed hash algorithm not encryption

8929419
oncreate	setcontentview
once you get it all set up initializing the layout is simply a matter of calling setcontentview in your oncreate method

8929424
dictionary	map
i d like to essentially map this dictionary to be something like this

8929453
ant	maven
i really recommend not doing this via ant but by using maven as suggested in the book although in this case the only thing missing is the struts.xml file

8929460
hash	hmac
an hmac is a construct above an hash algorithm that accept a key

8929492
des	aes
if you are looking for encryption algorithms go for aes advanced encryption standard des data encryption standard algorithms

8929561
getter	setter
just testing the get set combinations would be ok enough but usually not every setter should have a getter and just creating them for testing is not a nice thing ether

8929627
avr	microcontroller
our code is a mix of c c++ running on an an at32uc3a3256s 32-bit avr microcontroller

8929710
accessor	properties
i believe having an accessor or a properties would be replicating the getpixel setpixel in a normal bitmap object which is not efficient and setting the image field to public would break encapsulation

8929717
post	get
also with the ajax i am using post not get but for some reason it s putting the data into the address bar

8929728
width	height
xy position and width height should not overlap but it seems win7 can resolve some problems by itself

8929748
udp	tcp
you can write a server program that uses kinect to track movements and dispatches points via tcp or udp

8929759
width	height
i need to first resize an image proportionally the width is the important dimension and then crop afterwards to chop of any excess height and then store the new version in a directory

8929765
metaphone	soundex
you can use soundex difference levenshtein metaphone and dmetaphone or a combination

8929766
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
tested in google-chrome firefox safari all mac returned 1

8929774
ant	maven
maven or ant + ivy

8929785
equals	compareto
nican explained the equals part about compareto

8929788
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
you should never push a uitabbarcontroller from a uinavigationcontroller

8929795
post	put	post	get	put	get
you need to put up the page or post a code example in order to get answers to this question

8929805
width	height
you define your crop width height and should be all set

8929819
vmware	virtualbox
if your computer is powerful enough use virtualbox or vmware and use an ubuntu virtual machine

8929819
jruby	rubinius
rvm and rbenv are tools for managing multiple versions of ruby including jruby rubinius etc

8929820
button	checkbox
i m trying to get a listeners to check a checkbox well all of them but just one at the moment when a toggle button is toggled

8929858
ant	maven
just as custom tasks can be developed for ant custom plugins can be written for maven

8929858
ant	maven
additionally you can always call ant tasks from maven if as you need

8929858
maven	m2e
especially recently maven integrates really well into eclipse using m2e formerly m2e

8929875
setinterval	settimeout
you may also want to notice that you don t need an anonymous function for settimeout or setinterval if all you want it to do is call a function you already have defined as in this example

8929876
setinterval	settimeout
you should use settimeout instead of setinterval

8929886
hide	show
you can show hide editor area using iworkbenchpage

8929899
filtering	grouping
i am working on some ssrs reports and am running into an issue where tablix column grouping drop from the table when the filtering returns no rows

8929904
hide	show
that show hide a windows based on the state of this property

8929907
jar	war
the maven approach is to create a maven project for the logic of your web application this will build into a jar and create a second maven project for the webapp portion of your web application this will build into a war

8929907
jar	war
the end result is that when you build test your logic jar which contains servlets etc you will deploy that to your local repository and then build your war which contains jsp pages web.xml configs etc

8929912
jquery	simplemodal
i am using jquery 1.7.1 jquery validations plugin 1.9.0 jquery simplemodal plugin 1.4.2 and jquery qtip2

8929937
put	get
second if you want to get out the values you just put in you could use the output clause but i m not sure that s what you mean it s not entirely clear what you want to do with the values then you will have access to the final values that were inserted while still in the trigger

8929938
post	get
just because you re supplying post not get in the form doesn t mean ajax will handle it this way

8929976
ubuntu	linux
on ubuntu 11.10 gnu linux

8929988
wav	ogg
i am looking for a portable linux windows mac os x way to play either ogg or aac and wav files

8929994
sorting	filtering
as an added benefit sorting filtering that listcollectionview will be reflected in your grid whenever you call mylistcollectionview.refresh from your viewmodel

8930008
wav	aiff
files in other formats like wav or aiff

8930036
clutter	gdk	gtk	clutter	gtk	gdk
like gtk clutter gdk

8930036
xlib	xcb
i ve read some posts on wm development typically use xcb and xlib i think they are too low-level and i don t want to repeat others work

8930045
bash	zsh
the problem i get now is installing and using bash in terminal except of the installed zsh

8930058
put	get
the revision.description field on many of the rally object types was not originally intended for developers to get change information but rather for display purposes for our rally alm saas tool - that s why changes are put in a revision attribute called description which is just a text field

8930066
screens	tablet
on a tablet both the listview and the details activity could be visible at the same time to prevent the entire screens from being filled with the listview and then a second activity containing the details about that item

8930066
switching	screens
my thinking is that i would need to create a new layout manager that would be responsible for managing which views are available depending on the screens size but where i am stuck is trying to figure out at which proportions the views would switching from a single to a double view

8930071
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this was the final solution that worked in ie firefox google-chrome and safari

8930083
google-chrome	firefox
my problem is that this works in ie but gives me the following error in firefox and google-chrome

8930133
fdt	haxelib
afterwards go in the prefs of fdt haxe sdk and add the path where the haxelib was installed usr lib haxe most likely

8930161
width	height
if you want it to be a fixed size at 100 simply add the width and height attributes to the img tag

8930181
openni	kinect
im trying to access to pixel value of depth map using kinect openni and opencv

8930238
google-chrome	firefox
there is no reason for this to be browser specific i suspect what is actually going on is that ie doesn t render the error message whereas google-chrome and firefox do

8930238
google-chrome	firefox
if you really are getting different content generated in different browsers then the problem is most likely that appointmentlocation in not being populated correctly in the javascript in firefox and google-chrome and as a result the sql query is returning no results

8930260
ember.js	sproutcore
what you are describing sounds a lot like bindings and computed properties from sproutcore or ember.js

8930308
implements	extends
i have a class that implements an interface and that interface extends another interface

8930309
jboss	glassfish
i am following the tutorial at this link but instead using jboss instead of glassfish

8930348
vsto	add-in
i have a powerpoint add-in in vsto that do some operations like importing a slide from a template

8930361
opera	safari
after doing more research i have found that safari and opera are only desktop browser that would render jquery mobile pages as mobile browser would

8930361
opera	safari
as mentioned above only safari and opera desktop browsers would render this properly so i guess if you are testing on local machine use those two browsers

8930403
width	height
by default span is inline so width and height are ignored

8930405
post	get
you just need to set the form action to get instead of post which is the default

8930435
int	chars
istream get extracts a chars from the stream and returns its value cast to an int but you re putting this into an array of std string

8930507
int	double
here i use xs int as number is kind of an xpath 1 legacy function and it returns an xs double while the count function returns an xs int

8930511
folder	directory
made sure the permissions are writable on media directory and tmp folder

8930523
centroid	convex	distance	polygons
on top of that kernel algorithms are built area length perimeter centroid convex hull intersection clipping within point in polygons distance envelope bounding box simplify transform and much more

8930524
distance	polygons
it contains geometry classes such as point linestring polygons and functions such as distance intersection union

8930535
post	get
this resulted in the routing system taking the post from the form being unable to find a suitable method it converted it to a get which then found my actionmethod

8930568
onresume	onpause
in your activity s onpause you should tell your rendering thread to wait outside the canvas lock unlock and then let it run again in onresume

8930568
onresume	onpause
a simple approach to doing this would be to create the rendering thread in onresume and then in onpause signal that it should exit maybe by setting a boolean value read in the thread loop and then also wait for it to exit via thread.join before returning from onpause

8930573
width	height
it s impossible to know how much memory is consumed by a given cuda array - obviously it has to be at least width height depth sizeof texel but it may take more because the driver has to do an allocation that conforms to the hardware s alignment requirements

8930575
jax-ws	jax-rs
i ve tried jax-ws jax-rs and axis2 but no luck

8930599
ant	maven
i have some sense on what needs to happen but could use some help so that i don t have to create all of this structure and the related ant maven targets goals from scratch

8930612
width	border-color
alright well i have searched and searched on google stackoverflow other sites for an issue regarding how webkit handles the combination of border-radius border width and color applied to a box with one side having both a thicker border and different border-color

8930612
google-chrome	safari
this only occurs in webkit both the latest releases of safari 5 and google-chrome 16 and i m assuming this goes to all versions of webkit that supports border radius

8930632
width	height
what that means is 0 width wrap content on height then a relative weight for the width

8930651
pop-up	dialog
so if i call the page 4 separate times on the forth dialog page call it will pop-up 4 alert screens

8930662
onresume	onpause
onpause and re- open it in onresume

8930713
min	max	range	min	range	max
bump of the pad first if that doesn t work you should try setting min and max values slightly larger than your data range

8930713
min	max
this is why you get an error using min max as strings

8930713
min	max
using this min max

8930739
tar	gunzip
when i download a tar gzip d snapshot of the archer-tromer-python branch of gdb using this link and then gunzip and un-tar the file using 7-zip i get a file 140 mb file named archer-archer-tromey-python-b23c218

8930741
dictionary	map
i haven t had the time to look at the dictionary implementation in tamarin the vm for flash but it seems that the dictionary is beeing rehashed when a value is reaffected to the map by the line in the remove function

8930748
stdout	fflush
fflush stdout

8930768
width	height
in other words i can not specify the width and height of an asp.net control in a separate css file because asp.net will always give it its own style attribute at runtime

8930770
super	extends
i have done a few projects lately using a database object super class which i use for quick one off record query update and extends with appropriate classes such as a user class

8930779
mp3	wav
soundpool is bad with wav files with mp3 i didn t have problems.

8930809
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox and i get the success its ok alert but in google-chrome i get ok alert

8930821
udp	tcp
edit remember the speed of sending packets for both udp and tcp is almost same and depends on the network

8930828
text-align	height
setting line height and text-align seems to make it work however the 0.5em container is to small for the text

8930832
ember.js	sproutcore	ember.js	backbone.js
node.js + any of the multitudes of client side javascript frameworks jquery sencha yui backbone.js ember.js sproutcore etc..

8930843
post	get
one for get and one for post

8930846
post	get
.net note that this post has some voodoo in the first comment if you happen to get the same error

8930862
gridview	rowdatabound
well to use the datatable for flagging you would have to add an extra column to store the flag so you could retrieve it in the rowdatabound event of the gridview to change the color

8930864
button	checkbox
you are trying to set toggle handler inside checkbox definition while it should be on button

8930892
express	node.js
node.js server app often using the express framework

8930966
typedef	struct
since you initialized node without typedef struct needs to written before usage of node every time

8930972
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox and google-chrome but ie7 renders the ajax loaded content incorrectly

8931004
versioning	upgrade
maybe upgrade of firefox to the latest versioning will solve your problem

8931019
udp	tcp
you also don t have to handle network topology and connectivity issues as much than if you used udp multicast or tcp connections in reverse

8931019
activemq	rabbitmq
activemq and rabbitmq can be easily embedded within a server using spring in a matter of 20 minutes

8931023
saas	iaas
you can t unfortunately neither aws nor any other iaas paas saas vendor i m aware of does offer api access to their accounting data currently maybe due to the potential financial legal implications -

8931064
yacc	ocamllex
i m writing a compiler in ocaml using ocamllex yacc

8931076
getter	setter
well you could make your life easy and use php s magic overloading __call method to create generic getter and setter

8931076
getter	setter
the __call method above does a quick substr check to see if the method was a getter or setter using the first three letters of the method name

8931076
getter	setter
it expects that your array stores lower-case property names lcfirst and uses everything after the setter getter prefix as the expected property name

8931091
getter	setter
a database engine i have seen at clientâ s application used magic methods to simulate getter and setter

8931096
width	height
you could use a 2d regular grid of points p0 p1 p2 p3 ... p m n when m is width and n is height of this grid

8931096
width	height
depending on n m width height of your 2d space and the number of points you re gonna use this could be just fine

8931098
ant	emma
i have successfully managed to get ant to build using the emma param and thus instrument my application

8931128
try-catch	exception-handling
either wrap it in a try-catch to at least grab some of the exception-handling

8931133
google-chrome	firefox
i have these routines which work fine in firefox and google-chrome but do not run at all in ie9

8931137
folder	directory
instead of creating a file in your application directory you should try creating files in temp folder

8931143
ubuntu	linux
environment birt 3.7.1 deployed in glassfish 3.1 ubuntu linux jdk 1.6

8931151
swt	windowbuilder
i wanted to install windowbuilder for building gui java apps and so far i tried following repositories to install windowbuilder or swt plugin but none of them completes the plugin installation and it stucks and fails in between

8931182
entities	entitymanager
in that listener i would like to remove some other related entities but this does not seem to be flushed by the entitymanager

8931215
implements	extends
let myrunnablefuture extends forwardinglistenablefuture and implements runnablefuture

8931333
mdpi	hdpi
hdpi mdpi ldpi folder you have this xml

8931345
submit	submission
you ll without a redirect also run in double submit problem whenever the enduser presses f5 after submission the form

8931353
tstringgrid	tdbgrid
i ve seen a lot of code to databind tstringgrid simply just to avoid tdbgrid because of purism when tdbgrid would do nicely - just a overly absurd loss of time

8931370
lisp	smalltalk
note smalltalk and ruby can also go very far along this path because they are semi-functional they have outstanding support for closures in particular because the syntax for block closures is so lightweight and readable but i think you would find a language such as haskell or lisp a better match for the type of algorithms you are developing

8931375
next	except
it compares every item except the last - it will be checked by the second last item and checks whether the next item is smaller

8931422
post	get
you can also return whatever you get back to javascript like this after you do the post

8931438
hide	show
and another note - if your data and as a consequence inner html changes frequently then it will be better to re-render it each time user request it but if it is almost static then hide show should be more effective

but it does allow you to define a function server-side which will check credentials which you can call client-side with no additional hassle

8931654
client-side	server-side
when that server-side function is done you can send a client-side function with the result correct wrong credentials

does putting my parent class in the type argument prepare all the children too

8933275

8933412

otherwise as nsnotificationcenter s docs say the order of objects that receive the notifications is random and does not depend on wheher you re a subclassing or superclass

8933525
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
for reading and writing data to a file you can use fileinputstream and fileoutputstream

8933539

i can t seem to get the following code to work in google-chrome it works in firefox though

8933869
width	height
of course use your own css with all width height background and background-position

8933914
implements	extends
this makes it easy in a game to implements bonuses that extends the count-down and penalties that reduce it by simply adding to or subrtacting from the time remaining

8933984
superclass	subclassing
another option would be to have a common uiviewcontroller superclass that has all the functionality and then subclassing that base class and provide an implementation of viewdidload that sets the appropriate type

8934130
cassini	iis
note that with vs 2010 sp1 you can now use iis express instead of cassini for your web projects which gives you full control of your mime types

8934389
hash	hmac
the thing that caught my eye was that it uses the password as the hmac key which is exactly what is computing the hash for

8934422
hash	salt
the lack of salt allows an attack to create rainbow tables or simply attack all password hash in your database at the same time

8934422
pbkdf2	salt
you should add a salt and use a slower hashing method such as pbkdf2 and bcrypt

8934425
width	margin
if you don t want the content pushed off the screen then the width of all of your elements -- including margin and padding -- must add up to no more than 100 or the max pixel width you want

8934584

8934654
google-chrome	firefox
the following code works on firefox google-chrome and ie9 on my pc

8934757
post	get
the api statements are sent to the google fusion tables server using http get requests for queries and post requests for inserts updates and deletes from a web client application

8934757
post	get
there you have it like i suggested you have to use get to retrieve the data and use post only to send commands to edit the data

8934757
post	get
change the query function to use get and then write a separate edit function that uses post to edit the data

8934782
put	get
so you need to put your data in a buffer object and then make it resident so that you can get the gpu address

8934997
getter	setter
sounds like what you re trying to do is opt out the extra call and ret from your getter setter

8934997
getter	setter
another way would be to code your getter setter using c macro function if they are not too complex

8935011
geocoding	geocode
the geocode api has a section for reverse geocoding

8935029

firefox seems to be working - so does opera

8935102
children	parent
i ve some classes for example parent and children

8935102
children	parent
parent have a collection of children objects and i use linq 2 sql to persist them

8935102
children	parent
the problem is if some properties change in the children object i may need to update the parent object and i need to check it before persisting

8935167
screens	tablet
if you have an application designed for phones and run it without changes on the tablet via eclipse it will run fine although the ui may not be appropriate for the bigger size ie android will attempt to stretch the layouts to fill the screens which could look strange

8935270
width	height
so all entities in your game would have bounding boxes just frames equal to the width and height of your sprite

8935284
awt	swing
if you wrote your game with swing or awt instead of using robot you can do the following

8935287
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome for desktop should return true safari for ipad should return false

8935376
content-length	content-type
content-type application x-pdf content-length correct

8935413
x86	64bit
the reason was that i had compiled the library with the custom activities against the x86 platform and the build controller was running off of a 64bit windows 2008 vm

8935431
width	height
in your for-loop s comparison statement you re getting the height and width and multiplying every time

it will help in the future to get a reasonable answer if you edit your post to include examples of expected inputs 2 small sample files would be perfect and the output you need for you bag of words

8935630
udp	tcp
applications such as statsd have no qualms accepting tcp and udp connections simultaneously so i m not sure why there would be a limitation on listening on multiple tcp sockets at the same time

8935655
screens	tablet
but before i get dirty i wanted to know if there was a simpler way of just getting a simple app on my tablet that will in reality just be a full screens web browser

scheme is the only language i know well but i thought i d take use this project to learn myself some some java so i d be interested if there are any racket or java libraries that would be helpful for this

8935697
int	chars
however for many operations you cannot tell if the compiler actually did the operations in the precision of an int and then converted to a chars to store in your variable or if the operations were done in chars all along

8935697
int	chars
if you promoted to int you would get 600 which would then be implicitly down cast into an unsigned chars which would wrap modulo 256 thus giving a final result of 88

8935697
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition
this is true in general of addition subtraction and multiplication

8935697
division	modulo
it is not true in general for division or modulo

8935712
tiff	png
once you have a list of the annotation bounding boxes you will need to render the pdf file to an image format such as png jpeg tiff so that you can extract clip the rendered image of the annotation text you want

8935724
oncreate	setcontentview
all you need to do is create a xml file that has the layout with the webview widget in it and inflate it on your oncreate using setcontentview

8935725
jobs	cron
then you run only this one program in batch...it will run them in the correct order and automatically wait for them to finish executing before moving to the next program setting up separate cron jobs would require you to overestimate how long each one takes so they wouldn t conflict

8935726
min	max
nothing precludes adding a setprogress int progress in min int max method and the attendant property change support but it s hard to see any advantageâ the recipient would just have to scale it for display

8935729
hex	binary
i wonder how to secure it from for example someone obtaining the binary and searching for it in some hex viewer

8936072
mp3	ogg
i originally converted them from mp3 to ogg using ffmpeg in the command line

8936072
google-chrome	firefox
testing audio on its own in the browser showed issues with ogg on both google-chrome and firefox

8936073

but that s for treeview might work on treelist

8936077
freebsd	centos
the os will either be centos or freebsd

8936114
width	height
css3 adds the box-sizing attribute which allows you to circumvent the default box model rendering and instead instruct it to include the padding within the element fully honouring the specified width and height

8936114
width	height	min	max
the specified width and height and respective min max properties on this element determine the border box of the element

8936114
width	height
that is any padding or border specified on the element is laid out and drawn inside this specified width and height

8936114
width	height
the content width and height are calculated by subtracting the border and padding widths of the respective sides from the specified â widthâ and â heightâ properties

8936114
width	height
as the content width and height cannot be negative css21 section 10.2 this computation is floored at 0

8936120

datediff	difference
what you want to use is the datediff function and get the difference between today s day getdate and the stored dates time_of_post

8936201
subclass	accessor
that already highlights one way to delegate to the subclass define an accessor method a getter that subclass must override

8936268
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox both exhibit this behavior

8936287
persistent	transient
another way to do this is to have the value be persistent in one value but you use a transient property as the value that your code interacts with

8936343
min	max
for three numbers look for the min and max

8936343
min	max
then look for the number that is neither min nor max d

8936393
super	extends
so the super comes from mingleactivity which extends activity.it keeps throwing an error at activitythread.performresumeactivity ibinder boolean

8936398

qapplication	qwidget
qwidget must construct a qapplication before a qpaintdevice

8936546
client-side	server-side
your server gets less traffic if changes are made client-side with javascript but if there are complicate operations it could be a drag on the client s cpu so it might not be worth any server-side gains

8936576
chm	rtf
create professional technical documentation in multiple and localizable formats - html chm microsoft help viewer vs 2013 2012 2010 help ms help 2 vs 2002 - 2008 help docx ooxml format used in ms word which can be easily exported to pdf rtf help manual xml and others

at least for myself the shadows will not show only in safari ios safari desktop it works in google-chrome firefox

8936695
express	node.js
this may seem like a trivial question but i m wondering if anyone can help me with some specific preferably express node.js server code

8936709
ubuntu	linux
also i am not able to read the header correctly using igmp headers on the linux platform ubuntu

8936710
websphere	ibm

all you need to create property in your action class and provide there getter and setter once this is done framework will push them in to the valuestack with action processing

8936725
put	get
if i want now to access these wrapped lines i can get it through richedit.lines.text which will put automatically crlf at column 80

8936736
udp	tcp	icmp	tcp	icmp	udp	igmp	tcp	igmp	udp	igmp	icmp
they re a tool to let you manually assemble or inspect the contents of ip packets including the higher-level headers inside the ip packet that tell whether it s tcp udp icmp igmp etc

8936736
udp	tcp
for your application you almost certainly want tcp or udp sockets

8936777
innodb	myisam
query on innodb table is slower than on myisam

8936778
textview	simpleadapter
i have a list view that is built using a simpleadapter each row is defined by a layout containing a tablerow and a few textview

8936781
google-chrome	firefox
it works on firefox but not in google-chrome

8936798
width	height
to fix this i save the original width and height in variables and set object.contentwidth and contentheigth equal to these variables whenever necessary

8936798
width	height
when i print the original width and height variables the content widths and height and the regular widths and height they re all the same value as if the object was never scaled

8936825
httpresponse	request
don t have to construct the httpresponse until i perform the request

8936831
integer	unsigned
the large number is actually -1 expressed as an unsigned integer

8936884
folder	directory
anyway the obvious solution is to add another layer of namespace qualification by turning project directory into super packages add __init__.py files to each folder and remove these folder from the lines by which sys.path is extended

8936928
hash	md5
assuming that the output of md5 is a hash in column 4 and a file name in column 2 with the parentheses around the name not mattering and also assuming that the names do not contain any spaces because spaces in the file name will mess up the column numbering then you probably want something like

8936928
hash	md5
if there is no entry in the associative array file for the given md5 hash then an entry is created with the file s name

8936939
width	height
one way to fix this is to translate the canvas by its width height 2 then 0 0 is at the middle -- be aware of this

8936947
width	height
1 you defined textview as fill_parent width and height so no space for edittext

8936947
width	height
2 editext width height is zero

8936953
width	height
instead divide the screen width or height in half mirror across that

8937075
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in safari google-chrome ie9 but the animation is really choppy in firefox 7 8 9 on osx

8937201
put	get
you d need to determine where in the plist you were trying to get an array and why there was a string where you expected an arrayâ whether you created the plist incorrectly putting a string into it where you meant to put an array or are examining it incorrectly the presence of a string is correct

8937208
min	max
i do know how max and min heap work but i am not sure that whether heap is implicit data structure to implement priority queue

8937214
width	height
keep in mind that labels maybe really long texts so i have on labels width height auto

8937289
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
the problem is with google-chrome opera and safari

8937334
versioning	upgrade
if i upgrade from dnn versioning 4.4 to versioning 4.9.5 and then to versioning 6.1.2 then it gives me the error

8937379
int	chars
warning note expected const chars but argument is of type int

8937380
textview	imageview
i want to give id to some views textview imageview etc in a layout that is programmetically created

8937389

i do not know what you represent by the key of the dictionary but you can create a new intermediate entity with keys of employee employeeleaveentitlement and dictionary key and map this as a collection in your employee class

8937393
ssl	https
here s how i plan on doing it - everything over https using ssl of course

8937394
ostream	ostringstream
i m already including iostream and ostream libraries so i m not sure why it s treating ostringstream as undefined.

8937416
asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
can anyone explain how asp.net-mvc retrieve values from anonymous type parameters such as html.actionlink where the parameter representing html attributes can be passed in as anonymous type

8937427

after seeing questions related to this issue here and here i tried both wmode opaque and wmode transparent which solved the problem for google-chrome opera and safari

8937637
getter	setter
now my register and login bean contain getter and setter

8937704
int	chars
several instruction set architectures do not have any arithmetic machine instructions to operate on less-than-a-word int like short and chars

8937722
integer	fractions
fractions second is the part of the time that is not an integer

8937730
g++	gcc
the c++ compiler in the gcc gnu compiler collection is g++ not gcc

8937730
g++	gcc
you can use -wmissing-prototypes with c code and gcc to spot such problems but the option is not valid for g++

8937738
pascal	delphi
the delphi pascal version doesn t need to protect c from being included twice in a because it doesn t use the to achieve this goal it use the uses statement

8937767
disk	ram
however there are situations where the machine code is not yet in ram and the kernel has to load it from disk

8937782
accessor	properties
because all those properties are readonly only get accessor is provided

8937827
put	get
and then put it into postgres get two lines devided by empty n line and put it into db table

8937956
popupwindow	dialog
i met this issue also can only try a alternative way to display a transparent dialog activity instead of parent popupwindow

8937963
ciimage	uiimage
i know i can access the properties weather it i have my image as uiimage or ciimage but the properties that these seem to have differ from each other even if it is the same image

8937981
width	height
it will also help if you have the right width height ratio in this case 3 4

8937983
stdio	fflush
the stdio stream buffers are fflush

8938018
getter	setter
so the class is just dummy storage with getter and setter

8938024
getter	setter
i have declared this array and getter setter

8938053
button	checkbox
i didn t apply paging on my gridview and it extends to more than 600 records with checkbox button etc. and the value of 2001 didn t work

8938078
hide	show
the goal to solve the problem is show or hide dialog between activity s on resume and onpause

8938097
inherited	properties
i ve wrapped these methods up into a library - the library implements these methods as a category on nsobject so any class can be saved or loaded and it also adds support for coding inherited properties which my original answer doesn t handle

8938097
inherited	properties
i ve updated the answer to correctly deal with inherited and read-only properties

8938161
navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller
one can implement it by passing the value to next class under navigationcontroller using pushviewcontroller

8938171
teamcity	ncover
see also teamcity documentation - you can try running with a different runner or collecting coverage with ncover or disable coverage altogether

8938226
onresume	onpause
and in onresume and onpause i m doing this

8938250
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
google-chrome safari and opera do not allow it in the first place while ie is just fooling you that it can but won t actually submit the file selected this way

8938256
stdout	stderr
read the stdout stderr file contents created by start-process

8938262
stdout	stderr
- parse stdout stderr to find out predefined patterns

8938270
min	max
for simplicity you may at least use max and min functions for querying timestamp field instead of top 1 and order by

8938293
onresume	onpause
registering it in onresume and unregistering in onpause is safe and enough in your case

8938297
quicksort	mergesort
of course you should not use it in production as there are better performing algorithms for large lists such as quicksort or mergesort which are implemented by arrays.sort array

8938301
google-chrome	safari
i ve tested it in google-chrome and safari the graphs are drawn locally in the browser using javascript

8938304
folder	directory
in your app directory create a folder called lib

8938342
int	chars
yes int promotions are done on all small int types chars short and c99 bool

8938350
apache	nginx
both nginx and apache can be configured to pass requests on to other servers depending on various conditions like path pattern matching and being otherwise unable to serve the request

8938430
quicksort	heapsort
once you have a better grasp of heapsort you may want to look into the introsort algorithm which combines quicksort heapsort and insertion sort to produce an extremely fast sorting algorithm that combines the strength of quicksort fast sorting on average heapsort excellent worst-case behavior and insertion sort fast sorting for small arrays

8938489
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i am trying to put bar to close to black footer its working in google-chrome but not in firefox and opera

8938489
opera	firefox
but in firefox and opera the social bar is down and not coming directly underneath the footer

8938495
client-side	server-side
in a more complex case several pages flexible width use a preprocessor or server-side code or client-side code that adds soft hyphens

8938495
client-side	server-side
the client-side approach is simplest and can be applied independently of server-side technologies and authoring tools

8938509
gobject	dbus
iâ m very new to gobject dbus programming

8938581
google-chrome	safari
the ondragover event needs to be canceled in google-chrome and safari to allow firing the ondrop event

8938609
strftime	strtotime
strftime 10-10-2012 strtotime dt

8938615
hex	binary	addition	multiplication
ok i know hex decimal binary their addition multiplication their conversion

8938631
shapefile	geojson
it uses ogr library mentioned here and alows to convert most used gis formats to any other gis format - so for you for example from esri shapefile to geojson gml csv or other text-based formats

8938650
oncreate	ondestroy
i think if you use oncreate for register and ondestroy to unregister that ill solve your problem

8938695
udp	tcp
it can connect to any standard tcp or udp server

8938732
width	height
aspect ratio is the width height ratio of images and if you resize images maintaining the ratio then their clarity is maintained

8938732
width	height
now tag resizes by aspect ratio if you give only one of the attributes of width or height

8938744
hex	binary
hex is just a means of representing the binary data in a more easily understood form than binary

8938745
padding	overlapping
the css style of the logo must be overlapping with another one which is also assigning padding margin

8938806
button	checkbox
the problem is that the program controls the values of the checkbox before i press the run button

8938807
strftime	strtotime
just change the format by editing below line of script strftime 10-10-2012 strtotime dt

8938829
hex	binary
if you need to find a hex string in binary file may be better to use something like this tell me if there some bugs problems

8938829
fseek	fread
but if you are parsing game s settings file i d advise you to use fseek fread and unpack to seek to a place of where setting is read portion of bytes and unpack it to php s variable types

8938864
min	max
there is nothing big logic in this if you know the num value take two variable min and max

8938945
g++	gcc
use g++ instead of gcc

8938951
ocp	principles
i think this approach breaks the ocp principles and probably other principles

8938990
g++	gcc
generally cmath is in c++ g++ s include path not gcc

8939008
maven	pom.xml
i want to enable findbugs report in a maven 3 project site and did it by adding this to my pom.xml as described here

8939057
folder	directory
now my applet on website only copies xuggle folder and my main program jar into a temp directory from a zip file

8939080
width	height
when i change its height and width from wrap_content to 1000px and 500px it looks ok in xml but when i launch it in the emulator it gets very blurry as if it would be at first scaled down and then expanded again

8939100
jar	war
for some reason i can t jar -t the war file to view if it has the jquery javascript library but on the server i can see it s in the exploded view in tomcat

8939125
hive	hdfs
you can try create-hive-table tool to populate a hive metastore with the table definition based on the table present in hdfs

8939154
hide	show
clicking anywhere in the article hide the excerpt and show the full story with photo

8939199
folder	directory
this will store all the meta data in one directory in the project root so there will be no files in your project tests folder for phpunit to scan and get rid of the issue

8939209
mouse	keyboard
that being said it is good to use events like change or onchange inline with the element for a drop down list because it is will work no matter what changes it keyboard mouse event or touch event

8939214
uilabel	uitextview
you can use uitextview with phone numbers and links detection yes scrolling disabled yes user interaction enabled yes instead of uilabel

8939262
screens	mdpi	screens	hdpi	screens	tablet	mdpi	hdpi	tablet	mdpi	tablet	hdpi
maybe your problems is that the most tablet have xlarge screens and mdpi screens density and you put the drawables in the hdpi folder

8939275
gson	jackson
use a library like jackson or gson to deserialize the json to instances of your classes

8939296
flip	slide
quote exclude poorly performing platforms like android 2.x from the more complex slide pop and and flip transitions so these will fall back to the default fade for all transitions to ensure a smooth experience

8939307
serializable	deserialization
it s certainly not easier to write â you ve got to do all the path extraction yourself and all the method handling and all the content type negotiation in both directions and all the cookie handling and the object deserialization serializable thunks and â well lots of low-level stuff that would all need testing and debugging â or easier to maintain either since the jax-rs interface lets you operate at the level of resources the natural characterization of restful webapps instead of requests

8939315

8948444
width	height
1 it will definitely not load any faster if you set the width and height although it will look better on the browser because when you don t specify them the browser will use a standard size and when the image loads it will change to the actual size so you ll see everything move reflow

8948445

post	get
if so when it post it will automatically get sent to the index action as the returnurl parameter

8948569
post	put
in the post rather than adding the surveypage to the model which is lost because you are telling the client to redirect which creates a new request and therefore a new model you should add the surveypage as a query parameter in your redirect surveypage you ll have to look at how the surveypage is constructed from the query params in order to know what to put on the query string

however if that is the case i don t know why it would work better on a phone than a tablet but i suspect that it has to do with either the fact that the phone has a slightly faster processor or that the images that are being used in the gallery may take up more ram on the tablet since they are able to be larger on the screens

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
now the solution works in firefox google-chrome safari ie9 and ie8 but for some reason it s not working in opera and ie7

8956406
config	ini
i have a form config file in ini format that works fine

8956448
hide	show
here we hide the current list take it s class and construct the class or id of the original list and show that original list

8956458
uitextfield	uitoolbar
i want add a uitoolbar to the keyboard for my uitextfield

8956467
screens	tablet
tablet screens support

8956512
width	height
as i recall i used to get the height and had to use the window width to get the width

8956516
3gp	ogg
i thought about doing html5 and using the video tag converting them to ogg 3gp and mp4 or mpeg and let the browser show the correct one but again still wont work on blackberrys

8956565
hide	show
it looks like the jquery hide show is working but i don t know why it is not highlighting as if it were showing in firebug

8956599
width	height
however when you rotate the device to landscape the height becomes the width for display purposes

8956664
width	height
the size width height would then be the absolute value of x1 - x2 and y1 - y2

8956664
width	height
then when you draw the line you would draw the line from 0 0 to width height

8956671
int	chars
each chars in string have to be converted to int type and the converted type have to be inserted to the table

8956681
serializable	deserialization
i ve tested the code at the line before the serializable and the line after the deserialization and this is definitely where the problem is

8956697
int	chars
to split chars into table of int

8956704
uitextfield	uitoolbar
the reason i need this is because i want to create a uitoolbar to add to all the uitextfield s as an input accessory

8956704
uitextfield	uitoolbar
on this uitoolbar i will add a done button when pressed this should hide the keyboard for the currently selected uitextfield

8956883
multiplying	add
of course you re still trying to add a number to a string or multiplying by a string.

8956948
inline	inlining
i don t know what happens down the llvm road but at the core-level map fromjust and takewhile are not yet inline so if you re desperate enough you can get maybe a few tenths of a percent by inlining them manually if they aren t inline later in the llvm backend

8956993
implements	extends
we can implements any number of interface but we can extends only one abstract class

8956998
iboutlet	ibaction
as stated by mark adams iboutlet and ibaction is nothing more than a void typedef and will only be used by compiler

8957005
opera	google-chrome
opera displays the blue rectangle to the left google-chrome displays it different

8957020
int	double
binaryproblem is a generic class so t can be int double decimal or inclussive another one fraction

8957025
maven	pom.xml
traditionally in a maven project i d use resource filtering pom.xml - file.properties - read value at runtime

8957082
versioning	upgrade
or you may upgrade your jquery to the newer versioning

8957095
dictionary	map
you either need to copy the contents of the dictionary that you passed in into the class member availableexits or you need to treat the map that you passed to the constructor as having changed ownership and instead of allocating the map within the class assign to this.availaleexits in the constructor

8957109
width	height
game.graphicsdevice.viewport has height and width variables you can query that will give you the resolution of your viewport

8957118
qobject	qwidget
if you have any other qobject that can have strict relation to that qwidget you may use and overload

8957146
width	height
the width and height of the incoming image might be larger than 320 or 480 repsecitively so first i would need to scale it to ensure that it is less than 320x480 or equal to

8957214
for-loop	loops
there is another problem which will not make your program to fail but seems to expose some misunderstanding of how the for-loop works specifically you increment the x variable at each iteration but that s futile since the variable x is used only the for initialization the part is executed exactly once prior to perform loops

8957215
requestfactory	gwt
appengine rpc wizard relies on gwt requestfactory to do the marshaling unmarshaling

8957239
margin	height
i don t understand why the first call to setmargin sets a negative margin even though the logged height for container div and img are the very same ones that after the jqueryui show call set the image where i would want it from the start on

8957276
awt	swing
so since i m assuming your using awt s scrollpane here - i would suggest swapping it out with the swing jscrollpane

8957276
awt	swing
in general if you have a program that is crashing on an awt component the corresponding swing component might work better

8957280
maven	m2e
erik importing an existing maven project would let m2e discover and propose you to install m2e-wtp the maven integration for eclipse wtp plugin

8957280
maven	pom.xml
note at this point eclipse to maven conversion is pretty much inexistant only creates a bare pom.xml that s why i recommend to create a maven project first

8957314
globalization	localization
i am using this markup extension together with resx files for globalization localization

8957345
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i have found that this homework works properly in ie google-chrome opera safari maxthon avant and some versions installations of firefox

8957351
width	height
one of the problems is that you are calculating the width and height wrong

8957357
versioning	upgrade
most people have already upgrade to the recent versioning but in legacy code you may find another approach

8957372
post	get
looks like i m not allowed to upload pictures but the ui i want to get is visible in my original post

8957426
int	boolean
when you initialite the array put an int or boolean with a flag 1

8957444
post	get
i am trying to get the post id from a widget i am putting into the sidebar but what ever i try i seem to get random post id s from other post

8957464
implements	extends
extends thread and implements runnable is useless thread already implements runnable

8957464
implements	extends
you pretty much always want to implements runnable and not extends thread

8957466
hide	show
this will auto hide any non selected options while will show only the one selected if you need to put more then two options

8957491
min	max
if you want to take advantage of the sissdate index it is better if you try and convert the monthonly yearonly parameters into a min and max date and use these in the query

8957497
put	get
are there any other options or maybe code that i can put into the class in order to get the string

8957501
post	get
i have a main servlet that processes post get requests

8957518
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
these look the same as their real counterparts in safari google-chrome and firefox

8957527
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
in some cases stating the obvious can be useful though just as a reminder to the user of your class if you have a fairly large hierarchy of superclass and interfaces with several levels of inherited some of them in 3rd-party libraries it could be useful as a helper to declare a class as implementing a specific interface even though it implements it by definition because its superclass already implements it or implements one of the subclassing of that interface

8957534
hex	binary	octal	hex	octal	binary
php will not have a binary integer literal until 5.4 but it does have hex and octal literals if you don t mind converting between those instead converting bin oct hex by hand is very easy

8957544
free	malloc
second comparing the concept of in-place editing vs returning a new item within c using malloc and free

8957563
prepare	bindparam	prepare	execute
try and inspect the prepare and execute statement with debugdumpparams you may want to use bindparam for the prepare statement also instead of injecting the variables into the string like that

8957574
for-loop	arrays
3 you would need to assign the local arrays values back to the arrays passed in using a for-loop or a memcpy

8957601
haskell	scheme
i m trying to make a simple scheme interpreter in haskell

8957610

implements	extends
so if i were writing a list class and not extends abstractlist for whatever reason i would implements equals o by first testing o instanceof list and then comparing elements

8957778
google-chrome	firefox
i have found a solution which works in google-chrome and firefox

8957778
google-chrome	firefox
demo tested in firefox 9 and google-chrome 17

8957778
google-chrome	firefox
referrer hiding for webkit google-chrome .. and firefox 37+ 33+

8957778
google-chrome	safari
webkit-based browsers such as google-chrome safari support spec

8957782
onresume	onpause
i think you could use the action_screen_on and action_screen_off intent actions and you don t have to deal with onpause and onresume thing

8957800
put	get
so if you are databinding your dropdown list in the page_load event the entire content of the dropdown list will get put into viewstate which you often do not want

8957803
getter	setter
if cachelist is a public member and you re afraid external classes will change it make it a private member and synchronize the getter and setter

8957828

subtract	add
that is subtract the vector velocity of object #2 from both objects #1 and #2 giving object #2 zero velocity do the calculation and then add this same vector velocity to both objects

8957861
subtract	add
in this case just combine the previous two cases that is transform all motions into the reference frame of the cursor s object by subtract its velocity from everything do the calculation as for the object being held fixed and then add the same velocity to transform back again

8957862
versioning	upgrade
i would like to upgrade git to the latest versioning 1.7.8.3 so i downloaded the dmg installer git-1.7.8.3-intel-universal-snow-leopard.dmg and i launched it

sorting	filtering
- jtable has implemented sorting and filtering code example in the tutorial

8957869
jtextfield	jtable
2 by implement autocomplete jcombobox jtextfield read whole thread because there is most excelent alternative implemented in the swingx and for jtable to set filtering

8957876
hide	show
there s a tap gesture on the parent view of the scrollview that show and hide a navigation bar at the top

8957876
hide	show
but the problem is that whenever i tap these buttons the show hide navigation bar method is also fired

8957958
pop-up	dialog
that will pop-up a dialog when it fails to resolve an assembly reference asking you to point at the relevant assembly

8957972
allegro	sdl
i was also looking at sdl allegro sfml i didnt see much tutorials help on this but heard its better than sdl

8958004
multiplying	add
or alternatively you can convert to bigdecimal and use the arithmetic methods defined on that class not + - etc but add multiplying etc....

8958010
width	height
all the info about an object s position is stored as a 4 number vector a rectangle as x y width height

8958054
int	double
if there are more columns you could maybe resolve data to proper columns if you manage to build a priority list like in what order they could be missing for example last name first name middle name or and if you could combine that with data type matching string int double date .

8958093
put	get
i want to get every 3rd value from array content and put it into array id

8958103
width	height
otherwise width and height are treated as min-width and min-height

8958106
for-loop	arrays
you need to initialize id arrays before the for-loop

8958125
division	modulo
where is modulo and is integer division

8958159
width	height
and the width and height properties are saved in the database automatically when it s uploaded because of the special imagefield parameters

8958170
children	parent
this way the children will inherit all transformations of the parent scale position rotation

8958170
inherited	properties
i ve read a bit about hierarchical modeling but all literature about it seems to assume that every child always wants to inherited all parent properties

8958211
children	parent
in turn children can protect their state from being overridden through a parent

8958228
hide	show
btw i think your hide and show calls aren t syntactically correct

8958239
hide	show
so assuming you want to hide then change the html then show you can do this

8958253
int	chars
for each chars count of the short string divide the count from the long string by the count of the short string keeping only the int part

8958276
mp3	wav
it basically converts an mp3 to a wav and then creates a bunch of hashcodes in a database

8958276
mp3	wav
i couldnt think of any other differences as they are both the mp3 and radio sample converted to wav 16bit

8958303
switching	accessory
if a device is connected there is an on off switching in accessory view to control it

8958376
width	height
i took a leap into the dialog api so i am certainly not sure but you could try to call getwindow on the dialog and then call setlayout width height

8958401
min	max
universal just set how big substring subsequense has to be as percent of input max or min or avg or sum of two filenames - your choice

8958402
width	height
you can specify the width and height of a image using the width and height attibutes of the img tag and generate the image with the desired dpi within

8958402
width	height
then make the image on gd multiplying the width and height by that variable and you ll get a large image that will appear like a default 72dpi on screen but will print with much more resolution

int	chars
while solving a programming assignement i came across the need to convert an array of unsigned chars to int

8958566
single-quotes	double-quotes	single-quotes	backslash	backslash	double-quotes
the lesson here is to quote wildcards passed to find either with single-quotes double-quotes or backslash

8958599
libxml2	libxslt
libxml2 only supports xpath 1.0 and with libxslt xslt 1.0

8958654
setcontentview	findviewbyid
findviewbyid is used when you are referencing an xml layout that was usually set by setcontentview or inflated with layoutinflater

8958660
width	height
this would allow you control over color width and height

8958683
google-chrome	firefox
again it works in firefox and google-chrome but not ie9

8958695
put	get
when im trying to put a previously defined variable as parameter of mystring.remove once i debug it i get an error which says index and count must refer to a location within the string

8958702
express	node.js
i m using node.js with express connect and jade

8958738
int	boolean
but cannot be keywords like int boolean null etc

8958747
titlebar	window
the way you compensate for the window decorations the titlebar etc. is to use the win_gravity field of wm_normal_hints which is originally in the icccm see but better-specified in an implementation note in the ewmh

8958754
google-chrome	firefox
just open the sample in firefox ie9 and google-chrome and you should see the difference

8958762
multiplying	add
multiplying crit 1 by 1000 or some other number-depending or size of numbers and add to it crit2

8958854
prepare	execute
prepare once execute as many times as you need to

8958870
temp	tmp
path_name may be system name windir temp tmp etc. but may be user defined path

8958881
post	get
the server doesn t get to see this token as part of the get post request as you ve noted it is only seen by the browser

8958887
google-chrome	firefox
if you go to dyer dhe dritare on the left menu and drag one of the elements the door or the window into the right side the desk in google-chrome and firefox the 3 options that i have added for that elements show so this works but in ie9 when i drag an element it doesn t show the the options for dragging rotating or deleting

8958901
gif	png
as part of my application i store multiple image files png jpg gif in a mysql database in blob format

8958914
vim	emacs
python lets you set the encoding of files with vim emacs style comments

8958914
vim	emacs
if you use neither vim nor emacs then it doesn t matter which one

8958918
slideup	slidedown
jquery s slideup and slidedown don t seem to do anything with selects

8958918
slideup	slidedown
i can wrap the select in a div and use slideup and slidedown but so far the effect i get for the result i want is really jerky

8958918
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i just can t get a smooth transition css and or jquery that ll make it work cleanly in google-chrome firefox and opera i don t care about ie

then set view.hidden yes on the ones you want to hide and view.hidden no on the ones you want to show

8959040
rss	feed
i m working on a chrome extension that makes an ajax request for netflix rss feed

8959062
nsstring	nsdata
needs to make entered data into an nsdata type rather than the nsstring which was passed

8959074
portrait	landscape
because the self.view.bounds will not update to represent the new landscape orientation size always returns the portrait dimensions

8959084
uilabel	uitextview
i have added the questions to an outlet collection of uilabel and the answers to an outlet collection of uitextview

8959093
spaces	delimiter
the delimiter part can be up to 16 characters and cannot contain spaces or characters

8959121
ubuntu	debian
first things first if you re on debian or ubuntu i strongly recommend installing the manpages-posix and manpages-posix-dev packages in addition to the usual manpages package

8959146
inherited	properties
after doing some research i found out that checkedlistbox inherited listbox so it must have its public properties itemheight but for some reason it doesn t

8959164
move	drag
my solution was to move the click event add an unbinding on drag start and to add a settimeout on rebinding the event listener when drag was complete

8959171
wxpython	wxgrid
i have used wxwidgets c++ and wxpython and for my wxgrid i use forcerefresh

8959230
ostream	istream
you can decide whether you want an istream ostream or iostream pointer

8959278
glulookat	glrotate
don t use glulookat glrotate or glortho there all deprecated in the

8959292
getter	setter
you can also try using the chain result instead of redirectaction .all the parameters from first action will be passed to the second action but you do need to have the getter and setter of parameters in the second action

8959306
button	checkbox
if no switches are defined display a form with a set of checkbox and button that when submitted will parse into switches and the application will be launched with them

8959311
onmouseover	onclick
when the submission event happens or the onclick or the onmouseover or whatever for that form name or that form element as defined in the js file versus on the element itself then it is triggering some action

8959319
int	boolean
with that out of the way my question i learned from experience and browsing so that a java boolean is stored as a 32-bit int if you declare it as a standalone value but as an 8-bit byte if you declare it within an array

8959323
google-chrome	firefox
local installation for google-chrome and firefox

8959325
int	double
for int you should use int likewise for double float long etc

8959365
gson	jackson
either you need to return as json look up gson or jackson for converting object to json or pass variables not object to the function

8959409
apache	nginx
note that remote files can also include a locally running apache or a locally running nginx

8959415
int	double
both arrays and vectors can be used on any type of objects int double myspacepiratewizardclass etc

8959426
google-chrome	firefox
this script gives me 1.7.1 instead plus ui and no conflicts in google-chrome or firefox

8959439
post	get
so you might actually end up saving time by making one query to get all the matching ids from post then a second to get the post values

8959446
google-chrome	firefox
whenever google-chrome or firefox hits that it ll trigger the debugger and let you walk through

8959452
subtraction	addition
edit the values in the array are generated by iterative addition or subtraction of a constant double 0.2

8959459
queue	fifo
like a queue fifo

8959464
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
using it you can deploy to windows linux osx mac android iphone xbox playstation and webbrowser google-chrome opera firefox ie

8959475
opera	firefox
it ll show you the exact amount of memory being used by each tab etc plus the memory used by tags etc in ie opera firefox etc

8959495
post	get
in best case scenario it will be the last page with hidden variables you will need to parse those and send post request to the same url to get the real login page

8959501
queue	fifo
like a queue fifo

8959533
width	height
i have a container of a certain width and height

8959580
interpolation	splines
splines can be cheaply computed and subdivided interpolation to achieve the desired precision but a curve of explicit points loses precision without having weight information

8959580
move	drag
splines are also really useful in vector art think flash or adobe illustrator and 3d graphics because you can intuitively drag a few control points around to get exactly the curve you want instead of having to move a ton of individual curve points

8959622
gif	png
but i still cannot embed any images onto the pdf be it jpeg gif or png

8959633
g++	gcc
also compile the file with g++ instead of gcc

8959635
free	malloc
appeals to the fact that it s c++ not c and therefore malloc and free shouldn t be used isn t -- as far as i can tell -- compelling as much as it is dogmatic

8959640
cout	cin
std cin and std cout are in

8959640
g++	gcc
please include that and compile your c++ code with g++ not gcc - otherwise you ll get all sorts of linking issues

8959653
free	malloc
if you do not want to get your memory initialized by implicit constructor calls and just need an assured memory allocation for placement new then it is perfectly fine to use malloc and free instead of and

8959653
memset	malloc
the compelling reasons of using new over malloc is that new provides implicit initialization through constructor calls saving you additional memset or related function calls post an malloc and that for new you do not need to check for null after every allocation just enclosing exception handlers will do the job saving you redundant error checking unlike malloc

8959658
post	get
after you fix the code i strongly suggest to post this code on codereview to get some good advices on how to refactor it

8959660
post	get
first of all you should pass in get post parameter which will carry the page to show

8959667
sorting	filtering
if you want to get really simple you could output your entire table and let datatables sort out the paging as well as sorting filtering etc

8959668
rss	feed
there are plenty of tutorials how to parse rss feed â for example

8959679
width	height
i would expect the div to fill the page since both height and width are 100

8959697
post	get
i ve done something similar using the offset parameter for get post

8959697
post	get
basically with each new call to get post simply increase your offset amount by the amount of new thumbnails you want to display each time

8959716
hide	show
if the merchant has a logo i ll show the logo image hide the textbox

8959716
hide	show
if the merchant doesn t have a logo i ll show the merchant name in textbox and hide the logo image

8959729
hide	show
you can make use of wpf canvas control and in that make use of z-index property to show hide your control

8959736
cout	cin
if you want to compile with gcc you should use printf instead of cout scanf instead of cin and fprintf instead of fout

8959739
hide	show
then use show hide to display one and hide another

8959739
hide	show
to show and hide controls use the visibility property of the control

8959760
cout	cin
cout cin etc

8959791
pop-up	dialog
search for pop-up dialog in the link below

8959820
inherited	properties
since the div is inside the a it inherited the properties of a so normally it should inherited the underline thing too

8959824
websocket	pusher
projects like travis-ci get around that by using a service like pusher to serve their websocket

8959845
fadein	fadeout	fadein	hide	hide	fadeout	hide	show
because fadein and fadeout are not valid values for the show and hide options

8959857
free	malloc
if you just don t want to use malloc free you can allocate bytes with just

8959883
jwindow	jcomponent
there no issue set jwindow to the point with setsize that you can returns from any of jcomponent

put	get
you might improve performance if you put an index on timesheet_dt and make sure that it never contains a time part - then you can get rid of the trunc functions

8975202
superclass	subclassing
ps i misinterpreted the liskov principle above sven s comment below points out the fact that objects of a subclassing should behave like objects of the superclass the subclassing itself does not have to behave like the superclass

it turns out that the m2e plugin which manages maven projects in eclipse adds an exclusion filter of to any resource directory

8975703
folder	directory
this exclusion filter prevents the nls wizard from using that resource directory as its source folder

8976832
width	font-size
that means your example animates the width property of the element without waiting for the current animation if any to finish then waits for that animation if there was one to finish then animates the font-size property then waits for that animation to finish then finally animates the border-right-width property

8976850

getter	setter
i am almost positive it doesn t even happen for getter and setter as you can still acccess them by reflection which shouldn t be possible for inlined definitions

8976894
int	chars
if you store an int date ie 20120123 as a chars string the hex representation would be 0x3230313230313233 where 32 2 30 0 etc which is 8 bytes ie 32 30 31 32 30 31 32 33 of storage

8976997
postgresql	mysql
over mysql and postgresql

8976997
postgresql	mysql
it s actually faster when you are not cpu network -bound because i ve seen it perform better than them in many cases especially with bigger dbs -- say 10gb when it comes to filesystem access mysql and postgresql however are more efficient in terms of cpu network utilization when these are a constraint

8976997
postgresql	mysql
over mysql postgresql oracle db etc

8977605
google-chrome	firefox
while investigating breakpoints for a responsive design overhaul i found that google-chrome will include stylesheets at the expected width but firefox always included the sheet at a narrower than expected width

8977605
google-chrome	firefox
i ran some tests and see that in google-chrome the width seems to be based off of window.innerwidth while firefox is using document.documentelement.clientwidth

8977636
integer	unsigned
otherwise you would have declared num as an unsigned integer for sure.

8977666
google-chrome	firefox
my program works fine on ie8 i use google-chrome ie firefox with different settings and logins so changing the default browser is not really an option

8977668

8978773
google-chrome	safari
asp.menu control of asp.net 3.5 is not rendered properly in google-chrome and safari

8978773

8978842
pull	push
i m working a small drupal site and i m trying to pull and push changes from my local windows box to a remote shared hosting account on hostgator linux

8978847
stdout	stderr
what you cannot do is capture stdout in one variable and stderr in another using only fd redirections

8978865
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
as i understand it most modern browsers including google-chrome firefox and safari are supposed to traverse up the chain to determine if the source event was user-initiated in this case it was--a click event however despite this i cannot seem to prevent this pop-up from getting blocked and my users are having a great deal of trouble figuring out what s going on

8978898
put	get
the idea is that if i can get easy access to it i can just put it straight into the form to track it from my own backend

8978925
portrait	landscape
if the view is initially loaded in landscape or portrait the layout of each is fine

8978925
portrait	landscape
if the device is in portrait and i rotate it to landscape none of the subviews new frames are updated

8978993
versioning	upgrade
to upgrade the package to the newest versioning run

8979015
xslt	xquery
unfortunately though although many xslt 2.0 and xquery 1.0 processors allow you to use a case-blind collation there are no standards for collation uris so your code becomes processor-dependent

8979049
put	get
does anybody know a company that gives this service i mean i put some apps to download and i get paid for each download

8979050
versioning	upgrade
oh and you probably want to upgrade to the latest versioning of javax.mail

8979120
maven	pom.xml
many maven plugins will by default use the project.build.sourceencoding property so setting this in your pom.xml will cover most plugins

8979128

since it s the default option you can be sure that the improved version of cocos2d-iphone in kobold2d is tested well with arc and contains a few additional arc fixes

8979333
width	height
stretching an element let its width unchanged while its height gets

8979345
width	height
for simpler cases especially if you want both preferred width and preferred height to be respected use gridlayout as everybody else has suggested

8979362
hide	show
and because i can only find apps with one html i m wondering if all the existing apps only show and hide parts of an html file to simulate the navigation

8979373
sorting	filtering
i can create a fetchedresultscontroller filtering out collected yes and sorting by department easily enough

8979378
post	get
in other words it s the query string if you have a get request and the post form variables if it s a post request

8979387
factors	matrix
an additional constraint is needed because the matrix t effectively has an arbitrary scaling factors it is mapping between homogeneous coordinates which all divide out an arbitrary scaling factors anyway so there is no inherent way to decide what this scaling factors is

8979444
opera	safari
according to this mdn page it doesn t look like createobjecturl is supported in opera or in some versions of safari

8979452

8979511
for-loop	loops
i know i need some sort of loops i m guessing a for-loop

8979520
width	height
i don t want that so i have a temporary solution to have media query assigning height to auto and width to 100 when browser screen max-width is 1024 so that no clipping occurs

8979529
pop-up	dialog
restructure your code to instantiate the dialog once on page load set autoopen to false so that it doesn t pop-up right away and wire up the button to simply open the dialog

8979585
uiview	subviews
i have in my detailview a lot of subviews uiview see above hierarchie

8979638
integer	fractions
a microseconds fractions part rather than an integer value

the validation looks sound but it seems like a blank submission could get through if they put one space for all of your required fields

8979694
free	malloc
on linux everyone uses the glibc-supplied malloc free and so it isn t such an issue

8979712
hex	binary
just open the binary with a hex editor like hex fiend and modify it directly not a big deal

8979721
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
this does not happen on firefox opera safari or even internet explorer

8979742
google-chrome	firefox
for example bind to this event window.onhashchange -- it will only work on modern browsers ie8+ google-chrome 5+ firefox 3.6+ etc without some tweaking

8979751
post	put
this only happens with post put or delete requests that s probably why other request are successful

8979771

children	parent
i have a parent entity which has an id and possibly other simple properties name description etc but will have a 2-d collection of children in the simple case strings

8979810

so i made inheritance public changed the method to be protected and in parent further restricted access by putting the using declaration into private section

8979815
calloc	malloc
apologies i realized after i posted this your aversion to excessive malloc or calloc statements

8979815

since the type of the return value in the getter and the value arg in the setter are declared upfront in the declaration of the property it is avoiding redundant information

8979856
getter	setter
in this case the complier is automatically generating the private member and the code for the getter and setter

8979900

is there something special that you need to do or is it a safari and firefox bug

8979912
dictionary	map
in theory this solution has runtime o k n where k is the depth of nesting of placeholders and n is the length of the string assuming dictionary hash lookups need constant time while chris solution is o k n m where m is the number of items in the property map

free	malloc
in addition to having just one call to malloc free you also reduce memory fragmentation and increase memory localization

8980076
winpcap	libpcap
however there is no winpcap release that s based on libpcap 1.1.x or 1.2.x so there is no winpcap release that can read pcap-ng files

8980076
winpcap	libpcap
in addition the libpcap winpcap api currently doesn t return time stamps with nanosecond resolution so even if you did read a file with nanosecond-resolutions time stamp with libpcap you wouldn t see nanosecond-resolution time stamps

8980125
hide	show
but having it follow another element seems hard because the highlighted element could move or resize or show or hide and i m not sure how to have the highlight follow it

so i m getting a bunch of volunteers records with some filtering and sorting which is fine

8980455
innodb	myisam

min	max
i have a table as outlined below and i m trying to get the max and min values for a specific id but only if the max entry date is greater than the min entry date

8980501
min	max
so what i m trying to do is grab the max price and min price when the max price entry_date is greater than the min price entry_date

8980501
min	max
dice would not show up because the max date time happens before the min

8980526
mergesort	heapsort	quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	mergesort
if you just want to put them into a straight c array you could sort them using heapsort quicksort or mergesort

8980550
integer	unsigned
if you only want a hash_combine that hashes 2 64 bit values into one and you don t need a new hash function for strings you could just lift a tiny bit of code from cityhash something like this assuming size_t is a 64 bit unsigned integer add your favorite bit of preprocessor or template trickery to validate that

8980564
mongoid	activemodel	translation	localization
the translation from errors into readable messages is handled by activemodel rather than mongoid and embedded models are considered to just be attributes in terms of attribute localization

many-to-many	one-to-many
now the thing is this should be a one-to-many relation and not a many-to-many

8980629
google-chrome	safari
it seems this issue is confined to web-kit browsers google-chrome and safari

8980631
post	get
also i would recommend sending the clientlogin request as a post request rather than the get request so that the username and password are not sent as part of the url

8980824
put	get
you need to get from queue 1 and then do a put on queue 2

8980837
nsstring	nsobject
because nsstring implements the nsobject protocol method isequal to return yes for two strings of the same content this method will work correctly for you with two different string objects of the same value

8980854
min	max
since you wish to pick both the max and the min these two tables need to be joined together

8980854
min	max
this means 3 self-joins of product to itself where two product tables are used to calculate the max price date and the other two are used are used to calculate the min

8980854
min	max
in the query below all lines but the last will produce a table with the max price its date and the min price its date

8980854
min	max
the last enforces your price of max happens after price of min condition

8980854
min	max
the p p2 tables are used to calculate the max price and the p3 p4 to calculate the min price

8980854
min	max
it would still work if p3 was joined to p only but the extra condition prunes out rows we re not interested in there s no point looking for the min price on rows for which the price is greater than the max

8980858
google-chrome	firefox
compatibility with ie firefox and google-chrome would be awesome if possible. someone else will be taking care of streaming the video but i have to be able to receive and display it

rtp	rtmp	rtp	rtsp	udp	rtp	rtsp	rtmp
that might be what i have to fall back on if i can t accomplish this using udp but if that is the case i still am unsure of how to go about this using rtsp rtmp rtp or what the differences between all those acronyms are if any

8980875
post	put
normally if i had a variable that i wanted to put into the post request i would append a to the form however if i try this by serializing the object as json the json query is littered with inverted commas which corrupt the html of the form

8981226
facebook	fbconnect
i have an ios app that is successfully posting to facebook via the fbconnect sdk

i used it for a bar code scanning solution as there was no keyboard or mouse attached to the device

8981347
knitr	latex
knitr makes everything accessible for you so latex tricks are often unnecessary

8981347
knitr	latex
you may want to see how the default chunk hook for latex is defined in knitr to know better how the chunk hook works

8981374
width	height
these options should fill up the browser window according to the height and width

8981420
webkit	gecko
edit see my answer below for the vertical padding problems but i m still looking for a solution to the extra padding-left 1px equivalent on text-inputs only in webkit and gecko

8981428

the problem occurs on google-chrome and safari but works as expected on firefox and seamonkey

8981473
put	get
i then put the code into my website widget and i get the same message mentioned above on my website where the facebook like box should be

8981478
width	height
there s nothing in the xml that will let you link the width and height properties

8981501
hash	hmac
b. you take these 3 or whatever you decided on and generate a 1 way hash using hmac for example

8981501
hash	hmac
b. take the other params timestamp and the encoded payload along with the private key you found in the previous step and use the same algorithm to generate a 1 way hash again hmac is what i ve seen used in the real world

8981502
webkit	gecko
you can t go under line-height normal in webkit and you can t have anything other than line-height normal on these elements in gecko so the best solution is to always style these elements with line-height normal to get the best consistency which isn t really a nice solution

8981542
setinterval	settimeout
i m learning about settimeout vs setinterval and i have got setinterval to work but not settimeout

8981558
setinterval	settimeout
remove the inside the settimeout or setinterval

8981571
hide	show
since delay works with the fx queue you have to pass in an integer of sorts for delay to work otherwise the hide and show methods will execute immediately

8981571
hide	show
i passed in 0 to each of the hide and show calls to fix the issue

8981582
stdout	stderr
the logs directory will probably just have the stderr and stdout files that you re already seeing but there s another logs directory under the tomcat directory grails cf-list-files tomcat logs

8981627
post	get
this means that the type post will have no meaning since dynamic script injection only works as a get would work and that all of the data will be encoded into the url of the request as opposed to being send over as a post body

8981633
dismo	maxent
the approach suggested by ben bolker is also used by the cran package dismo - to make the function maxent work you have to download the maxent java binary and place it into the appropriate subdirectory within the main package folder

8981637
submit	submission
html submission a form by pressing enter without a submit button

8981639
httprequest	httpresponse
alternatively you could have your signal inside httpresponse fire and in turn fire a signal in httprequest doing that you could connect all the slots to the signal in httprequest then once the httpresponse is created you connect to the response signal ondownloadprogress request.signalname

8981670
portrait	landscape
i have a navigation-based app where all views are portrait except one which is landscape

8981674
mp3	flv
for example in order to make edgecast happy according to the documentation you need to specify filename in the format of mp4 filename.mp4 flv filename without .flv extension and mp3 filename without .mp3 extension

8981674
mp3	flv
but for cloudfront it s a different story that mp4 filename.mp4 filename no flv prefix and no .flv extension and mp3 filename without .mp3 extension

8981674
mp3	flv
this format makes people even more frustrating when today i try to use edgecast s loadtoedge function the format the accept is filename.mp4 without mp4 prefix filename.flv without flv prefix and mp3 filename.mp3

8981677
factors	matrix
i d like to create a matrix that is binary for each row that includes all factors

8981683
calloc	malloc
well it depends on the underlying implementation of malloc calloc

8981683
free	malloc
the rest is made part of an internal free list maintained by malloc

8981683
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
my guess is that the x amount of memory was larger for whatever reason than you requested and hence malloc calloc was holding on to the rest in its free list

8981694
salt	md5	hash	salt	hash	md5
maybe something like a cryptographic hash not md5 of the password + a salt you would store the salt but not the hash in this case

8981717
hash	md5
instead of running cmp you could think about generating a hash for each file using md5 or sha1 or sha-256 or whatever takes your fancy using python modules or extensions if that s the correct term

8981747
comparator	comparable
if an object does not implement comparable you can write an implementation of comparator to achieve the same effect

8981747
comparator	comparable
if the an object is not comparable it can still be sorted by collections.sort collection comparator by providing a relevant comparator implementation

post	get
i want to get my form to actual post the input values

getter	setter
if your problem is just shorten the code to access ident you may just use property in the old style - that is you pass to it as parameters the getter and setter functions instead of using it as a decorator

8981876
quicksort	mergesort
you can use insertion sort selection sort mergesort and quicksort on linked lists

8981895
cpython	ironpython
cpython is like c++ like ironpython is a dynamic language and has access to dynamic libraries which in turn translates to being forced to write everything

8981895
cpython	ironpython
ironpython is faster than c# in certain areas but not faster than cpython however you can link ironpython to any language thus over coming problems but then again you can do the same with cpython

8981898
flask	django
flask is a micro framework - something simple and to the point when you don t need all the batteries that come with a full stack framework like django

8981918
autocomplete	autosuggest
i m not 100 sure how jquery autosuggest works but from your code it looks like it allows the user to select up to 8 items from the autocomplete list i may be wrong

8981931

i have tested this on a windows 7 machine running firefox 7 google-chrome 16 safari 5.1 and ie9

8982125
width	height
as bassam mentioned you need to set an explicit pixel width and height

8982125
width	height
the width and height for these elements needs to cascade to the map_canvas element

8982178
min	max	aggregate-functions	sum
i am trying to generate a summary report using various aggregate-functions min max sum etc

if it was installed using the ubuntu debian package manager try

8982267
setuptools	yolk	virtualenv	yolk	virtualenv	setuptools

instead uikeyboarddidchangeframenotification notification will be fired on both show and hide

8982397
hide	show
you will have to analyze keyboardframe.origin.y to figure out what exactly happen show or hide

8982406
pull	push
this means that unless the user does a git pull to resolve the conflict locally the push will fail

8982416
post	get
so if i change object.php to include dynamically generated meta tags by using content from either get or post and use the object debugger with a matching url format to the one provided in og url the debugger shows everything as working as i would expect with now warnings

i ve looked through some post around here but am still struggling to get my code to work correctly..

8982445
qdatetime	qtime	qdate	qtime
can anyone explain to me why a. the date time is inaccurate for the qdatetime class r and why b. passing d and t as apposed to qdate ... qtime ... in the constructor also affects the date time

8982472
put	get
however i can not get a hold of them to help answer my question so i put it to you the following code leaves me with a sigsegv error in the notated place.

8982508
hide	show
if that doesn t work for you and you still want to show or hide one based on whether the other is visible use .toggle passing a boolean parameter indicating whether to show or hide the element

8982508
hide	show
this is particularly true when you want to show or hide an element depending on a certain condition

8982538
mechanize	splinter

fileoutputstream	filewriter	ioexception	fileoutputstream	ioexception	filewriter
the docs of java 7 for filewriter and fileoutputstream shows that the constructor of filewriter throws ioexception while the constructor of fileoutputstream throws filenotfoundexception

8982672
touchescancelled	touchesended
basically i end up seeing the touches with phases nstouchphasebegan and nstouchphasemoved but when the gesture kicks in i get absolutely no more information about those touch events no touchesended or touchescancelled

8982683
put	get
in the utility method i have enter code here a for-loop in which the service call logic is written in this i want to wait to fetch the next record till i get the callback method invoked and result recieved.i have put a do while but its not working to check the status of the flag that i set after calling the web service and then set the flag false in the call back method to fetch the next row

8982745
fileoutputstream	filewriter
if you look at the implementation of filewriter it uses fileoutputstream which throws filenotfoundexception

8982745
ioexception	filewriter
because the filewriter constructor can now throw either of these exceptions it is declared to throw ioexception which is a common superclass for both exceptions

8982758
disk	ram
if you have a 32-bit which means 4 bytes per pixel of image information image that s 800x600 it might be 100kb on disk but you decompress it and store it in memory to be able to display it that s 800 600 4 1 920 000 bytes 1.83 mb of ram

i think you should try keeping the controls as protected instead of public

8982849
width	height
2 make a cgrect there with that touch locations it centre.. make it a square..equal width and height

for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
the point is that in order to get the total risk you need to keep adding to a variable totalrisk every time through the for-loop so that it keeps increasing by the choice value for each value of i and i ve made loops start at 0 the first position in the arrays as peter s answer suggested

8983121

you can use your favourite profiling i think you ll need to use a tracing mode the mode that does an instrumentation and not a sampling mode

8983121
profiling	instrumentation
3.if you can t recompile your code but still would not like to use a profiling you can instrumentation your bytecode to achieve the same effect as in 2

the css code from your post is not working because it s a device-specific style and you are viewing it on a safari google-chrome or firefox using a laptop desktop

8983450
hide	show
take a look at jsfiddle live demo it should provide a fairly good example to start on in short what you need to do is when the user clicks on a element you want to hide all tabs and show only the one corresponding to your needs here s a snip of the code

8983450
hide	show
as you can see i ve defined an array which contain the ids of the tabs that i need to show hide

8983657
width	height
if you call the getthumbnailimage with one of the width or height arguments being -1 it will throw an outofmemoryexception as well

you might want to use mouseenter and mouseleave instead

8983678

i saw a code where getter and setter methods are declared private

8983709
getter	setter
that s exactly opposite of what we are trying to achieve through getter and setter

8983714
width	height
when i just use jquery to get the element s height and or width i will get a default value of 300 as it will not wait for the video to load

qabstractitemmodel	qabstracttablemodel
after reading the qt documentation for qabstracttablemodel and its ancestor qabstractitemmodel my first approach was to try this

8983791
hide	show
the basic idea is simple every ajax call you just have to show the popup div and every you receive confirmation from icefaces js you just have to hide the popup

8983791
hide	show
then everytime ajax request on your popup is show and if ajax stop your popup is hide

8983822

8983883
getter	setter
that s exactly opposite of what we are trying to achieve through getter and setter

8983883
getter	setter
the reason for declaring getter and setter is to hide the fields

8983883
getter	setter
the reason for making the getter and setter private is to make the corresponding part of the object s abstract state private

8983883
getter	setter
that s largely independent of the decision to use getter and setter or not

8983883
getter	setter
while the case for using getter and setter is not as strong for private state there are still tangible benefits

8983883
getter	setter
the getter setter methods provide a place for adding extra behavior or error checking code

8983883
getter	setter
getter and setter can be overridden

8983885

int	chars
if you think about the case in which a 1-byte unsigned int can have at most 3 chars in a string representation 0 .. 255 not including the null chars or negative numbers then sizeof int 3 is a reasonable estimate of the maximum string length for an int representation not including a null chars

8984031
integer	unsigned
you check if d is smaller then an unsigned integer

8984039

8984979
rss	feed
try rss or atom feed and any common rss reader mozilla thunderbird

yes you will have to create the constructors but that doesn t make inherited pointless although it is actually a good design practice to prefer composition over inherited that is generally not always it is better to have a cat that has-a animal properties than a cat that is-a animal

8986862
inherited	properties
going back to inherited when it really pays off since there are some attributes that all your animals will have think maybe legs ears head and by using inherited you will not have to declare those properties in every class you create

some processors allow direct access to the tlb while knowing nothing about page tables e.g mips while others know about page tables and internally use tlbs that the programmer mostly doesn t see e.g x86

8993860
hide	show
so now you can loop through the array of these elements show the div that goes along with the selected radio and hide the ones that aren t

8993860
hide	show
otherwise if you added a new section you d have to edit each if statement you made adding the new section to make sure it show and hide properly

8993861
gridview	rowdatabound
that should be done in rowdatabound of the outer gridview

8993867
subtract	add
you could compose a datetime object or perhaps just change your procedure to accept a numeric days offset and add or subtract that from sysdate within the procedure itself

8993877
typedef	struct
to understand where is the problem in the second code i give bellow i have put my struct definitions and typedef outside of myclass

8993877
typedef	typename
i also removed the keyword typename from the typedef and i have put instead of nodedata in the first typedef even if i don t want to do that actually otherways it will give some errors at this line like expected a type got nodedata

8993877
typedef	struct
how can i do for the second code to not be obliged to specify nodedata for the first typedef because members var1 and var2 of struct nodedata are not necessarily of type int

8993880
stdout	stderr
b it reported the error to stderr or stdout which usually goes into a .out file instead of through log4j which does to the usual .log file and i forgot that the .out file even existed so i didn t check there.

the w32headers project provides gcc - and g++ -compatible headers and archives for most standard windows dlls including ws2_32.dll

8994057
put	get
i am trying to put multiple date pickers on a dialog box from the extension library i get this error.

8994139
put	get
so you re not duplicating the info about the test step fields a-c but you do get an opportunity to put each of those steps into many testplans and record their results

8994165
int	double
firstly your main problem the d specifier is only for int not float s or double s

8994281
rtos	mqx
supports multi-platforms such as wince and perhaps other rtos s like mqx

8994454
google-chrome	firefox
the previously mentioned method is supported in firefox 4+ and at least google-chrome 5+

8994454
google-chrome	firefox
if you want to also support firefox 2+ and google-chrome 1+ you can play with the __definesetter__ to prevent onkeydown from being defined

8994481
google-chrome	firefox
i don t know if this helps but the following works for me on ie8 - 9 google-chrome and firefox using a 1.5gb zip file

the first is to return the same json structure for a post request as you would a get request for the show action returning a single item. this uses a single request

8994601
umbraco	dotnetnuke
based on what you are looking for i d recommend you go with a platform like dotnetnuke or a million other ones line sitefinity or umbraco or orchard or something like that some of them like umbraco give you mvc too

8994601
umbraco	dotnetnuke
and right now i have a asp.net app that works great but i want to add in some social features so i m going plug in a umbraco or dotnetnuke site that integrates with it to host the more common social components

8994614
put	get
there s no error on the import statement and if i put that import statement in external.as i still get the error on the function signature line but not on the import line it has no problem with that

8994621

8994685
disk	ram
each client s disk image could have a unique key it would use less ram and would probably take less time to implement

8994698
google-chrome	firefox
i would like to be able to do this with firefox and google-chrome

8994772
post	get
i ve read similar post on here but i can t get results with those answers

8994901
inherited	properties
because an a element is alway within body and td by default inherited the properties from tr

8994901
inherited	properties
perhaps you can selectively set white-space to pre or pre-wrap to some elements that enclose the relevant parts remembering that the properties inherited if not set on inner elements

8994921
folder	directory
while it redirects all visitors except 1.3.3.7 the images directory within the coming-soon folder is blocked

8994964
fadein	hide
which brings up an interesting point trying to remove the fadein it doesn t even hide the element

8994999
floating-point	fixed-point	floating-point	integer
decimal itself is fine but most programming languages don t support fixed-point arithmetic only integer arithmetic and floating-point arithmetic which means that your application will most likely have to use integers rather than floating-point values since floating-point values cannot represent 12.34 exactly and the round-trip can cause wrong results so it s a bit of a pain to handle the conversions between application-integers and database- decimal s

8995072
post	get
if you add the time as the second portion of the key you can use a combination of endkey descending and limit to get the last n post based on the thread_id

8995118
post	get
a controller does not represent a web page but a collection of actions performed redirects get s post etc...

8995118

chances are you ll only have one controller but two methods for the get and post phase of searching

8995131
versioning	upgrade
with the latest upgrade pack 1 you can even install a supported versioning of the extension library which allows very rich applications to be deployed

8995172
pull	push
it used to be that i could run git pull and git push and it would know that i meant git push origin master but now it does not and i think it s tracking a different branch because git push origin master works fine everything up to date and git push tells me it can t fast-forward changes

8995179
stdout	stderr
if you start your shell bash by following command all the stdout stderr will be rerouted copied to another shell dev tty2 in this case

8995225
post	get
that way your script can safely handle get and post requests

8995268
postgresql	mysql
the solution should work on a multidatabase environment mssql postgresql mysql

8995289
codeigniter	cakephp
if you want to head in this direction consider using an existing framework like cakephp or codeigniter to give you a headstart

8995294
hide	show
in my experience using jquery doing a basic show hide of an element does work but dom manipulation does not and getting positions of elements is sketchy at best

8995306
fadein	hide
however the fadein method works just using hide first

8995306
fadein	hide
.css opacity 0 will not hide the element in ie8 so my only option at this point is to use fadein for what i m trying to accomplish

8995324
coalesce	isnull
the solution in this link should be adaptable to those environments as it s standard sql you can use isnull if coalesce is not available

8995328
for-loop	arrays
if you aren t doing this for school or anything that you are limited in how you accomplish you could try something where you push the items into an arrays and then iterate through to print out using a for-loop join statement or string builder

8995332
fadein	fadeout	fadein	hide	hide	fadeout
the hide and fadein fadeout methods toggle the display css property

8995346
udp	tcp
this is called udp tcp hole punching

8995367
qtimer	qthread	qtimer	qobject	qthread	qobject
qobject starttimer qtimer can only be used with threads started with qthread

8995380
pop-up	dialog
when applicable a form button with an onclick event on it pop-up that throws a confirmation dialog and then submits the button

8995380
onclick	onmousedown
if i change onclick to onmousedown all clicks work but clicks on the confirmation dialog that comes up don t work

8995381
google-chrome	firefox
now if i run this within netbeans the xml file renders perfectly within google-chrome ie and firefox

8995385
cout	cin
for each of the cin and cout statements i am getting an error which says symbol cin cout could not be resolved. i am also getting an error which says symbol s not found for architecture x86_64.

8995394
toolbar	tabs
i am currently using extjs 4 and have a tab panel of about 4 tabs and i want to put the same container which contains two toolbar inside each tab

8995455
rvm	bundler	capistrano	bundler	capistrano	rvm
bundler by default doesn t install gems into the default rvm environment when deployed via capistrano it installs to the shared bundle directory instead to try and accommodate production installation environments that aren t using rvm

8995455
rvm	bundler
if you are using rvm in production and want to just have bundler install to your default ruby gemset which is terribly useful if you are going to be logging into the production running rake scripts console etc add the following options to your config deploy.rb

8995455
rvm	bundler
this will remove the --deployment and --quiet which you may or may not want to keep and --path flags which cause bundler to try and package everything up nicely so bundler will now install to the user s rvm environment

8995527
folder	directory
in that directory you should find a hidden folder .rvm which contains a folder scripts which contains an executable file called rvm

8995538
serializable	deserialization
note that i m using new streams serializable and deserialization to avoid end of stream errors

8995593
g++	gcc
i m well aware of the fact cuda needs older versions gcc g++ and i ve installed gcc g++ 4.5.1 and softlinked them as documented here

8995609
folder	directory
the problem i ve got is that on the server i have some javascript that used to work would create an activex object of scripting.filesystemobject and try to create a folder in a virtual directory that happened to be on a shared folder in a remote machine

8995610
uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
uiwindow doesn t handle auto-rotation or autoresizing - only uiviewcontroller do that

8995610
uiview	uiwindow
see orientation in a uiview added to a uiwindow

8995665
width	height
within the checkerboard class you could have the view divided into an 8 x 8 grid programmatically using the width and height passed in

8995705
sorting	filtering
i m trying to create a page with sorting layout buttons and multiple filtering

8995741
tunnel	packets
packets from tunnel coming with a linux cooked capture encapsulation 16 bytes header

8995743
width	height
i found that it was possible to work around this issue by setting an explicit width and height on the webcontrol

8995743
width	height
it seems that a webcontrol doesn t like being inside a stackpanel unless it the webcontrol has both width and height set

8995776
lxml	beautifulsoup
there are lots of option available like lxml or beautifulsoup

8995776
firepath	firebug
for xpath use firefox s firebug extension or install firepath

8995812
children	parent
it moves from the targeted element to the parent and then selects all ul elements that are immediate children not just descendants of that parent element

8995815
children	parent
.find looks into that containing parent element and only selects direct children of ul using that css selector ul

8995867
getter	setter
however i always see variables made private and then a getter and setter function used to retrieve that value sometimes even a pointer to that variable

8995906
for-loop	loops
javascript has no block level scope so variables defined in the for-loop are actually defined at the top of the function hoisted and survive the loops

8995921
versioning	upgrade
maybe you will want to add some checks to the next versioning of the library or to do something when someone read the value and if the variable will be public in the current versioning upgrade the library versioning will cost a lot of work

8995955
google-chrome	firefox
this works great for me in firefox google-chrome and ie it should lead you in the right direction

8995965
lxml	elementtree
i ve answered a couple of questions here on so related to lxml elementtree and i usually see people getting stuck trying to write these weird list comprehensions to deal with something xpath handles in one line much more clearly

8996005
margin	height	width	height	width	margin
each element in my masnory grid has fixed width 220px + 5 margin and random height depending on its content and i am using media queries in css file to change columns number on different screen resolution page width can be 230 460 690

8996011
free	malloc
for example malloc free are c routines

8996039
gif	png
bitmaps don t have alpha channels like png gif

8996040
solaris	aix
what applies on macos x with its mach kernel is different from linux which is different from solaris or aix

8996057
versioning	upgrade
i have not found out how to upgrade and replace a package whose newer versioning is not still in the distribution repository

8996104
int	boolean
it supports int float boolean string and unicode array and dict data types and arbitrary nesting yay recursion

8996161
width	height
i m looking for a way to find a specified window dimensions width height

8996209
rss	feed
i d like to know how to change the width of the border of this list an rss feed so that it s around half the content s width and centred without changing the width of the div or the rss feed

8996209
rss	feed
this is the rss feed s css

8996210
google-chrome	firefox
at least it s not in google-chrome 16 or firefox 7

8996279
width	height
what is the best way to have two divs left and right of each other where one dictates the width and the other dictates the height

8996279
width	height
then if the css is changed for width or height both boxes will adjust accordingly

8996281
src	attr
input name item_pic_url .val #mygalthree img attr src

8996283
put	get
at the moment the result i get is the list of the sponsors ordered by the amount as it should be but the team name appearing alongside it is the same for all rows it s not the one of the highest bidder and the bid amount is not the one of the highest bidder but simply the first one to put one in

8996326
children	parent
i ve run into a bit of struggle with .find and .attr i think when trying to iterate through an xml and find and return children where the parent s .attr value is equal to what is being passed in the function

8996326
button	checkbox
desired outcome the desired outcome is that the user clicks on a button to submit which runs the function createrow and when they do it will check to see if the checkbox is checked and if it is it will only iterate through those items in the xml where the oadata value is equal to the value of the boxes that are checked

8996336
stdout	stderr
one other odd possibility is if your remote script.sh tries to write to stdin or dev tty instead of stdout stderr

8996339
width	height
css borders are applied to the full dimensions of an element and can t be applied to only a certain portion or by a certain width or height

8996345
int	chars
if you re tempted to reduce the width of the transactions table consider a small chars code instead of an int

8996345
int	chars
if a chars 2 code won t cover your anticipated values use an int and pay the price of a join to get human-readable values

8996350
folder	directory
it should be noted than i can change directory using the first command above and then create a test123 folder in both pdfcreator and design review folder

8996380
mouse	keyboard
the key window is the window that is currently accepting mouse and keyboard events

8996393
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested it in google-chrome firefox and ie and it all works okay just a bit confused by the matter

8996405
uiview	calayer
uiview uses calayer in the background so you re using calayers in either case

8996405
uiview	calayer
note that there s a layer property in uiview of the type calayer

8996405
uiview	calayer
you can think uiview hides some of the calayer implementation details

8996438
keystore	jks
keystore type jks

8996458
google-chrome	firefox
to get a live view of the page you can either use firebug for firefox or if you re using google-chrome there are developer tools under the view menu that you can use to see how the html looks live

8996488
int	double
you need to convert them into int or double as required using integer.parseint value or double.parsedouble value

8996497
versioning	upgrade
i want to upgrade to the 2.0wip versioning of bootstrap and i found a fork with the same name under

8996516
int	double
you have to use in-built methods to parse string into int and double

8996541
post	get
if i do make a new mode and get anywhere with it i ll post it here

8996573
width	height
this for example is why the defaults for the filter effects region are x -10 y -10 width 120 height 120

8996576
getter	setter
class defines the behavior and the members are the state of the object...so having a setter and a getter defines the encapsulation behavior of the class of letting others find change the objects state

8996592
width	height
then divide the #container .width and #container height by the applicable tiles and map out a js object to create a data grid and the expected width and height of each cell

8996626
terminate	timeout
ipn will not as far as i know report back to the site that the checkout session timeout or was terminate

8996652
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the javascript console in a modern browser like google-chrome or safari or with the firefox extension firebug is awesome

8996654
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i tested it offline with xampp and online in google-chrome safari firefox but nothing happens no error but no panel no gui

8996696
google-chrome	firefox
you can see it working correctly on google-chrome and firefox using css3 transitions

8996696
google-chrome	firefox
i want it to keep the fade even when i hover onto the project s title in the same fashion as it works in google-chrome and firefox

8996710
google-chrome	firefox
...in google-chrome s developer tools or firebug for firefox

8996716
google-chrome	safari
the same code works fine in safari and google-chrome

8996796
touchesbegan	touchesended
then to detect a tap on the button you can just use the touchesbegan and touchesended i m pretty sure those aren t complete method names check in the docs for more info on them methods

8996809
verilog	vhdl
many designers write vhdl verilog instead of a high-level language for the same reasons that many programmers used to and still do in some cases write assembly instead of java you can tune resource usage and performance at a low level

8996809
verilog	vhdl
both vhdl and verilog are languages designed for designing hardware

8996809
verilog	vhdl
given enough time you could always write a program in vhdl verilog that will outperform a high-level language program

8996839
hash	md5
that script will create an md5 hash for a user password

8996843
hash	md5
note md5 always produces the same hash

8996851
hash	salt
at least salt your hash

8996856
hash	salt
and as the comments above suggest you should always salt your hash to add an extra layer of security.

8996881
outputstream	inputstream
if you really wanted to test output though i m not sure if there s a lot of value you could add inputstream outputstream parameters to the method

8996881
outputstream	inputstream
output will then read from inputstream and write to outputstream

8996882
min	max
see if it s possible to limit number of rows by adding a max timestamp combined with your min timestamp

8996882
post	get
if none of the above help you immediately check out this post describing how to use a sub-query to get the count which avoids the group by altogether

8996894
opera	firefox
synchronously in opera and pre-4.0 firefox

8996934
maven-antrun-plugin	appassembler
the only way to do this is to process the file with another maven plugin like maven-antrun-plugin or assembly after running appassembler

8996947
tiff	png	tiff	ico	png	ico
if you re dealing with any png tiff or ico images and converting them to a format that doesn t support transparency you also need to call g.clear bgcolor prior to calling drawimage

8997018
post	get
when you get your post data run it through stripslashes

8997062
public	protected
regardless of philosophy a class outside of your implementation cannot access the private method without hacking the jvm so you re out of luck - you either have to change the method s visibility make a protected testing api the unit-test class extends or test the function indirectly by calling the public methods making use of it

8997074
awt	swing
pdfbox uses java awt and swing even for non ui tasks i ve tried to remove references but there are a lot of files and i was removing too much stuff

8997092
hash	salt
also as mitch wheat mentioned for password storage you really should salt the hash hash some random data together with the password then store the random data and the hash

8997113
public	protected
well i dont know what scott myers said but anyway by doing the way you specified a car method can only access the vehicle public methods and properties exactly the same way that you would be able if you created a vehicle object there are no protected methods and properties so there are no encapsulation breaking over here only if the base class is not correctly encapsulated

8997127
post	get
whether the request was a get or a post is nothing but a piece of data on the httpservletrequest object by the time it gets to you

8997133
post	get
patches for get and post

8997133
post	get
you will have to include those extra arguments or change this yourself to get the priority working with post and get requests

8997166
post	get
ex so once you get the post you can handle that programatically

8997214
mouse	keyboard
it can even do some non-network-related tasks like report input device keyboard mouse events

8997248
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
create java.util.date or java.util.calendar object set date value and use java.text.simpledateformat class method to format it

8997253
onfocus	onblur
in ie i was able to defeat the onfocus onblur approach by double-clicking

8997268
put	get
and put it in your db with the id _design yourapp then get it like this

8997269
maven	pom.xml
moreso because it s a maven.xml and not a pom.xml no reasonably old or recent ide can load the project up - i have to build it by hand running the maven script

8997269
versioning	upgrade
i ll freely admit i m fairly ignorant when it comes to java and maven but surely someone out there has to have some pointers on how i could upgrade to a more recent versioning of maven

8997278
post	get
5 once you get the post request to your page make the deletion before you do select queries

8997303
filtering	grouping
the first two parts of the key where it was specifically used to filtering your criteria thus the rest remain in proper order already for the grouping

8997316
folder	directory
however when i attempt to browse to this directory i cannot find the folder directory named windowspowershell that is supposed to be in the documents folder

8997350
post	get
you can use get or post to do anything you want

8997354
pop-up	dialog	checkbox	dropdownlistfor
basically when a user clicks a link for a reserved booking a jquery dialog pop-up and populates rows of checkbox with an equipment name bunsen burner each row also has 2 dropdownlistfor which allow the client to select how many items and if it is for an individual or a group the checkbox changes the selected row from disabled to enabled

8997366
google-chrome	firefox
on google-chrome firefox etc.

8997368
google-chrome	firefox
right now i m using the google-chrome browser but i ve experienced the same in the past with firefox

8997445
pull	push
anyone can push and pull from any of the repos

8997456
qapplication	qwidget
the problem was that i initialize qapplication later than qwidget gets initialized

8997460
hide	show
you should just be able to hide a label and show a textarea and then switch back when you re done editing

8997548
pop-up	dialog
a dialog will pop-up with all the goodies

8997553
pop-up	dialog
pop-up a jquery modal dialog so you don t have to leave your question list page

8997593
pop-up	dialog
a dialog will pop-up with all the goodies

8997596
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition
if i want to create three threads one for addition second for subtraction and third for multiplication i can simply do

8997619
subtraction	addition
see the example here i have created two threads t1 and t2 where t1 does the addition and t2 does the subtraction

8997685
margin	height
one of your issues was also that your footer needs to have the same total height as the negative margin of the wrapper

8997719
width	height
uc behaves as if it was newly created with width and height equal to 150px

8997771
s-function	simulink	matlab	s-function	matlab	simulink
for an s-function you need to make sure your c matlab or fortran code is where simulink expects it to be

8997771
s-function	simulink
right click on the s-function block in your simulink project - choose s-function parameters

8997796
cpu	processors
first column is name second processors third cpu

8997807
ssl	https
there are several protocols http https file ssh ssl ftp

8997822
oncreate	recreate	portrait	landscape
in android when the screen orientation changes between landscape and portrait the oncreate method is called which if not handled properly will recreate the entire activity when the result is too simply change the layout and retain all of the same information

8997855
post	get
it simply consists in redirecting after a successful post so that the user refresh results in an idempotent get to be done rather than a post

8997857
width	margin
one way to do that is to add it s width to your margin on the right like this

8997890
oncreate	ondestroy
when such a change occurs android restarts the running activity ondestroy is called followed by oncreate

8997929
disk	ram
note this is a hypothetical so don t bring up anything about premature optimization you d be better off to minimize disk i o before worrying about this depends on how much ram you have etc.

8997956
google-chrome	firefox
when submitting a form with javascript with onchange event google-chrome and firefox work but ie does not

8998032
rss	feed
so i have an rss feed application but am currently having some problems

8998141
width	height
i have a horizontal nav bar and my a elements are not expanding to be the width height of the parent li element

8998145
width	height
because the element is an inline element by default which means among many many other things you cannot give it a width or a height

8998157
width	height
it combines the best of both worlds - you can put them side-by-side without the need for float and give them whatever width and height you choose

8998162
put	get
moreover what is weird is that when i do step-by-step debugging with a breakpoint inside the thread where the image gets fetched from the internet the code runs fine and the image gets displayed but when i put the breakpoint further down outside the thread where the code to actually update the ui is the image does not get displayed as if this code is never reached

8998183
serializable	deserialization
by using the sqlxml class ado.net can communicate with sql server in this binary format and not require the database server to do any serializable or deserialization of xml

8998183
serializable	deserialization
however at worst instead of serializing to a string the message could instead be serializable to an xmldocument - which can then be passed to sqlxml through a new xmlnodereader - avoiding a deserialization serializable trip to a string

8998185
mkmapview	mkannotationview
i have set up an mkmapview with mkannotationview s for a bunch of locations

8998195
width	height
i don t get what you want to know clearly but in my case i try golovko fixedheader table and it works fine even with dynamic table except some bugs .if the table is static you can do with just css and js which control the height and width of table

8998234
post	get
android sdk doesn t contain all the sources in order to get them all you need to use some tricks like described in this blog post

8998254
ssl	https
lwp protocol https socket ssl connect attempt failed with unknown

lan	localhost
we have a jar running on different machines all machines are connected in lan and this jar populating data which is stored on individual localhost machine s db...

8998268
jboss	weblogic	jboss	glassfish	glassfish	weblogic
normally ejbs are hosted in an application server such as weblogic websphere jboss glassfish etc etc - when you deploy your ejb to one such server and start that server - server process is a jvm - meaning your server process that hosts your ejb is running in a jvm

8998268
jdk1.6	jdk1.5
now if you use a different java.exe say c jdk1.6 bin java.exe to run the client than the java.exe say c jdk1.5 bin java.exe used by your application server you are using two different jvms

8998280
post	get
i am guessing this should be done in a php post or get variable

8998280
post	get
i can grab the topic from the post or get variable and then run the rest of my site

8998280
post	get
as of now the only way i have passed post or get variables was from forms on the previous page

8998289
equals	gethashcode
you also need to override the gethashcode and equals methods from the object class

8998309
post	get
you should probably use get because it sounds like you re just trying to display different information and post is supposed to be for performing changes or actions

8998311
for-loop	arrays
i was thinking about two weeks ago and coded a very similar game in c and after some if-else-if-else terrible spaghetti i ended up thinking in put the paths and choices each one in one different arrays and then run a for-loop for each interation and checking in arrays correct answer or not left or right and then extract the point on the other arrays to go allowing the next movement

8998311
for-loop	arrays
so u have choices arrays and paths arrays and the for-loop realize all interations with minimal code

8998330
min	max
create 3 class level properties of max min and avg

8998378
gmail	hotmail
in browsers and outlook it s working nicely but in gmail hotmail and ymail it shows links underlined

8998490
getter	setter
the private setter allows the property to only be set internally to the class while the getter still exposes the property value publicly

8998512
public	protected
the private modifier allows the property to be read-only in the context of public protected or internal access while giving the type itself the ability to set the property in the context of private access

8998592
inherited	properties
for example you may decide that all your view models will expose a showprogressbar properties which can be bound to a progress bar on your page or you may decide to create a progressviewmodelbase or iallowprogress that you inherited implement in pages that require progress bars

8998596
range	minimum
in my experience using ses the minimum api response time i ve seen has been in the half second range while the average hovered around one second

8998603
public	protected
to only call public package protected methods of your code

8998631
accessor	properties
another benefit in some situations is after giving a private set to your properties you can give a set method for changing the properties value from external world when you want to do some calculations or validations on the value received which is not a best practice to do inside the set properties accessor and then change the value of the properties as follows

8998647
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
this works for ie firefox google-chrome opera but doesn t fire in safari

8998786
rtp	rtcp
i want to know whether a device mobile phone supports rtp rtcp

8998786
rtp	rtsp
rtsp has rtp and rtcp.but when i try to create a socket connection which waits for rtp packets an exception throws

8998844
post	get
this is most likely because you re accessing indexes that don t exist in your post or get variable

8998859
getter	setter
take a java bean setter and getter methods class

8998864
post	put	post	get	put	get
not only http get request i need to generate dynamic post put request in some manners

8998864
post	put
there are many tools but i couldn t find right tool for generating post put request with non-static data

8998864
post	put	post	get	put	get
ability to write the custom request for http get post and put

8998864
post	put	post	get	put	get
based on certain condition the request generator needs to parse json document in the http body and process it to make another get post put request

8998895
cpu	affinity
we know how to change a threads affinity and we know that there is no guarantee that a thread will remain associated with any cpu although in this particular case the thread s eating up cpu remain associated with only one cpu but in order to do so we need to first determine which process thread needs to be relocated

8998898
hide	show
what i want is to hide and show the differnt forms on the page using the enable button using jquery

8998935
affinity	processors
by default threads have no affinity can operate on any processors

8998987

edit after some second thoughts i think it s better to just use one stringbody and put all the data in one post variable then parse it from that it skips writing the data to a file and deleting it after the request since the temp file is totally useless this will increase performance

9003693
put	get
for this i want to create a vector queue with synchronized get and put methods

9003706
width	height
to test this i made a new bitmap width 1000 pixels height 3 pixels

9003706
printf	atoi
so i thought i could just printf the string in reverse and then use atoi to convert it to int

9003706
width	height
i just want to get an integer with the filesize or width height anything

9003707
filesystems	fat
the problem is that somewhere in the lifetime of the files they have been copied using fat filesystems drivers that are not vfat aware

9003743
sorting	filtering
databases are great if you want to do efficient sorting filtering and relational operations ie

9003768
jobs	cron
its worth noting that in addition to running daemons or cron jobs you can kick off long running processes from a web request but note that it must run outside of the webserver process group and of course asynchronous message processing which is essentially a variant on the batch approach

9003780
hash	md5
cause some big services are avoiding this for example gravatar wants you to convert email address into md5 hash and then pass it in query

9003783
nsentitydescription	nsmanagedobjectmodel
since it s all core data an alternative would be to ask the nsmanagedobjectmodel for the relevant nsentitydescription via its entitiesbyname dictionary and inspect the entity description s propertiesbyname dictionary

9003834
children	parent
add a before_destroy filter to parent that iterates over all its children

9003834
children	parent
provided that the destroy triggered by is executed on the instanced children of the parent object it could work

9003868
division	modulo
is the modulo it gives you the remainder of an integer division

9003871
folder	directory
after tinkering with this method it seems that simply passing it a directory and expecting the resulting zip file to have the same file folder structure is wrong

9003881
post	get
for some reason on the second page when i click the save button which is defined exactly the same as on the first page i get the post that i expect request.requesttype post but then page_load gets fired again with page.ispostback being false request.requesttype get - like i just clicked into the page

9003959
google-chrome	firefox
when i view the webpage in google-chrome firefox the sidebar-homepage list items display correctly in the harabara font

9003967
express	node.js
node.js web apps such as those built with express can almost always handle multiple connections in a single process as can most python java scala and clojure apps

9003996
put	get
i have multiple 2d arrays containing resources grouped by format each has different dimensions for different format rowed by index coled by configure type like 0 1 2..6 so i want to put them into another 1d array in order to look up easily through index and get resource finally but i don t know how

9004002
put	get
as this method does not get called because you must register some listener to it but gets called because you put in your androidmanifest.xml file this line

9004010
google-chrome	firefox
but i get error 100 in google-chrome and nothing appears in firefox

9004015
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png
the source image can be in jpeg png gif or bmp format

9004019
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
it looks like you can eliminate the for-loop and the pram arrays altogether because you re adding the parameters to cmd already outside loops

9004020
junit	testng
i m converting a bunch of test cases written for use with junit 4+ to use testng instead

9004030
int	double
other types int double are working

9004060
google-chrome	safari
in ie works fine but in google-chrome and safari not open

9004061
put	get
the script runs in production if i put it in .ready instead of .click but in .click i don t even get the alert so i am assuming the issue is with the postback occuring before the jquery script has a chance to execute

9004061
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested this behavior in ie firefox and google-chrome

9004065
width	height
so if the 3rd is clicked replace the first two s with one that is the same width and height as the other two combined then animate the width of that to 0

9004106
post	get
in one controller i am receiving a post request then adding the value to session before redirecting to the controllers get method

9004106
post	get
the issue is that in the get request the session value returns null even though in the post request the sessions value was set

9004113
slideup	slidedown
if you want to use fading rather than slideup slidedown you can use fadeto duration opacity which will not make stuff jump as the space for the element is maintained

9004185
memcpy	memmove
so now i want to test if my old code using memcpy where memmove should have been used works correct or not on a system with a newer glibc 2.14

9004187

the entities are just regular php classes in doctrine 2 unlike doctrine 1 which can extends or implements whatever you like

9004252
komodo	notepad++	komodo	geany	geany	notepad++
notable examples include code blocks and flashdevelop and any other editor that uses the scintilla editing component such as notepad++ geany komodo edit and many more

9004263
lan	localhost
i got the same issue on a debian openvz container and the problem seemed to come from my etc hosts file where localhost was affected to the lan ip not 127.0.0.1

9004264
margin	height	width	height	width	margin
there are several approaches to achieve this problem but i want to create an xml file similar like web.config files and at the very beginning of my application i want to take the device s screen width and height and calculate each control s textview spinner button etc. attributes such as margin padding width height... according to this width and height and save these calculated values into my xml file

9004321
int	double
other types int double are working

9004575
maven-jar-plugin	pom.xml
according to the way to do this is to have a line in the maven-jar-plugin part of the pom.xml

9004627
coalesce	isnull
use is null isnull or coalesce when testing for nulls

9004637
pop-up	dialog
in one cell i use an href which does pop-up my edit dialog but does not pass the id brid

issue #1 - put sidebar element right under the header change margin to margin 0 20px 0 0 and you will get what you want

9004689
folder	directory
i can t add an existing folder or at least haven t found a way so far and i don t want to add each file separately because if other files are added to the original directory i d like them published as well

9004715
libstdc++	libc++
the following toy program returns different things when linked against libstdc++ and libc++

9004715
libstdc++	libc++
this is how libstdc++ behaves but not how libc++ behaves

9004792
cvs	svn
it sounds like you re used to having id tags in your docblocks that get populated automatically by cvs and svn when you check out the code.

9004793
getter	setter
you are using a getter as a setter

9004920
google-chrome	firefox
this is how it look like in firefox or google-chrome

9004981
google-chrome	safari
i am getting unexpected console output after array assignment in webkit browsers google-chrome 16.0.912.77 and safari 5.1.2 - 7534.52.7

more specifically i am looking to read in all images in a folder convert them to binary two colours black and white and then save the binary image as a new image in another directory probably directory binary for example

9005036
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
uitabbarcontroller - uinavigationcontroller s

uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i have done all of these with the uiviewcontroller being on its own and also with it embedded inside of a uinavigationcontroller

9005096
versioning	upgrade
use the latest versioning of jquery and tell your library users that they need to upgrade

9005096
versioning	upgrade
seriously everyone should be using the latest versioning anyway force them to upgrade

9005131
post	get
here s the beginning of the stock array i m trying to get the data from -- won t post the entire print_r because the source array is over 67 000 lines long but this much should indicate the structure i m working with

9005132
cpu	processors
the bottom line is cpu frequency doesn t say much about the processors performance

9005213
put	get
i don t have any code in my frogger.xml file and i need to get a picture of a frog at the bottom of the scereen and be able to put the code for it in a different folder

9005243
google-chrome	firefox
modern browsers support the maxlength attribute on elements but for the reasons outlined above it doesn t work properly in google-chrome and firefox though i think a fix is working its way through webkit

9005269
xsl-fo	xslt
i have an xslt stylesheet that transforms the xml data into xsl-fo which is then rendered as a pdf using apache fop

9005306
maven	pom.xml
maven pom.xml

9005319
ubuntu	debian
you should also be able to update by using apt-get install org-mode in debian and ubuntu

9005322
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve noticed the same behaviour in safari firefox and google-chrome

9005353
for-loop	arrays
iterate through each member of the arrays with a for-loop

9005397
vertica	ingres
michael stonebreaker the guy behind ingres vertica and other databases has some critiques of nosql that are worth listening to

9005412
youtube	vimeo
it works great but i have iframes youtube vimeo in my carousel and everytime the carousel scrolls it has to load the iframes again - causing a high network usage

9005465
maven	pom.xml
according to the maven pom.xml intro page the relativepath attribute is to be used when you have a parent pom.xml project located in a different-than-normal location where normal is .. pom.xml

9005499
profiler	visualvm
your fear is probably well founded pooling reduces garbage collection and pause times for socket connects but i would highly advise checking your assumptions against a profiler like visualvm

9005509
width	height
giving a print-ticket with the exact width and height avoids scaling that was i wanted in my case

9005510
post	get
you will get a viewstate validation error if the page that your form post to does not match the page that generated the viewstate

9005517
textview	imageview
i m trying to use a gridview with an imageview and a textview inside each cell

9005519
mouseout	mouseenter
normally should be executed after the animation is done but i am looking in the developer tools chrome when doing mouseenter and mouseout but the css does not change.

9005578
getter	setter
i have a model pojo called usermodel that has getter and setter for username and password

9005607
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
when linux passes it usually does not help you in analysis only when freebsd win32 or solaris pass then you got some certainty of correctness

9005652
folder	directory
i had added a main folder that had other directory under it

9005693
cpu	affinity
if you need to pin-point specific a thread or a process you can only assign its affinity so you can have reasonable hope that the process thread will be executed on a particular logical cpu

9005753
factors	matrix
for each eigenvector the corresponding eigenvalue is the factors by which the eigenvector is scaled when multiplied by the matrix

9005758
inline	inlining
the compiler may alleviate some of this through inlining the functions which you could incentize by adding the inline keyword to the definitions

9005759
entities	entitymanager
and i ve got two entitymanager that contain different entities different modules of one application and both point to the same datasource

9005778
for-loop	arrays
i m trying to create an arrays of arrays with a for-loop

9005785
post	get
i need to get selected checkbox values in post actionmethod as well

9005867
put	get
so no matter what i put in it i get messages like

9005885
for-loop	arrays
note that you are pushing the same arrays into super_array for each iteration in the for-loop

9005900
superclass	subclassing
a single object is created - but that object is an instance of both the superclass and the subclassing and java.lang.object itself

9005901
aggregate-functions	sum
any query using aggregate-functions sum mixed with non-aggregated fields computerid must use a group by clause

9005922
opera	safari
i looked at developer toolbar opera s dev tool firebug safari s dev tool and analyzed each button

9005947
int	double
it generates random double and int and send them to server

9006014
int	chars
one possible solution is to use the int value of an chars because every letter is represented by a number

9006032
tabcontrol	tabitem
i have a tabcontrol with multiple tabitem

9006037
button	checkbox
what i m trying to do is that when at least one checkbox in my page is checked a button should be enable or disable if none of the checkbox are checked

9006055
versioning	upgrade
so it might be necessary to upgrade your versioning of bnd or use a plugin that supports blueprint

9006078
getter	setter
i want to write an aspect that will generate getter setter for the fields of a class where it is being used

9006123
hide	show
you can use .show and hide after animation complete and show hide respective content

9006126
getter	setter
if you could generate getter setter in runtime.

9006126
getter	setter
as in eclipse source menu - generate getter setter

9006148
put	get
you could use a uinavigationcontroller to manage your screens -- do a push to put up each view then do a pop to root controller to get back to the beginning

9006159
outputstream	inputstream
i think is the same thing that asking how can i transform an outputstream to an inputstream

9006181
tabcontrol	tabitem
this is weird standard behaviour of tabcontrol - it is unload items whilst switching so you have to extend it slightly to keep cached tabitem whilst switching see more details with an example in this article keeping the wpf tab control from destroying its children

9006202
getter	setter
it generates getter setter and various other handy methods

9006293
mouse	keyboard
3 better would be redirect reading for file contents to the backgroung task swingworker or runnable#thread then jbutton and jlabel will be changed and gui would be during background task responsible for mouse or keyboard

9006325
post	get
wp looks to the trash to prevent duplicate permalinks and until that post is deleted you will get the -2 type permalinks

9006351
google-chrome	firefox
i m on win xp but this problem occurs on firefox ie and google-chrome

9006396
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
install and use graphicsmagick or imagemagick from php

9006437
uiview	subviews
the idea was find the uiview of keyboard and add the button like a subviews

9006441
subplot	imshow
with regard to displaying both images side-by-side you can use subplot in conjunction with your calls to imshow

9006491
hash	md5
if you want the fastest encryption algorithm then there s no substitute for testing it yourself - somewhat strangely php s sha1 implementation is significantly faster than its md5 i know these are hash - this is to illustrate that performance depends on implementation as much as algorithm

9006491
client-side	server-side
why not just use a server-side session with a random value sent client-side you don t have to use the php session handler if you want to implement a remember me type function and still have a conventional session

9006494
portrait	landscape
when testing my application at wxga720 resolution on the android emulator running 4.0.3 ice cream sandwich my app takes the layout assets from the layout-normal-land-854x480 folder in landscape view and the layout-port-480x320 folder for portrait view

9006503
width	margin
one way to kind of achieve the layout you want is to stop floating .productdetailspanel and give it a left margin of 25 the width of .categorypanel plus spacing between them

9006610
websphere	ibm
i am building a java application that should be able to connect to an ibm websphere mq queue manager and i cannot understand why i keep getting this error

9006626
autocomplete	multi-select
try chosen a neat jquery and or prototype plugin to style your drop-downs including tokenization aka multi-select fuzzy autocomplete etc

9006631
tcpdf	fpdf
i am generating a reporting using both fpdf and tcpdf for comparison sack

9006631
tcpdf	fpdf
what i notice is fpdf took nearly 40seconds but tcpdf took nearly 3minutes and 20seconds

9006643
sorting	filtering
the problem is that in our callback function the l2e query is actually executed on the db before any filtering sorting and paging has been performed by the devexpress grid

9006651
portrait	landscape
when testing my application at wgxa720 resolution on the android emulator running 4.0.3 ice cream sandwich my app takes the layout assets from the layout-normal-land-854x480 folder in landscape view and the layout-port-480x320 folder for portrait view

9006654
ivar	nsmutableset
in the header file declare the ivar like nsmutableset buttonsset then in the class implementation

9006696
put	get
the other challenging part is if you insert an element in a spot where it doesn t belong or put an invalid attribute on an element you will get a corrupt file when you try and open it

9006708
put	get
these are set up to handle all verbs but to 405 to everything except get and head because that is the default iis behaviour for static files is to refuse to allow them to be posted to or put to or deleted

9006708
post	get
then try debugging it with a simple html form that post appropriate data or even inappropriate data so you can at least get an error message about the data being wrong rather than it ending up somewhere that refuses to handle post at all

9006720
sorting	filtering
i would implement the paging sorting filtering in the data access layer level and return only what needs to be shown because the grid as you noticed can show the right page but this happens client side and everything is always loaded from the database except if you use their xpo orm which i dont and enable the grid server-mode at least this is the concept in their windows forms and asp.net grid

9006755
google-chrome	firefox
in ie7 8 but not firefox and google-chrome the space between the child li elements provided by the line margin 0.25em 0 0 0

9006796
many-to-one	one-to-many
i have many-to-one mappings working fine but a one-to-many relationship between locations and location_times keeps giving me an error

9006805
min	max
for example we have usagerange type that have two properties min max

9006805
getter	setter
and it is widely used on many tables and have some logic inside getter setter

9006821
folder	directory
we run a website that has an english version in the root directory and a czech version in a folder called cs

9006825
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
but there is some performance glitch under some browsers google-chrome mac windows opera mac ie paradoxically not safari

9006875
stdout	stderr
nslog also writes to stderr while printf writes to stdout

9006876
submit	submission
my intended functionality is for the ajax form to submit without the whole form submission and populate with data that i queried

9006881
try-catch	exception-handling
a while-loop ensures that the input value stays between x and y and my try-catch is supposed to throw an exception-handling if the user enters an invalid variable user enters e when the program expects an integer

9006881
min	max
here is my code when i run it everything runs fine except for when i try to enter an invalid variable for example if i enter e or then my program just loops the code nslog enter a number between i and i min max infinitely

9006893
vimeo	flickr
one i tried was this which iâ m using to extract the vimeo thumbnail so therefor i thought i would work on the flickr thumbnail

9006946
opera	google-chrome
see here for a demo google-chrome or opera

9007016
post	get
looking through other post on here i ve found the following code to get the list of ips for the interfaces on a system

9007029
put	get
in the first approach we put every new candidate into single data structure and that s bad because too many things get mixed up unwisely

9007038
cpu	processors
the first type is when the cpu does not have the virtual-physical mapping in the tlb - the processors invokes the pagefault software interrupt in the os the os puts the mapping into the processors for that process then the proc re-runs the offending instructions

9007058
gtk	cairo
yes cairo is a high quality 2d drawing api and gtk uses cairo to draw itself

9007058
clutter	cairo
clutter uses cogl for rendering but it can also use cairo for 2d elements

9007058
gtk	clutter
clutter will not replace gtk gtk is a very complex library that provides system integration complex widgets and other utility api that clutter has no interest in providing

9007058
clutter	gdk	gtk	clutter	gtk	gdk
clutter can use gdk the gtk windowing system api to talk to the windowing system surfaces and get input events

9007058
gtk	clutter
in the future it s entirely possible that gtk will use clutter internally as the base for its widgets - though that s still a work in progress

9007084
apache	nginx
if it isn t possible by mod_auth_kerb but possible by some other apache or nginx mod it is totally ok

9007122
google-chrome	firefox
tested with ie8 google-chrome and firefox

9007126
qstring	qbytearray
however there is another serious issue in your code which is that you are trying to convert from a qbytearray the result of readall to a qstring

9007140
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly in ie and firefox but will not work in google-chrome or safari webkit

9007150
temporary	tablespace
and there s different syntax for dropping and adding temporary tablespace

9007156
min	max
in first link the value start in 1.0 the min 0.00010 and the max 1000000

9007173
maven	pom.xml
there is no such artifact in maven central repository only pom.xml

9007196
puts	putchar
simply printing it all a la putchar c puts the exact same character at the end of the line

9007217
public	protected
or if the id is a protected public variable

9007217
public	protected
or even call your own method protected public

9007243
multiplying	add
i am pretty confident that you are dealing with strings based on the slicing you use in your example but if row.getvalue ld_mcpi returns an int you can multiplying it by 1000 to add the three zeros

9007245
accessor	properties
the retain is done by the synthesized properties accessor method

9007292
hash	md5
so i thought of using a hashing function like sha or md5 to hash the identifiers i get then use them as ids for my spans and i can apply the hashing function again to find my element

9007319
hide	show
these statments are used to show or hide columns in a grid run queries to return data and any other restrictions needed

9007337
put	get
if you don t get a permission which is not critical and inputsimulation is far to dangerous a permission imho to be considered critical to put the camera away run but inform the user at the appropriate time that s he has to do some manual stuff

9007348
listener	eventhandler
another way as implementing inner actionlistener with setactioncommand string actioncommand for whole jmenu is wrote java.swing.action for each of jmenuitem or implements eventhandler seems like as valid for all listener that i tried

9007348
listener	eventhandler
example about jbuttons and with implemented actionlistener and eventhandler both listener firing events

9007367
portrait	landscape
im developing an application to display a gallery of images by using a uiscrollview the sliding between images works fine on portrait mode but when changed to landscape mode it shows the image plus a portion of the next image

9007387
svg	vml
up to now - is used processing.js javascript canvas implementation of processing language and or raphael.js tiny and handy vml svg javascript library

9007387
svg	vml
lower amount of primitives highly scalable integrated in dom - svg vml vector high-level api

9007402
post	get
basically what you need to do is get the expected csrf value from the cookie named ci_csrf_token by default then post it along with your other data

9007452
typedef	struct
in my code i have typedef struct to represent the particle and a set of vectors to represent the particle s velocity acceleration and position

9007461
httprequest	httpresponse
httpcontext httprequest httpresponse etc

9007461
mvp	presenter
to summarize in the mvp design model the presenter is handling the work that might be handled by the view in the mvc design model

9007474
submit	submission
i suspect the reason that it s not submission is because the element in the page isn t a form element and doesn t have an associated submit action

9007476
entities	entitymanager
using an lifecycle event listener you can access the entitymanager and delete those entities too

9007483
free	malloc
for every memory region that you malloc you re responsible for free ing it yourself

9007526
min	max
this function returns an array of pretty y axis values that encompass the min and max y values passed in

9007529
free	malloc
in order to free memory you must use the free function after you ve allocated with malloc

9007529
free	malloc
so the answer is if is the only pointer to space you ve previously allocated with malloc you must release the memory with free before you assign to that pointer as that will mean you no longer have any pointer to that space and that is a memory leak

9007532
free	malloc
if you re not using malloc you must not use free

9007532
free	malloc
if you ve used malloc you have to use free

9007576
filtering	grouping
i want vertically grouping checkboxes with a search filtering

9007604
min	max
as for the min max part simply write the appropriate comparator classes

9007624
post	get
for some odd reason by design or omission on facebook s part using the graph api to get at public post using a user access token just doesn t want to work

9007638
versioning	upgrade
you have to upgrade your java versioning to 1.6 minimum

9007675
httpconnection	downloading
but not able to downloading it using httpconnection imageio.read and even in php using file_get_contents

9007675
opera	firefox

9010721
getter	setter	ivar	subclassing
as caleb points out another reason to use direct ivar access in init dealloc is to avoid subclassing that implement custom setter getter logic that may barf due to the undefined state of the object during init dealloc

just replace max with min

9011514
width	height
for your case you d just have to multiply the resulting texture coordinates with your width height

9011519
button	checkbox
the user can choose one favorite color via a radio button then they can choose multiple secondary colors via checkbox in case their favorite color is out of stock

9011519
button	checkbox
the problem i m having is that when i click a checkbox it also activates the radio button

9011549
google-chrome	firefox
i m not a programmer but i ve put together a site that uses fancy box and all is good in google-chrome and firefox but ie8 ie9 are a disaster

9011558
post	get
1 for the syntax to get a json asmx service to work take a look at this post

9011567
button	checkbox
the entire label is being used as a shortcut to the radio button so clicking the checkbox which is inside the label as well will activate the label and also the radio button

9011576
button	checkbox
clicking anywhere on the label selects the radio button including the checkbox you have inside the as well

9011596
required	placeholder
to be honest it looks like this is a placeholder block to be used if required

9011597
cs-cart	smarty
i m working with a shopping cart cs-cart that uses smarty templates

9011607
public	protected
you may have to create a class and inherit from whatever class you re using which inherits from listview i m assuming this because if you were using the listview class directly then you would probably have access to the underlying cache and the mechanisms to get the item at a particular index would be manifest create a public wrapper function call the protected onretrievevirtualitem function with the parameter you specified in your example code and the return the .item from there so

9011608
folder	directory
on the other hand if you want to run it from windows say from a cmd.exe command prompt then the .sh extension is used by windows to determine how to execute it and you can invoke it as rd if a it s in a directory in your path and b windows is configured in folder options and or by setting pathext to use sh or bash to launch .sh files

9011621
opensuse	linux
i am using gcc suse linux 4.6.2 on opensuse 12.1 asparagus i586

9011623
int	boolean
the boolean under the hood is essentially a short int

9011644
google-chrome	firefox
how can i reset file input in ie i used the following and it worked in google-chrome and firefox but not ie

9011657
post	put
the problem seems to be with all tests that do post put delete requests

9011686
onfling	gestures
there s a few issues with the webview and gesturedetectors - try always returning false in your onfling .. method instead of true - using a gestures detector in the fashion you do is known to block pretty basic stuff such as even updating the currently displayed page

9011693
google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly in google-chrome and firefox and it should work perfectly in internet explorer

9011702
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i also want the css solution to be valid for these ie7 and above google-chrome firefox safari

9011780
valgrind	memcheck
at alanxz s suggestion i ve run the standalone version of the code under valgrind memcheck helgrind and drd tools

9011854
16-bit	64bit
back when the natural-size on 16-bit machines was well 16-bit of course the balance went more in favour of going for the natural size than today when we ve 32-bit and 64bit machines

9011854
unsigned	short
firstly though we tend to use signed more than unsigned values which would lean us toward short but also ushort is not a cls-compliant type and there s hardly any point introducing an incompatibility with other .net languages in obtaining compatibility with com

9011891
put	get
if you don t do anything the app will get put to sleep anyway and won t execute any code

9011892
sendkeys	msgbox
-threading and sendkeys i was also unable to get the msgbox to respond to sendkeys

9011964
width	margin
set the width of the others margin s padding s etc and float them

9011987
getter	setter
locking inside the getter or setter won t help because that lock s scope exists entirely within one of the steps either 1 or 3

9012017
xslt	xquery
then you can use other libraries like saxon to execute xpath xslt or xquery against that xml tree

9012029
draggable	droppable
i have tried using draggable droppable so that the card is not initially confined to sortables but i still cannot get it to recognize where the card is

9012029
draggable	droppable
i m also thinking that draggable droppable will not be what i need because then i cannot move the card from a sortable back to original listing draggable

9012052
post	get
here is a modified version that sends a byte array to the server as far as you can get the image bytes you can use this to send them to the server as an attached image to the post request

9012134
atomic	interlocked
using the interlocked class provides for atomic operations inherently threadsafe as in this linqpad example

9012156
post	get
my problem is that when i try to post i get a js error because some of the vars are undefined

9012192
rtsp	rtmp
ideally i would like to show the video in player like jwplayer however it does not support rtsp protocol but rtmp instead

9012192
rtsp	rtmp
1 transcode the video stream from rtsp - rtmp

9012207
stdout	stderr
we would like to be able to output stdout to another file either a csv or txt and we would also like to be able to output stderr to null or a seperate file so we can inspect it later

9012223
post	put
i am very new to backbone.js and i am trying to figure out why changes in the page s form fields are not being sent in post put requests

9012275
strcpy	strncpy
use strcpy or strncpy function to copy a string in an array of char

9012290
for-loop	loops
change the for-loop to a while loops and only increment if

9012292
concave	convex
if the polygon is concave let s call an edge a concave edge if it s not on the convex hull of the polygon

9012293
width	height
clone the div incrementally strip words out until the clone s height width becomes less than the original s

9012318
for-loop	loops
although it s not strictly illegal in java it s not a good idea to change the value of the for-loop control variable from within loops

9012318
for-loop	loops
by changing loops iteration variable within loops you re messing with the implicit assumptions offered by your use of a for-loop

9012330
.htaccess	httpd.conf
if the redirects are simple redirects url1 to url2 no regex etc and you have access to httpd.conf then you could use a rewritemap for all the redirects and possibly have just 1 rule in your .htaccess to handle these

9012331
equals	gethashcode
it makes sense to me we re overriding gethashcode to return a value based on two properties that if match the two objects should be treated as equals

9012342
typedef	struct
for convenience you can combine the struct declaration and the typedef into one block

9012356
equals	gethashcode
based on your gethashcode implementation objects with coordinates x y and y x will be considered equals since

9012360
equals	gethashcode
gethashcode can return same value for two cartesiancoordinates that are not equals for two objects c1 and c2 such that and

9012365
chunked	transfer-encoding
you should try using curl instead to test out transfer-encoding chunked

9012370
equals	gethashcode
the gethashcode contract says that two objects with the same tracked properties should generate the same hashcode not that two objects with equals hashcodes will be equals

9012381
equals	gethashcode
in your particular case it should also be noted that your gethashcode method doesn t even match your equals method because your gethashcode will return different hash codes for strings that are equals except for case while your equals will return true in that case

9012383
post	get
you should check both get and post

9012511
punctuation	words
tokens are usually words punctuation numbers etc

9012526
mouseover	mouseout
i would recommend mouseover mouseout

9012535
hide	show
when the select changes hide all the div show the right one

9012614
hide	show
i was reading about an example on microsoft web site on how to show or hide a â œregisterâ link for an object depend on whether the current user is already registered or not

9012615
junit	jmockit	maven	pom.xml
if you are using maven add junit as a dependency listed after jmockit in the pom.xml

9012641
int	chars
i can assign chars to int as follows

9012648
width	margin
then you can remove the margin 0 auto because it s useless with a width of 100

9012667
typedef	struct
i have few questions connected with struct and typedef there is piece of code and i have marked some places where i m not sure if the syntax is correct

9012667
free	malloc
place4 place5 i may should handle errors there cause there is malloc so i should probably put all the line with place4 to if and if the malloc fails i should put at place 5 free player

9012671
google-chrome	firefox
2.0 now runs across mobile environments and desktop browsers including google-chrome firefox and internet explorer highly customizable and

9012675
for-loop	loops
changing loops variable in a for-loop is bad practice for the reasons described by greg

9012688
int	chars
not sure i can supply more for you other than the concept of casting from chars to int doesn t exist in the language specification

9012688
int	chars
if i treat a chars like an int indexing through it in memory at a low level wouldn t work

9012688
int	chars
a step of 4 bytes treating like int would actually step 2 indices in a chars

9012690
int	chars
the types int and chars are not compatible

9012692
nspersistentdocument	nsdocument
i built my application based on nsdocument - well actually nspersistentdocument as it gives access to core data services for storing my object graph

9012710
typedef	struct
you re creating a typedef called player_struct which is just an alias for struct player

9012714
int	chars
it is not equivalent to a loop that assigns the values of chars elements to int .

9012716
versioning	upgrade
that is actually an older versioning 1.4 and an upgrade to 1.7 would not work

9012718
typedef	struct
player_struct is a typedef for struct player

9012718
typedef	struct
you don t need struct because of the typedef - same as above

9012721
hide	show
i have two ul s that when the top li is clicked it show the others below and hide another opened in other ul s

9012721
put	get
i have put another a tag beside the main li s but now i cant get the show feature too work

9012726
int	chars
the chars to int promotion is a special provision for primitive types

9012726
int	chars
this works only if a is a reference type. even though chars can be assigned to int this rule doesn t apply because it doesn t apply to primitive types

9012743
punctuation	words
token can be words or punctuation

9012752
getter	setter
now this could be done using standard getter and setter such as vec2 xy and void xy vec2 val

9012752
getter	setter
transparent getter and setter

9012753
google-chrome	firefox
i have a css3 transition which is smooth as silk in google-chrome but choppy in the latest version of firefox

9012757
ubuntu	debian
i m running ubuntu 10.04 and i also tried installing it on a debian lenny vm

9012789
portrait	landscape
this automatically called the custom mpmovieplayerviewcontroller s shouldautorotatetoorientation method which was set to yes for both landscape and portrait

9012836
int	chars
that is when you assign a chars to an int it s sometimes called an implicit cast

9012837
filtering	grouping
i would then like to do a similar thing with filtering by tutor where in this case the shorthand would be but i d want this userprofile set to be filtering down to only include those where user_ grouping _name tutors

9012877
post	get
so i post this question hope to get some help

9012891
versioning	upgrade
a better option in the short term is to disable the warning until you re able to upgrade your php versioning

9012920
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
malloc calloc and realloc all return which can be assigned to any object pointer type without need for a cast 1

9012920
typedef	struct
also it s not clear what you re trying to accomplish with your typedef and struct definitions

9012920
typedef	struct
you re creating a typedef name value which is a synonym for an as-yet-undefined type struct value_t

9012920
typedef	struct
this value type is different from the struct value type you create later typedef names and struct tags live in different namespaces

9012935
hide	show
you can have a message container inside form and show that when you want and hide result all content and vice versa

9012937
instances	transient
i m trying to save an object with multiple hasmany relationships and i m getting the exception object references an unsaved transient instances - save the transient instances before flushing

9013034
awt	swing
i figured out how to do this in swing with the doclick method but this doesn t seem to work in awt

9013042
entity-relationship	diagram
i need to create a simple questionnaire entity-relationship diagram

9013042
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
and also each answer can be y n checkbox or dropdownlistfor

9013082
button	checkbox
instead of using a dropdown menu or checkbox i would like to display the data on button similar to quirky.com s application form- specifically the choose a category field

9013085
pull	push
then i did a pull which as far as i know is a fetch followed by a merge then a push and it worked kinda

9013120
mouseover	mouseout
or do i use mouseout and mouseover events instead of just hover

9013144
fast-forward	merge
pull will do a git fetch and then a git merge which may or may not result in an actual merge git will do a fast-forward by default if at all possible

9013152
fast-forward	merge
pushing is only possible if the pushed branch can be merge on the pushed onto branch using a fast-forward merge meaning that the current head of the remote branch must be part of your local branches history

9013152
pull	push
so if you work on a branch alone and only from one location you can typically get away with simply commiting and pushing otherwise you might need to use git fetch followed by git merge or simply git pull to get the most recent version of the remote branch into your own before you can push it

9013162
hide	show
the only setting i can find that affects the navigation bar is to hide show located in tools options text editor your language general at the bottom under the display heading navigation bar check box

9013184
freetype	libpng
the freetype libs python-gtk python-tk libpng

9013192
jcomponent	bufferedimage
instead draw to a bufferedimage and have the jpanel or jcomponent draw the bufferedimage in its paintcomponent override or add your image data to a collection of some sort and have the paintcomponent override method iterate through the collection using the information to draw your images

9013192
japplet	jcomponent
don t draw directly in a top level window such as a jframe or japplet but instead in a component that derives from jcomponent often either jcomponent itself or jpanel

9013203
pull	push
and you found the solution you had to pull fetch and merge the upstream change into your branch from the bitbucket repo before git would allow you to push your changes

9013243
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it use native methods for firefox google-chrome opera ie9 and not-native for ie 8

9013274
google-chrome	firefox
it seems to be working okay in ie7 not in google-chrome firefox

9013291
subtract	add
you can add or subtract 1 from the cell s textlabel

9013291
subtraction	addition
so the addition works but the subtraction does not

9013301
public	protected
how can i make it protected public

9013351
google-chrome	firefox
tested in ie9 firefox and google-chrome

9013365
httprequest	httpresponse
from django.http import httpresponse httprequest httpresponseredirect

9013372
profiling	instrumentation
try using the time profiling or the system trace instrumentation to figure out what s blocking something certainly is

9013425
webkit	gecko
a web-rendering framework like gecko or webkit might be appropriate

9013427
kde	gnome
i saw that svn now offers an alternative for gnome and kde users where the password is stored in a keyring but many of our unix users don t use either desktop environment

9013427
kde	gnome
in mac gnome and kde it uses a keyring to encrypt and store them

9013427
kde	gnome
as we don t use gnome or kde this makes management very uncomfortable

9013446
post	get
i have been searching and found that drupal v7 has this feature coupled with its services module i tried and load drupal post into flash using amfserver another module but i was unable to parse or get meaning from the loaded data

9013507
post	get
the db is just a file you need to get the path to it and then post it to app engine

9013522
children	parent
when i kill the parent the children die and once they are dead then the parent dies

9013531
post	get
im trying to get a count of all post that related to the postid joinded by parentid in a join but im getting an error so when i do a group by of all the fields i still get the error - error is below

9013545
post	put
the author of the post seems to put great importance on ui-bindings and composed view

9013594
post	put
you are doing an http post but you are not providing an object to put post ed

9013615
pull	push
one of the ways to get two git servers to talk to each other is to add one repository as a remote to the other and then push to and pull from the remote remote is git terminology

9013621
folder	directory
zendlibrary is a folder in the same directory where my script is

9013632
sorting	grouping
i can kind of achieve this by sorting by priority but if i do this i lose the sorted by path as well which means that tasks that are grouping in the same file and package are not really grouping anymore

9013646
set	bag
3 if you don t know how to set up a server that can serve an xml document and accept posted xml content that s a whoooole other bag of worms

9013652
onclick	onchange
also on the client side you need to use the onchange or the onclick to get the results you looking for

9013671
xlib	xcb
xlib rest in peace since then pushing new api design towards xcb

9013673
children	parent
then when any of the children invoke a scroll command find all of the draggable parent of that element and set a scrolled data element on that element

9013691
width	height
the following example adds a maxwidth property to the image control but you can modify it to set max width height to be proportional to the screen resolution

9013702
pop-up	dialog
which is higher than the z index of the pop-up dialog inside which the datepicker button is placed but its not coming on top

9013734
children	parent
my understanding is that when a parent jframe is minimized then its children also are minimized but in the following dirt-simple example it doesn t happen the child dialog stays visible when the jframe is minimized

9013747
post	get
looking at the server log it seems it receives a get request instead of a post even though i m using the rkrequestmethodpost option

9013779
solaris	bsd
posix is not a linux standard but linux follows it as does osx bsd hpux solaris and even some real time operating systems like qnx just to name a few

9013800
equals	gethashcode
according to the example on the ienumerable.distinct page you will need to implement gethashcode so that the equals objects return the same hashcode

9013807
super	extends
to achieve extends correctly doctrine enforces you to use a concept from jpa called mapped super classes

9013813
post	get
i ve changed the php post action to get obtaining amazing results

9013814
scheme	racket
however i could not get the code to run in either racket scheme or sbcl

9013830
put	get
fast forward through a vacation and now i can t get them to run at all even the most basic rake file that only contains a put

9013856
width	height
if i select a custom resolution and enter any height an width i just get the screen and no buttons in the emulator

9013877
gif	png	gif	bmp	tiff	bmp	tiff	png	bmp	png
from looking at the leptonica library it looks like the common supported formats are gif jpeg tiff bmp and png

9013877
gif	png
jpeg will be lossy and gif and png will both result in additional work by the cpu there will be an additional encode decode cycle when we convert from pix to uiimage

9013893
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
also i found it strange that strcmp is case-sensitive but order by is case-insensitive

9013895
int	chars
transform the chars to an int minus the int of a chars of a a

9013901
post	get
i m aware that i can hit the graph api again with the objectid and get all of the images for that post but i d prefer not to hit the api multiple times

9013933
post	get
im trying to get a count of all post that related to the postid joinded by parentid in a join but im getting an error so when i do a group by of all the fields i still get the error - error is below

9013962
free	malloc
to fix it you ll have to use malloc and free

9013978
express	node.js
it can be a simple static .html file or a file returned from node.js express view or similar

9014011
calloc	malloc
you could allocate the array yourself using malloc or calloc

9014069
metaphone	soundex
general consensus including the php docs is that metaphone is much more accurate than soundex when dealing with the english language

9014101
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i ve checked in ie firefox safari google-chrome and opera on osx and win - the result is the same in all of them

9014185
google-chrome	safari
but it works fine in all browsers except google-chrome and safari

9014231
lisp	scheme
software examples are given in a scheme like dialect of common lisp

9014272
youtube	vimeo
i ve seen this done with sites like youtube but i need something to pull in more sites like vimeo blog video sites like tumblr and so on

9014364
switching	screens
i m trying to switching views in an iphone application but whenever i click on the button to bring up the second view all i get is a blank screens even though i ve filled the view with buttons and whatnot

9014375
width	height
if you want a component scale you must give its scale direction a weight and any sizes width height you set for that direction will be ignored by the layout manager

9014428
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
after experimenting a bit i found a solution that works on safari and google-chrome but doesn t work in firefox

9014428
margin	height
after doing so the image was still affecting the height of the li so i just added an id to the affected li and overwrote the margin-bottom so the sum of its height + bottom margin would equal the sum from the li without the 32px image

9014455
getter	setter
when you define a property xcode synthesizes setter and getter - that is it automatically creates the - type variable and setvariable type methods on the class using the strategies provided retain meaning the class will retain it - as opposed to assign where the class doesn t hang onto it and nonatomic means that it will update it in place instead of copying the new value to another part of memory and updating the reference only after it is done

9014475
post	get
i have read numerous post that show how to calculate an estimated frame no based on the fps and frame timestamp however i am not able to get either of those

9014480
put	get	queue	fifo
if all operations have the same priority which is not changed after the operation is added to a queue and all operations are always - isready yes by the time they get put in the operation queue then a serial nsoperationqueue is fifo

9014526
pop-up	dialog
i have an app that has a few spinners and a couple of buttons that pop-up dialog

9014526
pop-up	dialog
however when a new activity is started and then we return all pop-up elements stop working properly - the screen dims but no dialog appears

9014566
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome get it right

9014580
implements	extends
but i can extends my library with different parts that are easy to implements

9014587
opengl-es	glkview
i m having trouble with getting textures to work the ios 5 way using glkview but with the old fashioned opengl-es 1.1

9014592
gif	png	gif	ico	png	ico
allows users to convert multiple ico files to png gif or jpg files in one step

9014593
websphere	ibm
is there anyway to access offline to the latest version of eclipse documentation info center help center just like ibm provides the offline access its product documentation such as websphere application server info center

9014599
accessor	properties
the properties directive is just a promise that accessor for the screenwidth properties will be provided

9014617
rtp	rtsp
a while ago we recognized the need to standardize and currently are almost at a point of ripping out all that dcom baggage and replacing it with a fully compliant rtp rtsp client server framework

9014617
rtp	rtsp
one thing we noticed during testing over the last few months is that when we switch the client to use rtp rtsp there s a noticeable increase in start-up latency

9014617
rtp	rtsp
however my team fully controls our entire rtp rtsp stack and i ve been thinking we could introduce a new rtsp command without touching any of existing commands so we are still fully inter-operable as a solution describe_setup_play

9014635
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox has a great add-on called firebug and google-chrome safari both have built in debuggers

9014663
switching	screens
the user can switching between the screens and each time a screens is visited or re-visited numerical arrays for both x and y data are requested from the server

9014666
client-side	server-side
geocoding strategies to make the right decision as to whether you need to use php server-side or javascript client-side

9014672
mouse	keyboard
applications where control of the mouse and keyboard is needed

9014676
google-chrome	firefox
then i found that my phpmyadmin was not working in google-chrome and was working in firefox

9014686
freebsd	linux
on freebsd and linux

9014697
uiview	calayer
the other option is just setting the uiview to have rounded corners using the calayer property

9014706
hide	show
that will hide the first one and show the second

9014741
ssl	https
you setup ssl for wcf web api just like you would any other wcf service exposed over https

9014784
octree	quadtree
i ve used this type of approach a number of times with quadtree octree and i can t at this stage see why a similar approach wouldn t work with kd-trees etc

9014789
hide	show
hide the div and show it or set the width to 0 and then animate it to maximum with a specific duration

9014819
getter	setter
you could tween a getter setter that applies the logic

9014819
getter	setter
you can see a smaller-scale example in the code i attached in the above url the scrollx getter setter in itembase.as

9014822
pull	push
push this branch and open a new pull request from it

9014822
pull	push
once this is finished you push this branch open a pull request from it

9014827
addition	multiplication
2+5 7 this evaluates to 2+ 5 7 or 37 because multiplication has precedence over addition

superclass	subclassing
so direct access from a superclass to a constant in a subclassing is not possible at all and that is a good thing

hide	show
where the showspinner and hidespinner functions will show and hide the ajax progress image respectively

9014901
hide	show
you just show the image before you make the call and hide it in the callback function for the ajax request

9014901
hide	show
you can also use global ajax events in jquery to always show a loading image when an ajax request is sent and hide it when the request is done

9014915
try-catch	exception-handling
the repository throws various exception-handling depending on how the checks i carry out go so the action contains a try-catch statement

9014949
put	get
now i don t know where to put this up and how to get it working

9014980
int	boolean	int	chars
in c obj-c the boolean and chars types are treated as int types which is not the case in call languages

9014980
int	boolean
are defined to return the int yes none of the boolean not even _bool value 0 if the relation is false and the int value 1 if the relation is true

9014980
int	boolean
it may be surprising but the whole statement is evaluated without any use of boolean at all - it is all done with int

9014980
int	boolean
- which also doesn t use any boolean is defined in terms of int

9015002
post	get
access to get and post primitives but often wrap them with enough syntactic sugar

9015089
ubuntu	linux
i am using linux ubuntu

9015094
nhibernate	massive
there are great tools out there which can effortlessly move data between a set of pocos and the database nhibernate ef simple data massive dapper etc so in that retrospectiv i would say that you would probably end up with a set of entities in most solutions today the real difference being whether this is just a database model or a real domain model

9015135
typedef	struct
the typedef eliminates the typing of struct when you use it but not when you define it there is no way to eliminate that

9015135
typedef	struct
with a typedef then declaring an instance of the struct becomes

9015135
typedef	struct
now that doesn t completely explain the _structa structa business in the defining of the struct typedef as you can do this

9015135
typedef	struct
â here we take an anonymous struct and immediately feed it to typedef

9015143
background-image	background-position
it s called a css sprite and is basically an element that uses background-image and background-position to reuse a single image to show many different smaller images

i have installed version 6 myself as i had some maven problems m2e with java 7

9015223
oncreate	setcontentview
just use below code in your activity s oncreate after setcontentview

9015244
typedef	struct
note that i used the same identifier for the struct tag and for the typedef

9015244
typedef	struct
on the other hand my own preference is to omit the typedef altogether and just refer to the type as struct structa

9015244
typedef	struct
to summarize the typedef is necessary only if you want to have a one-word name for the type which isn t really required -- and if you do use a typedef there s no real reason to use different identifiers for the typedef and the struct tag

9015263
uilabel	uitextview
99.9 of the time you ll be using subviews like uilabel uitextview uiimageviews etc. etc

9015306
g++	gcc
for more information about the options of gcc and g++ see

9015326
post	get
if jconole and the default thread information isn t enough waiting stack traces etc you can get your threads to post updates to their state as they go along

9015340
put	get
then the sign gets replaced no problem if i take away the and leave any other character in there they also all get replaced as soon as i put that in there the whole thing dont work

9015353
nullreferenceexception	objectdisposedexception
an objectdisposedexception will be more informative than a random nullreferenceexception but unless you re cleaning up unmanaged resources it s not usually necessary to set a bunch of fields to null

9015382
factors	matrix
for each eigenvector the corresponding eigenvalue is the factors by which the eigenvector is scaled when multiplied by the matrix

9015383
factors	matrix
the eigenvalue is the factors by which the eigenvector is scaled when multiplied by the matrix

9015403
min	max
i just re-read your question and realized you want to keep min and max boxes

9015420
memcached	ncache
you will need to use a distributed cache like velocity ncache memcached

9015424
scheme	racket
from what i understand racket is a rebranding of some scheme derivative

9015447
min	max
how do i get the axis labels to start from the axis min value 20.1.2012 and the last label to be at the max value 20.2.2012

9015458
folder	directory
the application would creating folder and some files on active directory domain s shared folder

9015477

portrait	landscape
open a pdf with some page in landscape and in portrait

9015514
libpcap	wireshark
i want to parse packets captured by wireshark offline using libpcap

9015533
spaces	delimiter
i have a file like this which is spaces delimiter

9015540
google-chrome	firefox
use www debuger inspect element in google-chrome or inspect element in firebug in firefox

9015552
post	get
it has the same semantics as 307 but the ua might rewrite a post request to get

9015562
division	modulo
i would recommend storing the time as integers and regulate it through the division and modulo operators once that is done convert the integers into the string format you require

9015567
rss	feed
i m parsing an rss feed with jgfeed

9015577

even if i create a blank directory folder in the what it s trying to tidy the url to it then works for that page obviously isn t a fix

9015707
cvs	svn
you should use a scm system like cvs svn git or something else

9015707
ant	maven
build with ant or maven but this will be much more expensive solution

9015761
getter	setter
since you cannot override any public getter or setter you can t detect when anyone using your class is writing to these variables

9015761
getter	setter
then change your getter and setter for x y from super. x y to mypointinstance. x y

9015801
objectoutputstream	printwriter
the three methods you mention printwriter objectoutputstream and httpconnection will all result in something being sent to the server but what is actually sent will differ greatly between the various methods

9015815
decimal	ieee
if you re doing financial math you may or may not be better off using a library that does decimal math rather than ieee floating point something akin to java s bigdecimal class or c# s decimal type

9015817
stdout	stderr
i m experiencing some odd behavior when attempting to pinvoke setstdhandle to redirect stdout stderr from an unmanaged dll

9015817
stdout	stderr
where fxnfromunmanageddll outputs to stdout stderr via fprintf the output gets redirected to file only when the project is built as debug. if it s built as release the output goes straight to the visual studio output panel

9015824
width	height
the problem with preview and i assume also pdfkit behind it is that when you set the rotation to 90 it does not simply set the rotate attribute to 90 but it switches the page width and height and applies a transformation on the page content stream so that the page content appears rotated

9015839
g++	gcc
you really should compile with gcc -wall for c code or g++ -wall for c++ code and then you get warnings

9015857
tabcontrol	tabitem
the screen has a tabcontrol so many controls are hidden now-showing until you open that tabitem

9015895
folder	directory
the most common thing is to read properties files from the classpath or from the working directory in the first case you should create the file in the root of the source folder

9015895
jar	war
in the second case you can create the file directly in the project node but in this case the file won t be added to the final jar war if you want to distribute your program

9015911
width	height
in order to always get this size i first resize them to fit the max width or height depending on image orientation and then crop in the center

it is worth noting that i have google-chrome canary installed as well as the latest version of safari to test the grid on webkit

9015948
jstl	taglib
taken from looking for jstl taglib calculate seconds between two dates

9015987
xslt	xquery
setting the xhtml namespace as the default namespace might be useful though sadly in xquery this also makes it the default namespace for the output - xslt does this better

9016018
mvp	presenter
from view perspectives mvp describes relation between model-view-presenter but any view could have child views with own presenter and bound model

9016029
google-chrome	firefox
somehow my fb like widget looks bad in ie8 but ok in firefox and google-chrome

9016043

9016090
zoo	xts
make the data zoo or xts class

9016121
width	height
w is the width of the xbm bitmap h is the height data is an array of unsigned char s containing the colors of every pixel

9016140
width	height
you need to set the paper size in report properties to custom and specify width and height explicitly according to your layout

9016396
oncreate	setcontentview
the trick is to add the setcontentview in the onbuildheaders section but not in the oncreate

9016439
dlsym	dlopen
instead you should look at the source code of dlopen and dlsym functions found in libc

9016465
pull	push
it seems that i can pull from or push to a branch on a remote repository from to the branch that i am working on

9016486
youtube	vimeo
i want to display a textarea zone with embed code for my visitors to share the content on their blogs or sites like youtube or vimeo etc...

9016580
jtextfield	jlabel
i made a small application to open a file and show the contents of opened file in some jtextfield and jlabel

9016614
sorting	grouping
sorting via the grouping properties window will override the tablix sort order for sorting grouping but will retain the tablix sort order within grouping

9016614
sorting	grouping
sorting via the details properties window will override the tablix sort order for sorting within grouping

9016677
children	parent
and if a child is active then the parent should be active too and automaticly show the children

9016677
children	parent
i can only get the standard links to do so and if you click a parent who s not active the parent who is active should slide up the children and become deactivated

9016734
portrait	landscape
the first two are in portrait orientation and the last two are in landscape

9016750
superclass	subclassing
in a class hierarchy when a function method in a subclassing has the same name and type signature as a method in its superclass then the method in the subclassing is said to override the method in the superclass

9016801
int	chars
when that result is stored back into variable it s converted from int to chars

9016801
int	chars
another rather obscure possibility is that chars and int could be the same size which can happen only if chars is at least 16 bits

9016829
multiplying	modulo
we divide degrees by 360 and multiplying by 40 to get the correct image given a specified degree we then use the modulo to keep the image_direction in the range 0-39 for degrees +360 or -360 and finally if the degree was a negative one image_direction will turn out to be negative therefore adding 40 to it will correct the image_direction

9016829
subtract	add
edit oh sorry i seemed to have missed the part about a degree of 90 image index of 0 easy enough to add in here just subtract 90 from the actual degree code edited above

9016868
textmate	sublimetext
i ve added textmate to the tags as sublimetext is compatible with text mate plugins

9016957
folder	directory
this should probably be in a directory under the application root or in some temp folder

9016961
superclass	subclassing
the aggregateservice is intended to be what isolates your subclassing from changes in the superclass and enable changes in the superclass without breaking subclassing

9016961
superclass	subclassing
if you go for option 1 you couple the subclassing to your superclass thus loosing the intended isolation

9016961
superclass	subclassing
taking an explicit dependency on iservicea in the subclassing that class can live on happily ignorant about changes going on in the superclass internals

9017023
post	put
the solution is too big to post code but i can put up shaders rendering code etc as needed

9017043
width	height
i ve tried specifiying the height and width in a css by class and id and also inline in my html

9017109
mtu	icmp
path mtu is supposed to be automatically discovered but if an intervening router is dropping all icmp traffic including needs fragmentation then you may see hanging connections

9017147
min	max
problem is i don t know the numbers beforehand so i don t know the max and min value

9017147
min	max
in other words the max and min numbers are different each time the user enters different values to the equations

9017147
min	max
a is the min value and b is the max value

9017147
min	max
one of the numbers a b c d e can be the max value and another can be min value

9017147
min	max
so basically i need to compare these numbers find which one is the max and which one is the min and add them to the aforementioned formula for normalization

9017204
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
neither text-align nor vertical-align seem to work in firefox 9 google-chrome 18 ie 9 or opera 11.61

9017244
put	get
the wsdl engine in wcf takes over the processing of get requests to the metadata address and therefore you cannot engineer a response to favicon.ico just tried to put a rest endpoint to do this side by side with the metadata and it doesn t get invoked

9017259
memcpy	malloc
implementing it using malloc + memcpy is a nice exercise

9017262

9017518
width	height
one can set html img pixel height and or pixel width but that is without respect to the window size

9017518
width	height
and one can set html img percent height and or percent width but that is with respect to the original image size not the window size

9017518
width	height
i ve seen suggestions to box the html img with a html div that sets height and or width limits but html img appears to blow out those limits

9017522
tolower	toupper
you could perhaps also benefit from toupper int c and tolower int c which are defined in the same file

9017529
width	height
note also that if you change the height when resizing an event will still fire even if the width is smaller than 300px but the reported width remains the same

9017544
google-chrome	firefox
using the min-width and percentage value for width make the layout frozen in firefox and google-chrome but it doesn t work in ie

a really good way of doing this is in an enterprise application is to utilise a dependency injection container which maintains the lifetime of instances singleton or transient and allows easy injection into constructors

9017760
google-chrome	firefox
note you can also test by viewing this post in google-chrome and firefox

uilabel	uibutton
also nslabels nsbuttons can hardly do anything compared with uilabel uibutton - no font setting no colour setting no customisation at all - they re basically useless

9018215
getter	setter
dynamic means that you will provide getter and setter implementation in your class that may be linked to no any i-var

9018225
getter	setter
this may be useful if for example the getter and setter methods are implemented by your superclass

9018268
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux

how can i get the width of the buttons to be the same size while maintaining a 4 3 width to height ratio

9021144
width	height
the width to height ratio constraint is so i don t end up with really tall and thin buttons which would look silly

9021144
width	height
if i could find a way to incrementally increase the width or height whichever is smaller of the button and then resize it so it re- wraps_content then this could work

9021177

postgresql	mysql
mongodb is fun to toy with and i ve built a few apps using it myself for that reason but it s almost never a better choice than postgresql mysql sql server etc

9021598
submit	submission
i need to be able to hit submit on the parent page and as well as submission the parents form fields but also the iframes form fields all to the same php script

9021608
for-loop	loops
one way i was thinking to solve this was to count the number of lines at the first iteration of loops and then check it at the end of each iteration against what it thinks the value should be and if it is more than it expects then go back to above the for-loop using a goto or some such but gotos don t work in logic expressions

9021624

9022435
lxml	beautifulsoup
if that s the case you should not use a regular expression but parse the html with lxml beautifulsoup or another html parser

9022440
put	get
the nearest you can get to that behaviour is to put as near as you can to the very start of the first stylesheet on your html page rather than applying directly to the style property of the element where it will have a very high specificity

9022480
post	get
first i ve run the following statement to get the right post code

9022494

i have some filters that the users can click to hide show the markers on the map

9022605
post	get
i will post in a new question if i don t get a response

9022613
pop-up	dialog
then your auth-cookie will expire and use js to pop-up the login dialog a few min before the auth cookie expired to avoid the gap where the user will land on login page if they click on a link if you care about that even

hash tables must allow for hash-collision even if two distinct key have the same hash value the table s implementation must have a strategy to insert and retrieve the key and value pairs unambiguously

9022835
cpython	pypy
if the slot is occupied cpython and even pypy compares the hash and the key by compare i mean comparison not the is comparison of the entry in the slot against the hash and key of the current entry to be inserted dictobject.c 337 344-345 respectively

9022851
gcov	lcov
the reason i need -a is when i use lcov it gives that option to gcov i can hack geninfo to ignore that option but i prefer not to since i ll eventually run lcov on a public system

9022887
equals	gethashcode
most hashtables require two bits of support from your storage objects - gethashcode and equals

9022887
equals	gethashcode
if two objects return the same gethashcode but their comparison with equals returns true they represent the same data and thus is not a collision just duplicate entries

9022887
equals	gethashcode
this is why in many oop languages like c# you have to overrride implement gethashcode and equals in your storage objects

9022887
equals	gethashcode
if you ever implement those methods such that two objects when compared with equals returns true but return different values from gethashcode then you have a bug

9022914
ant	maven
comparing maven with ivy ant is to compare a smartphone to telegraphy

9022914
ant	maven
in the past i wrote many ant scripts and with upcoming maven i began to hate ant

9022914
ant	maven
another advice should be mentioned ant offers the integration of maven

9022914
ant	maven
this integration is often used to test and play with maven in projects that are grown up with ant

9022914
ant	maven
instead stay with ant and its pain or migrate fully to maven

9022924
google-chrome	safari
i ve tested in google-chrome safari with no success

9022925
textview	listactivity
from the tutorials i have seen android either displays a listview using listactivity with separate xml which would not display the textview and the button or using activity with main.axml which would not let me populate the listview with something like this

9022927
google-chrome	firefox
currently only firefox and google-chrome fully support web sockets according to caniuse

9022968
mouseover	mouseenter
use mouseenter instead of mouseover

9022987
hide	show
this code essentially loops through the spans and sends it to a cycle function which will hide the current span and show the next one

9023004
hide	show
the purpose of the code is to eval the value of #rfq_need_report and show the #rfq_report_language if need_report is true or hide if false

9023020
put	get
so you can put it in the string directly and get an exact measurement like this

9023047
folder	directory
for cakephp you can just put the phpthumb folder in your webroot directory and use it just like normal

9023051
put	get
however it s not possible for me to get the contents of that storyboard and put them in the new generated storyboard

9023139
width	margin
then give it a width that s less than the width of your li and add margin auto to center it

9023182

try this and remember height and width are properties not methods

9023198
pop-up	dialog
these appear on a pop-up dialog using jquery

9023227
rubygems	rvm
if you have rvm installed this issue can start to occur once you update rubygems to 1.8.15

int	boolean
rather than representing the frame as an 2-dimensional array of boolean values represent it as a 1-dimensional array of int

9023304
easymock	powermockito
this one is probably a powermockito easymock 101 question which i cannot figure out why

the inherited value generally depends on the properties but it is most cases and in this case the computed value of the parent element

9023422
webclient	httpwebrequest
should i use httpwebrequest or webclient or rest sharp

9023424
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works correctly in firefox google-chrome and safari

9023439
lapply	strsplit
strsplit is already vectorized so there s no need to wrap it in lapply

9023456
quicksort	mergesort
for instance quicksort can outperform mergesort although mergesort is provably better than quicksort in the worst case

9023501
getter	setter
it is automatically getter and setter with synthesize

9023524
lapply	strsplit
i don t think your call to lapply is necessary as strsplit already works on vectors

9023530
puts	gets
this starts each of your commands in the background puts their process ids into an array tells bash to kill them all when your script gets a sigint signal ctrl + c and then wait s for all the processes to exit

9023551
avro	thrift
first off when it comes to drivers i wouldn t worry about things like thrift or avro since the underlying rpc mechanism is an implementation detail

9023556
updatepanel	ascx
each of the ascx controls have an updatepanel

9023564
width	height
however if i gave the a specific height and width then e.target.nodename returns div

9023567
lisp	scheme
recursion is a staple of lisp in general not just scheme

9023590
post	get
what i m doing is mildly insane but since get requests have very strict size limit solr uses post requests to solr select url to do what is semantically a get

9023590
post	get
and varnish now tries to handle that except it automatically converts a post to a get

9023614
accessor	properties
just declaring a properties and synthesising the accessor doesn t automatically create you an object

9023660
cpython	pypy
edit cpython 2.7.1 and pypy 1.7 on mac os x and cpython 2.7.1 and cpython 2.52 .2 ubuntu appear to give the same results

9023679
width	height
and i also added a fixed width and height in my js script

9023686
hide	show
what i have done is assign two classes do the div information class show and class hide and at the beginning it apears with a class hide

9023686

you need a post request instead of get

9023738
post	get
this blog post explained my situation exactly and helped me get it working from start to finish

9023757
rss	feed
if you are parsing the same way without accounting for encoding differences it is possible that the contents of is not actually the same between these two rss feed

9023764
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and in firefox the alert is displayed indicating the javascript is working

9023764
google-chrome	firefox
all files are in the same folder and again i stress that this works in firefox and google-chrome

9023805
wordpress	joomla
i found wordpress joomla as probably the two most popular platforms

9023810
vim	emacs
vim emacs is not an option

9023834
hide	show
that says hide div.information when it s immediately after an img but show div.information when it s immediately after a hovered img

9023845
nsfilemanager	writetofile	writetofile	nsdata
- cache your files in the cache folder using nsfilemanager and nsdata writetofile

9023872
inherited	properties
there are two ways to do this inotifypropertychanged interface on your viewmodel or make your view model inherited from dependencyobject and make the properties dependency properties

you should be using a while loops instead of a for-loop in this case as the for-loop will break if any of the filenames contain spaces or newlines

9023958
hide	show
i am having trouble with the animation queue when using the jquery ui slider to show hide and position elements on a timeline - my slider seems to be working well when you go slowly but as soon as you move the slider very fast the animation gets real messy - i was hoping someone could help by at least helping me with making it more smooth

9024046
quad	blender
whereas blender might and should be smart enough to handle quad your loader routine isn t

9024074
post	put
for the post and put method if there is no file to send and the name s of the parameter s are omitted then

9024079
youtube	vimeo
another answer is to use this gem which handles youtube and vimeo and could be expanded to more

9024112
linefeed	delimiter
the example in the answer explains step-by-step how you can process a file that has linefeed as the row delimiter and the example uses ã c-cedilla as the column delimiter

9024112
linefeed	delimiter
this is one way may not be the best way that you are looking for of processing a file with linefeed as row delimiter

9024113
hash	md5
also an md5 hash tag is a 32 character hash of something and thus your varchar need not be higher then varchar 32 though i always use 33 just in case lol

9024136
pop-up	dialog
i m aware of the various ways to detect a mobile browser but i m having trouble finding a way to pop-up a dialog for mobile users allowing them to confirm they want to view the regular page and not be switched to the mobile site even though they are on the non-mobile version of the site

9024179
google-chrome	firefox
i m using win xp and have noticed this on firefox google-chrome and ie

9024189

9024194
pull	push
none of us has a lot of experience setting up a central server for push pull

9024206
post	get
and by acting like a form button i mean that when clicking the link to do a or post in order to be able to capture it by get or post

9024224
mp3	ogg
attempting to transcode using ffmpeg to mp3 gives similar results as ogg except that the number of channels must reduced from 6 to 2

9024242
children	parent
also close them in the parent after you fork all of the children

9024245
post	get
on this particular case it will also use a get to request data from whatever.php and you should fine tune it to use both get post and serialize the forms data or not according to your needs

9024360
put	get
when i put in the request via a browser i get back my expected results

9024417
int	boolean
you re not writing in a turing complete language with smts no loops but you can work with int and real valued variables boolean logic functions basic arithmetic and arrays

9024428
touchesbegan	touchesended
as per above coding my concept is - using touchesbegan and touchesended am making rectangle here

9024454
pop-up	dialog
start your virtual device from avd and a little dialog will pop-up asking you if you would like to set a custom size for the device

9024459
google-chrome	firefox
the behavior in ie9 google-chrome and firefox is correct

9024502
getter	setter
however your imyinterface cannot be made either covariant or contravariant in t1 and t2 because it has both public getter and public setter accepting t1 and t2

9024504
udp	tcp
i believe that syslog-ng also supports tcp sockets for log redistrubution as well as udp

9024520
inherited	base-class
you have to recursively inherited from one base after another and everytime bring the base-class visit s into the scope of the derived class

rss	feed
when i go to a new page i need to change the advertised rss feed to the appropriate one for that page say #user has one feed and #comments has another

9024530
children	parent
you could clear the float by inserting an element after the floated elements that has a clear property applied to it because floated child elements cause the parent to have 0 height since they don t take the height of the floated children into consideration

9024550
background-repeat	background-size
i ve got a stretched background image in a td using the background-size and background-repeat css properties

9024627
uiview	subviews
with these methods you can exchange the subviews order to get one uiview appear over one other in their superview.

9024647
google-chrome	firefox
firefox says the connection to the server was reset while the page was loading. and google-chrome says the connection to staging.neopets.com was interrupted. it makes no difference whether there s any body after the header call

now sin theta dz sqrt dx 2+dy 2+dz 2 1 sqrt dx dz 2+ dy dz 2 1 sqrt 1 fx x y 2 1 fy x y 2

9024756
post	get
my guess is that your php script is expecting the parameter to be sent on the query string as a get request rather than as a post parameter

9024826
integer	unsigned
â 3.9.1 4 unsigned integers declared unsigned shall obey the laws of arithmetic modulo 2 n where n is the number of bits in the value representation of that particular size of integer

9024826
integer	unsigned
this implies that unsigned arithmetic does not overflow because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is reduced modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value that can be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type

9024892
put	get
i put some more javascript in to debug and literally get nothing

9024903
int	boolean
public boolean addperson string fname string lname string gender int age

9024952
int	boolean
as for variables each variable is a reference and will take up 8 bytes of memory even if it stores nothing int will generally only take up 4 bytes and boolean are even more optimized but these are special cases

9024960
oncreate	setcontentview
you may just move the call to setcontentview from oncreate to onresume given that you are not referencing views in oncreate

9024987
dbcontext	objectcontext
in ef 4.1 and up the objectcontext is wrapped by a class named dbcontext which provides navigational properties with which to get instances of related entities using strings

9025006
onclick	onchange
use the onclick handler instead of onchange - you re changing the checked state of the radio input not the value so there s not a change event happening

9025070
getter	setter
well actually you can through hacking with the getter setter but you generally shouldn t

9025075
post	get
i can authenticate by get and so iâ m trying to make a post request on the same connection to keep my authentication

9025324
requestfactory	gwt
we use it together with gwt requestfactory and the gwt editor framework

9025354

php runs server-side jquery runs client-side

9025766
x86	64bit
in x86 64bit i have the following instruction

9025779
width	height
however because the page uses web fonts and has images that have no explicit width or height attributes in the html the page length actually increases as these items finish loading

9025786
int	boolean
as far as you re dealing only with boolean which are in fact int it s possible however not recommended to cast the function to a pthread function type as a pointer is compatible with some int types

9025787
gmail	hotmail
this page applies to gmail but i had the same problem in other email clients including hotmail and godaddy email

9025827
g++	gcc
i use gcc sourcery g++ lite 4.5.2 for arm

9025840
webclient	httpwebrequest
using the httpwebrequest and httpwebresponse classes or the webclient class as per joey s answer you could capture the response stream as a byte array the image and write that to a file with the proper extension a .png file

9025883
oncreate	onstart
secondly if it is in this app put breakpoints in oncreate onstart and onresume

9025897
ceil	floor
you can use ceil and floor in a similar manner if you always want to round down or up

9025905
min	max
or like this for any order from max to the min listed in one array

fadein	fadeout
i have a page where i am cycling through a set of list elements using jquery fadeout fadein

9026023

i have parent div allcomments_4 and than inside it i have few child divs oneentry with their own children inside but i just need to find the last child of the parent node allcomments_4

9026097
touchesbegan	touchescancelled
for further testing i overrode the touchesbegan and touchescancelled methods and called their super implementations on my view containing the uiimageview

9026097
touchesbegan	touchescancelled
with the code above the touchescancelled is never called and the touchesbegan is always called

9026110
int	double
and looks like you you need to make some of your variables double instead of int

9026119
equals	gethashcode
keep in mind however that you need to implement a gethashcode method in this iequalitycomparer which should return the same values for objects that you consider equals

9026148
getter	setter
according to the javadoc of jsondeserialize you should use that annotation on the setter not the getter while jsonserialize should indeed be on the getter

9026165
sorting	filtering
we need to do some filtering and sorting on it

9026228
google-chrome	firefox
my code is working in google-chrome firefox and internet explorer but i do not understand the logic i turn off and turn on submit differently

9026231
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
forgot to mention one thing this should still work in safari google-chrome and firefox

9026304
inherited	properties
both have properties and classb inherited from classa

9026304
inherited	properties
meaning that all the properties that are exclusive to classb will be lost and only those inherited from classa will be serialized

9026331
typeerror	attributeerror
other errors from playing around include attributeerror list object has no attribute p typeerror new takes exactly 2 arguments 1 given valueerror need more than 0 values to unpack i replaced new s arguments with args something i don t understand very well

9026451

if you question is about an ordered map then you take a look to linkedhashmap if you care about insertion order or a treemap where you define a compareto method to have a sorting rule

9026459
debian	linux
there is an excellent in depth article on the wider topic running 32 bit compiled apps on 64 bit machines over at titled running 32-bit applications on 64-bit debian gnu linux

9026537
oncreate	setcontentview
you put content into activities by making their own files declaring them in manifest and putting in their oncreate the setcontentview r.layout.activitylayout

9026541
free	malloc
if you allocate it with malloc you must deallocate it with the free from the same c rtl

9026543
width	height
since the jquery .animate function can t be used in this matter it changes css i want it to change the actual attributes of the element i had to develop my own function that uses the internal stage.setsize width height function provided by the kineticjs api

9026550
free	malloc
so i recommend not to use marshal.allochglobal malloc marshal.freehglobal and free crosswise

9026550
free	malloc
one example where you will run into dire trouble is if you use a library that does some sort of fancy malloc free magic - you might even not know that

9026591
post	get
limit 20 -- is there an argument like the limit to just get their post instead of including post from fans

multiplying	subtract
for the next seed we got 59694 now there is a kind of a shortcut that you can also use once a full seed has been calculated or the shortcut itself could be used which is you take the last digit multiplying it by 2 and subtract the first digit doubling one digit is easily done in the head the important thing is to remember all the other digits and their order in the sequence this will at best though only produce pseudo - random numbers with some long repeat times the larger the list of numbers that you use but the initial list must be chosen with care like for instance don t pick all zeroes as you list or you will have an endless stream of zeroes and well some sets of digits will produce longer repeat cycles than others but maybe this should be done on paper provided you have a pencil or pen and a sheet of paper handy.

in a push based system where each filter pushes data downstream to a down stream filter you need some notion of timing the push requests such that you have data at the end of your chain of audio processing units when the sound card is ready for data

i would recommend not doing a pull push based system but an executor style architecture

9032267

9033162
voip	rtp
there are no standardised ports for rtp but some popular voip softswitches do use certain ranges by default

this means that a subclassing can declare a method with the same signature as a private method in one of its superclass and there is no requirement that the return type or throws clause of such a method bear any relationship to those of the private method in the superclass

9035122
webkit	blink	google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
ie since version 5.5 i think and webkit blink browsers google-chrome safari and opera version from the last couple of years for example support a selectionchange event on the document which does exactly what you want

9035122
mouse	keyboard	opera	firefox
firefox and pre-blink opera have no such event and all you can do is detect selection changes made via keyboard and mouse events which is unsatisfactory there is no way of detecting select all from context or edit menus for example or simply poll the selection object returned by window.getselection checking the selection s anchornode anchoroffset focusnode and focusoffset properties against their previous values should be sufficient

when getting attributes from dom elements jquery converts them to functions if they are dom events like onclick onkeyup etc. but not if they are custom events example

9035861
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
convert is also the name of a windows executable which converts fat filesystems to ntfs

9035862
slideup	slidedown
you should place the delay and the slideup into the callback of the initial slidedown function

width	height
in my case i ve sent a bitmapdata and the width and height of the object

9035889
margin	height
if your wrapper is not aligned to the top of the window -- ie it has a top margin or top padding -- it will still be resized to 100 of the window height but will push past the bottom of the page

9035893
content-length	content-type
the client sends the request multipart form-data encoded so the content-length header includes the size of the boundarys and content-type declarations

post	get
besides whilst it s not written in stone it s generally considered to use get for actions that don t cause changes and actions that do cause changes should be restricted to post

9035981
put	get
the other option is to put the get part of the request in the form action

9035981
post	get
personally i d say your best bet is to just try avoiding mixed submission types altogether and just try to stick to get or post

9035999
margin	height
just put top and bottom margin to your middle section add a wrapper with position relative and top section and bottom section inside the wrapper with position absolute and with height equals your margin

9036008
google-chrome	firefox
playn provides a function called log where i can choose different levels of output but none of them seems to print something out in my ie firefox or google-chrome

9036014
margin	height
if the top and bottom s are a static height then you can set the middle to position 0 0 with height 100 and a margin at the top to match the height of the top and a margin at the bottom to match the height of the bottom

9036026
oncreate	ondestroy
if the bitmap is small enough you can consider oncreate ondestroy as well

9036588
width	height
number 2 width 50 height 50

9036643
memcached	ncache
ncache expresse would work fine too there is no mistery on it but i recommend going with memcached because ncache express has the 2 servers limit so if you ever need to add an aditional node you ll have to change anyway

9036984
jsr168	jsr286
so as long as your jsr168 portlet doesn t depend on the value returned by getprotocol you re safe ie every jsr168 portlet is a jsr286 portlet

9036984
jsr168	jsr286
the posts you see seem to be logical as jsr286 is a newer spec and there are some features that make jsr268 portlet not a jsr168 portlet

9037011
dependencyobject	freezable
the cast to frameworkelement is not safe inheritancecontext is also of type dependencyobject the inheritancecontext usually is the object declaring the property in which the freezable is used if it is not a frameworkelement you might need to recurse

9037026
action-filter	onactionexecuting
originally i tried setting the content-type in an action-filter but the problem is onactionexecuting occurs after value providers are selected so setting the content-type there is too late

minimum	max
one way i thought of was to give each of the users an number ranging from 1 to the total number of players say 6 and then when a player makes a move set their number to the max number 6 and decrease everyone else s number by one so the one with the minimum number is the only one who can play

9038431

9038539
jar	war
however building with maven and flexmojos does fulfill all of your goals above we also use it for building our service layer so in a single mvn clean install we get a jar packed in a war packed in an ear with everything configured and a swf that part is really nice

9038542

9038863
post	get
instead of following the http request as get post cookies are being held on the client computer

9038874
width	height
you don t need to set height width for buttons they will be set relatively

9038874
width	height
anyway i checked your code ..your mistake that you always calculate knopafmeting based on width that is correct if height is equal or greater than width

9038881
slideup	slidedown
or alternatively you can use the slideup slidedown functions that do this already

9038890
put	get
to get to bind to a collection in your context class just put a property for it in a viewmodel class designed for your screen like

screens	mdpi	screens	hdpi	mdpi	hdpi
i ve got artwork for both mdpi and hdpi screens but i noticed that when i load the app up on the kindle it displays the mdpi artwork and stretches some of my artwork that i m filling parent with a little more than i want

9038987
mdpi	hdpi
i was wondering if there s any way on android to under certain circumstances like if i m on a kindle force it to load from the hdpi artwork instead of defaulting to mdpi

9038987
mdpi	hdpi
i do realize that i could just save my hdpi artwork in the mdpi folder with a slightly different name and do a check for every resource but that s a lot of overhead not to mention an increase in the size of my app which i d also like to avoid

9039033
width	height
specifically the height must be at least 120px and if the width is less than 100px then the aspect ratio must be no greater than 3.0

9039164
move	drag
now i should be able to swap the cards manually.like if i drag the card from position 8 and drop it in position 4 then card in postion 4 should move to position 5 card in postion 5 should move to position 6 card in postion 6 should move to position 7 card in postion 7 should move to position 8

9039164
move	drag
similarly if i drag the card from position 3 and dropped it in position 9 then card in position 3 should move to 9 card in postion 4 should move to position 3 card in postion 5 should move to position 4 card in postion 6 should move to position 5 card in postion 7 should move to position 6 card in postion 8 should move to position 7 and card in postion 9 should move to position 8

9040178
int	double
double is usually 64 bits 8 bytes whereas int is 32 bits 4 bytes

9040178
int	double
since you re passing an int in place of a double printf is trying to get 8 bytes off the stack instead of four and it s trying to interpret the bytes of a int as the bytes of a double

9040178
int	double
so not only are you getting 4 bytes of memory containing no one knows what but you re also interpreting that memory -- that s 4 bytes of int and 4 bytes of random stuff from nowhere -- as if it were a double

9041341
hex	binary
memory allocation in assembly we use hex but sometimes binary

9041341

you need to know how these regular numbers are represented and understood by the machine - hence all those conversion lessons like hex to binary binary to octal etc

9041357

if you use maven you can use plugins as jaxws-maven-plugin or maven-jaxb2-plugin for building ws artifacts at build compile time

9041552
ioexception	urlconnection
in short words you can spawn a parallel thread that .disconnect s the urlconnection after letting your second thread sleep for timeout milliseconds thus triggering an ioexception that ll get you out of the stalled read

9041563
ilist	iqueryable
this is one of several reasons why i am in the camp of don t expose iqueryable on repositories . while you re only exposing ilist using expression is going down the same slippery slope imho

9041629
dictionary	map
it turns out that you can easily convert a python dictionary to a map though by doing this

min	max
what i would like to do is after i add update delete a record s to the stop_times table the trips table will update the trip_start as the min arrival_time for a group of trip_ids and trip_end as the max arrival_time for a group of trip_ids

9041680
disk	ram
you can test this by creating a temporary ram disk and putting the file there

9041813
memcpy	memmove
memmove is like memcpy except the destination and source array can overlap

9041813
memcpy	memmove
so memcpy can be faster than memmove

9041813
memcpy	memmove
now it s usually better to use memcpy or memmove than to code your own function

9041863
opera	firefox
if you install a 3rd party browser firefox opera dolphin etc and when you click the ad if you are given a list of options that includes all of the browsers installed you could verify that it is using the intent that way

i ve even tried to add delay 800 right after hide but again the delay and fadein are affecting all new childs of

9042114

if i create a button outside the table i can change the size without a problem but as soon as it goes in a table the height stays fixed even though i can change the width

9042146
sat	np-complete
so suppose you wanted to show that 3-sat is np-complete then you can show a reduction from the sat problem

9042146
sat	np-complete
but we know that sat is np-complete hence 3sat must also be np-complete

9042153

labwindows	cvi
my experience with labwindows cvi is that its built-in libraries are more geared to instrumentation gpib analog and digital i o motion control and so forth and

9042399
labwindows	cvi
the development environment that comes with labwindows cvi is pretty decent -- they have a drag-and-drop gui building interface that makes it easy to position controls within windows and wire them up to your c code if that matters to you

9042415
spaces	delimiter
the odd part is that neither the spaces nor the semicolon function as a delimiter yet the colon works on the second time around

9042419
mouse	keyboard
draw on an offscreen buffer copy that into the cell using cellrenderer relay mouse keyboard events to the actual widget

9042439

if you pass in a stringio object rather than wave_output_filename you ll can get a string object that you can presumably use to construct a post request

9042446
spaces	delimiter
if you need groups of spaces to work as a single delimiter you can use something like

9042464

9042477
many-to-many	one-to-many
im confused whther this is a many-to-many relationship or a one-to-many

9042503
versioning	upgrade
if i find the new versioning the app will download and upgrade the app

9042520
getter	setter
and then define its getter setter or synthesize it in the .m file

9042520
getter	setter
if the property is not declared but a getter setter synthesize exists the compiler will let you use it from inside the class implementation from the point it was defined down the file

9042601
width	height
then you can set your imaveviews to have height wrap_content and width fill_parent

9042601

9042669
getter	setter
when synthesizing the property obj-c will include both the getter and setter if this happens

9042739
maven	pom.xml
i don t know the exact reason but it looks like properties-maven-plugin can substitute the property value properly defined under properties tag in pom.xml and maven can only recognize the properties name explicitly defined in pom.xml the following pom.xml works for me

9042739
maven	pom.xml
from my point of view the predefined build lifecycle of maven is quite exclusive especially when integrating with other build tools like adt the pom.xml version used for generating the apk is quite restricted moreover from the plugin documentation current version of android-maven-plugin does not provide any configuration for customizing the final apk name during apk goal

9042739
android-maven-plugin	zipalign
as a last shot android-maven-plugin provide options to customize the final apk name during zipalign goal

9042835
accessor	properties
this specifies that the accessor methods for firstname lastname and age should be synthesized and that the properties age is represented by the instance variable yearsold

9042844

int	double
the int types in java don t have representations of infinity not a number values etc - whereas ieee-754 floating point types such as float and double do

9044130
int	double
also bear in mind that the cases in which int or decimal floating point types are used typically don t need to concept of infinity or not a number results - whereas in scientific applications where float double are more typically useful infinity or at least a number which is too large to sensibly represent is still a potentially valid result

you perform trial division the modulo instead of crossing-off multiples as eratosthenes did over two thousand years ago

9045227
umask	chmod
how to do this will depend on how your application is written but something along the lines of chmod chowning ing the files after creation or creating them with a umask allowing myuser permissions

9045304

maybe nsapplication nswindow or nsview

9045306
free	malloc	free	strcpy	strcpy	malloc
so you may want to create a copy using malloc and strcpy and then free at some point

9045333
crypt	salt
crypt is a one-way function and returns a string that already contains the salt

9045333
crypt	salt
when comparing the user input with the crypt result the function automatically extracts the salt from the string

9045333
hash	salt	crypt	salt	crypt	hash
crypt outputs a string that contains both the salt and the result of the hash

9045333
hash	salt
when you pass it that string as a salt it knows to extract only the salt part and ignore the hash part

9045333
hash	salt
and it still returns a string containing both the salt and the hash

9045333
crypt	salt
when you pass this output as salt back to crypt it will extract the right algorithm and salt and use these for the operation

9045333
hash	salt
the hash part in the passed salt parameter is ignored

9045357
clang	llvm
i m not sure for llvm clang there are ones but i don t remember them right now but for gcc you should use the macro __gnuc__ which will be defined by the compiler itself without you having to worry about it

9045448
integer	unsigned
the bit pattern 0xffffffff happens to look like -1 when interpreted as a 32b signed integer and as 4294967295 when interpreted as a 32b unsigned integer

9045464
integer	unsigned
this can be also a caveat because when comparing signed and unsigned integer one of them will be implicitly casted to match the types

9045502
division	multiplication
i ve also taken the liberty to replace division by two with multiplication by 0.5f because the arm processors do not have a division instructions therefore the divisions are executed by software and rewritten as multiplication anyway

9045531
hash	salt	crypt	salt	crypt	hash
that accepts either nothing a salt or a hash that crypt made earlier which has the salt to make the hash embedded in it

9045531
hash	salt
in the latter case the salt is used and not the entire hash

9045585

ant	maven
also you can integrate the ant build into maven scripts so i ve found this to be a good and flexible solution for all purposes i ve come across so far

9045680

9045751
maven	pom.xml
apparently maven does not make any variable property substitution when installing the pom.xml

9045751
maven	pom.xml
you d better not read any properties from pom.xml unless this is version number bout you should configure your properties in external file one per stage dev.properties test.properties ... and then configure maven profiles again one per stage and invoke maven like mvn -pdev depending on what you want to build

9045751
maven-antrun-plugin	build-helper-maven-plugin

is it possible for me to get paypal post variables in return url

9046034
width	margin
i would suggest explicitly setting the widths of every object that usually fixes the problem under ie6 please remember that the outer width of the object is width + margin + padding so when you calculate the desired width take that into consideration

9046052
opera	google-chrome
i tested in opera 11 and google-chrome

9046064

when implementing http services in node.js there is a lot of sample code like below used to get the whole request entity data uploaded by the client for example a post with json data

9046074
pull	push
i can now pull push from this extension

9046086
width	margin
alternatively you can keep width 100 but then you ll need to remove the default margin on body

9046101
width	height
the problem is that you cannot simple use the width and height of the drawable to calculate the rectangle s position as it might get resized to fit the imageview

9046101
width	height
coordinates of the rectangle are from the upper left corner counter wise 0 0 width imageview 0 width imageview height imageview 0 height imageview

9046101
width	height
when the ratios don t match and let s say for example the drawable is wider than the imageview then the drawable will fill the complete width of the imageview but will not fill the height

9046101
width	height
so the coordinates of the rectangle are from the upper left corner counter wise 0 y width imageview y width imageview y + current height drawable 0 y + current height drawable

9046101
width	height
if the drawable is higher than the imageview then you can calculate it the same way but have to exchange the width and height values

9046116
width	height
i then compute a vector from anchor to target that points to one of the four corners it always does even when on an axis allowing me to expand shrink the width height of the view at the same time as moving or not its origin giving the effect that you can resize the top and left origin change required as well as the width height only origin left alone or a combination of both

9046116
width	height
in other words the vector is used to determine which corner i am pointing to and thus which quadrant the touch operates in thus allowing me to chose which of x y width or height to alter and the target current previous position tell me by how much

9046116

testing for the string android catches a bunch of tablet motorola xoom samsung galaxy tab asus transformer others from toshiba sony acer etc.

9046996
screens	tablet
arguably many tablet do just fine with normal non-mobile sites given their processing power and physical screens size so lumping them in with much smaller and less capable mobile phones does those users a disservice

accessor	properties
properties typically have a similar purpose to fields holding a value but they need to be defined using get and set accessor and can incorporate logic such as validation or properties change notification which fields canâ t

9047023
width	height
using frame buffer objects for rendering on ios which appears to be apples preferred way of rendering on ios according to the opengl es programming guide for ios from apple one is supposed to use glrenderbufferstorage for specifying properties like width and height according to opengl es 2.0 programming guide from munshi ginsburg and shreiner

9047023
width	height
apple then goes on writing to fetch width and height from the renderbuffer as that buffer sets them on creation without further detail

9047023
width	height
the width and height are 0 though

9047052

for some reason the vars were send using get instead of post any

9047138
post	get
that post as3 post request sending as a get may help if you are stumble upon this post like me

9047138
post	get
this should prevent flash runtime overwrite your post request with a get

9047148

if i understand correctly then it would be easier if you gave your image a transparency background and set the background container s background-color property without having to use filters and so on

9047174
vbo	normals
for such simple objects i would make one big vbo say 200 objects nrverticespercube put all the data interleaved vertex normals uv vertex normals uv etc

9047174
vbo	normals
this creates my vbo buffer with the correct size in this case 8 sizeof glfloat wich is 3 verts 3 normals and 2uv and copies the first keyframe to the buffer you could do the same with you initial object positions or just leave that and compute latter.

9047194
versioning	upgrade
you should upgrade to swank-clojure 1.4.0 and use the versioning of slime that is bundled with it

put	get
here is what i put to get it working

9047258
udp	tcp
tcp uses data streams and udp uses data blocks

9047258
udp	tcp
the problem is that tcp creates bigger packages of data while udp uses 8 kb of data blocks

9047315
udp	tcp
it may be that the kernel heuristics for servering tcp connections is more aggressive than for udp sockets since tcp connections require more state and more continuous processing than do udp sockets

you couldget the effect you want by removing the height and width bindings and leaving them as automatic

9047505
firefox	safari
the code runs just fine in the latest firefox ie9 and safari though no sound at all on ios4 iphone ipad but apparently that s a commercial decision by apple

we ve tried both ogg and mp3 file formats and everything works in ie9 mp3 and firefox ogg without issue

9047510
try-catch	exception-handling

9047918
post	get
this will hit up your checkemail.php script with a post ensuring correct refreshed return data each time unlike get the moment that someone has clicked or tabbed away from the field and javascript sees that the content has changed so it only triggers once each time the content is different during the forms lifespan

9048095
min	max
i am trying generate a random number that is within an annulus we have a max and min radius

9048097
for-loop	loops
i say it is potential because the for-loop has already buffered the queue so it doesn t care - unless you abort loops because new work has been appended to the late.txt file - then you actually will skip those missing ids

9048130
post	get
when i try to load any ordinary page page.php i get only content from two blog post and similar problems

9048147
hash	md5
for example you can store a hash code like md5 or sha1 of the password in a second cookie and then check if that hash corresponds to the user that the client pretends to be

9048163
hash	salt
bcrypt uses a modified encryption algorithm along with a salt which makes it expensive to calculate a single hash by using something called a work factor

9048175
int	boolean
try spinner#setselection int position boolean animate with animate false

9048189
width	height
i can reduce the width of the selected item but i haven t found a way to reduce the height

9048235

setting just x and y without width and height gives a rect with undefined size due to stack trash because the rect is not zeroed by a default constructor afaik

9048239
charindex	substr
select substr address_col 1 charindex address_col -1 as address_col

9048239
charindex	substr

i have a simple layout that contains a textview between two imageview

9048349
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox are forgiving and are much easier to develop for but they also help you out

google-chrome	safari
edit i should point out that the code works fine on google-chrome and safari

9048519
stdout	stderr
the problem is that the process you are trying to execute may depending on lot of things either first write to stdout or stderr

9048519
stdout	stderr
to handle this properly always you must create 2 threads to read stderr and stdout simulteneously

9048533
ssl	https
i m building an application that needs to open self-signed https ssl

9048533
keystore	jks
all you have to do is import the certificate in a keystore jks or pkcs12 and load it in your custom trustmanagers in your application

9048543
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
firefox allows a require directive but opera and google-chrome do not and local file security issues come into play with loading any local files

9048543
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
preferably for a userscript this would be a combination that works in opera firefox and google-chrome

9048594
pkcs#12	pfx	pem	pkcs#12
you need openssl the cygwin version works on windows to convert the pfx pkcs#12 file to a pem file then you can create a certificate from the pem

9048594
keystore	jks
finally you can use the java keytool program to convert the certificate to jks format the keystore default

9048594
keystore	jks
now you should be able to load the jks file with the keystore instance in your code

9048633
width	height
it s better to first cache the original file and then like explained by nick lockwood resize them remember retina displays need twice the width height for hi-res displaying

9048637
sorting	filtering
you will be still able to use local paging sorting and filtering searching of the data

9048638
alarmmanager	wakelock
i solved the problem by removing wakelock waste of battery doing a 10-second busy wait thread sleep just in case one blocks the gps invocation of onloc and using alarmmanager to wake the device from sleep and start the service

9048656
firefox	safari
the problem is that some browsers firefox safari on mac first time display menu incorrect like this

9048673
range	max
then assuming you name this named range ratio_data your function could be referring to max ratio_data in combination with index-match as suggested by tim mayes

9048691
width	height
give the frame a width and height

9048703
apache	lighttpd
it doesn t sound like suexec is in use so fastcgi will most likely run as the same user the web server is running as apache nobody daemon lighttpd etc

9048707

uicontrol which is the superclass of uibutton passes itself as the only parameter to its target using the action selector

9048850
folder	directory
when i open the project in eclipse make any changes and save the project eclipse automatically copies the .svn folder from my java directory to my classes folder

9048856
int	chars
the result of the conversion of the negative signed chars value -1 will be a huge unsigned int value equal to uint_max

9048856
int	chars
y is of signed chars type so it is first promoted to int after int promotions and x is of unsigned int type and stays an unsigned int

9048856
integer	unsigned
usual arithmetic conversions suite c99 6.3.1.8p1 otherwise both operands are converted to the unsigned integer type corresponding to the type of the operand with signed integer type.

9048856
int	chars
unsigned int has the same conversion rank as the int type remember signed chars was promoted to int so the promoted y will be converted from int after promotion to unsigned int

9048856
integer	unsigned
integer conversions c99 6.3.1.3p2 otherwise if the new type is unsigned the value is converted by repeatedly adding or subtracting one more than the maximum value that can be represented in the new type until the value is in the range of the new type.

9048863
int	chars
in this case signed chars y will have been converted into the unsigned int with value uint_max

9048891
put	get
when i use the sbt plugin gen-idea it seems to download all the necessary dependencies which get put into my .ivy directory as expected

9048895
django	web.py
i use django for web development and i don t about how web.py works but i think you can store it in session context or as a cookie if that variable is per-site-visitor based

9048917
ord	chr
you can replace the list comprehension with a map chr range ord a ord z +1 call but that s perhaps not what you re really asking

9048932
decimal	ieee
the ieee 754 standard requires that a binary - char - binary roundtrip recovers the original value if the character representation contains 36 significant decimal digits

9048970

9049008
ironruby	ironpython
the mono distribution from xamarin ships with c# vb.net f# ironpython ironruby and i think maybe boo out of the box

9049008

the other compilers are the same on both platforms as are other .net languages like nemerle boo and phalanger php

9049030
int	chars
number of bytes number of chars since the c standard reuires that chars be an 1-byte int

9049075
stdout	stderr
if you do plan to run your program directly from the shell like this be sure that any error messages are written to stderr instead of stdout

9049084

you can check if uploaded file has konwn image format extension jpg gif png etc and if so then save to your content gallery folder otherwise save to your content files folder

9049087
mouse	keyboard
i m making a little application that needs to know how long the user has been idle â as in not using a keyboard or a mouse

9049087
xlib	xcb
both xcb and xlib promise to give me idle time through their respective screensaver extensions

9049099
qgraphicsitem	qvector
i figure i can loop through each dimension create the qvector for the outer loop then cloning the qgraphicsitem on the inner loop unless it s possible to just simply clone the base qvector and inherently clone everything inside - currently everything inside are pointers

9049099
qgraphicsitem	qvector
each qgraphicsitem has get set functions to retrieve any properties i need so i could just create a new top level qvector outer loop to create a new qvector for each row then inner loop creating new qgraphicsitems and setting the properties of the original chart

9049107
getter	setter
i skipped the details of timeable base but it has a setter start_date val and a getter start_date and of course many more

9049139
getter	setter
so i have getter and setter methods in the facts model like this

9049150
mouse	keyboard
however contrary to most of the documentation it is mentioned here keyboard and mouse hooks work without a dll

9049191
codeigniter	cakephp

post	get
get will be after loading user edit form post would be after subbmiting it

9049225
svm	cross-validation
thus it only returns the cross-validation accuracy assuming you have a classification problem otherwise mean-squared error for regression as a scalar number instead of an actual svm model

9049225
svm	cross-validation
this shouldn t be hard to implement create a grid of values using meshgrid iterate overall all pairs c gamma training an svm model with say 5-fold cross-validation and choosing the values with the best cv-accuracy.

9049242
folder	directory
and in linker - general you set additional library directory to the output folder of navigator project if you haven t changed it s output directory it is .. debug for debug configuration and .. release and in linker - input you add

9049287
apache	nginx
yes you have to change in the apache settings or nginx settings or the server you are using this will redirect all the requests coming to your old website to your new website

9049297
centos	linux
i am on x86_x64 intel xeon cpu running a centos linux distro kernel

9049298
free	malloc
note that if you use malloc instead of and worry to free the previous array and to initialize teeest it will be correct

9049381
hide	show
the problem is slidedown doesn t animate it s current behaviour is analogous to me calling hide and show it simply appears

9049405
post	get
i have found post explaining how to send an image and how to receive files in mvc but i can t seem to get the two to tie together

9049415
put	get
however one way to get around this would be to put a pass-through property on myusercontrol that just relays its information to the nested controls

9049460
jobs	cron
i m familiar with creating cron jobs in linux

9049512
komodo	aptana
i ve been using komodo edit for the last few years but am once again thinking of switching to aptana because of it s built in refactoring tools for python

9049524
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome both have no issues

9049573
next	except
i tried the most obvious thing which is to prefix it with spaces which works except when the text wraps to the next line as shown below

9049579
octal	binary
this concept could be extended to the octal and binary numbering systems

9049582
mousemove	mousedown
now when you mousedown on either sliderrect sliderstartline or sliderendline i hook onto the mousemove event and use it to determine what to set the start time end time and duration variables else where in my javascript

9049582
google-chrome	safari
both of these issues only happen on google-chrome win7 and safari win7

9049608

yes you identify extract and quantify various aspects of human faces such as distance between pupils width of mouth percentage of head height where tip of nose is etc

9049646
post	get
is to make something like magento offers - basically a logic builder and as shown by this post on stackoverflow jquery or any web tool nested expression builder so far i have made jquery to build a tree and get the data that i want the builder to use check and set

9049670
width	height
the pixel width and height of your page will depend on orientation as well as the meta viewport tag if specified

9049674
for-loop	arrays
you d first have to extract each decimal place s value first either by converting it to a character arrays itoa or by writing a small for-loop that divides the number by powers of 10

9049707
floating-point	integer
when doing a floor although it would be possible to convert the argument to an integer this is not what most languages would do because the original type is a floating-point number

9049709
google-chrome	firefox
it works in ie firefox but not google-chrome

9049709
width	height
width and height fixes it to actually be the right size but they still are all just pasted on the same spot right under the bar rather than random spaces

9049712
hide	show
take into account than show hide operatoins are much faster than add delete

9049747
min	max
bound class contains min and max values

9049825
client-side	server-side
what i mean is that in order to have server-side validation the logic needs to be in the model in order for the input validation to behave and work according to proper mvc rules obviously optionally using client-side validation in conjunction

9049856
sin	math.h
you re looking for the source code of the functions declared in math.h here s one implementation of sin

9050082
accessor	properties
the only part of specification that seems to be relevant to virtual properties where one of the accessor is private is â 10.7.5

9050082
accessor	properties
a virtual properties declaration specifies that the accessor of the properties are virtual

9050082

9050675
trie	tree
there is also another data structure called a ternary search tree that is somewhere in-between a binary search tree and a trie that may be useful here if you d like to look into it

9050681
ready	each
the general idea is that you can create the driver once initialize it with the popup implementing editor then call edit on the driver each time you are ready to display it with a new model

9050681
implements	extends
i usually end up with something like assuming the class extends popup implements editor and has the driver defined internally

9050681
mvp	presenter
to flavor this answer with my own approach biases i like a mvp setup where the view and presenter are both interfaces and where the presenter impl doesn t know how the view will end up drawing

if you can run a virtualization environment on aix then a linux or opensolaris vm would be the best way to go

9050865
geany	gedit
if you re fine with moving to another text editor then i would strongly recommend geany which does the same thing as gedit but is more fully-featured and can allow for execution of code in the same application

9050906
scheme	racket
i ll give you the racket scheme one and whichever one is most helpful to you you can run with it

9050909
dictionary	map
you should be able to use the map just like you would a python dictionary

9050910
post	get
you want to perform an http get not a post in this cause

9050945
post	get
i understand that a post method should be used here according to rfc1866 section 8.2.3 but i want to implement a get method to this page because when a user is on page two they will select their options there and go to page three but when a user is on page three they may need to use the browser back button to go back to page two to change some values

9050945
put	get
page two the input names doesn t get picked up and put into the url like it would if i were to set the action to pagetwo.php this would turn into pagetwo.php

line breaks should not be an issue with dotdotdot but inserted images should have width and height atributes specified in html

9051011
pull	push
you can do this via a quick git pull or as you show in your example a git push to the tracked origin

9051011
pull	push
instead it only updates the remote-head reference in two cases a pull and a push to the default destination

9051066
for-loop	arrays
i put it in for readability to make it obvious that you are storing a reference to the object you were looking for then removing it then putting it in at the beginning of the arrays but given that the .splice method returns an arrays of the removed item s you can replace those three lines within the for-loop with this single line

9051108
free	malloc
if malloc fails you can free blocks from the pool and begin load shedding cache reduction or whatever other choices you have to reduce memory consumption

9051111

cause i dont need to use this code below as my gridview data is use the retrieve in sqldatasource in the design default.aspx

9051470
width	height
i guess you should either make webview fill_parent or match_parent or give width and height im not sure but guess it will not be very smart wraping to content as webview content is difficult to measure

9051474
width	height
its width and height will be calculated correctly

9051475
gridview	rowdatabound
you need to find control inside the gridview container in rowdatabound event

9051493
nunit	mstest
the project that is created is mstest or visual studio unit testing framework not nunit

9051500
portrait	landscape
the android api is designed to handle that automatically - you can have a directory called layout-land and layout-port with separate layouts for landscape and portrait respectively and the system will use whichever is the most appropriate

9051500
portrait	landscape
it s more about multiple screen sizes but it does cover landscape portrait as well

9051501
infobox	infowindow
i don t know customizing the functionality of infowindow but by using google infobox we can customize the look from that you can try the functionality

9051502
disk	ram
if that doesn t work right away then rabbitmq is down hard due to something like lack of ram ran out of disk space or a rogue system management tool deleted some of the rabbitmq binary components

9051518
gridview	rowdatabound
if this a row-by-row situation you will probably want to do this in the rowdatabound event on the gridview

9051529
ready	each
creating a class for each game state main menu ready screen playing state etc. would allow you to implement common keylistener boilerplate once in a superclass and game state specific listeners and logic

9051558
folder	directory
put public folder in root directory

9051573
searchview	autocompletetextview
and while i m asking a question up here if someone could clarify the difference between an autocompletetextview and a searchview w custom suggestions.

9051573
searchview	autocompletetextview
autocompletetextview seems suspiciously easy to implement compared to the searchview which requires changes to be made to the contentprovider sqlitedatabase helper class etc.

9051611

9052008
width	height
when i inspect the element it is not the right height or width

9052055
soundpool	playsound
to play a note you would simply call the playsound method of the soundpool with the relevant index

9052092
width	height
second you opened an image so fancybox set the type to image by default but then you are pretending to load a different type of content on the same box yahoo for instance which would require to set type to iframe and other options like width and height

9052097
post	get
in the implementation override the onlocationchanged and you can get the location lat long tuple and you could probably update the server with a get post request

9052112
integer	unsigned
this wrap-around behavior is guaranteed only for unsigned integer types

9052118
put	get
i am trying to do a simple time calculating program in asp.net where people enter amount and annual interest and payment per month need to get time in months when the debt is paid of along with interest and i want to test if the monthly payment amount is smaller than the monthly interest amount using if else condition but it doesn t seem to be working if i put monthly payment smaller than monthly interest amount then the program hangs

width	height
and how to determine the width height of the sprites in a sprite sheet

9052272
int	double
without the the compiler is going to assume that sqrt returns an int result rather than double

9052368
int	chars
here the password is stored as a table rather than a string where each element in the table consists of the int representation of each chars

9052368
sudo	passwd
a slightly more secure way of providing the passwd would be not to show the input as is done in sudo or to mask the input with dots or stars as is done in many web pages

9052378
put	get
you should try to let s say put a button or link and on the click event implement the call to get the xml

9052760
des	aes
aes will indeed yield a considerably faster result than des

9052822
width	height
since i m creating an activity there is no way to reference that how would i go around getting the screen width and height before the main class initialized within oncreateengine

9052823
width	height
if you want to make a vertical line you d simply use a width of 1 and then the height desired

9052825
mouseup	mousedown
on mousedown the mouseisdown var gets set to true and it starts a loop that continues to increment at whatever interval you set the time parameter to in settimeout until mouseisdown is false which happens on mouseup

9052930
pull	push
edit i could do something like adding a that added to a list of files to be synced and then adding a hook to hg push hg pull that would say run rsync or whichever sync tool in the background but i wondered if there was a less hacky solution i think bfiles bigfiles do something along these lines anyway

9052950
google-chrome	safari
next you can set a break on uncaught exception debug point in google-chrome or safari to stop at the actual error you are seeing

9052993
uiview	uiwindow
uiwindow is a subclass of uiview

9053075
superclass	subclassing
edit in other words we have a new instance of a problem already existing in java and any oop language the constructor of a superclass calls a method implemented in a subclassing but the latter cannot be safely called because the subclassing is not yet constructed

9053075
subclass	accessor
this code has the same runtime behavior as the code given by the op even if abstractelement.contents is now a def the body of the accessor reads a field which is initialized only by the subclass constructor

width	height
the content that gives me problems is placed in width and height specific divs

9053123
union	distinct
think about your using union and distinct keywords

9053123
union	distinct
rationale both union and distinct apply a unique sort operation on your intermediate result sets

9053123
union	distinct
that s one reason why omitting distinct and replacing union by union all is much faster

9053174
ssl	https
you will be sending username and password over the internet use https ssl to stop these going over in clear text

9053207
integer	unsigned
note that integer overflows only regard signed integer as unsigned integer never overflow

9053207
integer	unsigned
c99 6.2.5p9 a computation involving unsigned operands can never overflow because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is reduced modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value that can be represented by the resulting type.

9053267
width	margin
also anything floated needs a width and as to the double-margin bug it only occurs when you have margin on the same side as the side the element is floated.....so if you re declaring float right on something you don t want to have margin 0 20px 0 0 on the same thing.

9053294
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
as zmbq mentioned in his comment to marc s question the sortedlist is implemented as an array so if faster insertion removal times are needed then the sorteddictionary would be a better choice

9053301
uiview	subviews
if you want to do a subviews subclass uiview

9053343
integer	fractions
in this case you could have had fractions values in there and there would be no problems but some methods that were expecting the values to be integer might choke on non-integer values

9053823
versioning	upgrade
when i upgrade to the newest versioning which is currently 3.4.9 it worked just fine

9053836

if you want to filtering data from views you can use startkey and endkey parameters with possibly more complex json keys and or reduce grouping levels to achieve your desired results

9053959
gif	png
i m trying to convert my website book html+css to a single pdf for reading on amazon kindle but unfortunately kindle does not support transparent gif png images i have a lot of equations on my website that have transparent background

9054146
union	distinct
find all distinct id_product in both tables union together and display all that only show up once

9054168
folder	directory
this will move the png file to the directory as specfied ie the appicons artistid appid folder

9054176
allocator	stl
i believe it boils down to the behaviour of the stl allocator used since it is responsible for writing the initial zeros or not

9054230
folder	directory
in java i am trying to list the files and folder in my c directory and loop through them using

9054230
folder	directory
furthermore as you would suspect when you start to use a recursive method to look through every folder on the drive it throws a nullpointerexception as soon as it tries to list the files in that directory

9054233
gmail	hotmail
i am going to have a bunch of these modules 10+ for gmail hotmail etc...

9054248
spaces	delimiter
this will behave slightly different than the other approaches in that it will leave a dangling spaces delimiter at the end

9054257
min	max
it is faster than sort or multiple call of min max for large size inputs

9054299
uiview	subviews
i recommend creating your own uiview subclass which looks like a uialertview and then you can add it and an image or whatever else you want to put in there as a subviews and you won t have unexpected breakage if apple does something to the uialertview class to make its innards even more private

9054301
mamp	ampps
i use my program on a mac using mamp and using ampps on windows 7

9054379
google-chrome	firefox
it is conventional for php code not to display any error in google-chrome firefox and any other browser

9054381
submit	submission
php does have a special-case notation to allow submission multiple values with the same name but that wouldn t help you here as that d submit all of the aaa values not just the one closest to the submit button

9054415
google-chrome	firefox
i went to the page in firefox and google-chrome and both worked fine

9054423

in each div i can put three floated inline-block divs as columns to get the same result

9054530
flatmap	fold
it s also worth noting that both map and flatmap are actually special cases of another more powerful function fold

9054553
int	chars
here is the code i have written which splits a string in c and then i want to return the first int value pointed by the chars pointer

9054602
activemq	rabbitmq
you should look at using message queues like msmq activemq or rabbitmq to do this

9054631
fink	homebrew
i don t know whether homebrew and fink do this too

9054631
fink	homebrew
if they don t change your so that it doesn t contain locations with potential third-party dependencies before you install anything using homebrew or fink

9054646

put	get
get put ask tell â they all work in any monad with the right transformer somewhere in the stack

9054805
put	get
this is done with typeclasses for each effect on offer for example monadstate provides get and put

9054836
int	double
i m doing some large number divisions long long to double and int int to float

9054868
getter	setter
you ll also not want to try to directly access itemtoupdatetipo0 s fields but rather use public getter and possibly setter methods to do this for you

9054883
post	get
i am using lwp useragent to do a simple http post and get the error below

9054906
width	height
an iframe is a window as far the code running in it is concerned so your code can only measure the total height width of the iframe and can t draw outside of that window

9054921
folder	directory
vendors folder in my apps directory right

9054986
base-class	subclassing
because you would have a lot of subclassing to a base class it s important to take your time and think out how that base-class should work

9055106
rubygems	bundler
this is rails 2.3.8 i am using bundler 1.0.21 and rubygems 1.6.2 on a mac

9055130

9055140
spaces	delimiter
note s.item n returns a spaces delimiter zero based item

9055152
mouse	keyboard
so far the program seems to work except for the fact that each key needs to be clicked by the mouse before the sound is played by pressing each key hence put the object in focus where i need the key to play the sound without clicking the keyboard key put the object in focus on keydown

9055168
put	get
when i put in a bad email address i don t get a notification that is was not delivered

9055287
for-loop	arrays
here is the for-loop that i m using to generate 13 numbers 1-13 and insert them in to the arrays

9055308
int	chars
i read that one can use chars for small int

9055311
hash	md5
in case usually uses md5 hash

9055326
int	double
avoid using double precision and use arbitrary length int instead

9055362
int	chars
operations on unsigned int are typically faster than on unsigned chars because your processor cannot fetch single bytes but has to get at least a multiple of 4 and mask out the other 3 bytes

9055368
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
i did a little experimenting and it seems the viewcontrollers view sets its frame correctly somewhere after viewwillappear is called and before viewdidappear is called

9055369
ssl	https
i m building an application that needs to open self-signed https ssl

9055387
for-loop	arrays
you can traverse the arrays in the singleton using a for-loop or what ever and then when you find the dictionary you want you can access compare remove add what-ever the data in them

9055403
post	get
first of all i know this type of post are already been made but i ve tried almost all of them and i m not been able to get the results so here i m again posting the same kind of question

9055417
int	chars
a chars is a small int with range -127 to +127 and it is subjected to the same int arithmetic as int are

9055417
int	chars
the problem here is the concept mix-up between the internal representation binary number representing the -127 to +127 range with the external one that conventionally makes the input and output functions to represent it as the glyph whose ascii code is the number carried on by it while for int the external representation is the chars sequence that read like the int represented in decimal form

9055435
std	ostream
there is an overload of for std ostream and signed unsigned char that performs character output

9055435
int	chars
in order to output the int value of the chars you need to perform a cast

9055458
versioning	upgrade
i would also strongly recommend that you upgrade to a more recent versioning of cassandra

9055464
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
yes just for something like reading from a file you have java.io classes for things like file randomaccessfile filereader fileinputstream datainputstream and bufferedreader all slightly different and used for different purposes often one stacked atop another

9055469
width	height
i would like it to only resize the chat text area when the resize is done vertically keeping the controls the same height consistently also i would like the buttons for sending the chat to maintain their size with the input box increasing in width when the size is increased horizontally

9055469
width	height
obviously the swf resizing will be done by javascript jquery .onresize and thus i will be able to set a mimimum width and height for the swf maintaining usability

9055493
cassette	squishit
i have a small article on using squishit with mvc3 though i prefer cassette

9055564
post	put	post	get	put	get
backbone sends json data to your php backend server which you should expose your restful api to respond to http verb like get post put delete and etc

9055566
chunked	transfer-encoding
if you re using chunked transfer encoding which is your case here transfer-encoding chunked you should look for the 0 termination character but you ll also have to analyse all the chunks and glue them together since you don t want to stop when the actual content contains a 0

9055572
pull	push
i was able to push and pull to this repo just fine before reinstalling lion and i still can with the different syntax

9055600
wordpress	joomla

9055619
sudo	passwd
or maybe their passwd is already cached with sudo

9055627
sorting	filtering
supports sorting and filtering

9055627
listview	gridview
if you just need simple read only then go with gridview listview

9055631
put	get
but if all you have put into the list are comboitem then the object you get out will be a comboitem

9055634
width	height
you can use screenfly to test your website on the iphone resultion screenfly uses a iframe with a specified width and height

9055653
keystore	jks
the default keystore format for java is jks

9055653
keystore	jks
instead you can support more than the jks and try the default keystore type and if it fails try the #pkcs12

9055706
implements	extends
implements an interface instead of extends a base class or doing both could be another way to let functionthatreceivesanextendedexample call func on ex without caring what exact class the ex object is and without the example class having to implements a func function as in your example

9055727
post	get
please post your implementation of pluginmanager.dowork and the exact error message you get when the test fails

9055778
put	get
i know i can do this if i initialize readonly to a real reference of an object but when i want to put in there null i get the error

9055788
gcj	javac
it s working fine with javac but with gcj on an up-to-date ubuntu it s not working

9055795
width	height
this means that animating the dimensions requires you to adjust the width and or height incrementally while re-drawing the entire canvas at each iteration

9055795
width	height
if you are looking to animate the canvas dimensions to reveal content that is already present on a larger theoretical canvas the user has a small window that s cropping the full canvas you would be better off playing with your css width and height along with the overflow hidden

9055805
post	get
first of all to the moderators don t get angry if this is not the right place to post this

9055819
spaces	delimiter
the delimiter between the words in each line can be either a spaces or a tab

9055876
rar	zip
all you need is to distribute it as a zip file or rar

9055877
superclass	subclassing
when subclassing you only need to override the superclass designated initializers and primitive methods the non-initializer method equivalent of designated initializers as all other methods of the superclass end up calling these

9055932
mouse	keyboard	mouse	trackpad
in addition scrolling can be accomplished via mouse trackpad trackball and the keyboard

9055970
wicked-pdf	pdfkit
i don t how much about wicked-pdf but i once used pdfkit and this is how i did the rendering part

9055975
hide	show
move your containerview left or right to show the view you like and to hide the other two views then update the views that are out of the screen

9055980
uiview	subviews
you need to make sure that there is a top-level uiview object which is not added as subviews of any other view and that there is a uitableview in the uiview

9055989
uiwebview	nsurlprotocol
see drop-in offline caching for uiwebview and nsurlprotocol

9055989
nsurlconnection	nsurlprotocol	uiwebview	nsurlprotocol
the short answer in my experience is that the easiest solution is to use an nsurlprotocol to intercept nsurlconnection requests including the ones made by uiwebview and write the results to disk

9055989
nsurlcache	uiwebview
for more information on how to subclass nsurlcache see substituting local data for remote uiwebview requests on cocoa with love and afcache .

9055992
next	except
you can do certainly do it except when you are pointing at the last element of the list in this case next would return null and you would see bad access as the result

9056009
put	get
an restful api exists for the attachments providing get put delete operations implementing crud operations on the server side

9056027
post	get
post and get hold different purposes

9056090
clang	llvm
it takes llvm bitcode - which can be generated from c c++ using llvm-gcc or clang or any other language that can be converted into llvm - and compiles that into javascript which can be run on the web or anywhere else javascript can run

9056139
google-chrome	safari
when viewing the page in safari the javascript to style the button appears to be executed fine as the button is styled as expected however in google-chrome the link text is displayed each time and only gets styled as a button if the page is reloaded by visiting another link and navigating backwards

9056185
post	put
so try .get instead of .post if you want to load customer form and post put to update

9056185
post	put
since browser don t support put method well rails emulates this via post request but inserting hidden into form like

9056209
post	get
the best i could get is a list of all my own post but it doesn t show photos the user is tagged in so i guess more things are missing

9056249
junit	testng
i would recommend testng instead of junit as it will easily allow you to run tests in parallel in any number of threads

9056251
maven	m2e
tight integration between maven integration for eclipse a.k.a m2e

9056278
width	height
_width _height is the screen width and height

9056307
gridbaglayout	miglayout
but if you need something very flexible use gridbaglayout or miglayout but they are a little complex to use

9056345
width	height
you ll have to choose between fraction of the width or height of your screen unless they re equal

9056345
width	height
let h screen height w screen width f fraction of screen dimension x image size

9056392
put	get
however if you cannot do that for some reasons then i would suggest to make it an xml file and then you can get variables from simplexml and such you can view all and put their values to a form

9056439
children	parent
if that were the only style being applied to both of these elements it would make sense to set the style on a parent higher up so that it gets inherited by all its children grandchildren and so on

9056503
width	height
you can use some code like this you can adjust a height and width as per your need

9056509
width	height
just as an aside - in your pasted code you ve mixed up the variable names you declare them as height and width but pass them as _width and _height

9056565
children	parent
it uses the html as you provided with one minor change i moved the ul that houses the children selects inside of the li that houses the parent

9056617
stdout	stderr
do not use stdout pipe or stderr pipe with this function

9056644
bmp	png
can people upload dangerous viruses i m limiting the upload to jpg png bmp 800kb

9056649
submit	submission
i m submission a form with js and i want to cancel the submit if any field is blank

9056659
jobs	cron
my first thought would be to create one cron job launching 20 randomly scheduled at jobs

9056723
post	get
it didn t support post for large-file uploads out of the box so i modifying it to get it working by piping the content body out to a file stream

9056723
google-chrome	safari
the headers look fine coming in example from safari but same problem on google-chrome

9056733
width	height
pick a random width and height for image i

9056754
super	self
that initializer will invoke the initializer of the superclass super sale self .__init__ passing along all of the positional and keyword arguments it received

9056777
layoutparams	viewgroup
when you call getlayoutparams that returns various instance of layoutparams that matches to parent viewgroup type

9056799
pthreads	fork
you really need to know what you re doing to use fork together with pthreads unless you re going to immediately exec in the child

9056811
post	get
you are sending the form via get but test for the post parameter

9056846
post	get
also i think you should be using a get request instead of post for curl

9056866
free	malloc
that is if you are going to need memory during run-time and do not want to declare it during compile time you will need to use malloc and free when you ve finished with the memory

9056866
int	chars
functions can alter parameters if those parameters are passed in by reference a pointer to the parameter and functions can return nothing or return a single atom of data a chars int smallint or pointer

9056877
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
they use utf-8 google-chrome opera iso-8859-1 safari the system code page ie or something else like only the most significant bit from utf-8 in the case of firefox

9056923
ubuntu	debian
if you have an ubuntu debian system you can use apt-get install or your favorite package manager gui instead

9056925
children	parent
a add a parent or root object reference to children

9056925
children	parent
pro s object hierarchy still doesn t require children to know parent root

9056932
rss	feed
i m in the works of learning to parse xml and rss feed correctly and have run in to a little problem

9056932
rss	feed
i m using feedbarser in python to parse a specific entry from an rss feed but can t figure out how to parse just a single img src from the content section

9056981
superclass	subclassing
super is used to reference the superclass the parent class from which you are subclassing

9056985
.htaccess	httpd.conf
you phrase about it loads the index.php means that you have something else in the httpd.conf lets say that your server is apache of your server or in .htaccess redirecting all request to the index.php file

9056997
try-catch	exception-handling
will throw an exception-handling if the loan amount is blank or not a valid double - you ll need to use a try-catch to handle this

9057028
width	height
i thought of creating a custom_element_layout.xml and then inflate it width a given height in java.

9057040
jobs	cron
mysql events offer an alternative to scheduled tasks and cron jobs

9057075
express	node.js
i m writing a login for a website in node.js using the express framework

9057081
children	parent
if a node is red and it s parent is red then both its children are black

9057106
getter	setter
if you want to get and set variable you use the getter and setter syntax for flash

9057114
width	height
have a width and height so the browser should not need to wait to

9057139
nsobject	nsmanagedobject
the problem is that you are trying to instantiate a nsmanagedobject using a conventional alloc init method of nsobject

9057148
opencart	magento
a pretty long wish list i know but i expect a combination of modx with something as powerful as magento xtcommerce opencart or the likes would be a really nice way to realize a big website with integrated shop

9057157
entities	entitymanager
moving both entities into the same entitymanager resolves the issue

9057183
udp	tcp
this may let you change protocols as well and may change how the device is configured - the difference between streaming udp with no retransmission of lost packets and tcp where the sender may need to be able to retransmit may be significant

9057183
voip	rtp
and now that i ve blathered about the systems side there s a lot of information out there on packetizing and streaming analog data ranging from development of streaming protocols such as rtp to details of voice packetization for gsm cdma and voip

9057253
for-loop	arrays
have tried to think of something that sort arrays t and use for-loop to go through s and use binary search to see if i find integer like k - s i for every element in s

9057271
disk	ram
that s basically possible but it would take hours as hard disk access is so much slower than accessing ram caches

9057277
put	get
what i want to do is that when i write something in column c i want excel to check if it exists in any of the cells in column a then do the following.for example lets say i entered number 33 in c44 and a 35 has also the same value which is 33 then get the value in b 35 then put it in d 44 .sounds so simple but almost impossible

9057279
for-loop	arrays
at that point you have an arrays of animals objects so you can use the same solution as above a single for-loop to iterate through each of the animals object and perform some action on them one-by-one

9057331
width	height
282 width and 337 height are integer division - when the denominator is larger than the numerator you will get 0 as a result

9057332
width	height	integer	fractions
because 282 337 width and height are all integers the operator performs an integer division truncating any fractions part of the result

9057366
serializable	deserialization
reflection is used to build the class maps but reflection is no longer needed while doing the serializable deserialization

9057366
serializable	deserialization
you could speed up serializable deserialization a little bit by writing your own handcoded serializable for your classes or by making your classes implement ibsonserializable but since the bottleneck is probably the network anyway it probably isn t worth it

9057391
put	get
the only way i can get it to work correctly is if i put it inside a table

9057465
getter	setter
what you are doing there is probably assuming that __construct or any setter getter should be called by the orm

9057472
portrait	landscape
i have a sencha touch 1.1 phonegap 1.3 application and i ve got a portrait and landscape launch image sized according to the ios documentation

9057514
uiview	uipagecontrol
i made a class that manages a uiscrollview a uipagecontrol and an array of uiview

zoo	xts
edit i realize my error was because my function testfun returned a zoo object and apply.daily requires an xts object

9057530
zoo	xts
can anyone suggest to me how i get my testfun to return an xts object instead of a zoo object so i can use apply.daily

9057585
mouseover	mouseleave
wrap your .scroller and .tickpop elements in another element and bind the mouseover and mouseleave events on the wrapper

9057585
mouseleave	mouseenter
add a little settimeout to the closing of .tickpop on mouseleave and call cleartimeout if the mouseenter .tickbox or a .scroller item

9057587
post	put
i need to put a 201 created response code and a location header for a post request but for some reason i am still getting a 302 response

9057597
width	height
the logo is 100px in height and 100 in width and i want the content window to be covering the whole remaining area

9057602
ubuntu	linuxmint
i am using linuxmint ubuntu derivate downloaded qtjambi v 4.7.0

9057615
int	double
i m having issue with casting double to int in qtdeveloper

9057615
int	double
as you can see in picture bellow x is int and y is double

9057621
addclass	removeclass
to change the class name on the cloned elements you can use the removeclass and addclass methods

9057638
octal	decimal
so our class was given an assignment to convert decimal numbers to their octal representations

9057641
hex	binary
if an application stores values from a function such as md5 or sha1 that returns a string of hex digits more efficient storage and comparisons can be obtained by converting the hex representation to binary using unhex and storing the result in a binary n column

9057641
hex	binary
each pair of hex digits requires one byte in binary form so the value of n depends on the length of the hex string

9057641
hex	binary
if your password salt is also stored in a binary column if it too was a hex string generated through the sha1 function then the last parameter of the zend_auth_adapter_dbtable should be

9057649
skip-lists	tree
there are some newer binary search tree designed for parallelism that sometimes outperform the skip-lists here is one such data structure though i expect that there will be fewer existing implementations and discussion of these newer structures

9057651
int	boolean
method.invokenative object object class class class int boolean line not available native method

9057667
pop-up	dialog
if you create a modal pop-up with the modal dialog as the parent it should already be shown above the modal dialog

9057673
textview	simpleadapter
i also have a custom simpleadapter in which i override the getview method and am able to retrieve clicks on the textview and checkbox changes

9057677
lzo	snappy	lzo	lz4	snappy	lz4
such algorithms are called lz4 snappy lzo quicklz and reach hundreds of mb s per cpu

9057678
nsmutablestring	nsstring
nsm is just an nsmutablestring att_1_variable att_2_variable is nsstring

9057716

9057748
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i m using nsuserdefaults to keep an object in sync across several uiviewcontroller s that are used in a uitabbarcontroller

9057757
children	parent
at a bare minimum your children will need to know of an interface or worse the parent itself to implement it

9057757
children	parent
which means your children code will be tied to the parent code

9057757
children	parent
also with mvvm knowing the parent does not mean that the inotifypropertychanged event will occur on your children automatically

9057757
children	parent
or when instantiating the the children add a propertychanged event on the parent that updates the child

9057889
typedef	struct
create a struct and typedef both named node -- standard trick for self referential struct

9057893
typedef	struct
if you change typedef struct to typedef struct node that error will be gone

9057899
hash	md5
i am saving a struct which contains a string which is the result of hashing the bytes of another string with md5 and then encoding the hash sum bytes into a string with hex

9057925
queue	fifo
the extra thread the main thread listens for new connections with the listen system call accepts the new connections with accept then determines which worker thread currently has the least number of connections acquires a lock mutex for that worker thread s pending connections fifo queue places the descriptor for the accepted connection onto the worker thread s pending connections fifo queue and sends a check your queue notification using a pipe to the worker thread

9057925
queue	fifo
if when a worker thread receives a check your queue notification from the main thread it would acquire the lock mutex for its pending connections fifo queue and add any newly accepted connections to its fd_set list

9057933
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
a superclass is a parent or base class that is derived or inherited from by a child class or subclassing

9057946
ubuntu	mint
in a bash shell script on ubuntu mint i need to create some symlinks in the jre lib ext directory under the java installation directory

9057947
int	chars
an easy way to implement this would be using a map of stacks such as where location is a class you create that holds two int s a line number and a chars number

9057982
youtube	vimeo
i made some progress on this with the php transfer youtube to vimeo tool i made

9057986
int	chars
to make an int from a single-digit chars use this code snippet

9057986
int	chars
therefore when you subtract the code of 0 which is denoted as 0 in c from a single-digit chars you get the int value of the corresponding digit

9058005
google-chrome	firefox
code is working in firefox and ie and i try to not use iframe because google-chrome keep caching old page

9058010
int	chars
chars s are just small int s so userchar - 0 assuming userchar has a chars with a value between 0 and 9 has a value of 0 to 9

9058050
int	chars
however in int expressions types smaller than int are promoted to int so you can don t need a cast to convert a chars to an int

9058050
int	chars
the last thing that you need to know is that whatever the int equivalent of the chars 1 is the actual value is unimportant it is 1 more than the int equivalent for 0

9058050
int	chars
in other words the chars 0 1 ... 9 are represented by a contiguous range of int and the same is true for a b ... z and a b ... z

9058050
int	chars
therefore if you know a chars is a digit because you ve used isdigit you get it s int equivalent using

9058063
post	get
i am trying to build rpm for my java code.rpm build and install sections works fine.but later i have added a shell script in post section to run shell script file that creates some files and starts the java application.the file gets copied fine.but in post section i get the failed dependencies bin sh error.i am building the rpm on linux machine and target machines are centos.i have also tried autoreqprov no in spec file.i am not running the install as a root user.also target machines are not expected to have ant iam using it to build the java code-this might be not related to the problem on them.i am attaching the code below.default location of installation is in tmp folder. for testing

9058121
google-chrome	firefox
for example when it is a slow connection the detection method fails because it thinks that the file is a stream and when it is a fast connection or google-chrome - that preloads the stream faster than firefox it thinks the file is corrupt and skips playing and starts the next file

9058163
onkeyup	onkeydown
you could use onkeypress onkeydown or onkeyup to get that change quicker

9058163
submit	submission
following your comment you should add a submit event to the form that would compare the current state of the textbox before submission the form.

9058164
implements	extends
i ve only implements it for one- and two- parameter functions but it shouldn t be a problem to extends this

9058164
g++	gcc
by implementing doit as a macro and using variadic macros a gcc g++ extension it is possible to have a fully variadic solution with the function name appearing first

9058183
int	double
in the middle of the code you re using int instead of double

9058190
bash	zsh
suffix aliases are the only reason i m considering to switch to zsh but i want to stick with bash

9058203
pascal	delphi
if subpixel accuracy without gpu dependency is needed i would recommend antigrain geometry or it s pascal cousin aggpas for delphi

9058227
nsurl	nsstring
i m trying to convert a nsurl to a nsstring to use elsewhere in my program

9058253
post	get
i ve tried a bunch of things to get this working using php s curl library but i just can t seem to get it to not use post which their servers kick out with an error

9058257
stdout	fflush
we found that grep fflush its output when it writes to stdout but not to a file

9058289
installation	upgrade
this line is now raising an exception i suspect my web host has upgrade it s php installation

9058328
post	get
how to switch from post to get in php curl

9058333
puts	gets
however if the user puts in an invalid number gets an error changes their mind and backspaces the phone number field the error message should go away

9058361
fadein	fadeout
my main problem using scriptaculous fadeout fadein effects is that when one is triggered before the other has finished the effects conflict and the element misbehaves

9058414
ubuntu	debian
note that this conflicts with the command-not-found debian and ubuntu packages so you may need to uninstall or otherwise unconfined this package for reliable results

9058432
put	get
suppose you put an alert helloworld in the partial -- it would get triggered twice

9058433
google-chrome	firefox
many things supported by firefox or google-chrome are not available in ie even newer versions

9058437
mouseleave	mouseenter
obviously you can refactor that in several ways but basically all you need to do is observer the mouseenter and mouseleave events and remember to cancel any running effect before starting a new one

9058524
put	get
retrieval operations including get generally do not block so may overlap with update operations including put and remove

9058567
width	border-box
just set it to border-box to subtract the padding and border from the box s width or content-box to render the padding outside of the specified width

9058572
llvm	clang++
i am using clang++ with llvm version 3.0 and generating arm binaries

9058579
put	get
get your info and ctrl+a copy all the information then put all the words into this textarea. the xdebug will tell you the xdebug s version and config put the end of your php.ini file

9058604
comparator	icomparer
i guess the type with which pqueue is instantiated has to implement comparator icomparer

9058609
button	checkbox
i have the following jquery script to transform a checkbox into a jquery-ui button and set up the icons to be displayed

9058615
uilabel	uibutton
i read that uilabel aren t meant to respond to touch events and that i could just use a uibutton

9058636
octal	decimal
first of all a number is not decimal or octal

9058636
octal	decimal
decimal and octal refer to different string representations of a number

9058636
octal	decimal
that is decimal and octal etc

9058636
octal	decimal
only make sense when talking about strings and a particular number can be converted into a string as decimal or octal or whatever

9058636
octal	decimal
instead you are trying to pack it back into a number in such a way that the resulting number s decimal representation would look like what the octal representation of the original number would look like

9058636
octal	decimal
this happens to be possible since any octal representation is also a valid decimal representation of some number

9058636
octal	hex	octal	decimal
this wouldn t be possible with hex for example. in other words you are converting a number to its octal string representation then parsing that string into a number as if it were a decimal representation

9058636
octal	decimal
for example take the number 42 whose decimal representation is the string 42 and octal representation is the string 52

9058660
rvm	bundler
if you provide more detail rvm bundler etc. it may be of help

9058674
preorder	postorder
is it possible to just by changing a few things achieve preorder and postorder traversal using the same algorithm

9058696
width	height
specifically the image string source number x number y number width number height method within this class

9058715
post	get
values are set by the form as long as the form s method is set to get rather than post which doesn t submit the values in the url

9058720
int	chars
i am wondering if it is possible to use scanf to read one line actually just 1 digit from 0 to 9 and input the data as both a chars variable and an int variable so the user only has to enter the number once

9058722
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
after finish go to about in xcode menu bar and check to see the xcode versioning again to make sure the upgrade installation was successful

9058739
int	chars
read the variable as a chars check if it is between 0 and 9 chars zero and chars nine and if it is cast it to an int like so

9058746
int	chars
you can read the int in with scanf and then convert it to a chars by adding 0

9058746
int	chars
since digits are always represented sequentially this will convert any single digit int to its corresponding chars value

9058756
hide	fadeout
when you do this the hide method is run immediately after the fadeout method is called as opposed to waiting for the fadeout method to finish

9058756
hide	fadeout
as an aside there is no need to call hide here because fadeout actually does this for you at the very end

9058807
int	double
int double 0

9058884
post	get
you will get a much better response if you post this on sublime text s forum sublimetext.com forum

9058902
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the code that i have works in google-chrome and safari but does not work in firefox and ie

9058908
post	put	post	get	put	get
if your application is only concerned with put post delete get on a resource your documentation could easily explain that

9058924
int	double
either t is a built in number type like int double etc

9058940
stdout	stderr
that means create 2 processes which is very slow 2mb of stack for each full process information such as ip address registers stdin stdout stderr ...

9058987
pop-up	dialog
when you click that button a dialog pop-up with two buttons one labeled don t close dialog and another labeled close dialog

9059005
outputstream	inputstream
you can talk to someone remotely with the outputstream and listen using the inputstream

9059012
implements	extends
it s more cumbersome to implements but extends more gracefully

9059037
oncreate	recreate
you should use onsaveinstancestate to save your state and then recreate it in oncreate

9059069
put	get
the workaround is to get a copy of the vertex from the list update it and put a copy of it back

9059109
msdeploy	webdeploy
i have the following task in my msbuild script to deploy to a remote server using webdeploy msdeploy service

9059126
equals	gethashcode
but you should also implement equals and gethashcode

9059145
google-chrome	firefox
i seem to happen only on flash flowplayer firefox google-chrome android+flash

9059151
inherited	properties
your vm is not a frameworkelement so it has no datacontext properties presumably it is not freezable either and hence might lack an inherited context too so i suspect that this won t work

9059180
submit	submission
this happens prior to the actual submission so we can cancel the submit action by calling .preventdefault on the event object or by returning false from our handler

9059183
mouseover	mouseout
you have to use mouseover and mouseout events because hover with two separate callback functions is not supported with .on at least it wasn t the last time i checked

9059201
int	chars
where as s1 and s2 are simply struct pointers that have a chars pointer and an unsigned int in them

9059209
mouseover	mouseleave
i want to have an element with a fixed small height that expands to his full height on a mouseover and shrinks back when mouseleave

9059211
width	height
then just divide the width with how many sprites are there in a column and divide the height with how many sprites are there in a row

9059212
int	chars
for example if the user enters 1 followed by 0 you need to compute the int value 10 from those two chars

9059221
free	malloc
including 0 and it doesn t free and call malloc again it just

9059221
free	malloc
if there is enough space you don t need to free or malloc again

9059247
serializable	deserialization
it uses reflection once per type to generate a serializable using reflection.emit so serializable or deserialization of the first object might be slow but any objects afterward are fast relatively

9059296
clang	llvm
as another data point apple s been converting from gcc to llvm with and without clang

9059296
llvm	clang++
llvm has traditionally had issues with some c++ and while llvm-gcc is now a lot better there still seem to be issues with clang++

9059380
folder	directory
go to search directory and under compiler link it to the path of your curl-7.24.0-devel-mingw32 include folder

9059411
moq	nmock
moq and nmock rhinomock will not help you here

9059414
uiview	subviews
alternatively you could instantiate the new subviews with the full image set it with the original uiimageview s frame and then using a uiview animation block set it to the newer frame

9059420
uilabel	uibutton
so my app has the uibutton and uilabel but nothing else is showing up in my app

9059428
wordpress	vbulletin
ensure any popular web applications like wordpress or vbulletin are updated

9059484
google-chrome	firefox
this is windows only but needs to support google-chrome firefox and internet explorer

9059550
int	double
int streamposition double wavfileformat_samplespersec double wavfileformat_bitspersample 8

9059605
fadein	hide
a similar syntax applies to other jquery methods like fadein hide etc

9059636
iprincipal	iidentity
even then you still should use the base iprincipal and iidentity functions that membership and formsauth implement

9059645
hide	show
in all modern browser i tested it so far it works but in ie8 the div fadetoggle just show hide

9059655
portrait	landscape
in my application the activity is entering in to the application not responding state when the configuration is changed from the portrait to landscape

9059685
msdeploy	webdeploy
if you want webdeploy aka msdeploy to natively support this feature please vote on it at

9059718
octal	decimal
i need to convert some numbers from a list which i made into decimal and octal

9059732
nofollow	noindex
some of our front end developers have noindex nofollow code on the pages and we are told this is to prevent google and others from blacklisting the site as trying to have multiple links all going to the same content think somerepcode representing over 1000 sales representatives with nearly the exact same page minus name and contact number shown

9059734
portrait	landscape
refer to and specifically check out the providing alternative resources section - you can have the layout system use different layouts depending on whether your device is in landscape or portrait mode automatically

9059734
setcontentview	findviewbyid
then you will only have a single call to setcontentview and all the findviewbyid s ..

9059777
post	put
also be sure to put quotes around attribute values in your form and post value

9059804
single-quotes	double-quotes
ps replace double-quotes with single-quotes in str2

9059844
cpu	processors
having said that you can realize performance benefits with a multi-threaded algorithm on a single core cpu despite the fact that you only have one processors

9059854
rspec	capybara
when running my specs with rspec capybara it can t find capybara s visit method

9059872
tiff	png
i am converting tiff image into png format and showing it on browser but it works only in ie

9059945
hlsl	glsl
based on glsl mode i wrote a similar one for hlsl which is used in direct3d effect

9059964
google-chrome	firefox
it s working in firefox and google-chrome

9059976
nofollow	noindex
all links that go to www.site.com or www.site.com page.html as opposed to www.site.com somerepcode page.html should not have the noindex nofollow set

9059976
nofollow	noindex
all links going to mirrors www.site.com somerepcode ... should have the noindex nofollow set

9060018
firefox	safari
i can t speak for safari but in firefox there is a marvelous addon called greasemonkey that does exactly what you want execute arbitrary js of your choosing creation on arbitrary websites

9060085
g++	gcc
if using gcc or g++ that is done using the -g option

9060156
subtract	add
i have defined an instruction set which only have load store move add and subtract operation

9060170
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
if the arrays 12 10 0 0 ......0 the for-loop needs to consider only the non-zero elements so loops should get executed only twice..once for 12 and next for 10

9060170
for-loop	arrays
similarly if the arrays is 0 0 0 ......0 then for-loop should not executed at all since all elements are zero

9060170
for-loop	arrays
if the arrays is 12 10 5 0 17 8 0 0 ....... 0 then the for-loop should get executed for the first 6 elements even though one of the inner elements is zero

9060180
background-color	transparency
add the style attribute to table and set it to background-color transparency

9060183
int	double
but with int float long double etc i cannot do this

9060192
children	parent
for me i would build the tree in a top down fashion create the parent node before the children

9060204
folder	directory
the output directory should not be saved in svn so you should add it as an ignored resource right click on the output folder go to the team sub-menu and select add to svn ignore

9060208
fgets	getline
there is one difference fgets reads the line and n is included in the string while getline reads the line but delimiter n is not stored

9060234
width	height
if you set those equal to your viewport height only the width will be resizable

9060253
width	height
going with anthonywjones i m pretty sure width or height is something like double.nan

9060253
width	height
make sure you place a check to see is width and height is a real number

9060345
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i ve tested it in ie9 ie10 and the latest versions of google-chrome firefox and opera and safari

with webkit based browsers google-chrome safari i ve found that trying to do certain on click events submits and other things with a blank href element in your anchor tag won t work

9060421
google-chrome	safari
hi i m using the next css code to style scroll bars in safari and google-chrome

9060431
post	get
itâ s a post not a get so it could only be done from a form or ajax not a simple url

hide	show
to show hide progress in action bar

9060662
google-chrome	firefox
but in my browser console google-chrome firefox i see a object return

9060694
punctuation	words
we just iterate over every words remove punctuation and make it lowercase

9060713
disk	ram
my potentially crazy idea is to have an a master database that runs entirely in ram either as a memory table or as innodb backed by a ram disk and then replicate to a slave for slightly delayed persistence

9060743
onfocus	onblur
i found that adding onblur and onfocus events to inline bypassed the issue

9060765
hide	show
however i can t use listview because my list is a nested list and the frameworks default behavior is hide the nested list and show it once the its primary list is clicked

9060823
int	chars
when working with chars buffers in c sometimes it would be useful and more efficient to able to work with int -sized chunks of data at a time

9060832
sorting	filtering
include operation doesn t support filtering or sorting

9060859
onenote	ms-office
of course the best approach is to have a natural saving point such as if you have a page-change like for onenote ms-office or a save button

9060889
x86	mips
most modern systems eg x86 x64 ppc mips arm handle word-sized writes in the way you describe with the exception that writing to an unaligned address will result in a crash

9060936
portrait	landscape
in iphone launch images are always in portrait mode you can make launch image such that it looks like it is in landscape but actually it will be in portrait mode

9060936
portrait	landscape
while ipad has option for launch image in both mode landscape and portrait

9060941
width	height
i saw in your jsfiddle that you are mixing left top right and bottom with width and height and top-margin.

9060941
width	height
only use left top width and height

9060971
nasm	fasm
first place to look would be open-source assemblers such as fasm or nasm from these you can gleam how to do the code generation

9060993
public	protected
if you don t intend for the class member to be public then it should be declared protected or private

9060993
inherited	subclassing
unless you resort to introspection and reflection which is strongly discouraged because it usually leads to spaghetti code and is death to performance then the only way you can change a member s visibility is to inherited the class in a subclassing and redeclare the member with the new visibility

9060993
getter	setter
however if outside agents still need access to it then you should provide a getter and setter method for this job

9060993
getter	setter
a getter returns the value of the property and a setter lets it get changed in a controlled way

9060993
getter	setter
getter and setter let you do such things as make a property read only or implement lazy-initialization meaning that if the class needs to do some expensive operation to

9060993
getter	setter
as the property can t be directly accessed from outside your getter and setter let you have total control over what goes into the property and how it comes out again

9061022
versioning	upgrade
there is a forked versioning on which has been upgrade to a newer versioning of hibernate

9061037
chunked	transfer-encoding
yes jetty will default to transfer-encoding chunked if the size of response cannot be determined

9061049
client-side	server-side
and since you don t want to check this server-side the answer is browser-dependent in the sense that it needs a client-side javascript api capable of what you want

9061067
folder	dir
the git repo in the web folder is cloned from the same box to git s home dir where it s stored instead of through ssh

9061074
struts	stripes
if you re looking for a java web framework which is not so stateful - then maybe look at some action based framework like struts or stripes so you can work in request scope and not need a component tree present or rebuilt on a postback

9061106
width	height
you ll need to add layoutparams to the view before you add it since all views have to at minimum specify their layout width and layout height

9061110
versioning	upgrade
now i need to upgrade to latest versioning but i could not get a single link to download the latest versioning of the application loader

you cannot read from stderr and stdout in the script engine in this way as there is no non-blocking io as code master bob says

9063149
stdout	stderr
if the called process fills up the buffer about 4kb on stderr while you are attempting to read from stdout or vice-versa then you will deadlock hang

9063149
stdout	stderr
you will starve while waiting for stdout and it will block waiting for you to read from stderr

9063149
stdout	stderr
the practical solution is to redirect stderr to stdout like this

9063149
stdout	stderr
the incantation redirects prog.exe s stderr to stdout

9063149
stdout	stderr
you can now succeed by reading from stdout and ignoring stderr

9066272
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome and ie9 use woff files

9066272

serializable	deserialization
i m using jersey for both serializable and deserialization

9066360

pull	push
the client just needs to push pull data from the server on a regular interval and display among other things a google map with some moving markers

9066504
jobs	cron
but for now i will use cron jobs

9066506
client-side	server-side
if you mean controlling instance of httpsession on client-side simply you cannot control the session on client-side since it lives on server-side

9066589
udp	tcp
tcp or udp

9066609
centos	linux
maybe compile it from scratch with some particular flag i m on linux centos organize the files in a certain fashion or maybe make the search parallel in some way

9066846
xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
the jquery xmlhttprequest jqxhr object returned by .ajax as of

9066884
super	self
calls to super implicitly pass on self

9066884
super	self
therefore in apple s example code the call calls the super implementation of allocwithzone passing the current value of self which is mygizmoclass s class object as it is a static method

9066905
vim	emacs
vim emacs is not that popular with the other as it is very awkward and hard to get started and it requires alot of effort to learn which takes the focus away from our project

9066926
hide	show
i need the light blue bar which contains the search bar refresh button to be scrolled up so it hide and displays from the dark blue facebook bar as show in this image

9066986
post	put
the reason why i can t just put newsroom in my permalink structure is because i have custom post types that shouldn t be affected

9067002
slideup	slidedown	hide	show
but the problem is when i want to use slideup and slidedown instead of show and hide

9067018
int	double
so i guess you have double or decimals or floats but not int so make sure that you are casting back to the correct type

9067037
button	checkbox
i check the checkbox in r1 r2 and r3 one by one and then i click save button

9067040
int	boolean	int	chars
the convert method s job is to convert the string into an object of myclass where myclass can be anything except a primitive - int boolean chars date.

arcgis	proj
the fix for me was to open a sample arcgis app in eclipse file new other arcgis for android arcgis samples for android and copy the lib folder to my proj

9067092
subtraction	addition
signedness is about how bytes are treated by arithmetic operations other than addition and subtraction in the case of 2 s complement representation

9067151
client-side	server-side
the rest depends on the client-side or server-side code that you are using

9067171
try-catch	exception-handling
so catch-handle-continue is a perfectly valid use of try-catch and many uses of exception-handling throwing in the framework expect you to handle them robustly

9067203
width	height
in ondraw method i get view s width and height via getwidth and getheight and using these values i scale and move my image

9067203
width	height
everything is fine with that but sometimes when orientation has changed my imageview in ondraw still remember old values of it s width and height

9067310
cout	cin
what i am finding curious is when i call cout in the main function and i am running the program the console appears and displays nothing when i press a letter and enter the program returns 0 as if it were at the cin statement but the console will not even display the letter i have pressed

9067364
post	get
edit i get json array from post

9067404
ssl	https
i also tried terminating the ssl using node.js https server and the performance was very similar to pound stunnel and stud so no clear advantage to that approach

9067411
hide	show
when you click display it should hide all trs show trs that display the correct provider + grade id and then hide any td s parent tr that does not contain the class search

9067422
onclick	onfocus
i have tried onclick and onfocus and not working well

9067445

9067467
getter	setter
followed by setter and getter

9067595
onclick	onmousedown
i want to know which is better onclick or onmousedown - or do they both support all of the following middle button left click right click other buttons like gamer mouse

9067632
mouseup	mousedown
notably the click event will fire if you tab to a link and press enter but the mousedown mouseup will not

9067635

gentoo	ubuntu
our desktops are running ubuntu 11.10 with python-odbc 2.1.7-1build1 and our server has gentoo not my decision with pyodbc-2.1.8

9067664
onclick	onmousedown
the main difference is that while onmousedown triggers regardless of which mouse-button was pressed onclick triggers only for the left mouse button - which will be most likely what you want

9067679
xlsx	xlsm
as i understand it backgroundchecking is a setting specific to the excel application itself and nothing that could be set in the xls or xlsx xlsm file format itself

9067692
x86	64bit
however if your application did not exceed the limits of 32-bit you may deploy the application on x86 only anyway it should also work on 64bit os via 32-bit virtualization

9067745
uiview	subviews
a much much more elegant solution is to use a uiview subclass though this isn t always appropriate and recalculate all your subviews on a parent s frame change and be smart only recalculate them if the new frame size has changed use cgrectequaltorect to compare the new frame when you override setframe and before you call

9067745
drawrect	layoutsubviews	hide	show
the naive implementation would be to override drawrect don t a better one would be to just use layoutsubviews and then in the uiviewcontroller or whatnot you can call view setneedslayout in a single method that is called for either show or hide

9067776
onmousedown	onmouseup	onmousedown	mouseup	onclick	onmouseup	onclick	onmousedown	mouseup	mousedown	onmouseup	mousedown
the onclick onmousedown and onmouseup represent different behaviours none of which is intrinsicly better a click is a press and then release of the button mousedown is the down and mouseup is the release

9067776
mouseup	mousedown
the mdn documentation indicates that onclick fires after mousedown and mouseup

9067787
implements	extends
why is it that i must extends thread in an inner class instead of implements runnable

9067824
put	get
i m trying to put all my variables into a class but i get errors

9067841
virtuoso	tdb
if you want to use the data you might want to look into loading it in a triple store 4store virtuoso jena tdb ... and use sparql to query it

9067853
post	get
but most likely you misnamed the variables or sent them via get instead of post

9067947

9068051
popupwindow	dialog
android custom popupwindow dialog

9068057
put	get
change your line to put an echo in front and you get

9068069
int	chars
firstly it should be noted that date and time values should always be stored as those types and together as timestamp not as individual fields not as int or chars types - the headaches you run into just aren t worth it mostly relating to invalid values

9068070
portrait	landscape
create a portrait and landscape layout in a datatemplate

9068096
post	put
you could put the values in hidden fields so they are posted to your post action you can then bundle them in the actionresult of the post method

9068114
oncreate	setcontentview	oncreate	findviewbyid	setcontentview	findviewbyid
you are using findviewbyid inside oncreate of your world activity but you did not call setcontentview before it

9068115
post	get
then on the post action it can accept a parameter of the same class the model will automatically get the values from the form variables it will automatically matches values to properties of the model whenever possible

9068194
777	tmp
i both tried the tmp folder and a different folder with chmod 777

9068200

while this isn t a floated solution it does result in side by side columns where they are the same height and one can remain fluid with while the other has a static width

9068206
memcpy	memmove
note that you d be copying eg memcpy or memmove here bitshifting is usually done inside machine words not between them

9068480
ember.js	sproutcore
check out my sample sproucore 2.0 application ember.js is the new name of sproutcore 2.0

9068497
min	max
you have to find a min max of a function g such that g x sigma where x is a set of your observations in your case your image grayscale values this function can be anything that maintain the order of the intensities of the iamge for example this can be done with the 1st derivative of the image as g

9068508
post	get
sf_method get post

stdout	stderr
i d like to start a process wait 2 seconds and print out whatever is in the stderr and stdout pipes so far and then exit

width	height
i am trying to modify the height and width of the image box that opens when i click on a thumbnail but have not had any success

9068744
cpu	processors
some very old processors didn t have fast shift hardware in which case a lookup might be considerably faster - especially as cpu speeds tended to be the same as memory speeds back then

9068751
getter	setter
that isn t necessary if you re just doing trivial getter setter methods we re not writing java here... but since you mention that there is other business logic involved i think that s a good design decision

9068811
put	get
i supposed that you can call in your jquery code to get the object and do something i think could work because if you put a click event that fires an alert in the first element it works

9068864
nsresponder	nsapplication
you need to implement flagschanged in the same class where you implement this -keydown method or just any nsresponder subclass that may be able to catch this event the nsapplication

9068937
width	margin
the problem is that it is getting the width of the parent container which if you go far enough back is taking the width of your browser window and then adding the margin

9068950
cos	sqrt
also the functions has names in lowercase cos log sqrt

9068961
jobs	cron
that s just an example...you would need cron jobs to award resources for each business a user owns every hour that way they can collect the money even when they are not logged in

9068964

i was wondering if anyone can shade some light why it worked fine in my opera browser but not on my google-chrome or firefox i was using wamp for my computer act as a localwebserver

9069000
google-chrome	firefox
but google-chrome and firefox for some reason say that dayselector is not defined.

9069010
client-side	server-side
a user access token and page access token will be the same in either server-side or client-side environment other than maybe for the time stamp expiration

9069010
client-side	server-side
an app access token will be exactly the same either server-side or client-side

9069024
children	parent
i have added these parent-nodes without problems but when the children nodes are added via insertnodeinto only parent nodes appear

9069025
put	get
if i try to place the start before any of the buttons and put the end after the last of them then i get compilation errors

fast-forward	merge
the --no-ff flag prevents git merge from executing a fast-forward if it detects that your current head is an ancestor of the commit you re trying to merge

9069127
fast-forward	merge
a fast-forward is when instead of constructing a merge commit git just moves your branch pointer to point at the incoming commit

9069127
fast-forward	merge
similarly if you want to execute a git pull or use git merge in order to explicitly fast-forward and you want to bail out if it can t fast-forward then you can use the --ff-only flag

9069134
post	get
the szenario is - i go to the url and get a file in background if it is complete success i will use this data as a file and post this to the server .

width	height
i ve been trying to find a good jquery auto grow plugin but every single one i find either doesn t work correctly in all browser up to date ones not so worried about older browsers or they don t allow me to put my own css height width etc

9069198
width	height
i just want a simple one that works i don t want any fancy animations unless that plugin works great one i have had worked perfect in firefox however in webkit it would autogrow when you typed even before the text got to the end of the line and then another autogrow one wouldn t allow me to set the height width to specific values

9069205
free	malloc
i use malloc and free functions but i m not sure i m using them correclyt

9069219
onfocus	onblur
obviously replace the is_editing assignments with whatever you wanted to happen onblur onfocus

integer	fractions
integer part of returned value is the number of seconds since midnight and the fractions part can be converted into miliseconds - just multiply it by 1000

9069420
graphics2d	bufferedimage
you might try something like creating a bufferedimage getting its graphics2d and setting its affinetransform to affinetransform.scale -1 1 and then using the graphics2d s drawstring method

9069434
gif	png
i think the simplest way to do this would be to get a set of images of all the letters and symbols use flip them using any conventional graphics software -- paintshoppro photoshop whatever -- save the images as a bunch of individual gif or png files and then retrieve the appropriate one when you need it

9069474
free	malloc
when you call malloc it quickly looks though the free-store for a free block of memory at the size requested

9069474
free	malloc
thus if you make a lot of calls to malloc and free with varying memory size requests it could in theory cause a condition called memory fragmentation where there is enough space in the free-store to allocate your requested memory block but not enough contiguous space for the size of the block you ve requested

9069481
hide	show
i m looking to have only the clicked show hide expand when clicked instead of all the ul s expanding

9069486
free	malloc
you have to free the allocated memory in exact reverse order of how it was allocated using malloc

9069490
int	double
also you should be using float or double instead of int

9069513
gridview	objectdatasource
assuming the configuration is setup correctly is there a way to implement an objectdatasource bound to a gridview in order to show who the administrators are for each application entity with one record row per administrator

9069590
typedef	typename
signature looks like but this has three things after the typedef typename and i can t find online what that would be called or what it does

9069598
post	get
simply switching the form from get to post will likely fix the problem since post data is not nearly as restricted in length as get data tends to be

9069605
base-class	derived-class
the base-class destructor is automatically called right after the derived-class destructor has run

9069610
post	get
if the data is in the url string it is a get not a post

9069610
post	get
but really this is the sort of thing that you re going to want to do through post not with a get request.

9069634
put	get

9069654
gentoo	linux
i have just tried to install gentoo linux using xen kernel

9069656
superclass	subclassing
the virtual here is used so that if you delete a derived class object through a base class pointer c++ knows to call the destructor based on the dynamic type of the object the subclassing rather than the static type of the pointer the superclass

9069663
typedef	typename
this is exactly the same as the role of the typename keyword in that typedef but with the effect of telling the compiler it s a template instead of a type

9069673
mapquest	directions

9069840
draggable	droppable
i would recommend jquery ui - which supports drag-and-drop through the draggable and droppable interactions

9069847
draggable	droppable
use the callbackhandlers of the draggable droppable events to get the values which have changed

9069853

9070208
width	height
furthermore you can store the height and width on the element using data function

9070219
mouseover	mouseout
then inside the hover handler instead of trying to calculate on the fly you could just read the dimensions positions you ve already got stored and transition to the zoomed ones on mouseover or the original on mouseout

9070252
ncover	dotcover
i can t tell you if ncover fails to overcome the optimizations or solves this in another way but i m quite sure about dotcover

inherited css properties

9070342
stdout	stderr
in this particular case process.communicate returns stdout stderr but the code that calls call_command isn t interested in stderr so it uses this notation to get stdout directly

9070348
onreadystatechange	onload
to that end there are at least two events for script elements that you can hook on to onreadystatechange and onload

9070359
sorting	grouping
i also played around with enabling disabling sorting grouping and using refresh or update but with any result.

- uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

9078087
gridview	repeater
if you are not going to use the paging feature of the gridview control so i suggest that you move to the repeater as it will give you the power to format the table header section and footer and it will give you the power of rendering the table exactly as you want it to be rendered

9078136

realloc behaves the same as malloc so the memory returned by realloc has the same alignment constrain of malloc

9078338
realloc	malloc
if you look at the glibc source code for realloc it calls directly on to malloc

9078366
hash	md5
i suggest you generate a md5 hash of the message and send it along

9078366
hash	md5
if the hash does not match the md5 passed to server it means the user has tampered the data

free	realloc
a just keep in mind that neither posix nor linux man pages specify whether or not you even can pass these pointers to realloc only that you can pass them to free

9078627
free	realloc
in that case free may have been made intelligent since the specs say it must be able to handle the allocations done by posix_memalign but realloc may not have been given the same intelligence since the docs are silent on that matter

9078627
free	realloc
however based on gnu glibc 2.14.1 it actually allocates more memory than needed then fiddles with the arena to free up the pre-space and post-space so that the address returned is a real address usable by free or realloc

9078645
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it works in different ways in firefox google-chrome and in ie9 opera

9079278
viewmodel	caliburn.micro
i would seriously consider using an mvvm framework for view composition - caliburn.micro for example makes viewmodel first development extremely straightforward and already provides a viewmodel base class which implements inotifypropertychanged and a mechanism for building view compositions with conventions

9079278
viewmodel	caliburn.micro
caliburn.micro also has a host of other features such as being able to place a button control with on your view and your save method on your viewmodel will automatically be invoked when the button is clicked

9080288

haskell	scheme
it is difficult in haskell to capture the notion of a list in scheme unless you cheat and use an extension like data.dynamic

9089287
haskell	scheme
this is because from the point of view of pure unextended haskell it is difficult if not impossible to assign all scheme lists the same type

9089287
haskell	scheme
this means that while scheme allows you to write functions that take any list proper or improper you re going to have a hard time doing the same in haskell and for good reason

9089291
google-chrome	firefox
the bug is happening in firefox and google-chrome and not ie9 which leads me to think it must have something to do with css rendering but the fact that it only happens under certain circumstances has me very confused

equals	compareto
compareto tells you which and if one is greater less than the other while equals simply tells you if they are equivalent values

9089736
equals	compareto
finally note that these equals and compareto methods are not strictly needed for primitive types like int because the standard comparison operators are overloaded so you could do these

9089736
equals	compareto
equals and compareto work as i have describe for string as well

9089737
equals	compareto
compareto will return an int with -1 or any other negative value for less than 0 for equals or 1 or any other positive value for greater than

9089743
equals	compareto
the functionality in compareto is actually a superset of functionality of equals

9089743
equals	compareto
a compareto function dictates ordering before after or equals while the equals function merely dictates equality

9089743
equals	compareto
hence it s actually possible to define equals in terms of compareto

9089777

9090595
getter	setter
make a class of your own to hold this data once it is retrieved private vars with getter and 1 or more setter

9090604

9091539
int	chars
while my answer might seem quite verbose compared to simply select cast substr mycol1 1 5 as bigint from mytable1 but it allows for the space chars to not always be there situations where the mycol1 value is not of the form nnnnn nn if the string is nn nn then the convert to int will fail

typedef	struct
most of us are well aware that in c in order to create a struct you normally prefix it with a typedef to avoid calling the struct keyword before referencing the object

9092659
typedef	struct
my point is that given that you can already create a struct in c++ which doesn t require the typedef to declare without the struct keyword and using non encapsulated functions which pertained to these struct for an object-oriented approach i was curious to know if there are any advantages to the c approach of coding in c++ which would include using static global functions as private member functions along with global function constructors which would return pointers to objects

9092666

in django i have created a function decorator which can - in this example - create a lowercase version of a supplied post get argument and it updates the request before the view handles it all

9093299
post	get
i m a bit concerned i hack django s wsgirequest object in such a way other django functionality might not see the updated get post request objects

9093336
width	height
the width and height presumably you are taking this from frame.size have to change because they describing the smallest rectangle that holds the entire rotated view - if you rotate a rectangle by 45 degrees then the rectangle to hold the rotated rectangle is wider and taller than the original rectangle

9097905
onresume	onpause
if the mute action does not affect the performance of your app from my own experience i suspect it won t you could simplify the solution you suggested in your question with a single abstract base class overloading onresume and onpause to ensure you capture the event when the user returns to your already created activity

9097905

keydown	keyup
for keyboard input wpf first sends the appropriate keydown keyup events

9099420

9100165
width	height
with that font finder knows the width and height of the element when the fallback font is in use

9100165
width	height
if the width and height of the element matches the width and height when the fallback font was set we can deduce that the given font is not present

9100165
width	height
the first font in the list which produces a different width or height on the element will be the font that is actually being rendered note there is a special case involved when the fallback font â œserif â is in the font-family list

user inputs a link to an rss feed

9100254
error-handling	exception-handling
all in all exception-handling is the way to go but if this is not possible for some reason i have to disagree with the majority of the answers here and suggest something like getlasterror for larger less disciplined teams i d say return errors through the call stack for smaller more disciplined ones on the basis that if a returned error status is ignored this allows us to at least notice an error later and it allows us to retrofit error-handling into a function that wasn t properly designed to return errors by simply modifying its implementation without modifying the interface

9100256
client-side	server-side
.net and other server technologies provide you ability to use server-side computing and this gives you a lot of advantages from only client-side access

mtu	dhcp
have a look in the routers configuration and see you can configure the mtu value that the dhcp server is handing out

9100785
mtu	dhcp
if it s not possible to set the mtu in the routers dhcp configuration another option would be to turn off the dhcp function of the router and install a dhcp server on the windows xp machine

9100785
mtu	dhcp
the mtu size is dhcp option 26

i am looking for a way to display the result in a repeater or a datalist what ever is better

9103607

9103626
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it happens with safari google-chrome but not with ie firefox and so i thought it could be webkit s fault

9103655

while i am not sure i completely understand the problem here i have heard that css html should be used to control layout width but not height

9103878
width	height
if you take a square width height and chop off a fixed portion from one side you no longer have a square and you have to think about what that means to your graph

9103878
width	height
you can vary the width and height of the outer most svg and so long as you maintain the same ar all the code on the inside will not have to change - it will all scale automajically

9103885

in this function definition it does nothing with the class member car speed and car position because you declared the local int speed and double position in the function parameter list they hide the class member variables

mysql provides both des and aes encryption

9104079
uiview	subviews
this serializes the uiview and all its subviews into an nsdata and then creates a complete copy of those from the nsdata

9104091

9104116
centos	linux
i am running a java server on a vm linux centos with 4 cores and 4gb memory with 1gb heap

9104125

9104237
put	get
to get it to work but if i don t put that into my javascript it acts like it s not even regex.

9104301
spaces	delimiter
based off your example you could have a generated field that concatenates all other fields with spaces delimiter

9104313
mouse	keyboard
low-level mouse and keyboard hooks are two exceptions to this rule

9104391
vpn	lan
so if you attach database on server computer you can than connect from clients same way as you would to local database. provided those computers are in lan or vpn

9104507
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
they can with ie7 ie9 firefox opera safari

other solution is to add height and width to a persent value like 100 to get all the width height of your window and hide the scroll bars of iframe

9104537
rss	feed
i ve always shown text and links and i would like to know how can media be inserted in rss feed

9104546
post	put	post	get	put	get
however i notice that in my rspec tests it responds to all request types get post put delete

9104546
put	get
however from rspec the following test fails meaning the controller processes request successfully for get put delete

9104546
post	get
this appears to be an issue with either rspec 2.0 or actioncontroller testcase because i get the following error when i try to hit foo id bar on my sever with anything but post

9104548
width	height
the height and width of iframe is fixed at around 450px width and 160p px height

9104606
width	height
then i get an illegalargumentexception width and height must be 0 when the system tries to draw the new form

9104606

i traced the problem down to the call to androidimplementation.peerwrapper.getbuffer and the values returned by getwidth and getheight are width 474 and height 0

i have this code to check if a span is hidden or visible depending on the value it will show or hide the event is triggered when a user clicks a button

9104625
listview	gridview
i ve looked at a bunch of different controls listview gridview etc. and can t decide which makes the most sense for me to use

9104633
hide	show
notice the button towards the top of the page that says show less info if you click on that this should hide two of the elements inside towards the right of each of these grey data bars i m calling them rocks

9104633
hide	show
if you toggle the children the elements that are supposed to hide when you click show less info are not hidden

9104642
getter	setter
i realize there would be limitations if there are property getter setter or private members the source is not included but i don t need that

9104646
pop-up	dialog
on click pop-up this will generate a jqueryui dialog

9104646
pop-up	dialog
in the the newly added tab labeled tabs2.htm click pop-up this will generate a jqueryui dialog

9104666

a comment post works fine the first time but on the second attempt i get template is missing as if the form was being submitted before the ajax method got to be called

9104708
config	ini
ok i am planning on using the configparser module for creation of a few ini config files i have ran into some trouble though

9104718
post	get
here user_id would be the person who cast the vote polarity would be either 1 for an upvote or -1 for a downvote this lets you just sum the polarities to get upvotes and downvotes to cancel votable_type would contain what the vote is for post or comment votable_id would contain the id of the thing the vote is for and total would keep a running total of the vote sum for efficiency

9104738
ccscene	cclayer
that d be the constructor of your ccscene where mainlayer is your cclayer that you wanna use bg is the background obviously

9104739

9104837
fadein	fadeout
jquery override fadein fadeout effects

9104837
fadein	fadeout	fadein	hide	hide	fadeout	hide	show
you probably want to redefine fadein and fadeout to alias show and hide

9104849
getter	setter
by default getter and setter are thread-safe which also incurs a performance penalty

9104849
getter	setter
nonatomic tells the compiler to not worry about thread-safety considerations when writing getter and setter for that property

9104849
getter	setter
for completeness readonly tells the compiler to only generate a getter not a setter whereas readwrite generates both

9104849
getter	setter
this lets you implement the getter or setter at a future point with your own implementation without having to modify your code in numerous other places

9104858
getter	setter
this determines whether or not a getter readonly or a getter and a setter read write are available and synthesised during an synthesize

9104864
metaclass	setattr
add_to_class is a metaclass method that is mostly just setattr

9104866
fadein	fadeout
inside your ie specific js file you can overwrite the fadein and fadeout functions like this

9104866
fadein	hide
this will result in fadein and .fadeout calls being handled by the .show and hide functions

9104886
rbac	acl
a cms is nice for filling that niche but i would assume you will need rbac or acl grading some type of course tracking etc

9104886

children	parent
given a data.frame it returns a list of two children data.frames of equal ncol extracted randomly from their parent

9105026
put	get
but when you get to this point it probably makes sense to move more functionality out of the background task and put that on the server too

9105038
put	get
adding is get priority .add value if get returns null put priority new linkedhashset

9105050
ropemacs	pymacs

9110232
google-chrome	firefox
it s possible that internet explorer is refusing to set the innerhtml because you d end up with dom elements with ids that aren t unique whereas firefox and google-chrome aren t being quite so restrictive

9110350
inherited	properties
keep in mind that depending on the properties you re setting in this rule some of them may either be inherited by descendants that are .printable or otherwise affect them one way or another

9110435

9110502
scalamock	scalatest
i m afraid that scalamock with testng isn t something i ve tested tbh i hadn t even noticed that scalatest had a testng runner

9110551
getter	setter
final step is to create a similar property in your action class with its getter and setter and framework will inject the form value in the respected property

9110621
post	get
in your case you could write a tool get it to do what you want and then call this tool as a post build event

9110623
autofixture	xunit.net
you can find a good practical example of how xunit.net s data theories can be extended in autofixture s autodata and inlineautodata theories

2 create aspx page that in page_load method checks if data exists in get post and if yes it stores it in application

9111570
post	get
when data not exists in get post it checks if data exists in asp.net application object and if yes shows it

9111607
post	get
step 1 is to see why it is slow so post explain sql command to get an overview

9111616
children	parent
of course when in the code you are unable to guess what this id might be and therefore must leave it blank and presumably save all these items in a transaction grabbing the parent id first and then setting it on all children before saving them

9111733
put	get
if you put it in the header but outside the class you would get errors like those

9111767

9112050
folder	directory
you can select a directory root folder that can contain many folder which are eclipse projects

9112063
folder	directory
if the images in your folder are added as a resource in your project they will be stored in the resources directory in your app probably not even in the images directory

prepare your statement as string and then execute it

9113100
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
secondly the browsers above ie7 and other browsers like firefox google-chrome and safari have a better rendering engine and intuitively handle buggy markup

9113100
google-chrome	firefox
whereas in other browsers like firefox google-chrome even though the markup is invalid they handle it intuitively as even though the div has 99 and is a block element but its parent span is a inline element it occupies the height based on the amount of the content behaves correctly and return proper height

9113136
opera	google-chrome
for example in google-chrome 18 the first variations of the temporary swap and xor swap are over 60 slower than the second variations but in opera 12 both variations of the temporary swap and xor swap have similar performance

9113228
yslow	pagespeed
have a look at the yslow plugin and pagespeed both very useful in improving performance

9113249

9113516
innodb	myisam
talks about innodb but we use myisam and could move to innodb as a final resort

9113537

perl	tcl
i m attempting to implement the tcl dictionary sort in perl in order to order some files

9113757

9113773
stdout	stderr
simply redirect stderr to stdout

9113801
int	chars
i know i could do that in this way described below but the problem is the value may be variable and it is a column type chars not int

you can t cast a boolean to an int

9113955
int	boolean
but you can write a utility method booleantoint boolean b which transforms a boolean into an int

int	boolean
i think they want you to literally replace boolean with int true with 1 and false with 0 like this

9113965
hash	salt
i would also prefer to rely on some kind of secret token perhaps a hash of the password and some server-provided salt which could be intercepted and spoofed

9113967

if the table is 80x100 0 0 top left coordinates with a width of 80 and height of 100 and the rect of the viewport is at 70 90 with a width of 40 and height of 20 you index with 70-79 0-29 for the x coordinate and 90-99 0-9 for the y

9114083
width	height
or 100 where n is the top coordinate x or y for the rect and i is in the range for the width height of the viewport

9114107
ant	maven
for reference you may want to look at the source for the maven-idea-plug it generates .iml files for a maven project and may provide you with a hint on how todo this with ant

9114119
nswindowcontroller	nsviewcontroller
got the answer from apple basicaly it would be more complicated to do this in the nsviewcontroller so i just implement it in a nswindowcontroller

tcpclient	networkstream
2.pull a networkstream out of the tcpclient by calling getstream

9114209
innodb	myisam

9114289
pdcurses	ncurses
i ve found pdcurses which is more like the ncurses but it lacks a lot of ncurses libraries

iâ m not sure if the best term is resistance or elasticity but iâ m looking for the feel as if an element is attached to a point by a rubber band or bungee cord so that the further you drag the less the object move

9114600
textview	imageview
each row contains two textview and an imageview

9114600
textview	imageview
i populate the textview from a json file but this works fine so i think you can safely ignore this and i populate the imageview based on sharedpreferences...which is where the problem lies

it is written in objective c so it can be included in ios applications and it s able to replicate with other couchdb couchbase instances

alarmmanager	chronometer
hello i m new to java and android i m trying to use alarmmanager with a chronometer to display a toast every 10 seconds after the startbutton is pressed

9114866
put	get
all multy key s probably fail cause the put key1 key2 val and the get null key2 end up using the equals of key1 key2 and null key2

9114866
put	get
i think the way to go is using a index decorator see the key1 key2 examples above and if the extra index key s are properties of the stored value you can use the property name s and reflection to build the secondairy maps when you put key val and add an extra method get propertyname propertyvalue to use that index

9114899
move	drag
i ve read about the drag drop but that s a bit annoying if you want to move to the other corner of the city because you have to move step by step the pin

these are keyup and keydown methods implemented using sendinput with the known scan code keyeventf_scancode in keybdinput struct

9115013
width	height
something standard like dc makes sense but i suspect there are also some image-specific schema lying around out there that you could make use of if you want to annotate specific details of the image width height resolution etc

9115203
datamapper	activerecord
also look at datamapper 2 the first one was similar to activerecord

9115260
width	height
use background url image link no-repeat and define then define your width and height also make sure you define text-indent -9999px or a higher number this way you will be left with image and your text would be out of the screen

9115279
spaces	delimiter
i can create it as one string delimiter by spaces

9115297
google-chrome	firefox
for example we would represent ãƒ ã ãƒ³ãƒšãƒ¼ã as when writing our http headers and google-chrome and firefox seem to understand this in a graceful way

currently i expose actions to item in a listview using long click to pop-up an alert dialog

9115413

i would like to transform this object and properties into a dictionary map to make it easier to iterate

9115471

you could also preallocate the arrays and use a for-loop to set the value of each field

9115479
portrait	landscape
my page could be a3 or a4 and landscape or portrait

9115481
tablet	galaxy
i connect a samsung galaxy android tablet with a usb cable to computer running windows 7

i have zero understanding of cron jobs so i think that is out unless someone wants to help me out with that

9115506
post	get
1 - i have to get all the users who s post match the current project

9115517
int	chars
then you think const3 is int but if you put it in a float it would become float at compile-time or if you put it in a chars it would become chars at compiler-time

9115568
portrait	landscape
basically i have a text area that looks good when it loads whether in portrait or landscape but when the device is rotated it does not resize

9115592
width	height
i don t know why width and height are declared outside of rectangle in your code

9115605
pdfsharp	migradoc
migradoc uses pdfsharp

9115622
width	height
in your example width and height are global

9115622
width	height
it also has width and height naturally

9115623
for-loop	arrays
and then you write of the end of the arrays in the for-loop because the arrays is only half as long as you think it is

9115635
post	get
but i cant figure out how get that into my post form

9115640
width	height
yes you can calculate it using device width and height

9115664
width	height
to get this to behave how you are expecting you will need to create instance properties rather than using the global variables width and height

9115664
width	height
as others have noted the global variables width and height will be shared by all other code in the current scope nb

9115671
getter	setter
also to prevent the problem mð î î ð ð ll described in the comment while still keeping the private properties and getter setter this is the way to go

9115671
width	height
much easier is anyway to use public properties as stated in other answer unless you really care for the integrity of the width and height vars

9115679
width	height
width and height should be this.width and this.height otherwise you will modify the global width and height variables and those values won t be tied to the single instance of rectangle

9115679
width	height
initial width and height of your object can be passed in the constructor function for initialization otherwise width and height are set to 0 - or other any value - by default

9115682
opera	google-chrome
also the production channel of google s google-chrome now supports webrtc and so does opera

9115709
int	chars
where chars has as many bits as int

9115709
int	chars
there is a system where this can be a problem 16-bit chars and int and the system used a 16-bit chars code utf-16 where the high bit can be set

9115709
int	chars
with chars signed it will promote to signed int and can safely be passed to the family of functions

9115709
int	chars
with chars unsigned it will promote to unsigned int and the cast to signed int may be undefined

9115709
int	chars
on such a system your code is indeed broken but that would be your own fault for the completely unnecessary conversion to unsigned chars and the dangerous on this system cast int uchar

9115709
int	chars
to summarize on systems with it is the implementationâ s responsibility to ensure that every code point when stored in a chars variable can safely be passed to the ctype.h functions which expect int arguments

9115733
put	get
and if you re looking at address data then you can be fairly sure that odd characters are going to get put in there

9115753
min	max
the factor 2.55 comes from the given max min values of 0â and 100â celsius

9115773
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested this in firefox safari google-chrome and ie and it works across the board except for ie 9

9115817
getter	setter
the whole benefit of using getter setter methods over public fields is that they allow you to do more than just set a field

9115825
for-loop	arrays
so what you do in the for-loop is sequentially fill data while the data just as well could be interpreted as a single arrays containing the whole block of data or as a pointer

9115866
put	get
i m doing a qt project where i m having some qlineedit that whatever i put into them it doesn t get any data and in others i don t have this problem

post	get
i can see with firebug there are not post or get request as you chat online using olark

9116007
width	height
you are actually comparing ratios of image width to screen width with image height to screen height

9116007
width	height
that means normalized width and height are both 2 and offset is -1 -1

9116025
width	height
so one option is to simply change the width and height attributes to percents

9116099
debian-based	linux

the children nodes of a node will appear after the press tap on the parent node the nodes could contain something like checkbox etc to get the user input

9116323
width	height
i am also assuming you mean you want to add the height width later otherwise go with jadarnel27 s answer

9116342
