4320289
int	chars
look for sscanf or atoi as functions to convert from a string array of chars to an int

4320299

int	chars
when you cast a chars which is what token is to int you get its ascii value in c - which is 49.

4320317
post	get
controllers take the get and post requests and make the calls needed for a view to print the result often checking the parameters and multiplexing multiple model calls to get all of the appropriate data

4320317
put	get
models get and put data

4320317
put	get
controllers just get and put they neither generate html output nor access the data directly and models are mostly sql or other forms of getting data and stuffing it into something structured

4320323
post	get
i am going to answer you here on your original question try not to post duplicates - if your question does not get answered there is probably a reason

4320337
queue	fifo
so perhaps a better way to describe this data structure would be a queue fifo with the possibility of removing items mid-queue

4320344
ssl	https
this is conceptually similar to the way that https connections work over web proxies - the browser just says connect me to this destination and establishes an ssl connection with the desired endpoint

ant	maven
maybe ant or maven can help you

4320423
client-side	server-side
unfortunately actual usage has never quite replaced the character for this function and it is poorly supported by server-side code including asp.net which limits the ability of client-side code to adopt it pretty much no browser does

4320442
pbkdf2	salt	hmac	pbkdf2
use pbkdf2 with two different salt to generate two different keys - first the data is encrypted using cbc with the first key and then a hmac is calculated over the ciphertext using the second key

4320813
spweb	spsite
now this is a bit confusing but a spsite represents a site collection and a spweb represents a single site

4320813
sharepoint	spsite	spweb	spsite
say you have a sharepoint site on hxxp sharepointsite.com well the site collection spsite would be hxxp sharepointsite.com and a spweb would be hxxp sharepointsite.com blog or hxxp sharepointsite.com about

4320813

assuming you are using a qtableview or qtablewidget for your table you can receive a qt-signal whenever the set of selected cells has changed by doing this

4321311
mouse	keyboard
note that that will work whether the selection was changed via the mouse keyboard or some other means

4321311
qtableview	qmouseevent	superclass	subclassing
if you really need the callback only when the selection was made via a qmouseevent you could probably implement that by overriding qtableview mousepressevent and or qtableview mousereleaseevent in a subclassing and setting a flag to true before calling up to the superclass and setting it false again afterwards and checking the flag within your selectionwaschanged slot

4321325

i m very curious about the community s opinions on server side frameworks like django and ror versus client side frameworks like sproutcore and extjs

4329168
direct3d	directdraw
the device i am working on is a custom framework where direct3d is not an option though i do have information from the board manufacturer that directdraw is supported and 2d hardware acceleration is available so that shouldn t be an issue

keydown	onkeyup	keydown	keyup	keyup	onkeydown	onkeyup	onkeydown
keydown onkeydown and keyup onkeyup issues

4329359
width	height
instead of doing width and height attributes i think you can just set width 33 via css and have the scaling happen automatically regardless of the browser window size

4329454
ubuntu	linux
i am running linux ubuntu with an x86 processor

4329469
whenever	capistrano

sqldf	plyr
in the first example from fastest to slowest we get data.table plyr merge and sqldf whereas in the second example sqldf aggregate data.table and plyr -- nearly the reverse of the first one

4329527
sqldf	plyr
in the first example sqldf is 3x slower than data.table and in the second its 200x faster than plyr and 100 times faster than data.table

4329554
subtraction	add
can i check if a number is even or odd by using add and subtraction

4329587
implements	extends
and classes that extends proxy that implements the functions needed for for each loops

4329588
folder	directory
because these files are placed in the tools directory they are only visible to executables in that folder all other apps on your system will continue to use the winsock dll in your system32 folder

4329592
put	get
i also tried to put a try catch block around the code to see if i could get the error

4329622
gridview	repeater
basically when in a repeater of any kind which a gridview is the names are no longer all the same from the group property as a result of the way asp.net names things inside a repeater essentially each control gets a prefix to make it unique

4329626
children	parent
i m looking for a way to achieve the inverse so the children layouts would override specific blocks of the parent similar to django templates

4329626
children	parent
that way if i wanted to add that footer i would just change the parent and the children would continue to override just the content

4329657
google-chrome	safari
webkit supports it so it is possible in safari and in google-chrome

4329679
division	modulo
okay you re not specifying which operators you can use but since you mentioned in one comment that you only really abhor division and modulo i propose this

4329735
textinput	textfield
method in the autocomplete component textinput is my textfield

4329767
devise	cancan
typically you could use devise for authentication and cancan for authorization

4329909
hash	md5
i am looking to encrypt hash passwords to md5 or sha-256 preferably sha-256

4329927
hash	salt
if you re not familiar with it salt is a set of random bits that are included as an input to the hashing function which goes a long way to thwart dictionary attacks against a hash password using a rainbow table

4329971
internationalization	localization
i am going to be disabling the localization internationalization plugins on the website which is going to change every single page s url on the website from to the en portion is being stripped out

4329993
super	implements
if you implements clone clonable in the correct way you will not have any super class problem

4330013
printf	strcpy	printf	strlen	strlen	strcpy
this will cause printf and every other string-using function like strlen strcpy etc. to run off the end of the string into unallocated heap memory or stack memory depending on how you resolve the uninitialized pointer issue

4330043
post	get
basically the first from gives us a stream which we use for the async post in the first let the third from will ignore the result of the upload thus strangely named variable _ and finally the last from simply subscribes to the result of the get response

4330057
google-chrome	firefox
seems to just be with ie as google-chrome and firefox work fine without the addclass

4330057
google-chrome	firefox
you can verify in this fiddle that firefox and google-chrome are fine

4330073
folder	directory
for example if file1.xls then it will be moved to a directory s folder a

4330073
folder	directory
if file2.xls then it will be moved to a directory s folder b

4330100
int	chars
main.cpp in function int sdl_main int chars

4330104
passenger	thin
so it turns out to be phusion passenger or nginx depending on how you look at it - and thin as well that doesn t add a date http response header combined with what i see as a bug in .net httpwebrequest in my situation there s no if-modified-since thus date shouldn t be necessary leading to the problem

4330108
mouseup	mousedown
you might need to check other events also mousedown mouseup etc

4330116
rss	feed
so i have an iphone app that consist of a tabbarcontroller 5 tableviews one for each rss feed and a webview to show the selected news post

4330135
post	get
while the xml can get verbose you should be able to construct the xml using stringbuilder and then use a simple http client like the apache httpclient to construct a post request to a url using

4330170
fadein	fadeout
essentially i want the text to fadein delay for a 3 seconds and then fadeout

4330208
dictionary	map
heres the dictionary based indexing map based on dan d

4330222
maven	pom.xml
so basically i need something which is effectively like declaring a for maven to build and in that same pom.xml declaring a on that same module which needs to be built

4330223
children	parent
in derived type models everything about the parent is guaranteed to be true about the children lsp in this composed type model everything about the children is guaranteed to be true about the parent. instead of new dog animal new cat animal it s new dog cat catdog so you get a new construction of all statements that are true about cats and dogs

4330236
textarea	pre
internet explorer ... the values normal and pre behave like pre-wrap on textarea elements

4330236

.htaccess	httpd.conf
we have a similar thing working on our virtual machines where we redirect anything.usertld to a folder for that domain that was in httpd.conf tried in in the .htaccess and like yours it didn t work

4330261
min	max
if so max and min ok

4330309
jar	war
you may want to have that top-level project be the parent of both the war project and of the jar projects that are dependencies in the war

4330326
packets	pcap
i wrote a very simple c program to do a packets capture using pcap

4330344
int	chars
finally shorts int and longs must all be made up of an integral number of chars

4330344
int	chars
if you were to port a c++ compiler to them you could legally decide to have 9 bits in a chars 18 in both short and int and 36 in long

4330369
post	put
following on the logic in 1 you need to post the message using postthreadmessage to put it in the thread s message queue

4330379
selecteditem	selectedindex
this limitation may seem a bit strange but it simplifies the logic as now selecteditem has a one-to-one correspondence with selectedindex for items in the list

4330411
multiplication	modulo	division	multiplication	division	modulo
they are arithmetic operators equivalent to multiplication or division by a power of 2 modulo some weirdness about how c treats negative numbers

4330416
google-chrome	safari
safari same as google-chrome as they are both webkit.

4330438
min	max
2. re-size the data based on new max and min coordinates for x and y

4330438
min	max
this needs to be reproducible when re-sized across a spectrum of possible max and min values

4330439
rss	feed
i have to parse a rss feed and display the same in android

4330439
rss	feed
also changing the rss feed is not an option.

4330456
wcf	openrasta	asp.net-mvc	openrasta
in my opinion openrasta s strong focus on resources means it s much closer to roy fielding s original vision for restful architecture than many of the multi-purpose web http frameworks including wcf and asp.net asp.net-mvc

4330493
post	get
written directly into the post so i may have got a couple of the parameters wrong but you get the idea

4330496
rss	feed
move the five rss feed from the tab bar to the left tableview the user can then select the rss feed which will push the rss feed into the left tableview

4330518
maven	pom.xml
in case it helps anyone here s the full maven 2 pom.xml of project 2 in the accepted answer

4330560
for-loop	loops
and as a matter of fact it gives better performance than the explicit c-style for-loop as others benchmarks have shown because perl is able to do the counting loops in nice efficient internal code

4330586
hash	salt
don t use a simple hash or even a salt hash

4330604
ubuntu	linux
my operation system is linux ubuntu and my processor is x86

4330620
children	parent
that way if i wanted to add that footer i would just change the parent and the children would continue to override just the content

4330713
factories	presenter
autofac s delegate factories are a true joy here since you can just inject a delegate into the presenter and autofac will automagically wire it up as if it were a factories pseudocode follows

4330728
width	height
i need to render the value of the width or height of a 2d geometry object and the request is for it to not just be text but somewhat like a dimension that would be a set of building plans

4330754
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this working proposal is supported in recent firefox google-chrome and safari

4330765
children	parent
i have a parent with many children which is fine

4330786
put	get
if you intend for getoffset to be a property you need to put in the get and set keywords

4330789
hash	md5
result â s arg parameter value is the temporary hash placeholder for â s output md5 i believe that the template class reserves until later

4330798
free	malloc
you need the same number of free calls as malloc calls

4330802
parallels	bootcamp
the harder ways are to use bootcamp or a virtual machine like parallels to run windows xp with ie6 or attempt use winebottler to run ie6 without windows

4330810
children	parent
parent must exist before they have children

4330834
glassfish	resin
fyi atmosphere run on top of resin glassfish and jetty

4330855
vbscript	jscript
you can use the jscript vbarray object to get at these bytes in ie without using vbscript

4330927
post	put
in this blog post the call to authorizepayment was put on hold until the updated bundle is available

4330997
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m getting a sort of glow-y blueish rollover highlighting of my yui menu items when i m in safari and google-chrome but not firefox

4331021
unsigned	short
java has no concept of unsigned so the unsigned short option maps to simply signed short which is 16 bits or +32767

4331108
.htaccess	httpd.conf
if i set the header in the httpd.conf or .htaccess like this it works

4331169
getter	setter
then we run into the whole getter and setter debate and in the context of this application the fields of my data objects should only be modified by these xml messages not anywhere else

4331188
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
works great in firefox safari and opera but not in ie or google-chrome

4331213
int	double
you will occasionally need to add these modifiers as 5 is considered an int in this case and 3.0 is a double

4331246
rel	attr
i m trying to get the rel attr from a set of links in a slider to then use as the text for the control

4331249
min	max
that s a width of 8 min value is 0001-01-01 and max is 9999-12-31

4331249
min	max
also a width of 8 min value is 1753-01-01 and max is 9999-12-31

4331313
hash	salt
most posts you find online will talk about ascii encoding the salt and hash but that is not needed and only add unneeded computation

4331313
hash	salt
below are a few functions that will generate the salt compute the hash and verify the hash against a password

4331313
hash	salt
the password can then be hash using the salt with the function below

4331313
hash	salt
the salt is concatenated to the password and then the hash is computed

4331315
public	protected
on the other hand if you really want to expose the protected members of a class i would try using public members and returning a reference to the protected through it

4331328
integer	fractions
c# performs integer division truncating the fractions portion

4331333
integer	fractions
any int int int divided by int results in integer division which discards any fractions remainder losing precision

4331334
rss	feed
on my test site the rss xml feed is parsed and displayed properly

4331445
getter	setter
then there is no need to call .replace .text is a both a getter and a setter so you can just pass view summary to .text and it will change the element s text

4331450
post	get
when i perform the post i get a response from the server with the post id but it doesn t look like i can make modifications with it

4331476
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
i have a uinavigationcontroller with a uinavigationbar that changes title as you switch from one view to the next

4331476
navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller
the first time and the first time only that i call navigationcontroller pushviewcontroller loginviewcontroller animated yes the login view comes in and the login title appears on the nav bar only after the view has fully appeared

4331490
vim	emacs
if i were you i would edit the question and only ask for answers from people who are equally proficient with eclipse intellij vs etc as they are with vim emacs

4331494
google-chrome	firefox
the below example is working in google-chrome but fails in ie 7 and firefox

4331499
google-chrome	safari
however in google-chrome and safari the list items have a strange jump-glitch on hover such that it appears the hidden nested span is actually being displayed as block but not floated as it should

4331557
uiview	subviews
device window - nav tab bar controller - table view controller s - subviews uiview

4331576
subtract	addition	subtract	add
in addition it appears that the variable chance is not really used since you first subtract it and then add it back again

4331605
rss	icalendar
most icalendar .ics based calendars on the web expect to be used in a polling type fashion similar to rss or atom in which a client will periodically check to see if any changes have been made and if so download the new content accordingly

4331637
superclass	subclassing
if the subclassing has access to the state of the superclass it can implement writeobject and readobject to save and restore that state

4331653
super	implements
as far as serialization process is concerned the state belongs in the super class that does not implements serializable

4331699
width	height
originally the chessbutton s wouldn t appear unless i moused over them but i solved that problem by placing each chessbutton inside a separate jpanel and setting each button s setpreferredsize to a set height and width

4331702
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
your problem is that your for-loop is going from 0 to count inclusive but your node data arrays isn t defined at data count its only defined up to data count-1 so the last iteration of your that loops always gets garbage which sometimes might be non-zero and not show up but othertimes might be random characters

4331796
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationitem
you ll have to manually manage its stack of uinavigationitem s but if you do that right then you can get about the same behavior out of it as you would with a uinavigationcontroller

4331825
post	get
the easiest way to get around this is to data-bind your dropdown list in code only when it needs to be bound like when the page is first loaded and not on post back

4331839
puts	gets	for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
gets chars from the user puts it into a pointer arrays using a while loops nested in a for-loop

4331841
inherited	properties
if it works at all it s only because the framework is doing things in a specific order that happens to make it work first the properties is inherited from the parent control then bindings are applied and the properties change caused by the binding doesn t trigger the binding to run again

4331848
getter	setter
dtos are dumb objects composed of public getter setter

4331898
folder	directory
it works perfectly if the files you are copying from and the folder you are copying to are located within the codeigniter install directory

4331927
width	height
again i want to be able to create a datagrid-like control that even supports cell borders and cell widths and height should be connected to the other controls width + allow resize

4331927
width	height
but remember the cells height and width has to be dynamic and individual to specific columns rows

4331927
width	height
in reference to this question i created it in a slightly different way having a third control for cells but the question is still the same i want the height width of the columns and cells to be dynamic and give the user ability to resize them affecting each other

4331939
post	get
all i m trying to accomplish is to get the id that was passed in the url which in the controller i m grabbing that id and putting it in the viewdata and set the parentid property of my object for the post so that it will save it when the object is returned to me

4331959
width	height
originally the chessbuttons wouldn t appear unless i moused over them but i solved that problem by placing each chessbutton inside a separate jpanel and setting each button s setpreferredsize to a set height and width

4331980
floating-point	integer
integer versus floating-point can also be done using typeof

4331984
int	chars
others have already told you some specific problems with your code but one thing they seem to have missed is that c should be an int not a chars

4331996
cpu	processors
processors #1 name intel r xeon r cpu e5405 2.00ghz

4331999
for-loop	loops
as for the number of iterations if your for-loop is of the form constant n and m then max 0 m-n loops are executed if x is not changed in loops and no weird stuff overflow hidden casts of negative numbers to unsigned etc. occurs

4332050
twitter	myspace
can any one give me link for api s to post messages over twitter facebook myspace social media

4332058
ant	maven
the how to use wiki page of the project i wrote explains if for using a maven as well as an ant or eclipse based build

4332069
expander	grid
i used a grid to put the icon in the top right corner of the expander

4332105
width	height
according to this blog just add the x y width and height to grab the full desktop

4332210
rtp	rtsp
i have setup darwin streaming server the open sourced rtp rtsp streaming server and successfully played a video on my adp2 phone with donut image using rtsp url

4332219
for-loop	loops
actually i would probably code the inner while loops as a for-loop on i like so

4332291
addition	multiplication
we can optimize the calculation of by observing that the bitwise-or is equivalent to addition refactoring to caching the values of and between iterations and using shifts instead of multiplication

4332299
mouseover	mouseout
if you remove the image1 class from the element on a mouseover then that element won t be matched by the .image1 selector for the mouseout

4332301
mouseover	mouseout
the .hover function lets you specify both mouseover mouseout at the same time and you need to make a function for the setinterval

4332352
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i also have .js files being redirected to javascript engines as well for main.js in google-chrome it tries main.v8.js in safari main.nitro.js in firefox main.gecko.js

4332380
ddms	adb
you ll want to find the stacktrace from the crash you can get this with logcat either open the logcat view in eclipse or open the ddms perspective or run adb logcat from the shell to see the log

4332440
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
you have to stick either with visual studio or give sharpdevelop or monodevelop a try

4332441
udp	tcp
you could have a look at soatest which claims to be socket based and should be able to use whichever web protocol you are using hopefully tcp udp

4332482
profiler	yourkit
there are tools like yourkit java profiler that help you to identify such leaks

4332485
admob	inmobi
i am addind adds in my application using inmodi and admob adds inmobi adds not connect some problem

4332514
postgresql	mysql
sqlite fine for now but mysql or postgresql would be great

4332537
perforce	svn	perforce	cvs	cvs	svn
since perforce is less commonly used compared to cvs svn amongst bamboo users we generally get less feedback about it and hear less about existing issues

4332614
expander	togglebutton
it is because of the default template of the expander togglebutton contentpresenter

4332631
addition	multiplication
however it s still constant time - at most it s going to do one comparison one addition and one multiplication

4332717
free	malloc
a key distinction from malloc is that you never need to call free rather you just allow the last reference to it to evaporate and the garbage collector will reclaim its storage eventually

4332728
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
set the width and height margin and padding in pixels

4332756
put	get
i used the method of using sub-queries on my database to put together a list of bulletins replies count the number of reply likes and dislikes and get a particular users rating

4332792
clang	llvm
one of clang particular interests wrt optimization is that you can emit the optimized llvm ir code instead of machine code

4332793
java.util.calendar	simpledateformat
well personally i d use joda time and its localdate class if you really only want to maintain the date rather than java.util.calendar but if you do want to use calendar you need a simpledateformat

4332944
google-chrome	firefox
does not work on google-chrome ie firefox

4332959
gmail	hotmail
the e-mails get received on gmail and others as far as i m aware the only real problems i ve had is when sending the e-mails to a hotmail or yahoo account

4332962
postgresql	mysql
unnormalized data in mysql postgresql

4332962
postgresql	mysql
mysql postgresql is still pretty fast and allows free form queries thanks to the usual b+tree indexes

4332979
gmail	hotmail
sometimes you might face that you sent to two email addresses in different domain say gmail and hotmail one got delivered other not

4333016
put	get
absolutely only the compiler docs and or source code can tell you the chance of that though you can put some performance checks into nightly test runs so you ll get alerted if performance suddenly changes

4333029
cpu	processors
on 1 processors the computation will be doing a lot of data movement between cpu cache and ram

4333029
cpu	processors
on 8 processors the computation will only have to move data between cpu and cache

4333030
versioning	upgrade
however if i open the project properties in the upgrade versioning go to the compile tab and change the function returning intrinsic value type without return value option from none to warning then i can build the project again

4333045
ssl	https
and always test to see if your request was done through https don t test for port numbers to determine ssl

4333052
emacs	aquamacs
i m using aquamacs and started the emacs server with m - x server-start

folder	directory
the directory structure is followed for the most part by all applications because artifacts are defined primarily by their root folder

4333096
getter	setter
add getter and setter

4333114
vim	emacs
failing that a powerful text editor like vim or emacs will get the job done

4333126
mouseover	mouseout
i changed hover to mouseover since hover triggers twice once on mouseover and once on mouseout which seems not to be what you want

4333144
hide	show
calling show hide in showevent hideevent doesn t make sense - those events are the result of show hide calls and the like not the trigger

4333174
cldc	midp
using this approach may allow you to make your application to be depend only on midp cldc profiles thus to be easier portable to other phones at least in theory

4333177

versioning	upgrade
i support an application written in delphi 3 and i would like to put in some improvements to the source code while waiting for the opportunity to upgrade it to a newer versioning of delphi

4333863
getter	setter
is really supposed to declare setter getter methods for age ivar but that line will give compiler error as you can t declare property with retain attribute for non-object types see docs for more details

4333863
getter	setter
this line does not differ much from the 1st one - it also declares setter and getter methods for popovercontroller ivar and automatically synthesized setter will retain popovercontroller it gets

rank	max
ok i m making a game poker card evaluator and i am storing its values in list of list and each list is containing the values like the rate rank max or just 1 2 3 so my question is if i want to know which players has good hand mean good list for example by comapring list to list if rate1 rate2 list2 in the list of lists then i have to check is their rank are also same if that condition also true then i have to go to next value in the same list and check with the other list having same first two values

4334397
rank	max
if both lists are equal then we say they are equal else we find the greater one rate rank or max

there is the possibility to hash passwords preferably with a salt

4334876
int	double
you should always keep in mind that a pointer conveys two pieces of information the type of the pointed data int double ... which specifies how to interpret it and the address of the data it points to which specifies where you can get the actual value of the pointed data

4334876
int	double
the type information is in the type of the pointer double int ... while the address of the data is the actual value contained in the pointer variable

4334876

chars is an int type same in that regard as int short and other int types

4337252
int	chars
chars just happens to be the smallest int type

4337252
integer	unsigned
so just like any other integer type it can be signed or unsigned

4337252
int	chars
but chars in c are represented by their int codes so there s nothing unusual in the fact that an int type chars is used to serve that purpose

4337252
int	chars
the only general difference between chars and other int types is that plain chars is generally not synonymous with signed chars while with other int types the signed modifier is optional implied

4337679
int	double
so searching for the number 1 int double etcetera is not the same as searching for 1 string

4337680
for-loop	arrays
in the arrays case the easiest way to retain the index is to simply use a vanilla for-loop

4337684
unsigned	short
an unsigned char is an unsigned value which is typically smaller than and is guaranteed not to be bigger than a short

4337691
nunit	mstest
fortunately most of the functionality in nunit can be replicated in mstest without too much hassle

4337700
ienumerable	ienumerator
it works with any type that exposes ienumerable or implements a getenumerable method and uses the returned ienumerator to iterate over the items in the collection

4337706
ienumerable	ienumerator
likewise the collection can have a method called getenumerator which returns a type with the appropriate members but without any implementation of ienumerable ienumerator in sight.

4337715
int	double	int	chars
default promotions of small types chars short and float up to at least int double always apply

4337724
folder	directory
when i looked at the created directory you dont see a share icon on the folder but it is indeed shared

4337758
invalidoperationexception	argumentexception
connection.open can throw invalidoperationexception and argumentexception in addition to sqlexception

4337772
post	get
the answers i got on that post might help you get on your way

4337790
post	put
you should make a partial and put that post logic inside of it

4337812
ssl	ntlm
i can also authenticate via the os x mail.app application using the identical host username password account type imap port 143 ssl false authentication ntlm domain name

4337815
google-chrome	safari
that being said ie google-chrome and safari all support the onselectstart event which is cancellable

4337815
opera	firefox
for firefox opera and other browsers however there s no solution other than cancelling mousedown double click and key events

4337839
google-chrome	firefox
this works in ie and firefox but in google-chrome it still scrolls up nonetheless.

4337862
pop-up	dialog
a dialog pop-up and should show the location of the file

4337914
multiplying	add
if it s stored as a binary integer then read the bytes in to an array or read them one by one then multiplying by powers of 256 and add together

4337941
phpmyadmin	heidisql
my advice is that you find another sql client such as heidisql and try to repair the phpmyadmin database

4337942
int	boolean
my first instinct is to use boolean as my solution so that it truly acts as a flag but i have coworkers who have suggested using enums or int as more of a status rather then a flag

4337945
fast-forward	merge
rebase against master one final time then do a normal fast-forward merge which essentially brings all your branch s commits into master one by one

4338046
stdout	stderr
doing this doesn t require installing any utilities and works without redirecting stderr to stdout

4338055
google-chrome	firefox
but then when the data replace is completed the link color turns back into blue even though before it was black and this only happens in firefox not in ie or google-chrome

4338057
getter	setter
not sure if this is a getter or a setter either

4338078
hide	show
you can hide and show divs based on your choice that would be simplest way to do that

4338090
httphandler	httpmodule
when the iis server receives a http request it goes through series of objects httpapplication httpruntime httpmodule httphandler

4338090
ready	each
the page object is created for each request and disposed off when the runtime is ready to render the html

4338143
datamapper	activerecord
from my point of view the datamapper model is much easier to grasp but since activerecord is the defacto standard it feels weird to change the orm just for this little problem

4338212
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in google-chrome firefox and ie

4338214
firefox	safari
in some browsers like firefox it s extremely slow while in others mostly newer versions of safari on snow leopard it s perfect

4338247
inherited	properties
you can then set a value for that properties on the owner object textbox in this case and then access the inherited value on any element inside the tooltip

4338259
memcached	apc
the framework however does have memcached and apc options for caching installed but even with apc or memcached on it doesn t make a big enough difference.

4338326
ready	each
i m performing a lot of dom manipulations such as moving images within divs that are positioned below each other into a stacking order and moving all divs off stage w e of one .the external js file uses the ready event the js file is included in the head after the css file

4338326
firefox	safari
what i m finding using firefox and safari single stepping are that operations on the dom are taking place as the code is executing

4338326
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
therefore what i see is clean rendering in firefox safari and google-chrome in both osx and xp

4338353
submit	submission
i have been using the below code to automatically print out a form on submission but the problem i have encountered is that upon navigating away from the page the submit - and print button stops working

4338356
google-chrome	firefox
tested in firefox google-chrome 7

4338386
jquery	simplemodal
i am using jquery and simplemodal in c# vs2010 .net 4.0

4338386
post	get
my solution for the project i m working on now is to use a jquery ajax call to pass all the form data to the server and get back the validation results before allowing the post to proceed

4338410
ant	maven
use the java_home variable in your path variable as well that way you only have to change the java_home which is used in many projects anyways maven ant etc

4338469
division	multiplication
the cost of those additions on common hardware pales in comparison to that of the trigonometry reverse trig multiplication division and square-root calculations that are common in the arithmetic of sphere geometry

4338593
converter	multibinding
i ve never tried to do something like this before but if i had to i would probably try and use a converter that takes the multibinding and breaks it up and returns a stackpanel of the pieces

4338602
unsigned	short
i would like to cast unsigned int 32bit a to unsigned short int 16bit b in a following way

4338646
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome and safari the left padding on each li item says 10 but it s actually adding a couple extra pixels making padding 12 or 13

4338670
hash	md5
just use md5 its slightly more compact than the proposed rubik states rather fast and has good collision properties - it s not like you have a malicious adversary trying to cause rubik cube hash collisions

4338670
hash	md5
edit using cryptographic hash functions such as md4 md5 is usually simple once you have a library or function implementing the algorithm ex openssl gnu tls and many stand-alone implementations exist

4338688
vbscript	vb6
vb6 vbscript regexes probably don t like s in a character class

4338729
width	height
lwindist and lmaxdepth are the width and height of the rectangle to be displayed in 48ths of an inch if it matters

4338775
x86	64bit
when x86 moved into the 64-realm the i o address space remained at 64kb and they didn t even add the ability to move data in 64bit units.

4338783
width	height
i want a way to update that based on changes in screen width height

4338808
jboss	weblogic
and now it works in tomcat jboss weblogic webrick.

4338893
innodb	myisam
you can use the engine column in the table to see if you re counting on myisam tables the table_rows will be correct then or innodb table_rows will be the estimate used by the optimizer

4338902
min	max
if you re really truly devoted to being too clever by half then ruslik s second suggestion is actually quite beautiful much nicer than a generic min max

4338962
min	max
i know that if i could get that runid i could group by run to get counts averages totals max min etc

4338970
spweb	spsite
also you are referencing an spsite and spweb object without disposing of the object this has inherent performance issues as well

4338973
int	boolean
the type parameter is normally one of the migrations native types which is one of the following primary_key string text int float decimal datetime timestamp time date binary boolean

4338982
calloc	malloc
2 - declare a pointer that will be allocated memory at runtime with malloc or calloc

4339005
inherited	subclassing
dynamic polymorphism in c++ depends on inherited the pointer passed to dowithfoothing may point only to instances of foothing or one of its subclassing

4339008
getter	setter
public getter setter methods or properties are questionable as they primarily expose object state which see item #2 above

4339036
crypt	hash
i use a php script that hash passwords using php s crypt and uses sha512 however when i try to check if sha512 is set i get the above error

4339041
post	put
try this put this code back into an external file make sure you have a valid script include tag per nick s post

4339052
cube	skybox
hy.i drawn a skybox and a few objects inside it every thing is alright except the fact that my objects are deformed by the use of gluperspective which i need to draw the skybox and stuff for example i have a cube but it looks like paralelipipedic long a longer box .now i have read chapter 3 of redbook but i can t figure it out .i have tried using glfrustrum glortho and so but i just can t figure out how to make this work normal

4339070
filtering	grouping
however the where clause is not filtering the data properly for more recent years it only returns records where the parameter grouping is null ie not passed in

4339106
freebsd	linux
i need to know if there are any differences between freebsd and linux in the following categories

4339121
button	checkbox
what s behind the checkbox are colored picturebox es and a button

4339129
dictionary	map
it s easy enough for a caller to write out the dictionary comprehension or map call

4339134
free	malloc
from what i understand because malloc dynamically assigns mem you need to free that mem so that it can be used again

4339134
free	malloc
what happens if you return a char that was created using malloc how are you supposed to free that

4339153
cpu	processors
processors intelâ coreâ 2 duo cpu 2.00ghz 2.00 ghz

4339170
free	malloc
if you malloc you need to free

4339171
free	malloc
yes every call to malloc has to be matched with a call to free

4339176
free	malloc
if you have a pointer to memory created by malloc free ing that memory using that pointer will do the right thing

4339179
free	malloc
if you return a that you know was created with malloc then yes it is your responsibility to free that

4339183
move	drag
i doubt that this is directly relevant to this question but i had a similar problem - my slider could have its value set by my program and it would move but i could not drag and move it

4339206
freebsd	linux
you can set up the registers linux or stack freebsd yourself and then use a syscall by raising an interrupt or just use nasmx s macros to do so in a cross-platform way

4339206
stdout	stderr
stdin stdout and stderr are file descriptors 0 1 and 2 respectively

4339207
post	get
funny thing is in the allow header of response it lists get and post as allowed methods

4339253
post	get
that s working but now i need to get the edit post to send the content back as application json but i m having no luck

4339258
entity-relationship	diagram
if you d like some more in depth analysis try whipping up an entity-relationship diagram

4339340
svg	vml
on the other hand every svg vml element you create is a real element in the dom

4339359
width	height
try changing designheight and designwidth for height and width respectively and also set sizetocontent to none

4339378
width	height
you want width and height

4339425
hex	binary
this will output the data byte-by-byte and let you examine the individual hex values of the binary data

4339451
mouse	keyboard
mouse scrolling hangs up mouse scoll events doesn t work and pressing up arrow key from keyboard solves the problem

4339508
pull	push
nominally the right way to do this in git is to push your code to a stable location github and then have the online server pull from that location

4339517
int	chars
if it s a fixed-row size myisam table which it looks like due to the datatypes in the table then including the chars field even if it s blank will make the table 75 larger on disk 4 bytes per int field 16 bytes whereas the chars 12 would add another 12 bytes

4339532
nagios	mrtg
the closest i ve found is pg_top which i m working on installing grumble grumble and check_postgres.pl which is a back-end to data collection for nagios and mrtg

4339537
innodb	myisam
it s easier if you use mysql over sqlite and if you use innodb tables over myisam tables

4339547
mouse	keyboard
the mouseverticalposition mousehorizontalposition ismousecaptured are assigned in a chart mouse down event and modifierkey is boolean to tell if any of the keyboard modifiers are pressed to know whether or not to move

4339547
move	drag
here is my question is there different way to do the drag move or the resizing adorner class that i am not seeing

4339574
put	get
and once i get a batch put this subset for processing and come back and restart preparing another batch and so on till the end of file is reached

4339593
width	height
you need to have properly height and width for your image e.g 512x512 or 512x1024 so it fills a quad rectangle specified by your gl_texture_crop_rect_oes

4339602
serializable	deserialization
when i do serializable deserialization of single instances of this class sub classes everything works fine

4339602
serializable	deserialization
and on deserialization this is done in the serializable constructor also on the serializationinfo parameter

4339602
serializable	deserialization
deserialization always gives me an array of nulls and as i mentioned earlier a single item serializable and deseriaizes just fine with this code

4339602
serializable	deserialization
deserialization serializable constructor

4339611
post	get
for instance a function that executes a sql query is a sink and get post variables are sources of taint

4339641
xul	xbl
firefox extensions can be written with native platform-specific c++ code but the vast majority are xul and javascript and some xbl for the more advanced extensions

4339662
inherited	properties
i am building an app to store vehicles i have a main form with buttons on it to load individual forms for each type of vehicle car truck bus they all inherited their main properties s from the vehicle class

debian	centos
both debian unstable and centos 4.8

4339697
int	chars
main int argc chars argv

4339744
windows	wow64
the missing subsystem in question is windows on windows 64 wow64 the compatibility layer allowing 32 bit apps to run in the 64 bit os

4339800
fast-forward	merge
or instead since you know this is going to be a fast-forward merge the above is just a safety check you can just update the master to the current commit without checking it out

4339820
hide	show
made a simple script that hide show a hidden div

4339820
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the page automatically adjusts its height on firefox safari and google-chrome

4339829
post	get
and if we try to go to domain.com post we get an error of page not found

4339837
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
use firebug for firefox or the developer tools for google-chrome safari

4339890
post	put
if you put domain.com post it will look for an index.php or index.html for example

4339899
udp	tcp
the text chatroom stuff goes through tcp and works flawlessly while the udp only relays recorded data to other connected clients

4339913
button	checkbox
i append a checkbox and a remove button with an append button

4339913
button	checkbox
checkbox and a remove button

4339913
button	checkbox
the remove button has to remove the checkbox

4339941
pascal	delphi
here is a pretty extensive list of schools that teach either objectpascal delphi or procedural pascal

4339970
packets	multicast
that said you may also have problems with that as some routers that you have no control over will not allow the multicast packets to be forwarded

4339975
post	get
if they have the same name they will only come through as 1 item in the post get

4340010
strstr	substr
there s three that i can think of substr strpos and strstr

4340020
charindex	substr
try a substr with a charindex to find the space

4340027
put	get
this part i understand hibernate put a proxy for address instead of the real target and when i try to get the address from the persisted user object in the checkout.orderservice.ecsetexpresscheckoutcode method i get the lazyinitializationexception

4340055
slideup	slidedown
both slideup and slidedown accept optional callback parameters that execute once the animations are finished

4340121
opencv	cimg	cimg	magick++
having dealt only with static image loading typical of image libraries like opencv cimg or magick++ i m at a bit of a loss how i might best approach the problem

4340122
migrate	upgrade
the framework used to migrate the sqlite schema can also be used to load migrate data during an app upgrade

4340130
wordpress	joomla
i have a joomla plugin which does a one-way single sign-on between joomla and wordpress

4340130
wordpress	joomla
it means the registrations and logins are handled by joomla and every time someone registers in joomla it replicates the user s data into wordpress user tables and everytime someone logs into joomla it writes the user s status as logged in into the wordpress cookie thus the user automatically gets logged into wordpress

4340130
wordpress	joomla
hence i want to divert users from wordpress to joomla pages for login and registration activities

4340137
put	get
if the other process put an exclusive lock on the file then you don t get to read it

4340185
pull	push
example run after a changegroup has been added via push pull or unbundle

4340199
accessor	properties
and for those who prefer . syntax for properties accessor

4340213
folder	directory
so in your example domain.com post you would have a directory folder called post

4340215
stdout	stderr
i am pushing stdout to stderr for the jsl command so it will be displayed in the commit fail

4340224
distance	altitude
i am wanting to use altitude for my y range and distance for my x range

4340263
mef	prism
i ve searched for mef vs unity and i ve found some pros cons but nothing that specifically states whether one is better and i know that is subjective with use in prism

4340318
equals	gethashcode
gethashcode is not and cannot be collision free which is why the equals method is required in the first place

4340345
width	height
however resizing both width and height would result in a stretched image

4340345
width	height
to either resize the width or height depending of what side fits best you may consider a bit of javascript like this

4340366
post	get
so you get the idea behind it the div with id post-number holds a preview of a post and the the div with id post-full-number holds the full content of a post

4340366
hide	show
i don t want to show the preview of a post if the full post is already show - so i simply want to hide it with jquery

4340384
crypt	hash
i have an app that runs on php 5.3 which stores passwords hash using php s crypt function

4340384
crypt	salt
so if i input test with an sha512 salt the encrypted data should be the same when using crypt as well as when using mcrypt

4340396
ostringstream	std
on ideone the ostringstream is about 3 times slower than std copy + back_inserter + std vector and about 15 times slower than memcpy into a raw buffer

4340396
x86	64bit
on my laptop visual c++ 2010 x86 cl ox ehsc windows 7 ultimate 64bit intel core i7 8 gb ram

4340396
g++	gcc
same laptop same os using cygwin gcc 4.3.4 g++ -o3

4340426
hide	show
.toggle will show the div if its hidden and hide it if its visible

4340466
queue	fifo
store samples in a fifo fifo queue

4340480
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i might add that this renders correctly in all desktop browsers supporting the property safari google-chrome firefox etc

4340507
hide	show
if it s a tap show hide the

4340513
hash	md5
as a note i have used guid uuid fields in databases to store md5 hash

4340513
hash	md5
while no longer cryptographically secure 128bit md5 hash are fine for checksums and is much better than 64 bits.

4340622
hash	md5
you can easily use an md5 hash for this but you will have to alter the way it is stored

4340622
hash	md5
a standard char is 8 bits however so 16 characters is exactly enough to store the value of an md5 hash

4340625
jar	war
the data objects are in a separate project jar that the webservice war depends on

4340642
int	double
if has the value of 1291328282 is not a double but an int it looks like a unix_timestamp not to get confused with epoch

4340671
google-chrome	firefox
checked browser versions occurring in google-chrome 7.0.5 and firefox 3.2

4340690
google-chrome	firefox
the script works in firefox and ie but not in google-chrome

4340698
onclick	onchange
use onchange instead of onclick for select lists

4340700
opera	firefox
aligns the should be aligned left centered in ie 6 8 and opera but to the left in firefox 3.6 4 beta and chromium

4340745
winpcap	pcap.net
in my research i have found pcap.net winpcap .net wrapper to be useful because it can build a packet from scratch and it supports modifying all the address fields

4340758
super	self
super setdatasource self doesnt crash but the datasource never gets set

4340775
postgresql	mysql
i m converting a site from mysql to postgresql and have a really weird bug

4340800
jpql	hql
doesn t want to learn any new language hql jpql etc

4340814
sorting	filtering
having a computed column will allow you to page the view while still allowing sorting and filtering on the computed column

4340858
int	double
there s a simple reason why you cannot do that operators are non-virtual the compiler must know at compile time whether p1.x+p2.x is an int addition or a double addition

4340865
pop-up	dialog
no webpage is loaded in the background just a pop-up dialog saying authentication is required and prompts for a username and password

4340898
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
first have an autoresetevent or manualresetevent if you feel like in your test class

4340914
gif	png
what was odd is that my index page page 1 was a png and the other pages were gif

4340923
ssl	https
wireshark has a parser for https tls ssl this will be able to make sense of the plain text part of the handshake

4340939
httpwebrequest	networkcredentials
all you need to do is asign a networkcredentials object to the credentials property of the httpwebrequest object you have created

4340953
subtract	add
just add padding to the top as needed and subtract that value from the height

4341012
multiplying	add
get numbers by multiplying those percentages by 255 3 convert those numbers to base 255 and add zeros as previously mentioned

4341031
for-loop	loops
basically i get a different answer if i use lambda syntax in a foreach loops than if i use it in a for-loop

4341054
submit	submission
with xauth it is as simple as submission username and password and keeping the returned authentication token to submit a tweet

4341065
google-chrome	firefox
still none the wiser about why firefox google-chrome and ie all ignored float left in print though but it s working now

4341144
free	malloc
i wouldn t go so far as to say every malloc must be free but i would say that no matter how long a program runs there must be a bounded number of allocations and total size that won t be free

4341207
doc	rtf
i have a fulltext index on one of my tables which contains some metadata and a document blob pdf or doc or rtf etc

4341242
public	protected
page_load is a protected method and i was using public bindingflags

4341274
fontfamily	font-size
-- i removed that declaration and instead used font-size 11px line-height px fontfamily etc and it fixed the gap

4341287
flac	speex
if you want a free format you should look into vorbis or flac or speex

4341312
des	aes
probably the most normal approach for a diy solution is to encrypt the license file using some standard algorithm like aes 128-bit or triple des

4341336
free	malloc
at the same time nowhere does it make any requirement that memory obtained with malloc should or must be released with free before a call to exit or a return from main and i think it s pretty clear that the intention is that exiting without manually freeing memory will not leave resources tied up - much like how calling exit without closing all files first automatically closes them including flushing them

4341343
put	get
i would like to allow users to log in via windows authentication perhaps through a special page but anonymous users should not get prompted to put in their password ever

4341347
doc	rtf
so while it is possible to re-purpose a pdf doc it will always be easier to do so from an rtf doc

4341407
mri	rubinius	jruby	mri	jruby	rubinius
sequel is tested on mri 1.8 and 1.9 jruby and rubinius so you could try one of them

4341429
ejbql	jpql
i keep reading about them here and there jpql seems to appear slightly more often but frameworks like jboss seam use ejbql everywhere so which one is the one

4341436
min	max	distance	altitude
calculate your min and max distance and use those to set the xrange and calculate your min and max altitude and use those to set the yrange

4341473
postgresql	mysql
to elaborate on the net effect of increased code maintainability with this system then you could actually change out the db mysql to postgresql would still be painful but possible and only need to change one layer of code

4341514
loops	while-loop
then i replaced amro s while-loop with a simple avi production loops as follows

4341569
post	get
this is also sent via post jquery ajax verified via firebug but strangely in the php script that receivices the string if i echo the value passed i get

4341578
children	parent
so i have a parent with some sequenced children and i want to update that parent to have no children

4347033
post	get
see this post for some slick tricks on how to get single random values efficiently

4347045
post	get
i am getting used to the post redirect get pattern i find it a very good procedure and it also seems to get me thinking more about page structure and not relying on asp.net events too often

4347045
post	get
typically in the past i would have expected the typical user experience to be get post post post etc

4347067
getter	setter
see the sections titled avoid internal getter setter and use package scope with inner classes in

4347068
extjs	ext.net
i d like to use ext.net in this application but ext.net works using a set of compiled user controls that basically wrap the extjs ui suite

4347068
extjs	ext.net
i d rather not use use extjs directly - i m looking to expedite delivery and ext.net seems much easier

4347071

4347149
opencart	magento	opencart	oscommerce	magento	oscommerce
with systems like magento and oscommerce there very bulky and poorly coded opencart is a mvc style framework so if you have ever used codeigniter you would know half the system already

4347192
getter	setter
i like using getter and setter even for simple classes because it creates hooks in your code making it easy to extend

4347192
getter	setter
then when i get to the end of my project i ll take a moment and delete the getter and setter i didn t use

4347206
mouseover	mouseout
_this.timer is a shared var that handles the deferred function - it gets cleared up on either mouseout or mouseover

4347210
onmouseover	mouseenter
if you bind events to the onmouseover and onmouseout events in jquery you can then trigger that effect using mouseenter

4347211
getter	setter
you should commit every getter setter or any new method separately

4347284
getter	setter
getter and setter are invoked in this object to populate the values

4347582
portrait	landscape
the result is that when after rotation to landscape mode the user switches to a view that he has already been before which is because of that already initialized the view is presented to him still in portrait mode

4347583
google-chrome	safari
also there is an beforeload event in safari google-chrome that is supposed to fire before an external resource image is loaded so you can probably make more efficient image blocker

4347591
free	malloc
i think that malloc has an internal table and when you release memory with free the cell is just set to busy 0 then the memory is available for other data

4347611

4347725
width	height
width height and the contents of data are all correct as examined in the debugger

4347731

most of the time the salt value is simply prepended to the encrypted value so that the validation code has everything it needs to verify that a challenge password hash to the same value

4347788
stateless	stateful
as for the sessions there are two aspects to consider whether you want a stateless or a stateful session

4347796
min	max
when you do the group by id you may have different timestamps for the same id and have not specified which one to use min max etc a similar problem occurs with the label field

4347796
sorting	grouping
as you are grouping by id and the sorting by timestamp so mysql extracts one timestamp per grouping so an index doesn t really help much

4347858
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome and safari do support it but you have to use their moz webkit stuff to do so

4347891
tabcontrol	tabitem
i have a textbox on a tabitem inside of a tabcontrol

4347902

4347937
profiler	yourkit
hard to beat yourkit java profiler

4347941
cpython	ironpython
my current goal is to query a list on our sharepoint 2007 server from client machines remotely from a program preferably written in ironpython cpython is also fine

also make sure when you deploy php to a new server you have a list of all the packages you installed such as mcrypt pear pecl libraries imagemagick etc

4347983
stdout	stderr
i want to catch all the python output to a string i ve managed by the following redirection to catch pythons stdout and stderr output

4347987
for-loop	loops
but the real bubble sort would take a while loops instead of an outer for-loop and the while loops would execute again only if elements had to be swapped on the last pass like this

4348031
memcached	apc
by using an abstraction layer they are able to deal with multiple different possible configurations another example is caching technology with drivers for apc eacellerator mysql xcache memcached etc

4348044
gson	jackson
so you should be able to force use of something gson recognizes if it does not support iso-8601 format jackson defaults to using

4348044
gson	jackson
also jackson works fine on android if you don t mind using it over gson

4348088
keydown	keyup
i ve tried adding keydown keyup and the preview events to mainwindow and canvas 1 but none of them seem to fire i check with breakpoints

4348105
post	get	action-filter	onactionexecuting
also if your action-filter is performing a post actionresult action such as onactionexecuting you could probably get away with storing something in the route data

4348127
merb	ruby-on-rails
merb-core has been a great home for our application but i m now wondering if we should move elsewhere now that merb ruby-on-rails have merged

4348156
stdout	stderr
the python interpreter will run inside your c++ process so all its output will go to the stderr and stdout of the c++ program itself

4348192
waitpid	fork
i m trying to learn simultaneously fork pipe and waitpid and running into some problems

4348222

4348328
xul	xbl
i found that i need to add it to the xul file so i can use it in the xbl

4348358
hide	show
you can make your app a full gui app and just hide the main window using wxwindow show false

4348413
.htaccess	httpd.conf
somewhere in your httpd.conf site-specific .conf file or a .htaccess put this

4348437
udp	tcp
if i had to guess would need to see your recieving c# code to know it looks like you might be trying to receive udp packets but using tcp protocol on the client side

4348471
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in the browsers that support this functionality firefox 3.6+ google-chrome 7+

4348471
google-chrome	firefox
the only difference between firefox and google-chrome that i m able to spot is that in google-chrome the drop-area-active style is displayed for a split second when the user drops the file

4348472
post	get
if you re assigning this to your params hash on the get or post call or you might be getting converted

4348537
switching	screens	onresume	onpause
by sliding my finger over the screens i switching between different conversations i do this by calling startactivity with the new intent onpause will be called followed by onnewintent in which i do setintent followed by onresume

4348537
onresume	onpause	oncreate	ondestroy
then i change the orientation onpause is called followed by ondestroy at this point getintent returns the correct intent followed by oncreate which has the old intent followed by onresume which also has the old intent

4348537
onresume	onpause	oncreate	ondestroy
i know i can change the launchmode from singletop to standard but this will also affect android 1.6+ which i don t want because with singletop the changing of conversation goes fast only onpause and onresume are called with standard oncreate and ondestroy are also called.

4348569
verilog	vhdl
this is the question as in this question but for vhdl instead of verilog

4348601
width	height
the issue is if you can independently change the width and height of a rectangle and a square is a rectangle then you can change a square to not be a square

4348608
width	height
you could make it so that if the square constraint is set setting width or height would cause the other one to match automatically

4348617
vb6	vba
the vba in office has been the same for about 10 years now still using old vb6

4348651
width	height
notice how the z-index is high to put it on top of everything and the height and width are 100 to make it take up the entire window with its opaque background

4348677
min	max
you can set the min and max using an ajax call or jquery

4348677

post	get
you want to set up both get and post routes

4348790
post	get

4348807
implements	extends
this is a simple example of how you can create an itemrenderer extends skinnablecomponent and implements idatarenderer

4348837
trie	tree
you might try implementing a prefix tree trie as a data structure particularly if you know the range of the characters

4348844
jquery	jqmodal
i dug into the source for jqmodal and it looks like it s just using jquery .load internally

4348871
button	checkbox
when i click a button i want to get the value from each of the checked checkbox

4348879
firefox	safari
btw when i check it in firefox and safari on a mac it looks ok

4348894
post	get
depending upon the website you may be able to post directly to their page which is basically skipping their form or you may be able to pass their input field parameters in the query string if they are not being picky about whether the data is read from the get or post variables

4349003
for-loop	loops
you can use this for-loop to loops over the subviews of the search bar and enable it when the search button is pressed on the keyboard

4349009
bufferedoutputstream	bufferedinputstream
_input and _output are bufferedinputstream and bufferedoutputstream spawned from the socket

4349014
int	double
i want this to work with int long double float so i want to specialize it for this set of datatypes

4349062
cpython	ironpython
ironpython is also much easier to extend than cpython

4349062
cpython	ironpython
that s the reason that i ve started using ironpython because i got tired of writing wrappers for my c++ code in cpython

4349076
webkit	gecko
or if you are more adventurous there are also solutions involving webkit and gecko browser engines discussed here

4349146
set	bag
a bag collection is kind of like a set except that it can contain duplicates and it keeps track of how many duplicates there are

4349155
min	max
in both c# and java the min and max values for long are the same

4349163
actionscript	mxml
i know you said i m making all of this in actionscript 3 i assume that means that you re avoiding mxml for some reason

4349174
postgresql	mysql
it does not directly compete with rdbms solutions like mysql postgresql etc

4349234
bash	zsh
in bash 4 with shopt -s globstar and zsh you can use which will include everything except hidden files

4349234
bash	zsh
you can do shopt -s dotglob in bash 4 or setopt dotglob in zsh to cause hidden files to be included

4349290
button	checkbox
i have to enable the button depending on all checkbox being checked

4349334
gif	png
or is it faster to have it in png or jpg or gif

4349336
weka	orange
if you need a less naive solution try data mining practical machine learning tools and techniques and use weka or orange

4349339
hash	salt
store a salt hash of the password

4349387
backgroundworker	blockingcollection
i m asking this because you can access your blockingcollection fine from within the backgroundworker but you can t do it from a separate workerclass since it s a plain vanilla separate class

4349389
google-chrome	firefox
update 2 it now works in firefox and google-chrome

4349393
webrat	cucumber
i don t have a sample integration test in the book for devise but i think the code in the step definition in the cucumber chapter will also work if you have webrat capybara installed

4349397
mouseover	mouseout
there s a really good explanation of the limitations of the mouseover and mouseout events in the jquery docs about half way down that page

4349397
mouseover	mouseout
mouseover and mouseout events trigger when you move the mouse over the bound element as expected but they also fire a separate event when you mouse over any inner elements within the parent element - this is obviously undesirable in most circumstances

4349397
mouseleave	mouseenter
basically to fix your problem use the mouseenter and mouseleave events instead

4349397
width	height
if you want to keep the visual effect you ve current got with a tall coloured area behind each link make the link take up the whole box - 100 of the height and width of the div

4349406
subtract	add
with the use of the following gui the user can add or subtract more or less items for the three different parts

4349421
int	chars
if you use the array method use bytes unsigned chars s instead of int s

4349424
unix	solaris
so really looking for c api on solaris unix that would give me the total and available number of inodes given a filesystem

4349425
pull	push
and afterwards you ll find it s even possible to scale up across multiple processes and machines with little effort. take a look at the guide to get started and the zmq_socket 3 manpage specifically for how push and pull works

4349456
swt	swing
if you truely want a real desktop experience though then swing or swt should be sufficient for your needs

4349460
google-chrome	firefox
since then google-chrome has advanced 4 versions the firefox team has put a lot of work into performance in firefox 4 and ie9 has arrived with hardware acceleration

4349566
put	get
visual studio will put it in the bin directory for the dll project but it won t get copied any further up the line

4349567
google-chrome	firefox
i got it working in firefox + google-chrome but ie decides to not follow any rule.

4349588
post	get
looking at the requests in firebug showed the original post but then it returned 301 and issued a get to the lower case version

4349589
post	get
so in this case getjson post must return the same result but i get different results because of datetime difference

4349606
getter	setter
like a flattened field-only view with no getter and setter cluttering everything up

4349621
subtract	add
however it s still hundreds of cycles for things like add subtract and compare

4349630
onfocus	onblur
according to quirksmode onfocus and onblur are available on the window in most browsers

4349642
getter	setter
you generally don t test things like property setter getter i think this method is simple enough to avoid unit testing for the same reason

4349685
mouse	keyboard
hey i m developing application and want to simulate mouse keyboard events in other program game

4349688
width	height
set the width and height obviously to 100 and all of this on both html and body like the following

4349700
int	double
if you want to restrict your getratio function only for int long double and float then you can use this function as well

4349702
ubuntu	debian
additionally there are still distributions within their mainstream support cycles like fairly recent versions of ubuntu and debian that do not have it by default

4349712
width	height
data file data.txt lines represent width height

4349838
glfw	sdl
good options nowadays are glfw or sdl

4349845
folder	directory
files and folder not supporting reloading and requiring a restart of the application any code under src groovy src java domain classes under domain directory some configuration files changes in plugins any code under utils folder if you have any codec for instance

ubuntu	centos
i am running centos 5.4 ubuntu 8.04 php 5.2.10 apache 2.2

4349861
versioning	upgrade
i am using jquery 1.4.2 i m not in a position to upgrade yet as we are on an older versioning of jquery ui and have way too many bugs using anything newer than 1.4.2

4349869
uiview	subviews
if you want some customized behavior you can create a custom uiview subclass that always contains a button as a subviews so that you can take advantage of some of uibutton s functionality

4349872
pull	push
we have a what we call a shared repo on one of our file servers where we push to and pull from in order to share code

4349873
folder	directory
if it s not there it looks for eggs folder unzipped in the python module directory and imports those

4349914
put	get
it s difficult to tell you exactly where to put the code without knowing some more about your page and how the checkboxes get un checked but the general pattern for doing this check would be something like this

4349919
min	max	range	max	range	min
if the intended behaviour of this method is to set this.value to a random double within a previously specified range then the above three tests are useful assuming genesvaluesinterval min and max are the previously specified range and that you have tests in place to assert that numbergenerator.generatedouble min max returns a double within the specified range

4349959
for-loop	loops
then change the foreach loops to a for-loop and go from to thisprivilegeset.privilegecount

4350038
jobs	cron
seconds not skipping than i would cron jobs

4350058
swt	swing
if you download the now opensource windowsbuilderpro tool then it has excellent examples in both swing and swt of doing good databindings

4350058
swt	swing
it does the same example of a phonebook in both swing and swt gui libraries to demo its drag-and-drop gui builder tool power

4350058
swt	swing
so it is a great way to compare and contrast swing to swt whilst learning databindings

4350061
post	get
i tried with both get and post

4350065
put	get
if i put it as a get parameter in the img src itself it will be too many characters again

4350101
uploadify	swfupload
1 assuming you are talking about allowing bulk uploads from the website not as a rake task the typical way for handling multiple uploads is to use uploadify swfupload for the frontend along with a gem such as paperclip to handle the images on the rails side

4350101
uploadify	swfupload
a google search for paperclip uploadify or paperclip swfupload should give you some good reference material

4350103
int	chars
if you just have 3 possible values use an array of chars and that will copy 4 times faster than int

4350113
int	chars
use chars instead of int or

4350179
codeigniter	cakephp
the easiest to get off the ground in a working state are probably cakephp codeigniter and symphony

4350207
equals	tostring
no typeclasses you overwrite the equals and tostring methods instead no equivalent for read though

4350230
width	height
the way the box models are set up now just doesn t lend itself well to full width full height layouts

4350235
audiotrack	audiorecord
this class holds 2 sockets one audiotrack object and one audiorecord

4350235
audiotrack	audiorecord
when the service class receives a stop as its data in a tcp connection i would like to call a method inside that activity class not create a new one to close those 2 sockets and call stop and release on the audiotrack audiorecord object

4350246
width	height
in qt i would do it like this x and y are the height and width of the image data points to the 24-bit rgb pixels

4350261

4350285
richfaces	tomahawk
due to project constraints i m limited to use jsf 2.0 and richfaces 3.x which partially supports it so i can t rely on tomahawk solution preservedatamodel

4350299
firefox	safari
in ie8 firefox safari it works # of list itmes comes out to 3

4350315

my main problem - i do not see how to change horizontal rows with js knowing that height and width may vary

4350321
freebsd	linux
freebsd and linux have different schedulers

4350321
freebsd	linux
freebsd for a time differed substantially in its kernel threading model but now is closer to linux

4350321
freebsd	linux
freebsd and linux have different default filesystems although both support multiple filesystems and there is some cross-os support

4350421
apache	nginx
then the apache config looks like this proxy to nginx

4350483

4350626
getter	setter
it allows you to have getter setter functions while using the same syntax as you would for accessing any other data member in this case does the same thing as mylength._setbasic 10

4350626
getter	setter
because you can do this you should not write getter setter functions for your data members by default

4350626
getter	setter
if you need to have getter setter functions later you can convert the data member to a property and your module s users won t need to change their code

4350626
getter	setter
note that the docstring is on the property not the getter setter functions

4350631

the performance degradation occurs after prepare execute is complete - it s entirely in pdostatement fetch or pdostatement fetchall

4350809
pull	push

when you insert do a 16-bit hash the 64bit int by xoring each of the 16-bit pieces together to get a table index

4351117
width	height
your webpart should just render the object applet tag and its attributes relevant to the applet code height width or you can let the javascript do it all and your webpart can provide the marker div where the applet needs to be rendered

setinterval	settimeout
a bug in internet explorer 8 seems to have an arithmetic overflow when calculating when to fire a setinterval or settimeout event

4351191
setinterval	settimeout
this bug will probably occur for any time after 25 days uptime 2 31 milliseconds if a large enough number is passed to setinterval or settimeout

4351198
background-color	transparency
the larger issue is not actually the background of the element you want to see through which would just be background-color transparency but instead its ancestor element s

4351198
background-color	transparency
for instance a div with a background-color transparency is still going to look as if it has a white background if its containing element has a white background

4351212
children	parent
and to facilitate this instead of calling getter methods on lazy relationships does that mean its best to keep the transactions short and do finds manually for the children of the parent

4351220
int	chars
there also seems to be a misunderstand on your part about what the int function does when given a non-numeric chars string what it does is raise an exception rather than returning something less than 0

4351227
strcpy	strcmp
there are numerous utility functions like strcmp or strcpy which can do this for you

4351256
fadein	fadeout
jquery s fadeout and fadein functions support specification of callbacks so you would change the above code to something more like this

4351258
keydown	keyup
note that if you hold down a key keydown will be called numerous times and keyup will only be called once when you release it

subtract	add
if your model assigned the wrong ranking you correct the feature weights you add 1.0 to the weights of the features that fire on the better slogan the one that s better according to the people s vote and subtract 1.0 from the weights of the features that fire on the worse slogan its score was obviously too high so you re lowering it now

4351441
subtract	add
typically you don t really add or subtract 1.0 but eta times 1.0 where eta is the learning rate which you can set experimentally

4351582

4351635
put	get
large multiplayer games mmos - games that require multiple machines use their persistent data store as a write-only pipe and for recovery and then put a lot of energy into a scheme for partitioning data in such a way that the simulation ie business logic can get at what it needs to with latencies on the order of local memory access

4351655
getter	setter
you have to go through the setter and getter you ve made

4351749
hash	salt
a salt is a value that is added to a password or other secret which you want to hash one way

4351749
hash	salt
what this does is it mitigates dictionary attacks - basically dictionaries of common passwords pre-hashed with no salt - from being used to guess a one way password as long as the attacker does not know the hash

4351749
hash	salt
if every password has a different hash then it makes it very difficult for an attacker to create a dictionary optimized for cracking your passwords they would need a dictionary for each separate salt and they would also need to know where the salt was placed in each password

4351749
hash	salt	crypt	salt	crypt	hash
then when a user attempts authentication you combine that recorded salt value with the password during the call to crypt for example and if the resulting hash matches then they have entered the correct password

beyond using a tree model dom xom jdom dom4j which would work well with xpath best choice when dealing with data is usually data binding library like jaxb

4352113
onresume	onpause
then use onpause onresume in each activity to bind unbind from the service

4352113
onresume	onpause
alternatively you could add a pair of methods on your service which tell it to start stop listening for location updates and call it from each activity s onresume onpause

django	web2py
update thank you all for the wonderful input after buying three django books and going through a few small projects tutorials for both django and web2py i have settled on web2py

4352428
django	web2py
django is also a wonderful framework but web2py is just better in my limited experience opinion

4352449
pop-up	dialog
as i said any function that is not a callback returns a valid result additionally the dialog pop-up as expected no problems with dll s hinstance

4352478
django	web2py
for example develop your e-commerce website on web2py or django

4352480
division	modulo
your friend is right you need to use the operator called as modulo which gives the reminder after division

4352514
bazaar	git
using hg tried git bazaar etc.

4352547
lxml	beautifulsoup
use lxml it is very efficient as it is written in c another popular html parser is there beautifulsoup but again it is based on sgmllib so i would recommend that you should go for lxml

4352554
mef	prism
you probably do not want to use prism waf mef

4352604
min	max	range	max	range	min
if i have to use range then in this case we have to use min and max of ax

4352606
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome and safari the menus render fine

4352643
public	protected
the compiler itself remembers which ivar is public protected or private and emits errors if you try to access them from somewhere inappropriate

4352652
accessor	properties
unless you have a good reason to you should in general use the accessor methods for properties rather than accessing ivars directly

4352656
int	chars
however if i call the function once with a file call it again with a nonexistent file then call it one more time with the original file the chars string buffer is larger than the int length

4352670
int	double
the arraylist then gets filled with a string a score value as double and an array of int

4352670
int	double
all goes well i can read every single arraylist entry the label string the double value and can access the array of int with a nested loop

4352670
int	double
to be pedantic i i double check if that array entry of the int array is an instance of int with isinstanceof

4352670
int	double
if i leave out the isinstanceof call just looping over the int array all goes fine it loops over the complete arraylist reads my strings and double loops over the nested int array and finishes successfully

4352690
mouse	keyboard
seems like i could just call settimeout for my desired idle time and then call cleartimeout upon any mouse click or keyboard press by having something like body .click cleartimeout ..

4352732
mouseup	mousedown
in the mousedown mouseup events of the window call the mousedown mouseup event handler of the parent

4352751
int	chars
int senderror send this- m_socket chars wbuffer wcslen wbuffer sizeof wchar_t 0

4352771
portrait	landscape
the problem is arranging this stuff so that it appears fine on a landscape mode as well as portrait mode

4352803
mouse	keyboard
how to find out the system idle time means to calcuclate the time the user keeps the system idle ie without moving the mouse and without touching the keyboard and between which time the system is idle .also i should require an excel or mail to be send to the user with the summation of all the idle times for that day for that particular system

terms of cqrs and dddd originated in .net world and were pushed by .net practitioners like greg young and udi dahan

4352956
django	web2py
both django and web2py are excellent full stack web frameworks with similar features and capabilities - you won t be missing out on much as a beginner with either framework

4352956
django	web2py
having said that web2py has a lower initial learning curve than django as it was specifically designed as a learning tool

4352956
django	web2py
although there are more learning resources for django as it has been around longer and has more users learning web2py is also fast because of the excellent book and almost instant responses to questions on the user group

4352982
getter	setter
forget about the setter its only getter now when you dereference names readonly property the actual type behind dereferencing is statebag and statebag implements idictionary tha s why you can cast viewstate property to dictionary now when yo call add method of dictionary it will be stored in the statebag which is known s control s viewstate

4352988
post	get
it has simple rest interface and responds to get post requests

4353033
django	web2py
django has been around 5 years longer than web2py therefore it has more users and more applications to show off

4353033
django	web2py
django has what they call admin which is not the same as web2py s admin but more like web2py s appadmin

4353033
django	web2py
django s admin is better and more customizable than web2py s appadmin

4353033
django	web2py
django does not have the equivalent of web2py s admin

4353033
django	web2py
django is comparable to web2py in terms of security except that web2py had csrf prevention and default escaping in templates before they did but django broke backward compatibility when 1.0 was released

4353033
django	web2py
i am not aware of any functionality of web2py that is not present in django

4353033
django	web2py
you should try ask a question on the web2py google group and on the django group

4353034
inherited	properties
so in that case you could discover the inherited methods by enumerating the properties of obj.prototype

4353104
pull	push
in mercurial you add lines to hgrc in the paths section to create aliases to push to and pull from

4353117
google-chrome	firefox
see this w3schools item ie and this other w3schools google-chrome and firefox

4353117
google-chrome	firefox
on browsers except google-chrome and firefox use window.screenleft and window.screentop

4353117
google-chrome	firefox
on google-chrome and firefox use window.screenx and window.screeny i have tested this in google-chrome

4353150
uiview	subviews
consider a screen point cgpoint and a view uiview which is somewhere inside the view hierarchy it can be a subviews of other views

4353173
super	self
in your case you may want to send initwithname andlocation andsomethingelse to self directly and if needed you can re-define this selector on the class and call super appropriately

4353191
copying	overwrite
you are also copying items from two positions into the same position so the second copy will overwrite the first

4353193
nunit	moq
i m using asp.net mvc 2 nunit moq and mvc contrib

4353197
versioning	upgrade
of course it means you ll have to go through the extraction step if you want to upgrade to a newer versioning of sqlcipher but it d probably be worth it unless you really want to install a cygwin development environment just to be able to build this single library

4353198
hash	salt
i would go with a one way salt hash

4353198
hash	salt
when you create the hash of the password you first combine the password with the salt and hash this combined value

4353198
hash	salt
to authenticate the user you combine the entered password with the salt stored for the user perform the hash on the combined value and compare

4353198
hash	salt
by adding the salt to the mix you ensure that the hash for passwords that happend to be the same have a different hash because the salt portion differs

4353256
carrierwave	paperclip
the alternatives that pop into mind are paperclip and carrierwave

4353261
gif	png
slightly longer answer it s a very inefficient form of steganography it won t work for jpeg images and for gif png it ll basically make your image uncompressable

4353311
hash	salt
storing salt password hash with per-user salt of course is all well and good

4353312
udp	rtp
as the link points out you will get a few false positives where dns and possibly other udp packets occassionally contain the header byte 0x80 used by rtp packets however the number should be negligible and not enough to cause kernel drops

4353323
actionlistener	focuslistener
if you can not change the actionlistener of the close button add a focuslistener to the text fields

4353332
children	parent
if the parent has 5 children and each of those has 4 children then you ll get a total of 20 rows returned

4353373
apache	nginx
i ve finally got my server up and running using nginx as the frontend listening on port 80 and apache listening on 8080 but there s no problem there the actual problem resides with wordpress.

4353373
post	get
which breaks a few things on wordpress for some reason like i can t insert images to the post as i get permission denied from firebug so without 8080 being added on to the url everything works correctly

4353410
children	parent
what i m trying to do is to figure out if some folders is one of children parent or not related

4353515
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
iirc in windows xp when you press save on a savefiledialog or open on a openfiledialog the directory where the file is saved or opened is set as the new current working directory the one in environment.currentdirectory

4353521
folder	directory
an annoyig quirk of the original implementation was that after you made your selection the current directory of your app changed to that folder meaning that if you expected file operations to be relative to your app folder it now failed

4353523
hide	show
my page generates a lot of information dynamically and uses jquery to add remove show hide stuff in the dom

4353525
multiplying	add
they are reasonably fast but it s still something like 100 cycles to add or multiplying

4353529
nsautoreleasepool	nsinvocationoperation
each operation that is called using nsinvocationoperation has it s own local nsautoreleasepool per apple requirements

4353537
addition	multiplication
that s 2 additions subtractions and 1 multiplication instead of 2 addition subtractions and 2 multiplication

4353561
range	max
range of values max value

4353566
getter	setter
i m not sure i understand your question but it appears that you want to process xml formats like atom and represent it in objects with getter setter

4353573
jboss	glassfish
the resource servlet will be loaded automatically in servlet 3.0 environments glassfish v3 tomcat 7 jboss 6 etc however in older environments you need to configure it manually in web.xml

4353620
post	get
only within the namespace post you will get linedlogger instead of logger

4353635
firefox	safari
i ve also found that if you re using a .net webservice and it s running on the test debug server instead of the real iis server explorer s xmlhttprequest will accept answers but firefox and safari s won t

4353649
floating-point	fixed-point
if you re coding for a microcontroller without floating-point operations then it s better not to use floating-point numbers at all and to use fixed-point arithmetic instead

4353651
stdout	fflush
what if one does fflush stdout after each printf

4353653
int	boolean	oncreate	ondestroy
if you need your service to continue running as a single instance without being killed and restarted i would recommend placing startforeground int id notification notification in your service s oncreate method and stopforeground boolean removenotification in your service s ondestroy method

4353656
subtract	add
if a cast is faster than a float add subtract on your platform and if an integer answer is useful to you this might be a reasonable alternative

4353659
implements	extends
you can extends this to implements more sophisticated languages like scheme

4353700
post	get
i ve successfully set up the route using camel s http component but i m unable to get the body of the jms message to post

4353727
treeview	treelist
i have written a treelist treegrid tree with columns control that inherits the treeview control

4353728
hide	show
the boolean flag firstshow allows you to hide the form only for the first call of show while for the following invocations it will work as usual

4353761
onchange	onblur
try javascript onblur or onchange access textbox_1 by document.getelementbyid or by document.getelementbyname and write to other textbox_2 by the same functions

4353773
getter	setter
you could override the setter or getter

4353804
width	height
keep in mind that the position display width and height css statements are going to be what makes your layout work--or not work as the case may be

4353828
put	get
if the caller is interested heâ ll put out the fuse by retaining. and if the caller is not interested like maybe heâ s ignoring an output from a function or just uses the value to construct some other object he does not do anything and the object will get out of memory

4353867
children	parent
hi i have a parent class that is abstract employee and i have children secretary engineer technician if i have and in a for-loop i have randomly made employee new secretary or new engineer.

4353905
client-side	server-side
as pekka said php runs on server-side while what you are trying to do is client-side increment of a variable

4353909
firefox	safari
either way works for firefox and safari on mac pc and ios

4353910
portrait	landscape
why dont you try changing the frame of your view controller s view property for the current mode that the user is in portrait or landscape

4353910
width	height
so in shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation just change yourviewcontroller.view.frame cgrectmake x y width height and perhaps you will have your rotated views

4353912
cpython	ironpython
from straight python or ironpython or cpython or whatever your best route is using the soap-based web services to query the list in question

int	double	int	chars
also floats can t be passed in varargs they re always promoted to double in the same way chars and short are promoted to int in varargs

4353960
wstring	istringstream
it should be obvious that if you have string istream and istringstream therefore you also have wstring wistream and wistringstream

4353996
postgresql	mysql
the most common choice for storing a significant amount of information would be a sql-based database such as mysql postgresql microsoft sql server sqlite etc

4354004
allocator	stl
recently i ve been using one of the lesser-used stl features- custom allocator and i need some serious help in reducing my semantic overhead

4354005
disk	ram
in a small system with extremely limited ram today found mostly in embedded applications you may have to update the disk file

4354103
disk	ram
by way of contrast your classmate conserves ram by waiting to load the data on demand from the hard disk

4354103
disk	ram
you could store as much of the data in ram as possible while periodically writing any edits or modifications back to the file on disk during your application s idle state

4354112
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome safari webkit developers tools built in

4354115
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly on windows opera google-chrome firefox

4354115
firefox	safari
but not on ie and mac firefox safari

4354137
lxml	beautifulsoup	lxml	html5lib	html5lib	beautifulsoup
but instead of beautifulsoup and lxml i would suggest html5lib

4354198
hide	show
hide show column in an html table

4354199
jobs	cron
i would recommend a git repository lay out with the project name as the root under which all your source would lie including cron jobs db scripts unit tests library code as well as the php source in your www root

4354285
submit	submission
i think your code is missing the submit button on the image form submission

4354291
lisp	scheme
scheme p or -p other lisp simulating the question mark with a similar letter also denote predicates

4354309

it s a very light-weight map not a dictionary

4354331
disk	ram
whatever ram disk you choose to purchase or write remember check if the ram disk driver responds the setdispositioninformationfile call

4354356
hash	md5
this doesn t seem to be an md5 or sha hash but i m not very worldly wise in this area so it may well be

4354394
hash	md5
md5 is a hash function

4354422
viewdidload	didreceivememorywarning
didreceivememorywarning - release any data that is used in the presentation of the ui that i can recreate if when viewdidload is called again or some other app specific event

4354437
children	parent
now all of the children are associated with parent

4354484
perforce	svn
my suggestion is that if you are using the free version of perforce and you re not stuck having to using it use sourceforge.net svn hosting which is free and your data will be available anywhere

4354502
vim	emacs
i was thinking to write an emacs or vim script using abbreviations or something like that

4354521
google-chrome	firefox
obviously it should look good on all major browsers firefox google-chrome and ie for that matter

4354527
realloc	malloc
look at malloc and realloc

4354548
qtreeview	qabstractitemmodel
there s a pretty good qtreeview qabstractitemmodel example here

4354578
datalist	repeater
bascially create an asp repeater bind your data to it in much the same way as the datalist and build your markup in the itemtemplate tag

4354578
put	get
you will only get the markup you put in the templates nothing else

4354595
smarty	phpbb
if you don t have access to extend php on your server and smarty isn t your cup of tea on format of performance and would like all the bare-metal code you could do like me and rip out what s in phpbb

4354602
equals	gethashcode
then it will use equals and gethashcode but if you use

4354604
int	double
c# float and double map to them just like int and long map to system.int32 and system.int64

4354610
folder	directory
the only problem i have is when i hit run on netbeans it doesn t show the actual web page it shows me the directory where i saved the project to instead of the public folder

4354619
vbscript	jscript
whether a batch script itself can cope with unicode i do not know but if that is the only problem remaining i would switch to using vbscript or jscript instead of a batch file

4354619
vbscript	jscript
i m not a big fan of vbscript and jscript but at least they don t have completely insane arcane semantics and limitations like batch does

4354634
put	get
i have been trying to put together a query to get the carid where it has attributes of both fast and small but have been having no luck

4354641
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
you now need to define functions called malloc free and realloc which you pass to this c library

4354656
min	max	range	max	range	min
if you want to make sure newax stays within a particular range of values you can use the functions max and min like so

4354661
minimum	max
basically a user can select three different paths and each path has a minimum of 3 steps and a max of 6 steps depending on which path is chosen

4354704
hash	md5
i just updated the readme for you to know how to use it but it basically uses md5 hash it provides expiration times to channels and per-client-ip per-channel security it additionally adds jsonp support if you need it

4354711
put	get
i tried some variations on what to put on curlopt_postfields too but couldn t get it to work

4354804
setinterval	clearinterval
if cleartimeout needs to be bulletproof or you need setinterval and presumably clearinterval you d need to throw more code at the problem but the principal of verifying enough time has elapsed before executing func holds

4354819
inherited	subclassing
if you were to use inherited to cover all these features you d need one subclassing for every feasible combination of features no border no scrolling border without scrolling scrolling without border border and scrolling etc.

4354824
post	get
if i post to search properties refno 5 propstatus finished a correct post is first made then when the results form is being rendered a get action is being done to search properties refno 5 propstatus finished jquery jquery0.5.2.min.js which is incorrect

4354851
free	malloc
malloc you need to free eventually

4354861
instances	transient
ebs backed instances ensure that even if the machine gets rebooted the transient memory is not lost

4354927
ienumerable	ilist
so the property should be an ienumerable or an ilist if you need to allow access to count or indexed access

4354932
children	parent
the children belong to the same process group as the parent process and are thus killed together with their parent process

4354937
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
according to the specifications there isn t any limit but someone has tried to reach this limit and it seems the limit for opera safari supported well over 4000 classes and firefox at least 2000 classes

4354942
x86	64bit
however on 64bit systems 32-bit programs should not install to that folder and instead to programfiles x86 which as i understand points to c program files x86

4354974

4354995
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
the basic principles are pretty straightforward any memory allocated using the alloc family of functions including malloc calloc or realloc must be deallocated by a corresponding call to free

4355029
children	parent
i am going to implement a program where one parent process reads a text file and feeds the data he s reading into a shared memory buffer that s going to be read by some children processes

4355029
children	parent
when it finally goes down to 0 the parent process will be blocked until one of the children unlocks it after having read some block

4355029
children	parent
here is pseudo code for both children and parent

4355037
scheme	racket	lisp	racket	lisp	scheme
racket is closer to scheme than to common lisp but you could dip your toes into the lisp family without the speed bump of the emacs style of development

4355077
folder	directory
then go to cuda c c++ and under common add the location of the cutil.h to the additional include directory folder

4355090
free	malloc
when using the malloc free family of function there are two rules to be obeyed

4355090
free	malloc
you can only free valid memory returned by a malloc family allocator and freeing it renders it invalid so double freeing is an error as is freeing memory not obtained from malloc

4355129
internationalization	localization
you ll want to read up a bit on internationalization and localization often referred to as i18n l10n

4355168
hide	show

4355203
width	height	int	boolean
void drawbitmap int colors int offset int stride float x float y int width int height boolean hasalpha paint paint treat the specified array of colors as a bitmap and draw it. can i use that i m really not sure what its saying

4355220
free	malloc
you have only 4 malloc calls so you should only have 4 free calls

4355241
awt	swing
it combines the native-ness of awt with the ease and features of swing and of course runs everywhere

4355247
free	malloc
in general you cannot free a part of a malloc d structure

4355260
width	height
ok height takes a bit of work but it s pretty straightforward but the width â this gets really interesting

4355263
prepare	execute
i also implemented a staged approach to fetch data where i prepare a list of batches and then execute them

4355270
mongodb	bson
store your reports information in mongodb s native bson documents

4355288
hide	show
you can just show hide a gif but you can also embed that to ajaxsetup so it s called on every ajax request

4355315
int	chars
i want transformation from int to chars or string in c++

4355413
put	get
the only way i am able to get an email is if i put in some value

when you click the visible one hide it and show the hidden one

4355416
hide	show
then you can also hide show the other buttons in an onclick event

4355432
submit	submission	post	get
on a more generic note on form submission as with anything that the end user can submit manually on post be advised that input names can be tampered with to get something validated differently or not validated at all just by changing the validator tags

4355434
post	put
the plugins i ve used put the share option right under the post content but i want the share options to appear near mij comment-header one response ...

4355442
pull	push
here s the work flow i desire to figure out it s centralized in that my fellow collaborator and i push to the remote master and pull changes from the remote master and i think i understand how to do that well enough

4355442
pull	push
however i also want to be able to have a remote development branch from the main line of development the remote master but also i want my collaborator and i to clone this development branch onto our machines to be able to pull from this development branch and to push to it from our local machines and then when the development branch is stable to merge it onto the remote master and then we pull from the remote master onto our local clones of the master

4355442
pull	push
so far what i have learned is about the centralized workflow is that the collaborators can push and pull to and from the remote master and choose to make their local branches on their own machine and then merge those with their local master and then pull from the remote master first before pushing to it

4355545
google-chrome	firefox
out of the box it doesn t work too well with firefox or google-chrome

4355568
haskell	ocaml
you should learn to program in a well structured language first ocaml is recommended haskell is also good but a bit harder to get a working compiler and harder to learn because it is purely functional

4355577
tunnel	vpn
in which case a vpn that tunnel all connections from your machine would be preferred since your applications would still see an available route that was temporarily blackholing your connections

4355603

dis claimer i m the author maintainer of xlrd and maintainer of xlwt which is a fork of pyexcelerator with bugs fixed and numerous enhancements

4355658
width	margin
with you can even get the width including padding border and if desired the margin

4355693
gif	png
the weird thing is it works fine with png s and jpeg s bit not at all with gif s

4355696
mongoid	mongomapper
i prefer mongomapper for 2.3.x projects but mongoid has seemed much more stable for me in rails 3 projects

4355727
vim	emacs
if you re talking vim and emacs you might want to try a simple bash script

4355733
for-loop	loops
the only loops i can see in your code is the for-loop which is finite no more that 150 iterations so that would not make the code execute indefinitely

4355733
for-loop	loops
for instance if you put a line before and after the for-loop and when executing only the first one is displayed you know your problem is somewhere within loops

4355831
int	double
if you want to convert from int to some other type double long whatever just let that conversion be done on assignment

4355859
int	double
public static void getdata double t int m

4355928
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

4355947
integer	unsigned
the range of a signed 32-bit integer is -2147483648 to 2147483647 while the range of an unsigned 32-bit integer is 0 to 4294967295

4355951
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the uitabbarcontroller contains a number of uinavigationcontroller which in turn contain subclassed uitableviewcontrollers

4355969
hide	show
hide the footer replace the content then show the footer again

4356017
terminate	timeout
the watchdog arranges sleeps for the timeout period and when that time is up sends a signal to the actual command and a terminate signal to the parent process

4356020
memcpy	memcmp	int	chars
the way to deal with this issue is to accompany each buffer with an int that will indicate the number of chars in it and then stick to the memory area manipulation functions such as memcpy memcmp etc

4356020
puts	gets
you should also avoid puts and gets for file i o since those are also string-oriented

4356027
ssl	https
when the admin clicks this admin link the site redirects to ssl https protocal and is suppose to send the admin to the administrtion area of the site

4356043
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
note also that you can iterate through the current view controller s hierarchy using uinavigationcontroller s viewcontrollers property for uiviewcontroller viewcontroller in self.navigationcontroller.viewcontrollers .

4356053
pop-up	dialog
hi i was wondering if there was a way for a batch file to make a pop-up appear using the command along with other selections besides the ones that are there by default cancel and ok by this i mean add custom buttons to the pop-up message such as a next button that would bring you to another pop-up message with dialog on it or something along those lines

4356062
cvs	svn
your source control system should manage this for you and you should be able to access this information using cvs annotate or svn blame

4356080
width	height
that shader needs to run twice for it to work what you call blursize should be a vec2 and the value of that should be vec2 0 1.0 height for vertical blur and vec2 1.0 width 0 for horizontal blur

4356084
pascal	delphi
in delphi pascal we use . for any of those even properties.

4356088
google-chrome	firefox
but i have a strange problem in firefox in google-chrome this works perfectly in which the uniform location for each matrix sampler in each shader are not saved properly

4356088
google-chrome	firefox
like i said this doesn t work only in firefox which make me believe firefox and google-chrome store uniform locations differently

4356089
ssl	https
wxhttp everything but ssl https support

4356131
mp3	wav
it d be very difficult to do in python with any sort of speed - see how to convert mp3 to wav in python for some discussion

4356148
google-chrome	firefox
when you paste the code into the text area in the embedding dialog and then click on ok in ie and google-chrome nothing happens and in firefox it just adds a image as a flash-content-placeholder

4356167
pascal	delphi
in pascal or delphi

what i would like to do is get the last 20 wall post made on a public artist page

4356509
.htaccess	httpd.conf
add addhandler cgi-script ttf to the apache options for this directory in httpd.conf or .htaccess

chroma max red green blue - min red green blue

4356561
wordpress	joomla
i have access to mysql php python and ruby along with some of the standard cms s wordpress drupal joomla django etc from my hosting provider hostgator

google-chrome	firefox
but if i using wget or under ubuntu desktop with google-chrome or firefox i can t get any things

4356635
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
one thing i noticed is that it does not include add subtract multiplying or divide functions

4356635
multiplying	subtract
is it as simple as just adding subtract multiplying dividing them together using integer math

4356657
button	checkbox
for checkbox or radio button you can use the checked or checkstate property

4356672
versioning	upgrade
as a first step i would suggest that you upgrade to the most recent versioning of wordpress

4356684
wordpress	joomla
wordpress drupal and joomla are ready-to-go with minimal set-up

4356702
profiling	debugging
if your post-backs are slow you need to profiling the activity going on or otherwise debugging what s going on rather than try to avoid the page life-cycle

4356729
implements	extends
i have a class that extends glsurfaceview and implements renderer in my android app that takes care of the opengl rendering

4356739
calloc	malloc
i figured out the problem - i should have been using calloc not malloc

4356739
calloc	malloc
while malloc simply allocates the memory calloc

4356754
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it s a bit ugly but it works for firefox google-chrome and safari just not ie

4356763
width	height
i also managed to make it so that it can detect the height width by itself

4356801
subtraction	addition
no need for directional pointers just use some smart addition and subtraction logic

4356834
children	parent
adding restrictions to the criteria will not affect what children are loaded only what parent which doesn t make sense in your case because you already have a parentid

4356852
zoo	xts
the xts time series package works on top of zoo and handles the most common date time classes by translating them to posixct and back again

4356886
oncreate	ondestroy
in your case what you have to do is to stop the handler on ondestroy so that it can be re-executed again in oncreate

4356915
int	chars
question i would like to compress a list of int in as short a string as possible consisting only of ascii chars usable for filenames and urls

4356930
slideup	slidedown
i am using yahoo s yui3 library which doesn t yet have native slideup or slidedown methods so i m simulating them

4356930
slideup	slidedown
i can easily simulate slideup by executing a simple animation that sets the height 0 but i m having trouble simulating the slidedown method since i don t know the final height of the ul list i am dynamically building

4356970
filtering	grouping
in my experience most common tasks that rely on result filtering ordering projection grouping logical conjunctive or disjunctive statements or subquerying can be carried out by mutating a criteria object in the expected ways

4356978
int	chars
as in each int encoded to a utf-8 chars the chars made into a string then encode the resulting string in base-85

4357032
hide	show
i tend to just show hide a img as other have stated

4357032
hide	show
css then when you call the function show the image once its complete hide it again

4357063
portrait	landscape
landscape is 1 or 3 portrait is 6 or 8

4357079
width	height
also i set width and height of your poster s div

google-chrome	safari
normally not an issue but i m using font-face and little did i know that it doesn t play nicely with font-variant-small-caps in google-chrome safari ie

4357185
ant	maven
assumptions netbeans version 6.9.1 although likely applicable to most or all 6.x versions alternative build systems maven are not used...the default ant is used

4357204
width	height
you also need to position the latter div using css so that it does not just push the main content out from underneath it as well as sizing the div at 100 of its container s width and height

4357209
folder	directory
copy published folder to root directory of the website has just created

4357217
vmware	virtualbox
d virtual network adapters like for vmware virtualbox etc are cheap no hardware

4357242
hide	show
that will hide horizontal overflow and show vertical overflow.

4357300
for-loop	arrays
you can use a for-loop to iterate through the arrays as

4357317
folder	directory
if you are using standard java file system interaction that s going to be your first bottleneck - java is pretty bad at folder content iteration - and if you are doing checks against each file as you iterate get the modified date make sure the file isn t a directory etc... performance can take a big hit these all involve round trips to native land

4357317
folder	directory
next raw iteration of a huge directory in ntfs isn t particularly slower than an n-ary tree approach folder and subfolders etc...

4357320
implements	extends
but when you extends customitem and implements your own item complete control lies within the implementation

4357357
post	get
no direct access - however use intermediate get post or ajax

4357376
nginx	lighttpd
similar modules exist for other web servers such as lighttpd nginx tornado etc

4357383
extjs	mootools
extjs jquery mootools prototype is not welcome

this shows that a wildcard does not work in paths only for files in a single directory c folder .files

4357443
integer	unsigned
unsigned integer 4 bytes with max value of 4294967295 4 billion

4357510
post	get
odds are good that every post and get returns a cookie along with the page content a cookie you ll need to send back

4357535
post	get
you should also be submitting the form via post and then redirecting the browser so that it requests the results via get

4357585
gdal	ogr
gdal includes the ogr library which supports shapefile i o

4357589
superclass	subclassing
as far as i see by doing this i can still achieve the same thing as the composition example as well as i won t have to make a lot of wrapper methods to delegate methods of superclass for each subclassing

4357595
for-loop	loops
in that case you can add a nowait clause to the firs t omp for and rather than all threads waiting until the for-loop ends whoever s done first can immediately go on to start working on the second loops

4357625
phpstorm	webstorm
webstorm without php support and phpstorm with php support from jetbrains

4357651
google-chrome	safari
so now that whole iframe is not displayed in safari 6 and sometimes in google-chrome also

4357677
maven	m2e
the m2e was using a version of maven 3.x - can t remember which - and i was running a previous version

if you re allowed to use a queue fifo list you could do

4357803
folder	directory
this requires a table called keytable there is a script for this in the lightspeed installation directory under the providers folder

4357858
int	double
unfortunately dalvik bytecode makes no distinction between integral types short int long etc. and floating point types float double

4357968
post	get
so i post the first snippet and then what i added myself after having seen the documentation about jquery get function

4358030
rss	feed
i have big problem i want to read rss feed from mydealz.de and save their titles contents and dates to my db

4358101
ddms	adb
you could use adb push on the command line or ddms import export via eclispe to put the db on to your emulator

4358227
post	get
i also recommend installing in much the same fashion as the original post recommended - get the vanilla eclipse don t even try downloading the pdt package

4358242
put	get
but i don t understand how get it to put inside my ui

4358277
for-loop	loops
in javascript there s no block scope for your for-loop the domain variable is shared for all loops it s scoped to the parent function not strictly inside loops for example you could access it after the closing for the for and it d be the value it had in the last loops

awt	swing
note that both awt and swing are part of the j2se package

4358716
onresume	onpause
i call the mtts.shutdown in onpause and reinitialise it in onresume

4358765
int	chars
so getchar returns any chars value as an unsigned chars converted to int which will therefore be non-negative

4358765
int	chars
well it has undefined behavior if the input is more than long_max chars due to int overflow but we can probably forgive that in a simple example

4358787
post	get
however if i use same id in where clause in a select i get post data just fine

4358793
lisp	scheme
it s scheme rather than common lisp but that shouldn t hold you up for long

i will be using hibernate so was thinking of using inherited mapping for the user different user types having a therapist class extends a base user class and implements a user interface with common properties such as firstname surname etc

4358822
vim	emacs
a satirical way to say this unlike emacs vim does not attempt to include

4358861
folder	directory
so if you have files directory in the root you need to move the one-by-one to the samplesproducta folder

4358883
accessor	properties
it is usually considered bad form to call properties accessor in init because they may have side effects that you wouldn t want to happen while the object is incompletely initialised

4358883
accessor	properties
similar considerations apply in dealloc btw it s better to release your ivars directly rather than using the properties accessor

4358914
width	height
the file size of sample_original_bmp2emf_method2.emf is smaller by 15 mb than sample_original_bmp2emf_method1.emf but the width height has been maintained

minimum	max
you would then have functions to return the minimum max row column indices of form

4359171
superclass	subclassing
as such unless it is exactly test3 the assignment will fail since subclassing can be assigned to variables of a superclass type but the reverse is not true

hide	show
show hide are syntactic sugar in groovy griffon that was at one point in j2se but has been long been deprecated

4359429
integer	unsigned
if i understand you correctly you want to write length lower bits of the unsigned long long integer you receive

4359436
mouse	keyboard
i ve been developing a remote desktop application which runs as a windows service and i was wondering how i could connect the application to a specific session and allow it to retrieve the user s desktop as a bitmap set the cursor position send mouse clicks and keyboard input to the console session

4359456
dictionary	map
for that we can use some sort of tree or hashtable based dictionary implementation std map in c++ hashmap or treemap in java or dictionary in python

4359477
mongodb	bson
of course it works with bson documents but when you want to update some record mongodb returns full bson doc not the part

4359499
trie	tree
you can use a bloom filter before looking up in the hashset.this can fasten things up.the bloom filter has a problem of false +ve s.so for all true the bloom filter returns you will have to look up in the hashset once again to make sure but all false you can be sure.also you could replace your hashset with a radix tree patricia trie for more compact storage

4359513
implements	extends
in a shared project we have an adapter class extends baseadapter implements listadapter

4359513
rss	feed
in its constructor this class fetches an rss feed from the internet and parses the returned xml document to obtain the data it will adapt

i assume you either have a dx and dy which is the delta of the ball coordinate per movement or an angle say î theta so in this case dx is 10 cos th and dy is 10 sin th

4359595
min	max
so after some more searching i used the apply function to calculate various metrics as mean sd and min max

4359625

next thing all values except for arrays and objects are pass by value basically arrays and objects are also pass by value but the value is a pointer to the object

4359643
width	height
and also printer device is the dot matrix printer and paper is voucher size is 550 width 550 height

4359643
width	height
so my content should set inside these height and width also

4359670
webrat	cucumber
i tried cucumber for high level testing and webrat for integration testing

4359676
width	height
when the applicationcomplete event dispatches i check capabilities.screenresolutiony and if it is less than 800 i want to resize the app programmatically preserving the width height ratio

4359792
width	height
if the height and width were variable and the size of the image was determined server-side then it becomes more generic and reusable

symfony	kohana	cakephp	kohana	codeigniter	cakephp	codeigniter	kohana
there are plenty of them kohana symfony cakephp codeigniter etc

4359906
google-chrome	firefox
i find this blocking behaviour to happen in ie8 google-chrome 8.0 and firefox 3.6

4359958
udp	tcp
udp vs tcp

4359958
udp	tcp
when opening and forwarding ports you may notice that it asks for udp user datagram protocol or tcp transmission control protocol

4359958
udp	tcp
tcp is the most commonly used connection type and your chat program would likely communicate over tcp especially if you are connecting across the net because udp broadcasts are useless across the internet

4359958
udp	tcp
you should be safe forwarding and unblocking only the tcp ports but sometimes when i m unsure i just do both udp and tcp just to be safe

4359958
udp	tcp
in fact many routers and firewalls have 3 options tcp udp or both which saves you from having to create two rules for both types of the port

4359987
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome it works well but in firefox generate this error

4360024
webrat	cucumber
i have read a lot of similar topics but most solutions are for older versions of rails rspec webrat or for other testing frameworks like cucumber and so i do not know if how they would apply

4360036
try-catch	exception-handling
and don t forget to use lots of try-catch logic around it because the mail stuff in gae is prone to throwing lots of exception-handling

4360045
sudo	passwd
sudo will only prompt you the first time or every n minutes for a passwd

4360045
sudo	passwd
i noted here that in 10.5 and later sudo will only work if your admin account has a passwd

4360067
equals	gethashcode
i d rather override bool equals system.object and int gethashcode and use equals for value comparison - imho makes the code more readable by virtue of reducing ambiguity

4360075
hide	show
the first time the show hide login link is clicked everything appears to work fine and the div with the class loginbox appears on the screen

4360075
hide	show
the second time show hide login link is clicked nothing happens

4360091
cpu	hyperthreading
in addition to what roman said you should see whether the client s pc has multiple cpus cpu cores hyperthreading

4360091
cpu	hyperthreading
if there s just a single cpu with a single core and no hyperthreading you won t benefit from parallelizing a computation

4360130
des	aes
des is a very weak algorithm you might want to think about aes rijndael

4360194
mongoid	mongomapper
above is for mongomapper but idea is the same for mongoid -- just drop to the database level and drop all collections

4360195
int	double
is just a shorter abbreviated form of coding in fact the compiler will allocate the memory the same qty of memory for the array the first one is not explicitly write the new just like when you assign an int to a double variable you can write the cast or not because is a safe cast and will produce the same effect

4360221
google-chrome	safari
the client is either the latest versions of safari or google-chrome

4360256
getter	setter
i omitted generic getter setter

4360314
width	height
what i need to do is resize only this link so the page shows normal size yet scaled down to about 50 of its normal width and height while fitting in the iphone iframe perfect

4360325
margin	height
the height animation and also the built-in slide effects don t account for margin and border

4360325
margin	height
as a result the animation runs for example on a hide it collapses the interior height of the element to zero then it applies display none -- since the element s margin and border are still visible the application of display none causes the element to blip out of existence

4360325
margin	height
now all of the visible content including the margin and border are inside #faq-group-notice so when the height animation effect runs it collapses everything -- not just the stuff inside the border

4360343
getter	setter
remember that properties are just syntax aliases to setter and getter methods

4360411
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
if your character set is ascii then it s quite easy to compare characters in alphabetical order either case-sensitive or case-insensitive

4360516
google-chrome	firefox
it s realy strange behaviour of google-chrome and firefox but i m glad it works with this workaround

4360544
put	get
this is the general idea of hashing and you will recognize the put and get method from java.util.map

4360568
width	height
expands it if it s too small height width

4360579
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
opera and safari 4 and google-chrome

4360594
folder	directory
for xcode 3 the build directory is usually located inside your main project folder

4360598
vpn	wlan
my usual basic assumption is to treat a wlan as the internet - anyone can listen so you either configure the wlan with encryption if possible most wireless routers these days support wpa2 tkip aes which should be considered reasonably strong or you configure a vpn over something like ssl and use a cert as per cowabunga darren so you get greater strength than passwords

4360599
width	height
it s difficult to diagnose without seeing your markup and css but what might work is to make the target s parent maintain its height width when you animate

4360612
x86	64bit
i m running windows 7 64bit installed eclipse and android sdk in the program files x86 folder

4360616
width	height
tablelayout gives all children fill_parent and wrap_content for width and height respectively

4360616
width	height
tablerow gives all children wrap_content for both width and height

4360633
google-chrome	firefox
i am not coding for ie at the moment and only using latest google-chrome and firefox for testing now

4360655
dictionary	map
in another language with a similar data structure you might use a for...each loop processing every record and then deleting it from the hash dictionary map whatever

4360690
width	height
to follow up on slaks answer to use the pixel dimensions of the image regardless of the dpi you can bind the width and height to the pixelwidth and pixelheight of the source like this

4360708
pbm	pgm
read up on the pbm or the pgm image formats

4360745
away3d	papervision3d
i believe the latest version of flar toolkit has support for away3d papervision3d sandy3d and alternativa3d

4360773
put	get
and when you put each of these files in a different folder it can get tedious going back and forth and finding them

4360855
debian	linux
i ve tested this code on dell computers running debian linux and not had this problem

4360894
folder	directory
looks like the only app that can hold a handle to the folder is the manager itself because its starting directory is the one the error complains about tools

4360902
httphandler	httpcontext
and in the httphandler code you just read it from the httpcontext parameter of the processrequest method like so

4360956
post	get
i need to get an understanding about how you can handle get and post data in a form in asp.net in these 2 situations

4360958

i am trying to create a server-side solution which periodically pushes data to the client no client-side polling via node.js

4361034
vim	notepad++
in keeping with enlightenment ruby culture and simplicity aims of the project you don t need much more than a terminal and vim or notepad++ to work with the koans project

4361042
post	get
- you can pass the values using get or post variables

4361042
post	get
i think the easiest way to do it is to use post variables is as easy as with get but you should avoid passing an url in the url itself

4361050
passenger	webrick
tried running the app with both passenger standalone and apache module and webrick rails server

4361077
rss	feed
i have a situation where i have an hourly batch job which has to parse a large number of rss feed and extract the text of the title and description elements from each item per feed into strings which will then have their word frequencies calculated by lucene

4361102
move	drag
i ve thought about writing a program that just displays the image then you drag a box and its saves the image and move on to the next one

4361105
northwind	adventureworks
you can also grab some of the sql sample databases like northwind adventureworks and use that data to populate your objects if it s suitable

4361115
width	height
i have a filled shape and a bitmapdata that is the same width and height as the shape s bounding box

4361120
instances	transient
if you were to decide your repository and defaultcontainer should be transient rather than singleton but still had the static field you d be facing a pretty nasty race condition as the instances successively overwrite the shared field

4361165
button	checkbox
i have a usercontrol which may contain many different kind of controls button textbox combobox or checkbox

4361172
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
and i ve considered the route of using an explicit oo inherited model where i have subclassing of a base product class to represent any product that has additional properties

4361192
opencv	emgucv
emgucv on sourceforge is a .net wrapper around opencv which has numerous image manipulation capabilities including image filters and a bounding box algorithm that could solve this pretty easily

4361236
opera	firefox
firebug has a good one for firefox opera has dragonfly and other browsers tend to have them built in

4361268
folder	dir
copy the source folder to a dir which is not source a folder

4361272
post	get
i ve read countless post about this but i just can t seem to get it to work

4361377
versioning	upgrade
i ve already talked to my host and i am looking to upgrade to the latest versioning

4361378
public	protected
make sure the class is public or protected if in the same package

4361389
algol	smalltalk
ruby has been called smalltalk with an algol syntax where algol is the language that gave us the conventions you re talking about here

4361406
pull	push
it is typically put under version control so that the settings will propagate to other repositories with push and pull

4361413
post	get
when i am putting request via get it s working printing value of params but for post it s not working

4361433
int	chars
i need to hash an id int or chars array to an x y point confined within that boundary area

4361490
textmate	gedit	kde	gnome
well if you plan to use your linux distro with gnome instead of kde you probably should check gedit with gmate plugins although is not like textmate power it has a lot of it features

4361536
post	get
to solve the problem it is necessary that you post your stack trace you get when the force close message appears

4361538
put	get
i get confusing results depending on where i put the chr 10

4361576
public	protected
the visibility of a property or method can be defined by prefixing the declaration with the keywords public protected or private

4361583
google-chrome	firefox
firefox works like a charm but not in google-chrome it seems that autocomplete plugin is hijacking the enter key keycode 13 every other key works so when i click on enter without choosing a suggested text nothing happens

4361622
tolower	ctype
c++ also provides tolower in its ctype facet which you can use here

4361629
memcpy	strcpy
memcpy is not really any slower than strcpy

4361629
memcpy	strcpy	strlen	strcpy
in fact if you perform a strlen to identify how much you are going to memcpy then strcpy is almost certainly faster

4361641
division	subtraction
if you don t want to implement division for 128bit value you could precompute several 40 128 bit values that represents powers of 10 and use subtraction

4361645
rvm	bundler
based on my limited understanding of bundler and rvm it seems that they--like rubygems--have their own install locations for gems

4361645
rvm	bundler	rubygems	bundler	rubygems	rvm
do we use all three rubygems bundler rvm and tell them all to install gems to the same place

4361659
rss	feed
i ve categorized database of rss feed around 1000

4361659
rss	feed
so i iterate throught the rss feed downloads only feed with new items

4361659
rss	feed
- via the wrapper for gevent pool run task for rss feed download at every stage new items found add new job to quique to download item at every item downloaded add tasks for image downloading

4361662
folder	directory
if you want to do that you have to save the image to the app s directory folder and then build a way to show to the user the images he has saved internally and allow him to delete load etc

4361702
textarea	textbox
if you are watching changes that the user enters in the textbox itself you should use the class textarea or textinput instead of text

4361707
put	get
basically get s all the table s values and put them in a json array

4361716
rvm	bundler
when using rvm and bundler together rvm tells bundler where the gems should go and bundler installs them into the rvm-folder

4361716
rvm	bundler
i personally use bundler and rvm for all my projects

4361718
agile	sprint
well my experience from real life is that certain agile planning tools tools were handed to the scrum teams before they even started their sprint fortunately the teams liked it but we were free to inspect and adapt to using something else if it did not work out for us

4361736
rvm	bundler
this way i use bundler to keep track of the dependencies for each app and rvm to isolate each app s gems from each other

4361736
rvm	bundler
i have not yet installed rvm on my deployment server there i just use bundler to make sure each apps dependecies are handled

4361736
rvm	bundler
as for your last question bundler is a wrapper around gem rvm just manipulates the gempath where gems are installed

4361761
128bit	64bit
since the largest 64bit number is 20 digits long that means all 19-digit decimal numbers can be printed that way but since the largest 128bit number is 39 digits long we can t break it up into only 2 parts since there s a chance that we might end up with a 20 digit number bigger than the largest 64bit number

4361764
memcpy	malloc
sounds like you re onto something with your with malloc memcpy idea there

4361767
switching	screens
then if you want to add it to your project switching back to the wpf project currently open in eb and click the right arrows on the toolbar placed on the left-hand side of the screens and go to project - your user control here

4361849
onchange	onkeyup
i looked around and the text field does not have the onkeyup or onchange events

4361865
onkeyup	onblur
i would say an onblur onkeyup down event that triggers a custom event that waits for a pause or space then sends the data then handles the return

4361879
keydown	keyup
it does have keyup and keydown listeners but they are assigned at runtime via addeventlistener keyup ...

4361879
keydown	keyup
use your browser s dom inspector to select the input element and then drill into the event listeners currently assigned in webkit s inspector that s under event listeners at the bottom of the right-hand pane -- you ll see keyup keydown and several others

4361899
iboutlet	ibaction
using interface builder or some similar program for creating views that will connect to the code with iboutlet and ibaction

4361901
memcpy	strcpy
replacing strcpy by memcpy doesn t make any significant difference

4361903
decoder	encoder
use the built-in decoder and encoder functions rather than trying to create json-encoded characters like u..

4361909
free	malloc
but i think think there is another problem when i try to sort a bigger array 200 elements the program doesn t work i get a malloc error incorrect checksum for free object - object was probably modified after being free

4361920
jqgrid	datatables
if you don t have someone around to help with jqgrid you are better off with datatables

4361930
post	get
nb the way on how you get the single id name depend on how the is formatted so you do better if you post to us the echoed json

4361948
google-chrome	safari
when i load the page in google-chrome and click around the logs show the only thing it s trying to reach on the server is favicon.ico which is a 404 and which i don t think ios safari tries to load anyway

4361953
udp	tcp
http is an application layer protocol which could be encapsulated with a protocol that uses udp providing arguably faster reliable communication than tcp

4361953
udp	tcp
quake 2 protocol proves that udp can be used over tcp to provide a basis for a structured communication system insuring flow control chunk ids

4362006
gif	png
yet many of us don t know the trade-offs between a gif jpeg or png file â and there are some major differences there

4362006
tiff	png
tiff â any bit depth any compression lossy or lossless everything including the kitchen sink â and no better than png

4362006
tiff	png
but for some customers like the federal government it s tiff instead of png

the reason to do this is because even though there is an integer division instruction div idiv in the instruction set it s typically very slow several times slower than multiplication

4362064
multiplying	division
the second part calculates the remainder by multiplying the result of division by 10 in an indirect way via shifts and adds

4362077
int	double
i need to rewrite the operator so that it can cout values for hour int and temperature double

4362081
division	multiplication
finally on the computation of i 10 the basic idea is to replace division by 10 with multiplication by 1 10

4362146
post	get
these programs will work with any browser that supports http proxying and give you the ability to modify get or post parameters cookies requests and responses

4362197
jobs	cron
here is a blog post about cron jobs and a library that i have used in production code

versioning	upgrade
i ve released new versioning of our software in wix we specify to upgrade without uninstalling first

4362255

in any case lame.exe is not a good choice for editing tags as it s an audio encoder which will decoder and re-encode the mp3 causing quality loss

4362280
translation	localization
this is where i learned that localization is a lot more than translation

4362303
post	get
when i try to upload a file using this code i get a post success response on the client end but the file never shows up on my server

4362330
width	height
and width height is the same as x y

4362339
width	height
you can vertically and horizontally align it using just css providing you know the width and height

4362339
width	height
if you don t know the width and the height because it varies you could always use javascript or jquery to get it

4362360
int	double
c++ operator rewrite to cout int and double values

4362360
int	double
i need to rewrite the operator so that it can cout values for hour int and temperature double

4362378
unsigned	short
there s an unsigned short counter that gets incremented in the loop and within the loop i -drain and re-alloc the pool if the counter ever hits 0

4362397
division	multiplication
which makes sense - there are plenty of number collections that we might want to make instances of num where multiplication is irreversible - a division operation would be essentially meaningless

4362403
hide	show
you normally don t need to hide one mdi child before you show the next one but it is possible for the timing to get mixed up in which case the wrong form can end up on top

4362449

4362483
width	height
the biggest one you can fit in memory pixelwise will be 2gb leading to sqrt 2x10 9 maximum height and width

4362483
width	height
from this number and dividing by the number of images you have for height and width you will get the overall pixels per subimage allowed. and can paint them into the appropriate places

4362486
post	get
you really should be using post instead of get but regardless i would check the following

4362497
folder	directory
keep in mind that if you re working in eclipse your class files will probably be in bin with respect to your working directory so if it s just in your project folder the way you have it should work but not getresourceasstream

4362615
implements	extends
my class extends surfaceview and implements surfaceholder.callback

4362659
.htaccess	httpd.conf
i think you have to put your addtype handler in httpd.conf and nott in .htaccess

4362662
nsmutablestring	nsstring
based on the error message you are receiving i expect the culprit is a nsstring or nsmutablestring object

4362682
wan	lan
to go across the network wan or lan you pretty much have to use ip

4362682
udp	tcp
lastly in addition to tcp consider using udp as well because you get builtin message boundaries and easier endpoint management

4362688
lisp	smalltalk
just like lisp and smalltalk - # and so on are simply legal method names

4362717
client-side	server-side
server-side and client-side validation can easily exist simultaneously

post	get
it is clear since most browsers don t support other methods besides get and post

4362823
vbo	pbo
only basic opengl commands are used no pbo fbo vbo ... the only one problematic thing could be the use of shaders available only from qt 4.7 but its code is trivial

4362825
strcpy	strncpy
note that both strcpy and strncpy alone are unsafe the first might overflow your buffer and the second might leave it without a nul terminator

4362841
put	get
instead of .load which isn t intended for binary data...which is why you get those fun symbols with the encoding you just need to create an element with the right src and put it where you want in the document for example

4362857
udp	tcp
whenever the server has created new socket tcp i want it to notify the client to use the new socket for further communication.currently i have thought of sending udp packet to the client to be notified

4362857
udp	tcp
it it is not a good idea two have two tcp connections i can use udp to send the control information

4362871
pull	push
you can then push pull to this just as you would any other repository after you have added it as a remote

4362928
superclass	subclassing
1 when you extend a class your subclassing implicitly contains a chunk of data that consists of all the data used to make an instance of the superclass

4362942
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
they are correctly positioned in ie8 firefox safari google-chrome

4362972
implements	extends
threads or rather runnables which you should implements rather than extends thread have a run method that contains the code they are expected to execute

4362985
google-chrome	safari
it s open source and seems to be based on the webkit engine which is used in many browsers today google-chrome safari ios android

4362987
hash	md5
now i would like to save some bandwidth so what i have done is made a created a php script that md5 hash the images and then my java captures the output and then compares it against hash stored using the preferences api

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works great in google-chrome firefox safari ie8 and ie6-9 via ietester

4363132
xmltype	clob
first just to load the file you can either use sql loader to load the data as an xmltype or you can use something like dbms_xslprocessor.read2clob to read the file as a clob and then convert it to an xmltype

4363137
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
it has a uitabbarcontroller containing uinavigationcontroller presenting uitableviews that eventually lead to a uiviewcontroller that sets hidesbottombarwhenpushed to yes in its designated initializer to hide the uitabbar

4363137

if it does it calls one of two methods either to hide or show that row matches or nomatch

4363219
hide	show
if there are no visible rows i hide the header otherwise i show it

4363240
innodb	myisam
myisam and innodb behave differently in this regard for various reasons

4363240
innodb	myisam
for instance innodb will partition disk space for each column on disk regardless of whether it has data in it while myisam will compress the tables on disk

4363240
innodb	myisam
on the other hand innodb does row-level locking which means that with caveats concurrent read writes to the same table will perform better myisam does a table-level lock on write

4363888
post	get
note this only affects get requests post requests work just fine since there s no re-using of the connection

4363930
post	get
using gaetestbed or your own unittest code like this simply instantiate your handler classes directly using a mocked fake environment dictionary and call the methods initialize and get post etc in the case of webapp directly

4363971
tftp	tcp	udp	tcp	udp	tftp
if you can t use tcp perhaps your client don t have enough cpu power or ram to handle tcp consider using some easy to code udp based protocol like tftp

4363971
udp	tftp
the tftp udp ip stack was coded in pure tp 7 with only static allocated memory and was working great

4363971
udp	tcp
but if you don t have such low cpu requirements rather consider using tcp ip instead of udp ip

4363978
hide	show
recently i created a megadrop down menu but i started getting a lot of recommendations to use the hoverintent plugin instead of using show hide

for example it s sometimes used in for-loop clauses in a non-confusing manner to allow several variables to be updated on each loops iteration

4364120
httphandler	httpmodule
what you want to do is generally achieved via httpmodule and not via httphandler

4364155

hope that s enough info to get you started i can post you some interesting links when i get to the real keyboard

4364159
children	parent
a parent - which contains some properties an item collection and a collection of children

4364164
x86	64bit
as for why there is an x86 subdirectory that s because your compiler also supports other cpus like arm for android win phone 7 and iphone and also to differentiate between 32bit and 64bit

4364205
ireport	subreports
i had a report which include multi-level subreports everything works fine on ireport 3.7.5

4364381
hash	md5
to do this i m imagining taking an md5 of the memory then using this hash as a key into the database

4364414
equals	gethashcode
you have to override equals and gethashcode

4364416
equals	gethashcode
you can override this behaviour by overriding the equals and gethashcode methods

4364423
equals	gethashcode
also when overriding the equals method it is good practice to override the gethashcode method as well

4364431
equals	gethashcode
you can override this behaviour overriding equals and gethashcode

4364436
versioning	upgrade
i decided to upgrade three20 to the latest versioning as well but i encountered the compile issue listed here note apple login required

4364438
put	get	post	get	post	put
the reason you get the post not supported message is that your form uses post and your handler is annotated with put so it doesn t match

4364461
equals	gethashcode	equals	tostring	tostring	gethashcode
that doesn t mean you should simply make it a struct as to avoid boxing etc you would also need to override gethashcode and equals anyway plus tostring - and by the time you ve done that you could have done it for the existing code

4364473
int	boolean
then use method items int searchtype long startdate long enddate boolean initialeventonly to iterate over events

put	get
but don t forget to put in your latex doc the lengthy preamble which you get with document t

4364544
postgresql	mysql
gorm hibernate will automatically create foreign keys which are important as well. given the necessary indexes are in place and a dbms that provides a decent query optimizer postgresql oder sql server - maybe not mysql you can select from millions of records using 10 joins in 50 milliseconds or less.

4364545
hide	show
this takes a few seconds and i m able to hide this in the time the splash screen show at startup

4364572
post	get
in that case i thought the form element at the server is not required to handle post if i can get the post data from the request object itself

4364620
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
fortunately other major browsers like firefox and google-chrome barring safari do not throw page not found errors when a link with a custom protocol is clicked and the protocol is not installed on the users machine

free	malloc
this will allow to you to provide a custom malloc and free in a dynamic library which will predominate the libc provided ones

4364816
do-while	break
break ends execution of the current for foreach while do-while or switch structure

4364821
free	malloc
i assume you define malloc and free in the main.cpp file that you try to compile and that mem_alloc and mem_free are located in libmemnmf-0.a

4364821
free	malloc
when the linker includes the objects from glibc and finds that these objects require a malloc free symbol it will try to include the malloc free from the glibc library directly

4364821
free	malloc
this will obviously include another malloc and free object in your executable

4364821
free	malloc
what you should do is put the malloc and free routines in a separate .o file and add that file somewhere in your link-command preferrably on the end assuming you do not specify the standard library in a special way on that line

4364871
strstr	strcmp
scansb is the assembly variant for strcmp not for strstr

the point of it being protected instead of public is to ensure that it s only called by subclasses or within the text of foo itself

4365799
jena	dotnetrdf
both arq jena and leviathan dotnetrdf support the majority of the emerging sparql 1.1 specification

4365911

rss	feed
at the end of the day an rss feed is an xml document that adheres to a predefined schema

4366236
rss	feed
you can also put information in the head of your web page markup to inform the browser that an rss feed is available to them this is optional

4366236
rss	feed
.net 3.5 3.5 introduced system.servicemodel.syndication this wraps up the various rss formats that are available and makes the process of creating your feed much easier

4366607
for-loop	loops
now what the for-loop executes is clearly defined and if we wanted to do more in our loops we would add the extra instructions in between the curly braces

4366624
for-loop	loops
the reason loops continues rather than quitting is because without squiggly brackets to indicate a statement block the for-loop will only loops the single statement immediately following loops - that is the console.writeline

4366639
for-loop	loops
that is the basic of the for-loop in that loops you declare that the starting value of integer i is zero and it should continue to loops until i is equal to the length of string argsin and increase the value of i on each iteration

4366676

google-chrome	firefox
and yes for the picky ones firefox and google-chrome have adopted these kind of dialogs but they don t work quite the same

4367179
try-catch	exception-handling
good exception-handling handling in c++ is not about writing try-catch all over but to catch where you know how to handle it like you seem to want to do

4367602
put	get
higher values decrease the space overhead but increase the lookup cost reflected in most of the operations of the hashmap class including get and put .

4367639
free	malloc
since you re using malloc to initialize the cycle_list cycles and vertex_list vertices members you should use free to clean them up

4367665
jar	war
project is packing into war and dependency a - into jar

4367710
versioning	upgrade
i have an application which runs on rails 2.3.2 and now i upgrade my versioning of rails to 3.0.3

what i wanted to achieve is there any way through which i can get the exact height or width of image minus transparent background

4367961
move	drag
i want to do this because i m trying to implement a drag move gesture

4367999
wtl	atl
my app is vs2010 c++ with wtl not mfc or atl

4368068
width	height
in my own experience with visual studio 2010 in order to see the line in the designer view i had to set non zero width and height while also using x y to set the line within that space

4368090
width	height
so in code you could either check the width and height of the imageview or the image it contains and get the same numbers

store your temporary iis files on your fastest disk or a ram disk

4368487
for-loop	loops
but if the for-loop is small feel free to unroll loops too

4368496
next	except
perhaps someone will have a better idea but the only thing that comes immediately to mind is to add a resetup flag so that you could sort of replay a script of the user s previous activity navigation actions within your app having your activities start each other up in turn but due to the resetup flag bypassing most of their code so they don t really do anything except essential setup and start the next one

4368526
uitableview	uisearchbar

this will be slow but you should initially build your code with floating-point support then profile to see if there are just a few places that you need to convert to fixed-point to get sufficient performance

4368562
floating-point	fixed-point
you will also need to have the floating-point stuff running to provide a comparison as you port to fixed-point to make sure you haven t lost anything in the process

4368861
zoo	xts
this could be some example data stored in xts or zoo object

4368861
zoo	xts
i didn t figure out how to do this using the xts-formatted data or if this even suits the purpose of the xts zoo formatting of the data which seems to always carry the year information along it

4368894
children	parent
in other words the select works properly if i select all categories that has the top parent marked as main it will display the tree with all categories including children categories marked with

it is particularly aimed at irregular time-series of numeric vectors matrix and factors

4369063
google-chrome	firefox
i m not worried about varying values between ie google-chrome i can debug that just the way mouse position is interpreted but firefox not picking any values is confusing me

4369065
touchesbegan	touchesended
unfortunately returning no for touchesshouldbegin blocks the touchesbegan and touchesended methods

4369082
for-loop	loops
the only noticeable difference is that find uses a for-loop because it already knows the number of elements and first uses a foreach loops because it doesn t know it

4369256
linefeed	delimiter
we have an access application interfacing with a sql server database and we need to find a way to programmatically export a given view to an excel spreadsheet -- or at least an excel compatible spreadsheet csv tab delimiter etc. i can use bcp however several of the views contain fields with linefeed in them which proves troublesome when importing to excel

4369262
fadein	fadeout
i m trying to fadeout a row and fadein as the last row in the table but i can t get the fadein to work

from your code -- put that in and you will get more information about failing code in your error log

4369461
folder	directory
i need to have it in a compressed folder called by a specific name and then upload that folder to a specific directory

4369488
sorting	filtering
it supports server-side processing for sorting filtering and paging

4369488
sorting	filtering
with an html table so you could send down a bunch of html and then have all the sorting filtering and paging work client-side

4369520
inline	inlining
while i believe that the jit prior to that will still inline small methods properties are simply methods after all there is a bug in the earlier frameworks that prevented inlining of methods that take or return value types

4369535
hide	show
i assume you have some other tags that have the specific image descriptions so you ll have to show hide them too

4369542
hide	show
clicking on the movie hide the conrols the status bar clicking again show the controls and the status bar comes back too

4369673
folder	directory
you probably need to check to see if the directory folder exists and if it doesn t then you need to create it on the ftp

4369685
post	get
be sure that it fits the http model of simple request reply get post processing

4369687
filesystems	fat
if you are talking about the sdcard with a fat filesystems i believe based on past recovery of an accidentally saved back picture edit that linux doesn t even try to write back to the same blocks of the filesystems

width	height
this will allow you to add url parameters for width and height on a fancybox by fancybox basis

4369783
width	height
how can i change the height and width of the slider as the window is resized

4369795
post	get
basically what you get is an array similar to post but with things like file size temp name and the temporary location of the file which you can use to test and move the file to a permanent location

4369861
folder	directory
instead of looking in the project s bin debug folder it looks for it in the test s working directory c projects sap reapprovals testresults name_machine 2010-12-06 13_45_43 out

4369900
facade	memento
facade and memento

4369904
getter	setter
i d personally err on the side of caution and stick with the property setter and getter as potentially the method body might change and as a result the raw field access mutation may not be enough

4369926
button	checkbox
um they seem to work quite okay js fiddle demo except that without the position absolute the after content appears within the element itself inside the button or checkbox and so on

4369938
for-loop	loops
also on the first line is a typical for-loop for each item resulting from the sub-shell we loops once storing the value of the item in the variable kind

4369995
floating-point	fractions
firstly floating-point numbers use a base-2 internal representation in which it is impossible to represent some decimal fractions exactly

4369995
floating-point	integer	floating-point	fractions	integer	fractions
secondly the reason floating-point numbers are called floating-point is that instead of using a fixed precision for the integer part and a fixed precision for the fractions part they offer a continuous trade-off between magnitude and precision

4369995
integer	fractions
as the magnitude of the integral part increases the bits that were previously used for precision are now needed to store the larger integer value and so the accuracy of the fractions part is compromised

4369996
stateless	stateful
jsf is used often so you d have managed beans and probably stateless or stateful ejb s also

4370057
equals	gethashcode	equals	tostring	tostring	gethashcode
it should and it does override the object methods equals tostring and gethashcode

4370079

min	max
then i would like to sort the resulting list consisting of key value pairs from min to max depending on the 2nd element value

4370128
min	max	range	max	range	min
i am looking for a numeric spinner that has a property for incremental value .25 .5 .75 supports auto-rounding in case someone types in a value or an change event max and min range and support for custom images would be great

post	get
i can grab info and post it just fine however when i get to the point of uploading images it seems to work no runtime errors image in wp media tab however it uploads a broken image link

4370161

maybe you could hide one view then show the other using a uiview animations block

4370178
uitableview	reloaddata
first off there s a reloaddata method on a uitableview which you can use to force it to reload its data

4370193
appfuse	spring
as a comment on the actual question i don t think either of the two is way better than the other in the actual entity generation but there is a big difference of course between appfuse and spring roo aside from the entity generation

4370193
appfuse	spring
if you actually need dao s this is something that comes out-of-the-box in appfuse and put partly in spring roo but there is also a great addon for spring roo hades addon that does a great job at this maybe even better than appfuse

4370193
wicket	appfuse
main reason to go for appfuse in my humble opinion is if you require another web framework ie wicket

4370193
jsf	tapestry
tapestry or jsf as front end then spring mvc or gwt as these are currently the only well supported web frameworks within spring roo more coming though like flex etc.

4370193
appfuse	spring
other reason you might go for appfuse is if you want to use an ide with full intellisense and code-completion support but don t want to use eclipse you can use other ide s and build works perfectly well with spring roo but due to the aspectj files which aren t recognized by netbeans other ide s then eclipse currently don t do code completion well for the spring roo generated managed files

4370223
division	subtract
with a little math think about integer division by 7 you can get the number of mon-thursday days in that range subtract the number of holidays that don t fall on the weekend from that number and you are done

4370236
avr	microcontroller
microcontroller pic msp430 avr assume these are not microcoded

4370239
min	max	range	max	range	min
i m currently using the data function to clamp the values out of range to the y axis min max but this displays misleading data

4370253
loops	if-statement
your nested loops will execute if-statement many of them invalid because of wrong combinations of numbers

4370277
getter	setter
in this case an errant synthesize tableview at the top of the implementation file generating conflicting getter and setter

4370302
division	multiplication
firstly multiplication and division is actually quicker in some circumstances

4370324
google-chrome	firefox
i would get an extension like noscript for firefox or notscript for google-chrome

4370356
post	get
you re doing a post but your resource says that destroy_image is only available via get

4370413
boost	stl
you do not have to use an implementation file if you tell the vs wizard that you want to create an inline class it will only create the header file but typically that is only done for template classes the stl classes and many of the classes in the boost library or very simple classes

4370435
range	max
for operations which can possibly overflow the range of the variables you need to add checks for overflow and decide how to handle it - pin it at max store with a different scale raise an error etc

4370442
jax-ws	jax-rs
since then the java standards committee created a new api named jax-rs the rest counterpart to jax-ws

4370452
awt	swing
awt swing allows to show application modal blocking the whole application and parent modal blocking only the parents dialogs

4370464
int	double	int	chars
my core api class varies based on std vectors of built-in numeric types chars uchar short ushort int uint float and double

4370487
children	parent
you actually say you re looking for this count but only for nodes what are children of a main parent

4370490
children	parent
prior to the code in question i ve successfully created a parent and three children

4370509
getter	setter
blazeds will not serialize a property unless it has both a getter and a setter

4370687
apache	nginx
before phusion passenger allowed rails hosting with apache and nginx deploying a rails app was scary and difficult

4370687
apache	nginx
nginx is not as mature but is very efficient also very configurable and a great alternative to apache for rails hosting. webrick and mongrel are great for development but unless you are an expert it is difficult to set them up for production use

4370710
width	height
one thing i was thinking was surrounding the input with a div of the same width height and giving the div the hover background image and on hover fade the span out to opacity of something like 0.01 so that it would still be clickable but be transparent

4370722
getter	setter
this may also allow you to declare dummy getter setter that satisfy your other requirements without screwing up the jpa commits and retrieves

4370726
hex	binary
i am also using hxd hex editor to look at the binary

4370730
post	get
when you post a message you also return new messages and things shouldn t get out of order

4370783
accurev	cvs
the pulldown menu only has accurev cmvc cvs and clearcase so i specify a subversion project in the local location so it can auto-detect

4370791
apache	nginx
there are two ways around this either you run several ruby application servers and put a load balancer or reverse proxy in front of them nginx or apache in front of a pack of mongrels or thin servers the number of processes you run reflects the number of requests you will be able to handle in parallel

4370791
apache	nginx
or you run passenger which is an apache or nginx module that manages a pool of applications that can dynamically grow and shrink as the load changes

4370795
xdebug	xhprof
i know there is a way to achieve such a task with facebook s xhprof profiler but was hoping for a similar solution using xdebug

4370800
int	double
i need to pass an array to a function in c# where the array may be a string int or double and may be 1 to multiple dimensions

i ve used javascript in the past to force the form fields on a page to match the query string but there are issues with that approach firefox and safari don t normally execute the onload event for the window when loading a page from the cache and it seems like a hack to me

post value from index.php then get the value by self without refresh the page

4370940
int	chars
a trivial compression would be a b c d e f and if the chars set is known beforehand and only those 6 chars you could even pack things into a 16-bit int

4370951
screens	mdpi
i ve been testing my application on a samsung moment which is an mdpi screens

4370951
screens	hdpi
today i went to test my application on a samsung epic 480x800 which is a hdpi screens

4371003
width	height
i have been searching for a solution to resize the text size in a div to make the text fill out the entire div height and width with no avail

4371003
width	height
so this is a simple div with a height and width set

4371003
width	height
this height and width does not change the text in the box does

4371003
width	height
so what i want to do is to make that text fill the whole width and height of the div just like in the image below

4371016
pop-up	dialog
currently at about 4 minutes of inactivity a jquery ui dialog pop-up warning the user of their impending timeout

4371044

i have a for-loop and on each loops i want to add a new line of text to the end of the file in question but every time it adds a new line it removes all the other text leaving just that line

4371247
children	parent
i have two lists parent children

4371247

set path.data.transform to a scaletransform with scalex and scaley bound to the actual width and height

4371513
post	get
your delete page tries to access both _get id and _post id which won t ever both be set since an http request is always of a single method get or post or head etc

4371523
curlpp	libcurl
but you tagged this c++ so if you want a c++ wrapper for libcurl then use curlpp

4371574
put	get
this is also a bit of a hack but the only thing i could get working was to put an intermediate delegate on the nstextview s layer so that all selectors are passed through but drawlayer incontext then calls the nstextview s drawrect

4371574
nstextview	nscell
it might be worthwhile looking for an nscell backing the nstextview as it s probably a lot more appropriate to use this instead

4371596
dosbox	djgpp
it is not clear to me that dosbox supports dpmi but i imagine that it does and djgpp itself is in the dosbox compatability list so one would imagine that the code it generates might run also if it does not do anything too out of the ordinary to the emulated hardware

4371618
for-loop	loops
for a while loops it looks ok but even more messy for a for-loop or a foreach loops

4371619
required	placeholder
another option that doesn t required subclassing - leave placeholder blank and put a label on top of edit button

4371621
goto	break
you have to use goto to break out of multiple loop levels in c#

4371726
client-side	server-side
xmlhttprequest is used on the client-side in chrome webkit browsers to fetch server-side resources without page refreshing and content is dynamically loaded in and animations can be hooked in during that content being appended

4371734
client-side	server-side
as has been said a million times client-side validations are good because you can use them to keep well-behaved users from hitting your server with bad requests but every validation client-side must be mirrored server-side as well

4371755
put	get
i am trying to put a variable htmlcontent into a div element and refer to the divid to show on the thickbox but i am unable to get it working

ord	chr
if you don t know what the python functions ord and chr do look them up in the interactive interpreter using help ord and help chr .

4371896

4371908
put	get
the breakpoints i put on java code get hit but the ones i put on

4371977

looks like the trick is that the canvas element needs its width and height specified

4372051
mockups	balsamiq	mockups	prototyping
my suggestion instead is to prototype with an ria prototyping tool like balsamiq mockups or use a grid system like 960 grid to generate rapid prototypes then use a web development framework that allows your developers to run the code with or without the backend server

4372054
gmail	hotmail
how do i achieve this with php without having to pay for my own smtp server and without having to use my own gmail hotmail account

compressed a file with gzip on the command-line and read it with a gzipinputstream wrapped around a fileinputstream

4372259
cos	sin
the tabsin and tabcos are defined prior to the function so that they are just a sin and cos of the angle

4372265
button	checkbox
i needed this same functionality but after reading aseptik s solution i was suspicious since it seems to enable the button any time a checkbox gets checked and disabled the button any time a checkbox gets unchecked

4372265
button	checkbox
my reading of the code suggested that the solution would appear to work as long as you only test it by checking and unchecking one checkbox -- try checking one checkbox then a second then unchecking one of them leaving only one checked -- you will see your button disabled even though one of your checkbox is checked

4372282
installation	upgrade
pip -e var www env example.com install --upgrade django will work properly and upgrade the django installation however you may want to read the release notes for django 1.2 and be aware of any backwards incompatible changes that may break your code

4372779

as mentioned use i1.equals i2 to compare - in addition also remember that you have to override gethashcode when overriding equals otherwise your class might not work as expected

4372786
cpython	pypy
py2exe appears to depend on cpython s c api which i m pretty sure pypy doesn t support

4372786
cpython	pypy
that is i can t see why pypy would support the cpython api nor did i see any mention it in any of the obvious places on their website...

4372832

4373017
google-chrome	firefox
one of my extensions has enjoyed popularity on google-chrome and i would like to share that with firefox users

4373083
ant	maven
also note that while maven is no slower than ant for multi-module projects of this sort importing your maven project into an ide will generally result in far faster builds than maven can perform itself

4373086
maven	m2e
working in the eclipse ide with m2e you can enable workspace dependency management for compile time as well as in maven launch configuration

4373089

currently my testing app writes raw pixel data directly to a file after each undo using nsdata writetofile atomically but i am getting 0.6s delay

4373221
minix	linux
study linux and the better bits of minix and if you go with a ready-made bootloader as some here have suggested i d go with lilo over grub these are just personal prefs of course

try using valgrind specifically the memcheck part

4373231
width	height
img src . images images. randomindex width 100 height 100 border 0 alt random image title random image

4373307
allocator	stl
the reason this came to mind is that most of the c++ standard library all of the stl if i recall correctly lets the user specify how and where to perform allocator but if std inplace_merge requires an allocator by design it seems that there is no way to control this if it were an issue

4373353
mouse	keyboard
applications that rely on mouse keyboard emulation are brittle at best

4373375
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox

width	height
i have these mapped in my .gvimrc to let me hit command- arrow to move the height and width of my current window around

4373511
google-chrome	firefox
the first one is that i am getting a break in firefox ie and google-chrome between the top img and the logo

4373637
post	put
my idea is that each time a consumer processes anything and looks up to put it in the output it should make a call on something like post on a semaphore

4373666
keydown	keyup
the functionality i d like to add needs a keypress keyup keydown event handler one of those three

4373666
google-chrome	firefox
i ve checked in google-chrome and firefox both i can t get it to work in either one

4373676
firefox	safari
this should load an ugly blue placeholder which i get in safari but in firefox swfobject just gives me the alternative content

4373763
packets	multicast
but in my experience even when doing that only one of the sockets will receive any given packets unless you re receiving multicast packets

4373763
udp	tcp
normally though when you talk about a multithreaded server you re talking about a server using a connection oriented protocol over tcp not udp where there is a server socket listening for connections and then when a connection is formed it creates a thread to deal with it

4373764
width	margin
but when i resize it the column width is not accounting for the margin of the row and the words are cut off by like 10px and then if i double click the column it will resize without cutting off the words

4374082
firefox	safari
in other browsers for example firefox 3.6 and safari 5 it all works as expected

4374090
outputstream	inputstream
reader and writer are for text data and operate on characters and strings inputstream and outputstream work with binary data raw bytes

4374090
outputstream	inputstream
to convert between the two wrap an inputstream into a reader or an outputstream into a writer you need to choose a character set

4374090
outputstream	inputstream
i m feeling strange why not read out from outputstream but from inputstream

4374090
outputstream	inputstream
of course somewhere on the other end of the stream someone might treat your outputstream as their inputstream .

4374095
public	protected
security - the sensitive data needs to be protected - transport is fine because we can use something on the transport layer tls ssl ipsec however storing card numbers on the sender side public network is not ideal.

4374097
namedtuple	dictionary
if you re looking for something that is like a dictionary but also immutable then namedtuple might be your best bet from what s in the standard library

4374125
mouse	keyboard
the major problem with trying to override this behavior like overriding the default behavior of any control is that there are a lot of ways for the user to accomplish it clicking and dragging with the mouse double-clicking the mouse button using the arrow keys on the keyboard in combination with the shift key tabbing into the textbox right-clicking and choosing select all from the context menu etc.

4374125
onmousedown	onkeydown
your first instinct might be to override the potentially relevant events exposed by the .net framework such as onmousedown onkeydown etc. and reset the selected length to 0 so that the text is immediately unselected after it is automatically selected

4374133
outputstream	inputstream
the inputstream outputstream classes and subclasses are for reading and writing byte-based data without any assumptions about character encodings or that the data is text

4374133
outputstream	inputstream
in simple terms an outputstream writer is something you write to a data sink and an inputstream or reader is something you read from a data source

4374136
innodb	myisam
if you are using innodb or myisam table types a better approach is to use the handler interface

4374170

on another note which might be helpful to others it seems event delegation is only possible with firefox and not opera google-chrome or safari

4375847
portrait	landscape
for example if a 1024x768 splash image is used and the initial view doesnâ t support portrait viewing through orientation locks this can cause visual ui objects to appear off screen especially when animation is involved as the view will try and present itself in a portrait configuration even though the device may be in landscape

4375847
portrait	landscape
generally 1024x768 images imply portrait while 768x1024 images imply landscape

if the headers match the divs in number and order and they are children of some parent without other siblings you might be able to make use of the jquery index method

4376168

mouseover	mouseout
for all the other issues it s because mouseover and mouseout fire when entering children you re seeing the most common side-effect flickering with animations

4376826
hash	salt
store passwords as salt hash

4376843
for-loop	loops
if you re doing that within your for-loop then yes you are starting new processes every time through loops

4376847
versioning	upgrade
that s the biggest thing you need to be sure of -- keep an eye on drupal versioning and always upgrade when a security update is released

4376865
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox after a while the form gets submitted something like 10seconds and in ie it crashes

4376885
pbkdf2	hash
if the hash is computed with a large number of iterations with pbkdf2 and the encryption is a simple application of a password run through a single iteration of a hash function to get the key data then the encrypted value would actually be the weak point in terms of cpu cost

4376919

i am referring to the following link for xml serializable deserialization

4377093
post	get
in general i recommend you to use httpclient for implementing http conversations in java anything more complicated than a simple one-time get or post

4377106
post	get
the third party tool makes an http post request to the webservice to get user information

4377154
versioning	upgrade
i can t upgrade the jquery versioning thus can t use live

4377160
ant	maven
the underlying build system used in spring roo is maven where jboss seam uses ant

4377160
ant	maven
seam can for as far as i know also be used with maven but seam-gen by default uses ant

4377160
jsf	seam
seam with seam-gen is mainly targetted for using jsf as the web framework while spring roo is focused on spring mvc and or gwt as its web framework

4377160
wicket	seam	jsf	wicket	jsf	seam
if you want to use jsf or wicket go for seam while if you want to use spring mvc or gwt use spring roo for other web frameworks it probably doesn t really matter which you choose though spring roo might then be a better solution

4377171
glut	fltk
fltk provides modern gui functionality without the bloat and supports 3d graphics via openglâ and its built-in glut emulation

4377196
folder	directory
what you need to realize is that this does not actually remove the source directory from the deployment but the output folder associated with that source directory

4377196
folder	directory
by default all source directory share the same output folder

4377196
folder	directory
if you remove one source directory from the deployment assembly in this situation you still get its classes since another source directory outputs to the same output folder and eclipse copies over the complete output folder completely disregarding which source folder contributed which classes

4377196
folder	directory
the solution is to associate an independent output folder which each source directory that you want to exclude

4377224
min	max	range	max	range	min
for instance looking for a level-12 weapon one would pick randomly an axe min 0 max 72 pick randomly of fire min 6 max 72 eliminate sharp min 24 max 72 pick randomly dull min 6 max 18 and then use a fudge value of 2 12 6 for the range

4377306
put	get
the idea of the http methods is that when a the characteristics of a request fit those of get put and delete you should use them

4377306
post	get
there are numerous hybrid approaches one of which is to post the query parameters and have the server create a new temporary resource that represents the query and then return a redirect so the client does a get on the temporary query resource

4377316
folder	directory
i m using visual studio 2008 and easyphp whose directory includes ext folder php extensions directory

4377368
octal	decimal
033 is an octal number in c because it has a leading 0 and that means its value is 27 in decimal

4377384
google-chrome	firefox
it is only supported by firefox and google-chrome so far but as usual the others will adopt it sooner or later read later

4377395
std	ostream
either add using std ostream

4377395
std	ostream
whatever you do don t be tempted to use either using std ostream

4377399
hide	show
this is the jquery code to show and hide an elements

4377432

in post handler i was expecting the command object to have all the properties that was loaded in get handler in addition to the properties that are bound with jsp

4377445
post	get
in post handler i was expecting the command object to have all the properties that was loaded in get handler in addition to the properties that are bound with jsp

4377475
put	get
in your case if you get rid of the scalar variables and just put the subqueries inline it should work

4377501
webclient	httpwebrequest
beyond that you just need to pick a data store to hold your processed data you can use any database technology for that and a way to download content from the web which .net provides two high-level mechanisms for the webclient and httpwebrequest httpwebresponse classes

4377551
google-chrome	firefox
it works totally fine in firefox and google-chrome but the background image and text don t display in ie8

4377564

note 2 the lookup table would contain c escape sequences for codes that have them n r etc and backslash plus hex octal decimal codes for those that don t

4377612
uialertview	uipickerview
i am afraid it is not possible to pack uipickerview into uialertview

4377659
postgresql	mysql
i found this post very useful - migrating django from mysql to postgresql the easy way

4377709
int	chars
i tend to store timestamps in int 10 format as a unix timestamp will always be 10 chars long

4377709
int	chars
it s recommended to use int instead of varchar or chars as when you use sql s order syntax it won t get the order incorrect

4377709
mktime	strtotime
say you want to convert from a date to a timestamp you could either use strtotime or mktime depending on what you re doing

4377713
width	height
however you may also consider sizing your child elements in updatedisplaylist which will always give you the the height and width of your container which i suspect is more important for sizing purposes than the screen resolution

4377740
temp	tmp
i have to store file paths in a db field tmp aaa bbb c temp xxx yyy etc.

4377755
associativity	operator-precedence
in particular it doesn t support several expression features and it doesn t add parentheses where required by operator-precedence associativity

4377755
associativity	operator-precedence
adds parentheses where required by operator-precedence and associativity is correctly regenerated

4377794
pull	push
with that parameter i could pull out the the information from the order model and then push it into a block which made a nice html formatted invoice

4377809
inherited	properties
on ui you can use inherited to not duplicate properties

4377809
inherited	properties
for example if you have a model with 10 properties but need to edit only 2 of them create editmodel and inherited viewmodel from it

4377810
cassini	iis
it has been working fine in dev and on a number of web servers running cassini and iis

4377827
hash	md5
each method that returns an a set of results you would them md5 the query to create a unique hash for that query you would then check to see if it exists in the cache if so you would return instead otherwise just run a new query fetching the results and then before you return them store them within the cache

4377876
pop-up	dialog
most people are used to seeing a save dialog pop-up when saving a document

4377888
mouse	keyboard	mouse	joystick	joystick	keyboard
there you can basically define which input events mouse keyboard joystick touchscreen are mapped to what actions

4377888
mouse	keyboard
for example if you want mouse and keyboard movement you have to add horizontal and vertical axis twice

4377888
mouse	keyboard
once for mouse input one for keyboard input

4377891

4378046
stdout	stderr
presuming test_app is a program that outputs one line to stdout and one line to stderr

4378062
many-to-many	one-to-many
one-to-many can be modeled with a inside a while many-to-many is the only case in which having a mapping could be good since otherwise you would have to explore both objects to understand their mappings

4378128
many-to-many	one-to-many
this answer does not change if it s a one-to-many or many-to-many relationship

4378151
srp	principles
an object that can save itself to the database would violate srp single responsibility principles

4378181
hash	salt
if you don t use in app purchases you could set up your own authentication process and give a token to the device and have your server remember said tokens and then later only serve valid responses for requests that had the said token appropriately hash and salt

4378348
put	get
you can then put a feature condition on it to control whether the components brought in by the merge modules get installed or not

4378364
post	get
if you have to use webforms don t use the postback and page lifycycle model - have aspx pages with presenters for get requests and have a handler or empty aspx per post

4378400
orientdb	neo4j
my suggestion is to pick a java-based graph db like orientdb or neo4j and then use it via the php java bridge

4378400
orientdb	neo4j
in the near future neo4j and at some point orientdb as well should get native php support and you can replace the bridge with native access

4378432
loops	while-loop
this means your code to update the progress bar in the while-loop is holding the ui event lock and prevents other ui updates from happening until the while loops terminates -- in this case when thread.isrunning returns false

4378435
accelerometer	gyroscope
i have recently come across a few websites that seems to access the accelerometer or gyroscope on my laptop detecting changes in orientation or movement

4378443
set	bag
is it mapped as a bag or as a set

4378478
ssl	https
since you set ssl options you probably use https

4378484
disk	ram
nodexl does scale in part in proportion to the amount of ram disk and cpu available

4378534
google-chrome	safari
as you mention support is limited to google-chrome and safari at present

feedback	review
after the review is done this document is sent back to the student with proper feedback

4378575
folder	directory
change the name of wp-contents folder to something else and move it outside of the main wp directory

4378575
folder	directory
this code in your wp-config.php file will help to install in a directory and move wp-contents outside of it into an includes folder

4378580
put	get
my idea is if i get data with page load from server and put it in some array in javascript and as user click it get data from client side

4378627
mouseover	mouseout
the jquery menu is programmed to animate out on mouseover and collapse on mouseout

4378627
width	height
ul.inactive3 .stop .animate width 500px height 150px fast function

4378627
width	height
ul.inactive3 .stop .animate width 500px height 300px fast

4378627
width	height
ul.inactive3 .stop .animate width 500px height 150px fast function

4378627
width	height
ul.inactive3 .stop .animate width 0px height 0px fast

4378643
width	height
as you see it sets the background right top with some width and height with #af7a38 color background for the rest of column but what i want to do is to set another background instead of color for example setting this

4378656
pull	push
all development commit push pull merge is done in the individual subrepos

4378668
post	get
the problem is that the edit action takes a get not a post so it s probably never getting called

4378721
filtering	grouping	squash	branch
if it is just you using the repo or a select grouping of folks that you can easily communicate with then you can safely squash or filtering see below to clean up history and then when they fetch they ll need to manually reset all their branch heads to the new heads

4378732
switching	screens
but if for some reason you have to use a modalviewcontroller you could either just deactivate the tabbar while the modalview is shown or try to implement a switching or a simple if...else case in your viewwillappear where u check what screens to load

4378765
umask	chmod
in this case use 770 as the file permission and ensure that files created by php get this permission either explicitly after creating with chmod or with umask before creation

4378772
superclass	subclassing
that said i don t have any problem with throwing a superclass and its subclassing

4378778
rss	feed
what i have considered is creating an rss feed that is polled by the client and lets the client know when these particular areas need to be updated

4378778
rss	feed
the rss feed will be managed by a service that either polls the database for changes or iterates through a list of items that are queued up by the wcf requests made by the client

4378779
pull	push
in git each user has their own repo which is cloned from the central repo and they push and pull from the central repo which as philipp points out should be bare when you create it do git --bare init

4378779
pull	push
that repo should be shared of course but only so that people can push and pull from it

4378803
onchange	onsubmit
and if you use the onchange and not onsubmit setting the hidden input value when the combo changes not when the form is submitted the id attribute is useless too

4378817
folder	directory
this is possible if we manually create a filesystemwatcher and watch the parts directory here some dlls inside the folder and track any changes then we reflect the changes into a container which allows for recomposition

4378832
children	parent
you can get all of the children of the element s parent and exclude the element itself

4378834
postgresql	mysql
postgresql and mysql offers to write expression into order by clause in sql query

4378837
rss	feed
i am trying to parse live weather data from weatherbug s rss feed in php

4378840
single-quotes	double-quotes
if you use single-quotes instead of double-quotes the dollar sign won t be evaluated

4378840
single-quotes	double-quotes
generally speaking you should get in the habit of using single-quotes unless you really need double-quotes for something such as escaped hex values

4378849
x86	64bit
x86 64bit 00000000004004c0 main

4378849
x86	64bit
x86 64bit -duse_shiftor 080483a0 main

4378858
rss	feed
but if the expensive operation is the client pooling the server you can use an atom or rss feed with pubsubhubbub to minimize the number of requests to the server

rss	feed
with an rss feed you ll have to make a request for the feed get it parse it and take action based on the relevant values

4378912
width	height
all other attributes should be grouped by their impact - appearance related background foreground opacity etc. layout related height width aligments etc

4378912
width	height
not to have width in top of your attributes list and height somewere in the bottom

4378919
put	get
if you really want to fail graciouslly no matter what then yes put a nested try inside the except clause - but log the full traceback otherwise it can get really hard to debug

4378942
config	ini
if nothing exists at the above registry location i proceed to reading config at the standard location whether that s an ini file or another reg key does not matter

4378944
onchange	onsubmit
basically handle the onsubmit action of the form or the onchange of the dropdown list --both will work and change the form s action based on the value of the drop down list

4378952
children	parent
after all i assume the different children are all reading different slots so if you need to prevent them treading one ach other s toes you ll need to do the same for the parent too

4378952
children	parent
when it gets signalled the parent checks if he can write and the children check if they can read

4379006
hide	show
in the above we re using .toggle bool to do the hiding showing this allows us to hide show the depending on whether the checkbox we care about is checked

4379010
folder	directory
i tried to place the file in the main project repository folder and in the working directory

4379044
svg	vml
i would recommend using either svg if you can limit yourself to browsers that support it or a drawing api like raphaã l to abstract support over svg and vml for ie

4379084
width	height
what i am trying to do here is stretching an image to fit the page in height and width

4379090

serializable	deserialization
i would suggest creating a wrapper over membershipusercollection for your serializable deserialization purpose

4379419
rss	feed
i don t know if it s a bit too much for what you re wanting but websvn gives you an rss feed that you can then subscribe to in an rss reader

4379419
rss	feed
that way you just need to monitor the rss feed

4379469
post	get
when i need to store information between a get and a post that is set something on a get and read it back on a post i set a session attribute

4379540
iprincipal	iidentity
fortunately httpcontext itself is fakeable just enough for you do replace the iprincipal user and iidentity

4379588
richtextbox	tabcontrol
there does not seem to be a newtabadded type event for tabcontrol and the initialized event for the richtextbox does not seem to even make it to the code behind in the view

4379665
jar	war
figured it out just missing classes in the ejb jar in myproject s war web-inf lib folder

4379704
getter	setter
one thing you might be seeing is the magic getter and setter in the zend framework

4379760
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome as well as safari has really underestimated developer tools feature

4379773
filtering	grouping
i can also filtering by the grouping - but that s not what i want

georss	kml
problem is i can t figure out how to get access to the markers in a google map when the markers came from an external source kml georss

4379812
datagridview	xtragrid
i am looking for a free or very cheap alternative to the datagridview one that looks more like what i see on ads for xtragrid

4379819
int	double
your problem is probably due to type conversion from native .net types int double datetime etc. in your calling c# code to the oracle types number date used to store the values in the database

4379831
integer	unsigned
a simple and fast way is to use an unsigned integer as a cursor and shift it to advance the cursor

4379895
yacc	bison
i can t use lex flex and yacc bison

4379907
gridview	sqldatasource
edit i should note that i am using the sqldatasource for the outer gridview as it is also editable

4379930
folder	directory
by default it tries to create a directory and store a file in the currently logged in user s applicationdata folder

4379937
put	get
just to be more clear i need to check a directory for any file that ends in recipient or otherwise put if i were to use ls if a file with that name exists then i need to get its name

4379952
int	chars
i also belive that in the for-loop you are changing the pointer value itself and that would make only the first chars of s to be tested when testing the other chars of s search_chars will always be equal to 0 try using an int like len on the for-loop as well

4379972
tabcontrol	tabitem
use an eventsetter in the itemcontainerstyle for the tabcontrol to perform some logic when each tabitem loads

4379995
.htaccess	httpd.conf
personally i think the best place to put the addtype directive would be in apache s httpd.conf as .htaccess puts a performance hit on your server but in the case of shared hosting .htaccess is usually the only option available

4380034
getter	setter
then have your standard property getter and setter

4380035
width	height
i think #pagelength should have a fixed width height

4380048
post	get
then i would get the value of blog id then i would search in the list for comment post for that id

4380081
versioning	upgrade
remember to generate and use a new run-time license key if you change the name of your application assembly or if you upgrade to a newer major or minor versioning of the component dll

4380095
try-catch	exception-handling
when i put a try-catch block in run itself the contents of the catch block were correctly executed when an exception-handling was thrown

4380181
gridview	repeater
use a repeater for your outer databound control as it renders more efficiently and it will have the same effect you re trying to achieve with the outer gridview control

4380181
gridview	repeater
in your code behind retrieve your data for your outer gridview which is now a repeater and load it into a datatable and add it to a dataset do the same for data in the inner gridview

4380215
margin	height
another way is to use math and do calculation of the height of grid row and control and position it by margin

4380235
implements	extends
remember that an interface doesn t implements anything and so in deriving one interface from another you re merely extends the contract that must be implements by implements classes

4380245
children	parent
the problem is that this node which is updated also has some child menu items under it in the primary menu and when i update the node to change the parent its children just end up one level higher and don t get moved with current menu item

4380330
sorting	grouping
again i m grouping by one datetime successfully and then sorting by another datetime successfully confirmed in linqpad

4380337

4380408
post	get
i m facing a really annoying problem i created a form with spring s form-tags and when i insert text with non-latin characters i get a sequence of questionmarks.i ve used the characterencodingfilter in my web.xml but i m still facing the same problem i ve set characterencoding in utf-8 at the formbackingobject method of my controller i ve set page encoding charset and enctype to utf-8 with no result.i know there are similar post here and i ve tried the suggested solutions but nothing changed

4380498
hide	show
i am currently using this function to add and remove classes which show and hide my tabs perfectly

4380523
gridview	objectdatasource
i believe the gridview s sort is intended to work with something like an objectdatasource which knows to call a method to retrieve the data and pass a sort string into that method

4380559
try-catch	exception-handling
however a method definition will be placed outside the standard try-catch so you have to handle the exception-handling yourself

4380569
ceil	floor
the very best you can to is type cast to int or use php rounding functions like round floor or ceil

4380570
try-catch	exception-handling
in the short term you can change the declaration of the md5hash method in the second snippet to throw nosuchalgorithmexception that way you do without the try-catch and don t eat the exception-handling

4380570
try-catch	exception-handling
by the way the try-catch is not just useless it is potentially harmful since you could have a problem and not get notified about it because of the exception-handling getting eaten

4380579
google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to get rid of an exception that makes the library partially work on firefox and completely die in google-chrome

4380588
folder	directory
you do need to put the file in the directory above the .hg folder so the layout looks like

4380596
post	get
then when the user accesses the confirm via history or back its a get request not a post request and will not show the warning

4380638
boost	stl
and by the way the boost libraries are a tremendous complement to stl

4380655

rss	feed
i ended up writing a module that outputs as rss i used an access callback to validate the host and a key i appended in the url of the feed

4380719
google-chrome	firefox
i thought that binding the click event in javascript is done by using node.onclick and google-chrome firefox seem to agree with me but i saw it written .onclick here 4 times by 3 people so it can t be a typo and i doubt that it s a coincidence

4380728
bmp	png
and i need a image-type like png bmp ... which can hold this color with full transparency alpha 0

4380743
128bit	64bit
123ll a signed long long a 64bit or 128bit value depending on the environment

4380759
onresume	onpause
i m guessing that the behavior you are seeing is related to the lifecycle of the activities within android and you might need to move some of your processing to the onresume onpause or onstart onstop methods

4380824
ssl	https
even if you tried to put the login block in an iframe that uses https a man-in-the-middle attack might change the src of that iframe easily so you either make the loginbox a login link with https login page or you will need more resources to run your website with ssl for all webpages that has the login box .

4380825
svg	vml
it uses vml in ie but svg in all other browsers

4380825
svg	vml
as the op said you can grab the raw svg as it s a whole svg doc and download that he is looking for some similar functionality with vml

4380840
innodb	myisam
myisam doesn t support many of the enhanced data validation facilities supported by engines like innodb so you are generally at a disadvantage by starting with myisam

4380863
wikitext	mediawiki
i am already familiar with the mediawiki sitenotice page that needs to be editted but the one on wikipedia has css included and html elements that i don t believe is possible to duplicate in wikitext

4380881
maven	pom.xml
and then touch your pom.xml file in eclipse to make new maven build.

portrait	landscape
and when the app rotates to landscape i just set the alpha of the tableview to 0 in willrotatetointerfaceorientation and back to 1 when it rotates to portrait

4380947
width	height
i tried to come up with an equation with number of letters width height it s alright but it s not a 100 reliable because the characters widths are different so in some cases it doesn t apply very well

4380960
width	height
use a second div whose css position is fixed and whose width and height is equal to the window.innerheight window.innerwidth properties respectively

4381040
disk	ram
i know it reduces the size of the disk file -- what i m interested in here is that actual ram used

4381063
nunit	mspec
i am trying to grasp how writing unit tests with mspec feels in contrast pure to nunit

4381164
getter	setter
whenever you use self it will use the property setter and getter

4381177
stdout	stderr
if significant output is being written to stdout and or stderr or you re both reading and writing to the process

4381177
stdout	stderr
however it s when system buffers for any of stdin stdout or stderr fill up that blocking becomes likely and things can get more involved

4381177
stdout	stderr
if the child process fills up the stderr and or stdout buffers it ll likely block and wait for you to clear them

4381177
stdout	stderr
but if you re waiting for the process finish before you read from stdout or stderr

4381177
stdout	stderr
both stdout and stderr are monitored concurrently

4381177
stdout	stderr
if you re writing to stdin and reading from stdout a pipe you ll want to keep stdout and stderr clear and only write to stdin when its ready to receive input

4381177
stdout	stderr
simply waiting for the process to finish then reading stdout stderr probably works 90 of the time

4381240
vb.net	vb6
vb6 com components require sta threading which by default your vb.net apps will not run as

4381270
rvm	bundler
i have tried running bundler and also using rvm to install sqlite3 and i still have the same issue

4381281
openssl	gnutls
so i should be using openssl and not see gnutls

so it turns out when i switch to curlpp it uses gnutls instead of openssl

4381286
ivar	subclassing
this makes it possible to overwrite this variable access in a subclassing what would not be possible with direct ivar access

4381375

4381456
pull	push
let the worker fetch a request from the queue using a req rep connection and have it send the answer along with the original envelope when the processing is done using the same socket as above or even better through a separate push pull connection

4381466
accessor	properties
it is my understanding with the modern runtime this will not only synthesize the accessor for my properties but also the instance variable itself so i could then say in one of this class s methods and it would work just as if i d declared an instance variable

4381466
accessor	properties
i know there are sometimes when i want to keep a variable private and not give access to it externally but then i usually just declare the properties in my private class extension or i don t create a properties for it at all if i don t need accessor for it

4381515
for-loop	arrays
to enforce a particular order for your output just replace in your for-loop with an arrays of the object properties in the order you want to display them in your case

4381550
width	height
you might want to just set the height and width of the img tag in html to 100

4381581
post	get
you need to use httpwebrequest.getrequeststream to get the stream write your post data and make sure it is closed

4381615
curlpp	libcurl
curlpp is just a wrapper over libcurl it doesn t dictate which ssl implementation libcurl uses

4381615
openssl	gnutls	gnutls	libcurl	curlpp	gnutls	curlpp	libcurl
am not exactly sure how you ve come to the when i switch to curlpp it uses gnutls instead of openssl conclusion but i suspect that you have multiple libcurl.so installed the one libcurl uses and another that your app is using via curlpp

4381641

4381742
hex	binary
even if you prefer converting to binary sscanf ... 2x... is better than manually parsing hex numbers

4381759
junit	mockito
however if i right-click a single test function and choose run as - junit test i get an exception java.lang.nosuchmethoderror org.mockito.mockito.doanswer lorg mockito stubbing answer

4381759
junit	mockito
best i can think of is if eclipse is trying to help me by providing an outdated mockito artifact i m using 1.8.5 in my maven dependencies for the junit plugin akin to how the maven plugin can stick you with an oddball version of the maven runtime for certain tasks

4381802
ant	maven
building another maven but with more flexible support on top of ant using beanshell mostly is something i ve done already

4381821

where max and min are the maximum and minimum absolute values of the real and imaginary components and alpha and beta are two constants which are chosen to give a reasonable error distribution over the range of interest

4382115
ienumerable	ilist
because the ilist interface does not derive from the generic ienumerable but rather the non-generic version of ienumerable you can t use many of the extension methods on the enumerable class in the system.linq namespace

4382115
ienumerable	ilist
however if you know that the non-generic ilist implementation contains only implementations of ivendors then what you can do is call the cast extension method on ienumerable like so

4382122
background-image	background-color
to fix the problem one have to do one from the things 1 remove ui-widget-content class 2 use background css style instead of background-color 2 use background-image none together with the background-color style

4382129
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i currently have it set to 4ms per write and 2ms per read and this fixes it completely in older firefox google-chrome with http uploads and opera

dbcontext	objectcontext
even using objectcontext instead of dbcontext i can t figure out how this simple test scenario can be recreated without manually cleaning up any mock test objects created

4382139
dbcontext	objectcontext

4382213
svg	vml
it is a js library for drawing diagrams on a svg vml canvas

4382227
integer	unsigned
however i hope you re not using this as a unique identifier use an auto_increment attribute on a suitably large unsigned integer field if this is what you re after and i have to wonder why you d use mysql for this and not a scripting language

4382286
width	height
you can constrain it any way you wish such as only selecting one that would result in sub-rectangles of at least a certain minimum width or height or no bigger than some amount

4382286
width	height
in the sample code in my answer it s defined as the center point â 1 3 of the width and height of the outer rectangle but basically any interior point would work to some degree

4382290
hide	show
my problem is that i want to hide this screen after 5 seconds and show the welcome screen of the app

4382326
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	hfs

4382336
try-catch	exception-handling
so i would like to use a try catch statement to figure out what possible unhandled exception-handling might be being thrown meaning i d encase the main method in a try-catch and if an exception-handling is thrown print to the command line a message

4382351
superclass	subclassing
searching on the superclass collection will find subclassing objects and i guess that even though you explicitly searched the resource collection the actual object you found was a video

also note the similar mouseenter and mouseleave methods

4382559
int	double
doesn t work well in the int case with float and double yes

4382565
mouseout	mouseenter
there is a reason to use mouseenter vs mouseout - it has to do with nested elements

google-chrome	safari
it seems that google-chrome and safari which use stylesheet.innertext run incredibly slow on larger stylesheets

4382835
int	double
my issue is if the user puts in 10 11.1 12.2 those are taken as int double double and not the float that i require the assignment says the 3 sides must be float values

i havent seen any good answer for this but though my own work figured out the following code should work for styling a hr to look consistent in firefox safari google-chrome and ie not sure if it works below ie7

4382907
opera	google-chrome
browsers other than webkit accept the html selector so i use that for all other browsers annoyingly using html works in opera but not google-chrome and using body works in google-chrome but not opera..

4382912
min	max
expr between min and max

4382912
min	max
if expr is greater than or equal to min and expr is less than or equal to max between returns 1 otherwise it returns 0

4382912
min	max
this is equivalent to the expression min expr and expr max if all the arguments are of the same type

4382923
inherited	properties
i also changed the way you get the value from a properties to a method and even used inherited

4382972
typeerror	attributeerror
if the method was t implemented you ll get an attributeerror if it s not there at all or a typeerror if something by that name is there but it s not a function or it didn t have that signature

4382972
typeerror	attributeerror
catching attributeerror and typeerror is important in a lot of situations actually

4382985
for-loop	loops
if you want to use the cycle as it is you could try rendering the entire list of objects in your template and then have your template do a for-loop over them - instead of doing a loops in your code

4383048
min	max
the min max dot products for the would then be

4383048
min	max
so the min max pair for this normal is -5 5 as are all the others in this case due to symmetry

4383048
min	max
from my understanding i need to shift the min max pairs by the projection of the given axis onto it s global position

4383048
min	max
this means that the adjusted min max values would be 15-5 15+5 10 20 which is correct

4383064
nunit	mspec
i generally would recommend against converting from mspec to nunit

4383064
nunit	mspec
when introducing people to mspec i like to start with a classic nunit personrepositorytester.testaddnewperson fixture convert it over to a more bddish fixture like the one below and then show them how mspec can help to reduce language noise and introduce readability + better reporting

in many cases they even omit the struct name from the declaration and just leave the typedef name

4383205
post	get

typedef	struct
while it s up to you whether you use a typedef or the struct name there is a very good reason not to use typedef names ending in _t

4383308
button	checkbox

you can download snoop or other tool that shows you visual tree and see there that content of tabitem is not actually the visual child of this tabitem but the visual child of tabcontrol

4386251
tabcontrol	tabitem
so tabitem is the logical child of tabitem s content and tabcontrol is the visual child of tabitem s content

np-hard	np-complete
the first problem is np-hard because an arbitrary np-complete problem say 3-sat can be reduced to it in polynomial time

4386504

i think that you could probably use findwindow to find the correct child window and then sendmessage or postmessage to send a wm_close

4387970
mouseleave	mouseenter
this problem occurs because of mouse event bubbling ie has two special events called mouseenter and mouseleave which does not fire if you move your mouse in child elements for more info on this you can checkout this link

4387996
jar	war
package - build the target artifact jar war ear etc

4387996
maven	pom.xml
from the above it should be clear that specifying hibernate3 as a dependency in your maven pom.xml will instruct maven to go off and look in your local repository for the necessary jar files that make up hibernate

4388004
scheme	racket
alternatively you could target racket which supports parallel constructs and would make it very easy to target from your scheme system

4388366
ubuntu	linux
this occurs severely on firefox linux ubuntu

4388384
uiview	calayer
yes one could use a uilabel here and get drop shadow properties to set but that wouldn t be as performant since any uiview subclass such as uilabel wraps a calayer object and is going to be heavier performance wise

4388479
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
this should work in opera ie firefox and google-chrome

4388609

so i tried to toggle the visibility with the jquery functions show hide or toggle

4388964
disk	ram
when the size of the memory mapped file however increases there is still enough ram to cache it when the server is running the system at times virtually grinds to a halt as it seems the operating system linux in my case consumes a lot of resources synchronizing the file with the disk

4388985
maven	m2e
there are lots maven document but some of them pushing you away like this from using m2e

4388985
maven	m2e
by simply entering a groupid into the query field m2e queries the repository indexes and even shows a version of the artifact that is currently in my local maven repository

4389000
maven	pom.xml
if they are proprietary you can manually install jar to your local repository using maven you can use your version suffixes group names artifactid etc and then use them in your pom.xml

4389007
hash	salt
the only vulnerability with salting is that you need to know what the salt is in order to reconstruct the hash for testing the password

4389008
salt	md5
in addition to providing salt or seed the md5 is a complex hashing algorithm which uses mathematical rules to produce a result that is specifically not reversable because of the mathematical changes and dataloss in throughput

4389014
hash	md5
md5 or better put hash algorithms in general are used to safely store passwords in database

4389039
inherited	properties
the vbcrepository inherited from a vbcrepositorybase class that in tern implements the ivbcrepository and defines a properties session

4389041
hash	salt	crypt	salt	crypt	hash
if you use the crypt function it allows you to specify a string to hash a method to encrypt in some cases and a salt

4389041
hash	salt
returns a hash and salt password ready for storage

4389047
hash	salt
salting prevents this because then a part of the input value to the hash is controlled and so tables have to be compiled for that particular salt

4389047
hash	salt
so practically you store a salt and a hash value and authenticate by hashing a combination of the salt and the password and comparing that with your hash value

4389052
getter	setter
the getter and setter are actually methods and not fields

4389052
getter	setter
however the compiler at least the microsoft one will optimize this code and make the method call to the getter and setter inline so that the performance between the property and using a public field is the same

4389058
salt	md5
your example is almost good except your application needs to be able to regenerate the md5 using the same salt every time

4389058
hash	salt
your example appears to use one of the random salt which will fail 2 of 3 times if you try to compare a users password hash to something input

4389067
min	max
reduce the number of data points using min max avg before you display them

4389068
typedef	struct
according to gnu you may specify aligned and transparent_union attributes either in a typedef declaration or just past the closing curly brace of a complete enum struct or union type definition and the packed attribute only past the closing brace of a definition. in addition the document shows the following example

4389068
typedef	struct
but i have found few examples with typedef struct

4389068
typedef	struct
i would greatly appreciate any additional detail about the correct usage of __attribute__ aligned with a typedef struct

4389070
roxygen	vignette
within r i can run through the example in the roxygen vignette

4389078
hash	md5
if everyone just takes their passwords and hash them with md5 then my hash table is good for any set of password hash i can get my hands on

4389078
hash	salt
the data for the salt could be stored right beside the password and even if i get both it doesn t help me get the password back since i still have to essentially brute force the hash separately for every single user - i can t form a single rainbow table to attack all the hash at once

4389088
ant	maven
you may use ant for merging and invoke the task from maven

4389096
getter	setter
getter and setter for dependencyproperties should only call getvalue and setvalue because xaml doesn t use them they are only for convenience

4389119
put	get
we want to use c# to get the idle time for the system across all sessions and put the machine to sleep if nobody is using the machine for x minutes

fcntl	fork
if what you re testing is only reading not seeking or writing or doing fcntl and stuff or only writing then it is quite possible to realize this by using a pipe and fork

4389375
pthreads	fork
i ve never done this in windows but i suppose it should be possible as both pipe and fork are pthreads

4389392
children	parent
said another way parent can have multiple children as in the case of invoice parent and lineitems childs

4389392
children	parent
and then when i send parent to server the server knows that a children with id 1 and id 2 already exists and hooks it up

4389799
hebrew	polish
generally speaking i will test in german polish hebrew or arabic and an asian language japanese chinese korean

4389799

german and polish are wordy and nearly guaranteed to stretch text areas asian languages use an entirely different set of characters which tests your unicode support and hebrew and arabic are both right to left languages

4389806
versioning	upgrade
solution upgrade jira versioning

4389809
put	get
from a security perspective if you put your xml file on your site and i can guess discover the filename i can get the file and i now know all your sites what servers they are on and a set of ports on the server that are open that i might be able to use to attack and take control of the servers

4389829

4396612
put	get
note that this approach does not work because i don t want a map in the put method and the get method returns just this null

on top of that fink gives you access to more packages than macports

4396850
children	parent
the problem is that the parent property of frameworkelement is of dependencyobject which has no notion of children

4396850
children	parent
so the only thing i can see going about this problem is via casting the parent to see if it s a border panel etc elements that have notion of children and remove it from there

according to duscussion in some jquery 1.3x versions this bug affected several actions slideup fadeout and toggle if the element being hidden slid up is a a non-floated parent containing floated children

4397123

i would say valgrind + callgrind you can control the output while the program is running and you can use kcachegrind to check the output in kde

4397127
portrait	landscape
copy your portrait layout xml file to that folder and edit it for your landscape needs

4397134
width	height
to make the popup relative to the screen you will have to get the width and height of the window which can be a little hard in different browsers

4397136
post	get
ebomike s post has the answer to get rid of the errors

4397153
width	height
as per my experience the repaint is more effective if you call it on the innermost enclosing component using public void repaint int x int y int width int height rather than using public void repaint

4397153
awt	swing
note swing processes repaint requests in a slightly different way from the awt although the final result for the application programmer is essentially the same -- paint is invoked

4401479
portrait	landscape
that s fine - the behavior in landscape shouldn t pass the portrait tests - and i know how to check the orientation from my test code so i can avoid the test failures - but what i want to do is from test code put the emulator into the correct state for each of my tests

then you will get file handle so you can put conditional breakpoint to kernel32.createfilew and check file handle

4402285
bash	zsh
most shells certainly including bash zsh and ksh are posix shells and will implement at least what is listed there

4402302

4403010
switching	screens
then cocos2d image appears on the screens and just a second later device switching off

4403012
openssl	m2crypto
as far as i m aware m2crypto is the most complete python wrapper for openssl but i can t figure out how to accomplish what the command-line utility does

4403019

for every input event you will get a result event with the same start time containing the first in this minute and the current price as well as the min and max occurred in this minute so far

4403351
min	max
so only the very last result event within each minute will contain the first last min max of the entire minute

4403366
maven	pom.xml
first you need to make sure that eclipse and maven are playing together correctly so that when you add dependency to you pom.xml eclipse will recognize them too and your eclipse project setup and structure match with maven

4403367
next	except
what i did to solve the same problem was open up gimp hide all layers except for one export it as its own image and then hide that layer and unhide the next one etc. until i had individual resource files for each one

4403387
for-loop	arrays
i managed to make a workaround by doing a for-loop in the oncreate method where i go to every tab and put all the view objects in an arrays

4403394
post	get
i ve been going bananas trying to get some data from javascript on one page to post to a php file asynchronously

4403407
put	get
in this question which you ll notice i ve accepted my own answer i did remove the water mark i ve put in flash what i want to tell you finally that the same thing could be done if the file was a flex-programmed file but as we all know what matters is code crackers can get all your code whether you use flash or flex but it is harder in flex to get it to work by recompilation

4403412
folder	directory
and then in messages folder create a directory for your language for example

4403476
post	get
i wrote a view that will display a data table of groups if the request method is get or display a form to edit a particular group if the request method is post item to edit is passed with post data

4403482
post	get
some of my rest server methods accept normal get methods with request parameters but others needed much more complex post to handle the incoming data lists of lists of objects

4403482
post	get
should you use get or post to do this

4403512
margin	height
i simply adjusted the height down and added a top margin to keep the overall height the same maintaining the overall element height at 95px

robocopy	xcopy
i don t think there is any other way to do this that adding copy xcopy och robocopy lines with suitable patterns to the post build events

4403540

4403596
hex	binary
open the binary with your favourite hex editor

4403610
rss	feed
basically what you re looking for is an aggregator or scraper to use the rss feed from your blogspot site and output it elsewhere namely your website

width	height
you are setting the bounds of this view to the rect x 0 y 0 width 320 height 480 - y

4403728
width	height
with that position you can create a bounds using the height width of your image

4403749
google-chrome	safari
for example i had a minor font size rendering issue that only appeared in google-chrome safari and i fixed it with something like this

4403749
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
another warning if something renders incorrectly in google-chrome safari but not in firefox there s a good chance you have some other underlying issue invalid markup

4403761
mouseleave	mouseenter
in addition to wajiw s and ryan s answers you should trigger the mouseenter and mouseleave events as you detect that the mouse is over not over the image so that whatever code you bound to .hover is still executed

4403791
put	get
i want to have a form on another page that a user can fill out and they would get to choose a box in which to put images or text into

4403810
swt	nebula
use an alternative swt table control nebula grid or ktable which do not share the same platform limitations of table on windows

4403853

the only remaining complexity now is when you insert elements where you would have to push the other elements numbers after that one but only on that one level or when you remove elements when you would have to pull them

4403867
viewdidload	viewwillappear
first separate the initialization code into a method in your view controller that s called by your viewdidload viewwillappear

4403885
post	get
if you mean that is used get as a retreive method it is because get is usually used or should be used for retrieving information while post is for operations which involves changing data in the server

4403923
int	boolean
it s templated so i can have an int matrix or a float or boolean matrix

4404000

you can then handshake with your service using a salt hash of the key the first time the app is run the service hands out another key for the device to actually use day-to-day

4404245
versioning	upgrade
you will need to upgrade your xcode to the newest versioning which is included in the ios 4.2 sdk

4404287

go for mime application rss+xml to be safe if you want to make sure your feed is compatible with rss readers and other scrapers

4404302
kerberos	ntlm
it can be used to exchange kerberos as well as ntlm tokens between the user s browser and your web application autmatically

4404315
hash	salt
salt are essential because without them it is possible for an attacker to pre-generate a rainbow table of known password hash

4404315
hash	salt
salt values are not secret and can be stored alongside the hash password in your database

4404315
hash	salt
a good rule of thumb is to use a salt that is the same size as the hash output so you ll have two 40-character columns one for salt and one for the hash

4404318
hash	salt
3 store the salt in a different field with the hash

4404325
hash	salt
hash salt are used to keep your users password safe

4404325
hash	md5
md5 hash is the most popular algorithm used

4404325
hash	salt
this is why salt was introduced - salt is added to the user password and then hash

4404325
hash	salt
salt is randomly generated thus should be kept in the db for each hash

4404325
hash	salt
this one is very useful because it has a custom membership provider implemented which utilizes the ideas of salt hash

4404381
navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller
dont you just need to do self pushviewcontroller etc instead of the navigationcontroller bit

4404487
hide	show
in other words i want the div the be show within those two + range and hide the rest

4404526
google-chrome	safari
it occurs only in google-chrome and safari

4404534
allocator	stl
the bottom line is that stl only provides locks on allocator

4404570
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
he has an app with two view controllers in mainwindow.xib a uiviewcontroller and a uitabbarcontroller

4404570
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	hide	show
when the user logs in it uses some technique to hide the uiviewcontroller and show the uitabbarcontroller

4404570
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
when the button is tapped it removes the uitabbarcontroller from the superview and shows the login uiviewcontroller

4404570
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
you can t use the following since mainwindow.xib contains your app delegate and another uiviewcontroller not just your uitabbarcontroller

4404589

4404697
opera	google-chrome
b some browers like google-chrome and opera add the fakepath filepath to the textbox and this is just ugly so any if statement that can strip this out also would be hugely useful

4404714
nsstring	nsdata
i receive a json response in a nsdata variable and then convert the nsdata into nsstring

4404728
post	put
if the page is loaded and the textbox text gets a value then you clear this value and try to insert it into the database it should insert this value and then when the page post back it will fetch the new value from the database and put the value in the textbox

4404764
spaces	delimiter
finally i found a workround according to rfc 2047 the delimiter could be crlf or spaces between ecoded-word s and the c# use the crlf as the delimiter but the notes gmail client could not interpretation it and after i replace the crlf with spaces it works well in the note gmail

4404826

4404870
google-chrome	firefox
my function works great in google-chrome but i get a timeout everytime in firefox

4404885
free	malloc
new instead of malloc garbage collector instead of free

4404887

i was trying to to create a pop-up page using jquery ui dialog which will load another .net page in the modal dialog

4404944
width	height
i have div with width 100 and height 280px

4404957
dependencyobject	observablecollection	inherited	properties
the wpf way to do this is to have the objects that you re putting in the observablecollection inherited from dependencyobject and have dependencyproperties instead of old fashioned properties and propertychanged events

4405020
profiling	debugging
my configuration is set as debugging and in my project properties on the build tab i have a profiling selected under the code signing identity

4405048
width	height
i don t know the exact answer to your question but generally you can calculate the width and height of a text based on the font type and size using methods available in the graphical library

4405060
filtering	grouping
here i have to filtering based on the grouping

4405061
google-chrome	firefox
this works great in google-chrome but firefox gives a timeout and it doesn t work at all in ie

google-chrome	firefox
everything works perfectly in google-chrome firefox in ubuntu so it doesn t seem to be rails and apparently it s not ie

4405201
post	get
alternatively if you did want to look into generating xaml at runtime here is a post by pete brown that will get you started

4405213
dbcontext	objectcontext
however context class which ctp5 generated is not possible in that same way because it does not inherit from objectcontext instead it inherits from dbcontext

4405247
google-chrome	firefox
this my code which works fine in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

4405249
keydown	keyup
note that keydown and keyup provide a code indicating which key is pressed while keypress indicates which character was entered

4405249
keydown	keyup
for example a lowercase a will be reported as 65 by keydown and keyup but as 97 by keypress

4405501
google-chrome	firefox
i tried that in firefox google-chrome and ie and they all show it properly

4405506
width	margin
the total width of the element is width + border + padding + margin so when you set the width on the to be 100 it sets the content width to 300px but the total width is that 300px plus the default borders which causes it to exceed the 300px width of the

4405506
width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
you ll could accommodate these borders in the using padding margins but a better solution would be to set the box-sizing property on the to border-box to force the width property to define the total width of everything up to and including the border of the element

4405511
helpers	actioncontroller
everything seems to be working except form_for helpers which genererates a form tag with actioncontroller instead of action rails controller

4405545
put	get
step3 on the second page put in account number click submit button to get the many lines of data displayed i call this as third page

4405549

4405614
google-chrome	firefox
tested working on firefox 3.6.10 internet explorer 8 and google-chrome

4405646
width	height
you really don t need any jquery to get 100 height width - scrolling

4405664
jobs	cron
rails and many gems use rake for things like migrations cron jobs and any other task that needs to run outside the application server

4405667

4405680
jobs	cron
-i m not able to run cron jobs

if i try placing height and width parameters on the drawimage the picture scales down to fit the screen but it s blocky and pixelated

4405717

4405725

4405764
explode	implode
i have a class with a function to take read this record explode it unshift one airway bill number implode rest and save in database again

4406509
wxpython	pygtk
there are pyqt4 and pyside both qt there s pygtk gtk wxpython wxwidgets and more

4406526
width	height
the easiest way is probably to animate a change to the frame property and increase the width and height there rather than try to work out the complexities of a transformation based around the center point

4406533
opera	firefox
it further seems that when you use absolute positioning tricks to set the height of the table firefox and opera interpret this as if you ve set an explicit height even though you haven t

4406533

4406637
google-chrome	firefox
this works in firefox and kinda works in google-chrome

4406651

4406733
children	parent
there seems to be a short lag after parent already started to fade out and before children actually follow

4406743
qstring	qtextedit
i must add that it would probably be a better design to store just the richtext data in bbb as a html qstring as opposed to the qtextedit itself

4406768
ubuntu	debian
i have created testing small to medium size mysql + django python application which i would like to distribute via debian repository so that my users who uses ubuntu can easily install and update it

4406973
qtextedit	qtextdocument	qstring	qbytearray	qstring	qtextedit	qstring	qtextdocument
for reading back the qbytearray store it into a qstring see qstring fromutf8 and use qtextdocument sethtml to display the content into the qtextedit widget

4406973
qstring	qbytearray
once you have a qstring containing your text document as html you can use qstring operator and qstring operator without using a qbytearray

another idea is having ranges of 64-bit int and converting integer- chars id in software code where it could be done asyncroniously

4407159
pull	push
now when the other developer has new work done and want to push 10 git will refuse this push since the f commit in the central repository is not an ancestor of any commits in the developers repository and git now forces the developer to pull f from the central repository 11

4407159
pull	push
you can do corrections in a clone of live website and then push these changes into path to staging which then distributes your changes back to live website but do not push into live website which cause git to screw up your index nor do pull your clone changes in there because then you may need to merge different development histories from your clone and path to staging in live website which is definitely not what you want

4407204
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller

this automagic conversion is covered a bit in section 9 type conversion and testing and section 11.2.1 properties accessor in the spec albeit in the usual awkward specification-speak style

4407428
accessor	properties
in a literal number is a decimal point rather than a properties accessor although if you wanted to be really esoteric you could use

if you follows the second demo you should modify the code of loadcomplete function which you currently use to show hide the div with the no rows message in the jqgrid body

4407502
versioning	upgrade
and if it is possible in your project - upgrade asp.net versioning to at least 3.5 - it could improve your coding speed a lot

4407511
sorting	filtering
the jquery datatables plugin works fantastically for that kind of thing sorting sorting on multiple columns dynamic filtering etc

4407511
sorting	filtering
-- and with only 50 rows it would be very fast too so that users can play with the sorting and filtering until they find what they want

you should use get or post method depending what request you use

4409250
getter	setter
the header file is uitableviewcontroller i ve declared four nsmutablearrays and i ve given them properties set up getter and setter

4409252
int	chars
i decided not to use size_t structure instead just assigned int and chars types so i know exact value of bytes to read out

4409265
hide	show
i would definitely use custom user control s respective of each content you want to display and as you stated programmatically show hide them

4409265
width	height
so when you first start the form make sure you make it user control visible then change its height width as needed for its initial display to the form then run from there

4409274
imageview	viewswitcher
i ve got a viewswitcher containing a linearlayout in position 0 and an imageview in position 1

4409293
inherited	properties
if you want to limit the results to direct properties not inherited through the prototype chain then use as well the hasownproperty method

4409295
getter	setter
i would recommend you to just write the standard setter getter we used to write before properties are introduced

4409308

post	get
if none of those solutions are good enough then there are also plenty of blog post out there from experts about how to get equal height columns more consistently

4409544
children	parent
then you could make changes on the parent and have them carry over to the child or children databases

4409577
int	boolean
a third solution is to use a boolean array to represent the set and a single int max for the biggest element in the set

4409598
jobs	cron
what you are looking for is code that implements cron jobs

4409669
subtract	add
plimus has powerful api which allows you to authorize a card set up recurring billing and even add or subtract from the next billing amount make corrections - great for pay-per-usage stuff

4410306
rss	feed
especially as you ll presumably need to load the rss feed in its entirely anyway.

ubuntu	linux
in general i m interested in many sandboxing approaches those provided by the linux kernel and those enforced by ptrace but in this question i m only interested in the socket creation aspect of the sandboxing approaches so if you suggest a sandboxing approach please also explain how to prevent socket creation with it and i m not interested in approaches which need kernel patching or which involve loading a kernel module which is not part of the ubuntu lucid default binary kernel package or which would affect every process on the system

4410552

why not use get rather than post in your form

4410552

fgets	getline
it is definitely possible to provide 100 of the semantics of gnu-style getline including embedded null bytes using purely fgets but it requires some clever thinking

client-side	server-side
to which you calmly respond no that s 1 10th the network traffic because 9 times out of 10 the requested resources are already sitting in your client-side browser cache and when they re not it s 1 10th the server s computational resources since they re sitting in a server-side cache and when they re not there either we avoid stampeding with a smart cache on the server .

4412288
ubuntu	linux
the commentator also claims that when using apc opcode caching the speed difference between the two is completely irrelevant. regarding the actual implementation of require and require_once this indicates that either the os ubuntu linux in my case or apache is caching or knows the results of the previous stat calls so it doesn t bother repeating them. take that for what it is worth

int	chars
you are casting an int to a chars

4412345
projectile	angle
i m attempting to make a tank game in java in the vein of scorched earth or pocket tanks in that the user defines the angle and velocity of the projectile

my program calculates x-acceleration and y-acceleration of velocity as well as taking to account the maximum height reached the total time it takes to reach the final point and the angle of the projectile launched

4412379
filtering	grouping
i have also used one of the ways to find max per grouping and that is to join a table on itself and filtering out a row for which there are no records that have a bigger id for a same name

4412415
projectile	angle
if it is a tail wind it will add a certain ammount of velocity over time until it reaches the max velocity that the tail wind can contribute to the projectile itself and the same is almost true for head wind except that at a certain angle with certian horizontal speeds of projectile a head wind of high enough speed may reverse the horizontal velocity

4412449

sure i think it s even a common practice to replicate innodb tables into myisam tables on the slave to be able to add full-text indexes

4412751
min	max
there is a min and max macro in cocoa in foundation nsobjcruntime.h

4412787

the data binding manager is smart enough to weakly reference the view if you inherited from inotifypropertychanged or use dependency properties

4412825
post	get
you can do that by either passing get or post variables to the corresponding jsp page and reading them using jsp

4412825
post	get
there are many ways to use get post to send data from one page to another this is just as quick as i could write one up - using form submissions are another place you should look into if this way doesn t work out for you

4412841
mouse	keyboard
you can always visit the keyboard mouse system preferences panel to undo your changes

4412849
folder	directory
you might consider mapping a virtual directory into your apps folder structure then that directory can be mapped to multiple applications at the same time

4412898
ant	maven
can i do that in maven i have done it in ant not sure how to go about in maven

4412908
viewmodel	caliburn.micro
if you have a property on your dialog viewmodel which is another viewmodel type and you add a contentcontrol to your dialog view which is named the same as this property then caliburn.micro will automatically inject the view which corresponds to your property viewmodel type into the contentcontrol placeholder and bind that viewmodel type to the view automatically too

i would use sax push reader or a stream reader that allows me to pull if i needed to respond to information as it was read in

4413207
getter	setter
if i had two applications just trying to communicate data such as python and java i would use json because it can read these into instance objects with setter and getter without a complicated framwework even though this could make things slow

4413215
getter	setter
i like to make the properties in my class protected or private and then use getter and setter

4413220
getter	setter
i don t want once again to repeat the argument that even that you don t expect inheritance now you may still need it in the future but they are still more reasons to use getter and setter

4413220
getter	setter
getter and setter will let you easily implement validation of your properties

4413220
getter	setter
if i ran into a code file that didn t use getter and setter i would be very skeptical about it and would have to read it carefully many times

4413220
getter	setter
there are tools that can autogenerate writing the getter and setter for you

one approach would be to use ipc open3 to enable your perl code to handle both the stdout and stderr streams of your external program

4413390
submit	submission
even worse - if you are not redirecting after the submit - someone can hit f5 after your form is done submission

4413416
cos	exp
1 for chaotic float number between -1 and 1 compute the function f x cos exp x

4413416

4413506
post	get
there are several ways of doing this you can either use get post or store the variable in a session

4413533
cpu	processors
the most cpu intensive applications like calculating pi to a million decimal places may consume 99.9 of the processors for long periods but the os is going to interrupt it periodically just to see if something else needs to be done

4413533
mouse	keyboard
some of this is how computer games respond by doing the specific operations needed to modify the screen directly and read directly from the keyboard or mouse device buffers bypassing the os

4413592

what do i need to put into my extensions javascript code to get it to output to the chromebug log

4413595
qtreeview	qfilesystemmodel

getter	setter
if it s for a resume it s likely that they care just as much or more about your logic as they do the little details like getter setter

4413641
getter	setter
if it was me i d make them public without getter setter but include a comment above them saying something along the lines of consider making these private and using getter setter depending on the scope of the application and preferred code style of the team

4413647
junit	jsunit
but the jsunit download comes with a jsunit.jar which implies to me that i should be able to control this process from a junit test

4413647
junit	jsunit
my goal is to wrap jsunit in junit so that i can right click on the project and run as junit and have my jsunit test suite executed so i have renamed my question to reflect my intentions

4413647
junit	jsunit
running jsunit tests from junit or ant on one or more browsers

4413647
junit	jsunit
running jsunit tests from junit or ant on one or more remote machines each of which has different oss and browsers

4413695
post	put
put the random post code in a div if you haven t already and refresh the contents of that div with jquery.

4413708
prepare	bindparam
bindparam doesn t seem to evaluate a function and then bind its return value to the parameter of the prepare statement like so

4413713
internationalization	localization
another -- perhaps now preferred -- way is to use rails internationalization and localization support

4413718
fgets	fgetc
there isn t a big performance difference between fgets and fgetc setvbuf

4413720
daemons	launchd

bindparam	bindvalue
better to use bindvalue instead of bindparam it can pass values as well

4413747
sorting	grouping
it is focused on sorting tabular data in html tables but you can easily re-purpose the examples to work with a grouping of divs or list elements or whatever

4413773
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the first two lines works great for firefox safari and google-chrome but the ie statement give no response

4413808
hide	show
the goal is to have items that dynamically hide or show depending on the selection of other items

4413810

4413860
width	height
as part of the method i wanted to enforce that a point should be greater than zero but less than the width and height of the board in other words it should actually be on the board

4413864
hide	show
the way they have the jquery show hide example on the tinymce site doesn t actually work

4413876
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
again this is not a problem in firefox it scales according to the report only in ie google-chrome and safari

4413882
children	parent
if the children of this parent have similar members properties but are named differently for whatever reason you just write the method to accept parameters then pass the different property names in the call to that method

4413890
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
i ve read somewhere that one should use a for-loop when you are iterating over some sort of arrays sequence list whatever you call it and a while loops when your loops needs to stop at a certain condition

4413893
google-chrome	firefox
i ve already written the extension for google-chrome and it was a way simplier than doing it for firefox

4413933
inherited	properties
this properties leads to a potential multitude of inherited hierarchies in the system

4413974
for-loop	loops
but with years i have happend to really prefer the while loops over for-loop

4414044
post	get
i found this post which is pretty much what i am after trying to do but can t get it working

4414050
firefox	safari
this solution won t work on safari but works fine on ie firefox

4414057
children	parent
i d remove the nodes on the way back inserting the children to the parent at the position of the node you re currently on and then remove this node whenever you are on a non-a node

4414089
versioning	upgrade
worse if the app actually received permission in the past then gets uninstalled then an updated versioning of the app is installed not only does the icon appear but the upgrade app no longer actually receives location information because the app never gets to ask the os for location permission

4414090
ostringstream	std
when i parse it i handle the backslashes and add the appropriate character to the string that i am building using a std ostringstream instance

4414090

a label 100 width and 20 height

4414130

4414232
profiling	instrumentation
run the application on the device no performance tuning should ever be done in the simulator using the time profiling and memory monitor instrumentation

4414233
post	get
i d suggest using a form using htmlhelper and an http post with the parameters instead of an url link and an http get with query string parameters

4414245
mouseup	mousedown
you need to handle the mousedown move and mouseup events while persisting some data which is then drawn on the paint event of whatever control you are painting into

4414245

actionlistener	documentlistener
simply define a method call it performsearch or whatever and have both your actionlistener on the button and your documentlistener each call that method on their own

4418574
next	except
it turns out that something very similar to the above code can work except you need to use callchain in order for the next link to fire

4418596
google-chrome	safari
the keypress event is in its original ie form and in safari google-chrome about an actual character being added to a text field

4418596

this doesn t answer your question since it s for postgresql rather than mysql but i figured i d drop it in for people searching their way here

4418681
french	turkish
for example in turkish and but in french and

4418708
free	malloc
note that this works only in the case that you haven t dynamically allocated the string because then you d have to free it necessitating using that cpu register you saved to hold the pointer you originally got from malloc and friends

4418717
width	height
the image in img tag is present and there you set the width and height

4418717
width	height
the width and height stay intact

4418785
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

4418841
children	parent
this also forces the children of the nodes in the superinterfaces list to be visited as soon as their parent is visited

4418856
disk	ram
this should do the trick 4 or more core cpu plenty of ram 4gb and install the virtual operating system on a disk other than the one your main os uses firewire esata external drive

4418871
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
another approach is inherited where subclassing inherited methods and properties from parent classes and expand on parent class functionality

4419134
treemap	treeset	treemap	linkedhashmap	sortedmap	sortedset	treeset	linkedhashmap
if you want a map with a deterministic ordering i suggest you use a sortedmap sortedset like treemap treeset or use linkedhashmap linkedhashset

4419136
post	get
for some reason prototype s ajax.request under firefox seems to react by attempting to do an options request rather than a get or post so perhaps prototype has not been updated to correctly handle these new security conditions

4419172
lisp	scheme	haskell	ocaml	haskell	scheme	ocaml	scheme
sounds like you need to separate functional as in lisp scheme standard ml caml ocaml f# from purity absence of side effects as in haskell and incidental language features algebraic datatypes pattern matching

if you re going to go that route then just pass the min and max directly

4419343
uiview	subviews
you can always subclass uiview and override the layoutsubviews method to manually lay out your subviews

4419391
profiler	perf
stepping thru the code in the vs debugger is the best code analysis tool otherwise possibly even rd-gate perf profiler to record call stacks over time

4419461
client-side	server-side
you haven t even mentioned whether the templating is happening server-side or client-side which makes it hard to help

4419468

post	get
the same attitude as in answer as soon as you can in your original post won t get you support or help

4420060
google-chrome	firefox
i m using jquery to pass post data to php scripts however the function only seems to work on firefox and not function on google-chrome

4420060
google-chrome	firefox
instead of functioning like a proper ajax request as it does in firefox it simply refreshes the page in google-chrome

4420103
memcached	apc
raw performance is gained using nginx php-fpm memcached apc and a proper designed server

4420109
pthreads	usleep
on some systems there is a micro-sleep usleep call but that is not part of pthreads 2008

4420109
pthreads	usleep
the direct analogue of usleep in pthreads appears to be nanosleep

4420117
pthreads	usleep
if you need sub-second resolution on a timer you can use a second pthreads thread and a usleep

4420136
google-chrome	firefox
seems to be a browser issue as in firefox it is working fine but not in google-chrome

4420169
post	get

4420243
rss	feed
lkml has one but gmane offers four different rss feed

4420244
super	self
since super works a bit differently it might mean that self is not getting retained like one would expect

4420244
super	self
one easy way to check this would be to use the calls to super as originally written and simply leak the object referred to as self and see if it works

4420245
min	max
select the min auto increment number for the initial earlier date and the max for the latter date and subtract one from the other to get the record count

4420251
free	memmove
since it s crashing in memmove it sounds like you are specifying a block of image data which isn t fully allocated or is prematurely free

4420269
concave	angle
another opportunity if you can identify the curve s interior and there are algorithms for this then anywhere that two segments form a concave angle with respect to your curve you could blow it out to make a non-corridorish area

4420308
post	get
it will escape all the get post cookie super globals automatically - but then escaping again will leave you with a slash that will be inserted

4420321
portrait	landscape
each list item contains an image either portrait or landscape

4420321
width	height
i would like the class of each list item to be defined based on the width or height of the image created within it

imperative	declarative
functional declarative and imperative programming i ve just read this bringing insight a bit

4420401
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
in my main nib file mainwindow.xib i have a uinavigationcontroller and a uitabbarcontroller

4420401
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the nav controller first loads another view as its root view and when the user taps a button the uitabbarcontroller is pushed onto the uinavigationcontroller stack

4420408
hide	show
i am able to have a button on my entrypoint show the panel but i cannot seem to get the popuppanel to hide

4420429
webclient	webrequest
by default webclient webrequest try to determine what proxy to use from ie settings sometimes it results in like 5 sec delay before the actual request is sent

4420460
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i m using a uitabbarcontroller and added 10 uinavigationcontroller into the subviews so some of the uinavigationcontroller s would be in more controller

4420464
imperative	declarative
when in a functional language write in a functional style when in in an imperative language write in an imperative style and when in a declarative language write in a declarative style

4420464
imperative	declarative
in the case of writing declartively in an imperative or functional language this would usually break down to writing a declarative dsl and or api without actually changing the fundamental style used to expose or even glue said declarative-friendly dsl api

4420476
google-chrome	safari
in ie7 ie8 google-chrome and safari it works and sticks

4420537
uiview	subviews
i know that normally i can access subviews using for example but i can t seem to access the subviews of a subviews using since viewwithtag only returns a single uiview and not all of it s subviews

4420557
dictionary	map
i need to translate or rather map the words in an english document to bengali using an english-to-bengali dictionary

4420560
unix	bsd

4420566
cvs	svn
now i have plenty of experience as a source code consumer - git clone svn checkout cvs co that sort of thing - but none as a maintainer committer or updater

4420566
pull	push
there s a lot i m still trying to work out but i ve got it set up now so that i can pull clone from http and push over ssh next step is to set up gitosis

4420567
width	height
the arguments for the slides class are the width the height and the color of the slides

4420567
width	height
after you would declare the private properties _width and _height that holds the width and height of the display object

4420567
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
next a for-loop is used to loops through all the slide colors in the _slidecolors arrays and create an instance of slide that is added to the stage and add it to the _slides arrays

4420567
width	height
upon creating each slide instance the width height and slide color is parsed to it and each slide is positioned to the right of the previous slide

4420567
put	get
if you could put up more code from your flash app movie or a link to it it could help you get a better answer

4420648
hide	show
then if you have a single tap that toggles the navigationbar and or status bar to show or hide you need to do two things in you toggling method

4420653
keydown	keyup
things to note ie will not detect backspace using keypress only on keydown and keyup

4420680
nsobject	nsmanagedobject
you could create an nsobject that mirrors the attributes of your nsmanagedobject in your editing window

4420697
persistent	transient
jus saw your comment and for what you are trying to achieve you could create a transient nsdate attribute non persistent that is formatted in a similar way to the above code without h mm ss zzzz and use that attribute as your sectionnamekeypath value

4420759
post	get
you cannot get value_text from post data

4420763
post	get
note 2 i want to get an url from an uploaded file url which i get after i submit second_form and then add as post meta using first_form

4420766
opencart	magento	zen-cart	opencart	zen-cart	magento
i have not decided yet which shopping cart application that i will use it could be one of the followings opencart magento zen-cart

4420797
hash	hmac
hmac is not encryption it s actually authentication integrity but its secure when used with a reasonable hash

4420818
spaces	delimiter
you didn t mention what the end delimiter is so i used white spaces

4420824
post	get
then only problem is that the example didn t have multiple get post calls getting rendered into the same tab so i m not sure how to do that

4420847
swt	swing
we are having a swing application which we plan to port to swt jface

4420849
post	put
can you please put few lines in the post where exactly the error is coming and also the class or structure from which you are accessing

4420856
ivar	subclassing
another approach is to subclassing calayer and add ivar property pointing to the object it represents

4420900
put	get	post	get	post	put
get post put and delete are shortcuts for limiting the route to a single http verb

4420912
profiling	debugging
this is the full version of the code the problem occurred also before i imported the profiling i used it after it happened to try and debugging

4420917
put	get
put a select at the end of the statement to get it into whatever type you want

4420958
equals	gethashcode
if you re going to implement value equality at all override gethashcode and equals object - creating overloads for and implementing without doing that could result in very unexpected behaviour

4420958
equals	gethashcode
i would always implement if you re overriding equals object and gethashcode

4420987
cvs	svn
for internal work i ve found out that fossil uses little bandwidth much less than cvs or svn and is able to synchronize huge projects in a blitz even via an adsl or a 3g connection

4420992
keydown	keyup
it uses getkeystate instead of tracking keydown keyup since you might miss those messages if something else has focus

4421015
imperative	declarative
no html is a declarative markup language not an imperative programming language

4421044
charindex	substr
for reversal decomposing the csv string you need charindex and substr functions

4421091
uiview	calayer
the general solution to this in cocoa is to use delegates turns out that the delegate for a calayer is the uiview it is backing

4421095
put	get
you can get the session and add keys but even if you don t put anything in it it will be there for use

4421193
wsimport	wsdl2java
to get 2.0 files i used the wsdl2java tool of axis2 for 1.1 i used java wsimport tool

4421193
wsimport	wsdl2java
but i am not sure if it would work with the files i have generated wsdl2java or wsimport

4421205
dictionary	map
just check what sort of support it has for unicode and whether it has a built in associative data structure stl map in c++ hashmap treemap in java dictionary in python etc.

4421225
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the html5 geolocation api works in never browsers safari google-chrome firefox though it requires some kind of location service on the computer

4421228
hash	md5
i would go with md5 with hash that changes on interval

4421284
jobs	cron
also take note that apache is running as a particular user and that s usually not root which means the cron jobs can only be changed for the apache user unless given crontab -u privilege to the apache user

4421306
typedef	typename
unless c++ allows us to write typedef 5 five or typedef t value t_value where t value is value the presence of typedef itself removes all ambiguities and so typename seems to be an unnecessary requirement by the standard in such situations

4421311
gridview	rowdatabound
in asp.net we can handle the rowdatabound event of the gridview control

4421312
translation	localization
this will prevent localization guys from modifying them removing bolded text from cjkv translation

4421330
associativity	operator-precedence
the order of execution is determined by operator-precedence and associativity

4421338
post	put
i know it sounds like i m trying to breach my own privacy but of course i would put some exceptions to the user history that i post on the web

4421458
accelerometer	gyroscope
i would like to use gps but even accelerometer and gyroscope if it s possible

4421458
accelerometer	gyroscope
gps + accelerometer + gyroscope

4421518
int	double	int	chars
i usually pick references for everything other than the built-in data types chars int bool double etc.

4421529
submit	submission
it s worth noting though that this is also visible in the html source of the submission page even if you use post to submit the form

4421570
jobs	cron
i had similiar problem for which i didn t want to couldn t use cron jobs

4421582
post	get
inspect get post requests

4421609
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome this sidebar seems to be absolutely fine displaying on the right as it should

4421610
keyup	mouseup
you ll have to handle keyup and mouseup events for the whole document and write some code to compare the current selection with the previous selection from when the event handler last ran

4421634
mouse	keyboard
you could attach a mouseup event listener and a keypress listener respectively for mouse and keyboard selections and then use window.getselection to tell if any text is selected

4421641
simplecursoradapter	convertview
i m not sure maybe the simplecursoradapter version in the phone checks that the convertview parameter you are passing is of the correct type

4421641
simplecursoradapter	convertview
if you want to try an easier way to solve the problem but less optimal you can always pass the convertview parameter to the simplecursoradapter as null

4421668
post	put
here s a post i put in the devexpress forum but i don t think my issue is with their control rather with my databinding syntax

4421671
centos	linux
there is centos 5.5 oracle 11g release 1 oracle application server 10g release 3 10.1.3.2.0 for linux x86

4421683
qtkit	audiotoolbox
the second one would be to switch to a lower level framework from qtkit to audiotoolbox

4421683
qtkit	audiotoolbox
audiotoolbox isn t as straightforward as qtkit but it offers a clean solution to your problem

4421693
post	get
get will allow you to bookmark the url with the submitted parameters post will not

4421693
hash	md5
as for what is well implemented token i would say that 12-15 characters long random string hash into md5 should do the job

4421693
post	get
any user is able to submit any nonsensical or resubmit data to your server side script regardless of how the data is sent there post or get so it is not a valid consideration.

4421697
folder	directory
your template should reference images using #image_prefix#some_folder_name some_file_name in which case you need to put the images in a folder called some_folder_name beneath the directory that the i alias points to

4421715
int	double	int	chars
to the former belong for example int chars and double

4421716
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and also google-chrome implements a multi-file selector in html5

4421746
google-chrome	firefox
what s really weird if i keep reloading the tab in google-chrome it sometimes works and is consistent with firefox internet explorer but often is not and looks like the above this is quite a mystery to me

4421784
accessor	properties
sorry the problem was not that it wasn t compiling i missed the public accessor on writing the stuff here the question was why not to use ienumerable for a properties

4421786
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly in google-chrome and safari except in firefox the flashing text cursor does not appear inside the form input when it has focus

4421792
width	height
your slideshow div has a predefined width and height set to 22px

4421792
width	height
just change these values to height 332px and width 532px

4421792
google-chrome	firefox
ie and firefox does this in the background while google-chrome displays it wrong

4421802
getter	setter
that fails to compile because when you include an extra access modifier for a getter or setter it has to be more restrictive than the overall access of the property

4421804
post	get
imo the main reason to use post isn t security you can secure get but it s a matter of having the right semantics

4421834
kde	gnome
generally gnome and kde use gtk+ and qt respectively

4421840
toolchain	binutils
the best option for me would be using the gnu toolchain gcc binutils etc.. to do so but i might be missing an easy way of doing it with swig

4421871
post	get
to fix that problem there exists post redirect get pattern you need to follow

4421871
post	get
post redirect get prg is a common

4421950
google-chrome	safari
webkit browsers safari and google-chrome can fire the event prematurely in this case before the images have loaded

4421950
width	height
you need to specify a height and width value for each of your images so the browser can calculate page flow before the images are loaded

4421953
rss	feed
i was trying to parse smsugsmug rss atom feed using simplepie php parser and am getting error

4421963
udp	tcp
so far i only worked with sockets tcp or udp

4421985
google-chrome	firefox
this code works fine in ie8 firefox google-chrome etc.

4421989
std	ostream
in addition to that you ve got some serious namespacing problems- you ve used namespace std for the ostream but then called your argument cout which is a conflict with std cout

4421994
textview	imageview
it s just a relativelayout with two textview s and a imageview

4422043
width	height
what i am trying to do is dynamically change the height of an inputbox when the users text overflows it s width sorta like facebook s status update textbox

4422050
trie	tree
as flightofstairs mentioned depending on the requirements a bloom filter is one solution if you need the full data another solution is to use a trie or radix tree data structure

4422068
awt	swing
i m relative new with awt and swing and this is for homework

4422087
put	get
the data you ll get from them probably won t be very accurate so put some more thinking on this area rather than silverlight perf

4422100
clang	llvm
apple is pushing llvm and clang a lot

4422129
haskell	ocaml
you could imagine it being a lisp-like s-expression or an g algebraic data type in haskell or ocaml

4422149
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome it looks fine as per below

4422177
width	height
you can manually control the size of the textarea using the css height and width parameters

4422200
tax	shipping
so i ask you to help me i need to make the exact same calculation as magento do and still get out the values that i need each product shipping with discounts but without tax

4422204
gif	png
try to put both of the images background and logo back-page1.png logo5.gif in the same format either gif or png i prefer png and it should do the trick

4422233
client-side	server-side
i m not aware of any means to interact with a file input on the client-side so you ll need to verify validate the uploaded file server-side within the next.php script but this should be enough

4422235
gif	png
at this point you can make it more secure by checking the type and ensuring it s only jpg gif png or of the sort

4422273
int	chars
seems like from the text box you will be taking first two chars from the string convert it into an int and then do xor on it

4422284
implements	extends
there may be a problem between your use of the keywords interface abstract and extends implements

4422287
awt	swing
instead of using awt components like canvas i would strongly strongly recommend using swing or really any other graphical library

4422325
fadein	fadeout
now what i want is to add fadein and fadeout to the changing background however i m not sure of the proper way to do it i ve tried some different arrangements of it and it worked just not in the direction or order i wanted it to

4422327
prepare	bindparam	prepare	bindvalue	bindparam	bindvalue
stmt- bindparam and bindvalue and in general prepare statements are safe against sql injection

4422329
mouseup	mousedown
you seem to already know that with regards to the mousedown event and it s exactly the same thing with the mouseup event

4422331
width	height
one thing you could try is if you set the canvas s width height with css into for example 300x300 and then give the canvas width and height attributes of 150 and 150 it will appear zoomed in by 200

4422346
nsbitmapimagerep	nsimage
now i want a renderized nsimage or nsbitmapimagerep of it

4422358
width	height
you can upload an image into the media section and then using css format the header area to the height and width that you want and place a background image into the header

4422361
getter	setter
perhaps you could implement getter setter to retrieve the metadata or something along those lines

4422442
min	max	int	double
i tried for example to simply for each attribute divide the difference between the max value and the min value for that attribute dividing it into an arbitrary value like 10 and then map all the double values of each attributes to the index of it s corresponding interval and by doing so normalizing my attributes to int values between 1 and ten.

4422454
codeigniter	kohana
if you re just starting to use codeigniter maybe you ought to check kohana it is very similar to codeigniter in many ways but it loads classes in the normal way using new classname so netbeans autocompletion features should works normally

4422467
singleton	facade
this could be achieved either using singleton pattern as you ve suggested using static fields or by using a service provider facade to access the object either of those will do the job

4422470
integer	unsigned	unsigned	short
unichar is an alias of unsigned short and so is an integer type

it is cleaner than trying to use the jquery ui getter and setter to try to change the buttons and their click events and if you making a large app will help you in lots of other places

4422693
ostream	istream	std	ostream
edit because your requirements state use of which is already opened and you cannot change you can implement a std streambuf implementation that uses an existing to allow re-use of high-level std istream and std ostream operations

specifically in objective-c an ivar will be protected by default so they only can be accessed within the same class or subclassing

4422910
getter	setter	accessor	properties
the methods you mentioned are accessor getter and setter and in that case you probably want to use properties since they can be defined in 1 line and you can set some attributes like retain assign copy readonly etc

4422963
opera	firefox
looks the same in opera firefox

4422976

4423656
uiview	subviews
you can get an array of subviews of any uiview using subviews property

4423665
debian	linux
the autoconf archive is available as a package in debian gnu linux and macports and probably many other systems which means that any neededâ definitions can be used without copying .m4 files around by hand

use common.logging and inject it via castle castle ioc

4423998
castle	common.logging
injecting common.logging via castle castle seems like wearing a belt and suspenders to hold your pants up

4423998
castle	common.logging
my guess is that you really want to use one technology or the other common.logging or castle castle s logging facility

4423998
castle	common.logging
if you really do want to inject common.logging via castle castle you might find this link useful

4424025
hex	binary

that way you don t need your loginuser_loggedin method and the menu will show hide on every load depending on the user is logged in or not

4424375
post	get
be sure to post back when you find out how to get it to work

4424389
google-chrome	firefox

4424397
hash	md5
i tried the md5 hash but found generating the hash became a bottleneck

4424402
floor	sqrt
this can be naively implemented by checking if it is divisible by all integers less than floor sqrt n in a loop

4424403
range	max
if you know the range of the inputs which you do since your function takes an int you can precompute a table of primes less than or equal to the square root of the max input 2 31-1 in this case and then test for divisibility by each prime in the table less than or equal to the square root of the number given

4424518
post	get

4424629
width	height
however this is always returning a value of 1 for both height and width

4424635
put	get
if you can t get that to work then you could also put a different rewriterule above your one to redirect before this rule is matched.

4424684
pull	push
my current idea do the git pull and manually update the last two days files from my backup then finally do my git push

4424716
min	max
i need to write a method that accepts two ints as arguments a min and a max

4424716
min	max	range	max	range	min
on the next line i start with min+1 print all numbers up to max and then go back to the front of the range and print min

4424716
min	max
next line i start with min+2 and so on until i have repeated this starting with each number in the range.very hard to explain here s two examples say i pass 1 and 5 as the min and max arguments

4424727

developing for both ati and nvidia is actually not too difficult so long as you avoid using any part of either vendor s sdk

4424780
for-loop	loops
in the case of a for-loop there are 3 settings arguments that control loops

4424797
fgets	fread
i am guessing fopen flock fwrite fgets fread fclose

4424806
ati	nvidia
this library is included in both the ati stream sdk for ati users and the nvidia gpu computing sdk for nvidia users

4424816
for-loop	arrays
you don t need to concern yourself with algorithms at least for now - an algorithm is a series of complex procedures designed to solve a specific problem and not a simple for-loop used to iterate an arrays

4424844
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this seems to work just fine for firefox safari and google-chrome but not for ie8

int	chars
so i need to copy the int array to a chars then i will compress and save to file

4425050
int	chars
i will open the file read it with chars and the decompress to array of int

4425050
int	chars
i don t want to do a look in the chars to convert each int

4425069
int	chars
you can treat the int array directly as a binary chars buffer and pass it to your compression function

4425069
int	chars
and similarly when you decompress into a chars buffer you can use it as an int array

4425096
rss	feed
perhaps look at anyevent feed it is asynchronous using the anyevent event loop with configurable polling intervals as well as built in support for seen articles and support for rss and atom feed

4425102
isapi	httpmodule
have the application server populate an iis isapi filter or httpmodule that can read and then serve the file instead

i used a multivalue parameter in ssrs 2008 to show hide columns in a tablix

4425241
affinity	processors
afaik it is advisable to use this kind of timer on a single thread for which you set the processors affinity

4425266
hide	show
the resulting chooser dialog gives me options for network default hide number and show number and when i make a selection or even if i just cancel the dialog i get another alertdialog with circular progress indicator with the message updating settings...

4425266
hide	show
android.provider.settings has other similar actions for other settings pages but there isn t even one for call never mind call - additional settings and nothing for the alertdialog to allow you to choose to hide show the outgoing caller id

4425359
inherited	properties
no copies of the properties are made if you create a new instance of a class classes don t exist anyway in js an object which inherited from the prototype

4425359
inherited	properties
it only makes a difference on how you use the these inherited properties

4425414
osql	bcp
you can use bcp or osql as your command

4425467
typedef	struct
looking at what they have the struct holds and int and it holds an array that should be populated with the f_string typedef they defined earlier

4425478
strcpy	strncpy
you ll need to copy each string using the strcpy or the safer strncpy function

4425551
for-loop	arrays
generally when using multi-dimensional arrays you are going to use a nested for-loop

4425586
jboss	weblogic
jboss websphere weblogic and tomcat

4425590
put	get
i think you can put it simply as if you re using a framework to move the problem of a lot of structural plumbing to do into that framework let the framework handle the plumbing for you and you switch framework you re going to get the a lot of structural plumbing to do problem right back

4425592
for-loop	arrays
the first for-loop the one with a for inside it traverses the 2d arrays from top to bottom

tpagecontrol	ttabsheet
i have a tpagecontrol which has 3 ttabsheet and some of those have further tpagecontrol which have a ttabsheet

4425636
crossover	mutation
the reason i ask is because i have noticed significant performance improvements quicker convergence when using for example the top 10-25 of the population for the selection crossover and mutation processes for advancing the generation rather than using the full population

4425674
ant	maven
erik is right a dependency manager will help you out - may want to look into maven or ant ivy

4425676
crossover	mutation
this is when you throw out the bottom x of your population before crossover and mutation

4425742
post	get
the only important thing is that you post your calls to update the ui on the ui thread otherwise you ll get exceptions

4425743
google-chrome	safari
the equivalent in ie would be behaviours and you could use the css3 in safari google-chrome as nico suggested and you would be keeping the presentational stuff out of your markup but only you can know if it s worth the effort

4425772
free	malloc
just remember to free anything malloc d and delete anything new d

4425804

simply put they use the already well established http protocols everything supports get and post http methods

4425921
public	protected
don t put it in protected or public section otherwise an derived class may wrong use the typedef to refer to its grandparent rather than its parent

4426008
range	max
if i make the list range small enough for it to all fit in memory my results array before it calls the max method looks kind of like this

4426011

4430676
google-chrome	firefox
however jquery and css are both having some issues running properly in ie8 it works fine in ie7 and firefox and i believe even google-chrome

4430726
portrait	landscape
landscape and portrait mode

4430726
width	height
height and width are each a multiple

4430738
google-chrome	firefox
with the content check it out firefox and google-chrome output something like the following

4430752
google-chrome	firefox
the following works in google-chrome and ie6+ but in firefox the text is not wrapping

4430770
cos	sin
for using this function t will need to support both sin and cos static members

4430796
google-chrome	firefox
ie7 by itself is largely incompatible with firefox google-chrome standards and requires a lot of hacking

4430799
folder	directory
i found a great treeview on the internet but the problem is this tree is for folder and directory and not for text items

4430800
google-chrome	firefox
also this solution should support ie7-ie8 firefox google-chrome

4430807
children	parent
the style override only occurs on the children of the said menuitem the parent has the expected style

4430811
width	height
there is another solution which is to give your text widget a requested width and height of one

4430811
width	height
if you set the width and height to one your initial window unless explicitly set to a larger size will be rather small

4430830
mp3	wav
there s a free for non-commercial applications sound library for .net called irrklang that supports playing multiple sounds at least wav and mp3 from what i can gather at the same time their tutorial specifically covers this case as basic usage of the library

4430845
northwind	adventureworks
about your secound questions the reason you more see northwind database than adventureworks is just because aw is a huge and northwind is a fairly small database hence make it a better fit for samples and walkthroughs

4430877
versioning	upgrade
and this is after the webservice versioning upgrade

4430889
width	height
set your canvas a height and width

4430890
hide	show
to hide the tinymce and show the textarea you should call

4430900
std	ostream
you can use the string extraction operator of std ostream

4430942
integer	fractions
you can use class rational - it stores non-integer numbers as fractions of two integer s which as far as i know will be automatically converted to bignum when need

4430944
width	height
in the above code malloc is taking arguments which is width height sizeof rgb

4430951
for-loop	arrays
in addition you would probably want to optimized the arrays clearing code to not use a for-loop

4430987
post	get
i am that kind that spends more time looking for bugs in web projects and correct them but i still have one question about the use of the get and post method

4430995
move	drag
if a tile isn t touched when the user touches the screen i can somehow catch the tile when the user drag their finger over it as they attempt to move it

4430995
touchesmoved	touchesended
currently my tiles are implemented as subclasses of the uiview and they handle the touch events touchesbegain touchesmoved and touchesended directly

4431084
int	double
it looks like you can t pass an int so just make i a double and that should work

4431103
solaris	aix	unix	solaris	unix	aix
it is easy enough to find the answer for windows linux and osx on the web but how about on commercial unix operating systems like aix on power hp-ux on itanium and solaris on sparc

4431118
profiling	benchmarking
the only way to know is to set performance benchmarking and to profiling

4431123
folder	directory
i ve tried moving the .android folder to my home directory

4431129
button	checkbox
2 disable auto postbacks from the checkbox and only update the table when a global update button is pressed

4431134
inherited	properties
note no versions of internet explorer including ie8 support the properties values inherited or collapse

4431166
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
exactly the opposite - you must not free that particular pointer value since it hasn t been allocated with malloc or calloc

4431242
getter	setter
for example i have addresstype.java in my workspace with getter setter

4431276
setinterval	settimeout
any call to settimeout setinterval will flow through and in the first example i was using settimeout instead of setinterval

4431342
post	get
i think it determined this via the post or get methods

4431391
comparator	comparable
implementing the comparable interface on element will force you to implement the comparator method

4431392
onreadystatechange	onload
you could try listening for an onload or onreadystatechange event to see if it s being fired later

4431447
stdout	stderr
in the end i followed runrig s advice but then used the core module open3 command so i could capture the output from stderr as well as stdout

4431489
folder	directory
my .h and .lib files are in the folder c pcm .i specify this path at the required places c c++- additional include directory linker- input- additional dependencies .every thing works fine

4431502
implements	extends
i would personally make the repository interface extends idisposable - it s easy enough to implements it with a no-op after all

4431599
super	self
but override hittest on the board view so that it first calls the super implementation in order to find a tile if the result is self the board itself was hit

4431600
hide	show
so i want it to hide on success and then if you press on the link it should show the fields again #respondmsg #response

4431619
versioning	upgrade
it provides additional support for new os versioning and deployment scenarios and is the upgrade path for users of earlier versioning

4431659
ubuntu	linux
if you re developing on ubuntu linux you need to add a rules file that contains a usb configuration for each type of device you want to use for development

4431695
onfocus	onblur
i used onblur and onfocus on these elements since there was no description beside the textbox to indicate what each box is for

4431712
google-chrome	firefox
use firebug addon for firefox or ie google-chrome debugger to inspect the element you need to modify its style and see if gwt has assigned it a style class name or read its javadoc

4431712
width	height
to add vertical horizontal scroll you need to specify height width or max-height and use overflow-y scroll

4431772
post	get
the problem that this causes is that my post now get a 400 - bad request response from my server

4431815
subtract	add
i m thinking maybe just subtract a set amount from each of the first control points and add the same amount to the second control points but that sounds over simplified to me

4431856
floating-point	fixed-point
for floating-point and fixed-point types m is the total number of digits that can be stored

4431881
iboutlet	ibaction
i m currently refactoring a couple of view controllers that share a few iboutlet s and ibaction methods

4431881

i moved the outlet declarations and the ibaction method into a superclass cutting these out of the subclassing

4431885
hide	show
i m writing a wordpress plugin that allows people in the admin to hide show content specific to us states

4431926
mouseover	mouseout
and i d like to add a sort of listener such mouseover or mouseout for each of this div by taking the class teamscroll as reference

4431931
typemock	moles
technically this can be done by using a suitable mocking tool such as typemock isolator or microsoft moles there is a third one which i don t remember now

4431941
mouseover	mouseout
the difference here is that .live runs an extra selector and the event bubbles all the way up to document ...as well as it actually maps to mouseover and mouseout under the covers which is often undesirable

4431960
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
works on ie 7 firefox google-chrome safari and opera i ve not tried ie6 as we re working to a you re-lucky-it-works-at-all-so-don t-complain-about-rendering-oddities policy thereabouts these days

4431973
for-loop	loops
also if you want to only run loops five times your outer for-loop should be only to x 5

4432014
superclass	subclassing
i think that the easiest solution would be to leave the instance variable declarations in the superclass but duplicate the property lines in each subclassing

4432029
hide	show
i can probably wait until the window show up and then hide it by getting a handle to the open window

4432080
put	get
the funny thing is i can get it to work without the timegodkend variable but no matter where i put the timegodkend now â œ it gives me an error message

4432096
16-bit	64bit
the registers are 128 bits wide with instructions treating these 128 bits as a vector of sixteen 8-bit eight 16-bit four 32-bit or two 64bit values depending upon the operation

4432101
post	get
this weekend using this fantastic blog post as a guide and the cometd grails plug-in i was able to get cometd installed with my existing grails app

4432101
google-chrome	firefox
everything works perfectly in firefox and ie believe it or not but i m having issues with google-chrome

4432101
google-chrome	firefox
from what i can tell the cometd 2.0 emulates websocket by using long polling in browsers that don t support websocket natively firefox ie etc and uses websocket in the browsers that do support it google-chrome so i m guessing that s where my issue is coming from

4432132
jboss	glassfish
apart from upgrading to a servletcontainer which supports el 2.2 tomcat 7 glassfish 3 jboss 6 etc you can also replace the el implementation yourself

4432137
mouse	keyboard
the best answer would be a couple of mouse clicks and no keyboard

4432159
put	get
3 put the big one sun in the dead center and for the middle ones planets -- just choose a very easy heuristic what about from biggest to smallest going anticlockwise srtaing at the top left don t try to get clever than that with that part of the problem - which indeed could be a huge research project purely on it s own

4432206
stdout	stderr
close it or redirect it stdout and stderr and close stdin

4432206
stdout	stderr
in bash you use to redirect both stdout and stderr to logfile and trap hup to ignore the hup signal

4432211
implements	extends
the only objection that i can see is that extends the interface will require all derived classes to implements the interface

4432221
x86	64bit	128bit	64bit
the sse2 instruction set uses 128bit registers however most of the registers in a x86 x64 are 32-bit or 64bit

4432230

4432794
punctuation	words
this regex to strip punctuation also incorrectly makes the words b #225

4432797
jcomponent	bufferedimage
a reasonably simple way of having access to the raw pixels of an area fully under you control would be to extend a custom component from jcomponent and overwrite its paintcomponent -method to paint the area from a bufferedimage from memory

4432876
slider	jcarousel
now when i navigate via keyboard arrows to the items that are actually hidden in the carousel the jcarousel must slider to the new view

if you really must edit the hosts file which is a bad idea as stated in other answer s you find it under system etc hosts and do that via adb pull editing the file on your computer adb remount and adb push

4433254
postgresql	mysql
postgresql and mysql support enumerated types which is what you sound like you re looking for

4433270
int	chars
you should use a chars 1 or an int depending upon the number of options and map the values to constant strings this way you ll save space and the strings will be easily configurable in the future

4433272
memcached	apc
i would opt for mysql and or an in memory cache like apc or memcached

4433277
translation	localization
if it s a localization thing and columns sourced exactly the same way can have different names for translation or departmental jargon purposes then define a constant internal name for that column source and use that in the settings

4433346
versioning	upgrade
oscommerce at 2.2 os not compatible with php 5.3 largely with oscommerce using the deprecated ereg_replace php function and the correct method would be to either roll back to a previous versioning of php until such a time as you can upgrade oscommerce or to upgrade oscommerce now

4433370
disk	ram
also a good tip for codeigniter concerning database session table s set the type to memory so that the sessions are stored in ram instead of disk which makes your site quicker less disk reads when accessing the site

4433899
mouse	keyboard
that should work for both the mouse and the keyboard

i m surprised to find that most of the products out there focus on client side paging filtering sorting and grouping

4434137
filtering	grouping
yet the sites for telerik devexpress componentone xceed and others all have fancy demos that bring 10 000+ rows of data to the client and show off the ability to page filtering grouping and sort it

4434140
int	double
c++0x is going to make the following code and similar code ill-formed because it requires a so-called narrowing conversion of a double to a int

4434140
floating-point	integer
from a floating-point type to an integer type or

4434164

4434736
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
a good way to quickly check things like this is with the console of firefox firebug google-chrome and safari i believe that opera has something similar as well.

4434763
arraylist	treeset
for actually sorting each node s children do whatever you d normally do use an arraylist and sort it or use some kind of sorted collection that maintains sort order eg treeset though make sure you distingiguish between elements that have the same population

4434771

4435171
getter	setter
a basic action class note with stuts2 at this version you don t need setter getter

4435246

you can offset this effect by also applying a negative vertical margin equal to half of the height of the element

4435257
gson	xstream
for example if i were using a java application i could use the libraries available at json.org or google gson or xstream with the json driver to populate an object and then simply use the jsonarray.length method to check for the number of posts returned

4435284
width	height
the size of a swf in a html page is defined by the tag and the swf application s attributes like width and height

4435284
width	height
let s say you did not define the maxwidth and maxheight of your swf app they default to zero which means that there is no maximum and you set the width and height to 100

4435372
google-chrome	firefox
i tested this in firefox ie and google-chrome without issue

4435382
post	get
make sure to require a hash via get or post before giving out the db sql on server 1 or else anyone could read it have your database dump

4435400
min	max
i think this is the closest you could get with getting numbers and there is no a way you can get a max min value straight from xml you probably need to create some functions you can read an implementation of it here

4435412
width	height
basically i want it to lock it s position at the top left so when i change the width or height it expands right or down

4435438
directx	gdi
there s three methods gdi method directx method and windows media api

this class contains nothing but getter setter for the different search options

4435868
versioning	upgrade
you will probably not have any issues installing a 1.1 plugin in a 1.3 application but you might want to upgrade if there are issues or to take advantage of the features of the more recent versioning of groovy and grails

4435868
versioning	upgrade
my process for upgrading plugins or applications with a large gap in versioning like this is to not run grails upgrade - that s best for smaller versioning deltas to upgrade from 1.3.1 to 1.3.5

4435873
width	height
you sholud minuse child form height and width like this

4435885
width	height

salt - a known random string appended to the original string before it is hash

4435888
hash	salt
salt each password before it s hash

4435888
hash	md5
the bcrypt algorithm works because it takes five orders of magnitude longer to hash a password than md5

4435888
hash	md5
if you re not salting your passwords then all an attacker has to do is to pull up an existing rainbow table for every implementation out there aes sha-512 md5 and just see if one matches the hash

4435894
realloc	malloc
it uses the same malloc and realloc technique

4435929

4436092
radio-button	checkbox
i have big table with many html items such as select textbox radio-button checkbox

4436153
implements	extends
the class which extends this interface must implements all the methods declared in it

4436164

4436350
equals	gethashcode
as an aside note that the contract for gethashcode specifies that the return value must be equals for two objects when equals would return true when comparing them

4436350
equals	gethashcode
a simple way of implementing gethashcode is to xor together the hash codes of all of the data you consider for equality in equals

4436351
lisp	scheme
i m thoroughly intrigued by scheme and have started with some toy programming examples and am reading through paul graham s on lisp

4436351
lisp	scheme
this is why i m learning scheme rather than common lisp at the moment

4436354
client-side	server-side
because lamp only addresses the technologies that run on the server-side not what runs on the client-side like the browser or javascript within the browser

4436386
equals	gethashcode
you should also override the equals object object and gethashcode object methods so that no matter how your calling code is comparing equality perhaps in a dictionary or perhaps in some loosely-typed collection your code and not reference-type equality will be the determining factor

4436411
dictionary	map
nhibernate provides the ability to map a dictionary dynamically to a table

4436424
for-loop	loops
if you are looking for that specific block of data to loops 10 times every time the page is loaded simply use a for-loop

4436442
mkoverlay	mkannotationview
since you are using ios 4.0 i would suggest using a class that conforms to the mkoverlay protocol instead of mkannotationview

4436444

4436771
pyquery	mechanize	pyquery	lxml
what i m trying to do is to convert a script i wrote in python with mechanize pyquery and lxml to javascript the reasons don t really matter i thought in javascript it would be easier to simulate something

4436791
x86	64bit
i think you ll need the x86 version of the runtime rather than x64 since pygraphics-win32 sounds like a 32-bit library not 64bit

4436798
windows	wow64
but it doesn t work for wow64 applications in 64bit windows

4436858

4436924
int	double	int	chars
remember that for example chars are promoted to int when used in operations involving int int are promoted to floats floats to double etc

4436924
int	chars
so typeof int_variable + char_variable is int since the chars would be promoted to int to perform the operation

4436991
instances	transient
an exception is thrown if the given entity instances is transient or detached in relation to this session

4437000
put	get
i read somewhere that once you log in here and put the website url we can get the way the site will appear on mobile browsers

4437338
folder	directory
thats great in the sense that it copies the folder to the output directory

4437401
getter	setter
on a sidenote __get and __set are not lazy replacements for proper getter and setter

4437401
getter	setter
also note that they are much slower than proper getter and setter

4437420
decoder	encoder
instead i would work with a well defined object model and have a simple encoder decoder to handle the conversion to xml string and vice versa

4437444
width	height
make sure using firebug that the body element is actually visible on the page the contents might because the overflow is set to auto by default but you ll also need to set the body height and width to 100 to ensure that when you re mouse moves across the screen it actually invokes body.mouseover

4437475
hide	show
you re best bet is to give each form or its containing div a unique id and using this to show hide using jquery

4437495
integer	unsigned
or as an unsigned integer

4437526
post	get
you won t get analytics but if you include the post views function in your page you can see how much

4437557
gif	png
the logo is a transparent png whereas the original image can be png jpg or gif

4437557
gif	png
when the original file is a gif or png the logo has a solid white background meaning the transparency is not working

4437596
altera	xilinx
is this the same for xilinx altera other

4437617
width	height
the height width of the grid is set by the docklayoutpanel as docklayoutpanel automatically scales to fill the whole area

4437682
post	get
if you want to send post back to your current page remove in form tag method get action profile.aspx attributes

4437697
partialfunction	implicit
plus you get the compile-time overhead of looking up the implicit conversion and the run-time overhead of wrapping the match in a partialfunction not counting the conflicts you could get with other already defined matches methods like the one in string

4437705
integer	unsigned
u is unsigned integer

4437713
versioning	upgrade
i was about to start my first rails 3 app and thought i would upgrade to the latest versioning of ruby before i did and the ruby fails to make correctly

4437736
google-chrome	safari
i ve been working on a menu and have it perfectly working in google-chrome safari

4437740
maven	pom.xml
when maven builds a jar it places a pom.xml at meta-inf pom.xml

4437777
width	height
however the width and height of the composed text layout is equal to that of the canvas so it is not a matter of just turning on the scroll policy

4437777
width	height
somehow i am not able to find the full height and width of a full composition of the textflow

4437840
equals	gethashcode
but i strongly suspect it s because you haven t overridden equals or gethashcode in dickeys

4437840
equals	gethashcode
you can override equals and gethashcode to provide equality based on the contents of the objects though

4437840
equals	gethashcode
see this question for an example of the kind of thing you might do in equals and gethashcode - and some other members you may want to provide on types which have value-based equality

4437849
postgresql	mysql
i m currently checking out sql power architect both w postgresql and mysql - but it also supports other vendors and it definitely seems promising

ienumerable and iqueryable are the two most used terms of any linq discussion

4437871
superclass	subclassing
you can only hide superclass methods by defining a method with same name and signature in the subclassing but it s quite confusing and therefore generally not recommended

4437887
jobs	cron
read about setting up cron jobs here

4437892
mp3	wav
if you didn t touch the binary data and it s still in its original binary wav mp3 form you have the audio file

4437906
int	double
0 is of type int but can be casted to double and 0.0 is of type double but can be casted to int

4437918
mp3	wav
you do not need to convert it but if you want to allow a user to download an mp3 or wav file you need to set the correct headers

4437921
mp3	wav
if converting to mp3 is impossible then maybe somebody at least knows how to convert it to wav

4437924
udp	tcp
the tcp and udp protocols have too many semantics to be easily mapped to your usual file stream apis

4437924
fgetc	fread
at the end of the day once you ve dealt with binding and listening and accepting none of which you can do with c file streams and wrapped the resultant file descripter in a file stream type all you are going to do is use fread and fwrite maybe fgetc so you may as well leave it as an ordinary file descriptor and us recv and send and save yourself the hassle of wrapping

4437964
google-chrome	safari
instead of debugging on their site i d probably do my best to record via firebug or google-chrome safari s dev tools etc. a sample ajax interaction and then set up a dummy page on my own local server that would simply echo that interaction playback style

4437984
hide	show
and show hide the required form as per the requirement

4438203
opera	firefox
i ve tried firefox ie and opera but none of them worked

4438228
getter	setter
largeproduct has a variable height which has getter and setter methods which have to be implemented in the product class

4438251
superclass	subclassing
note that things are slightly different when you are subclassing a class and you want to know whether the superclass responds to a certain selector

4438251
super	self
therefore sending respondstoselector to super is equivalent to sending it to self

4438256
rss	feed
this code is meant to pull rss feed from yahoo weather server in a map-reduce pattern

4438260
pop-up	dialog
i have my listactivity that when you tap on an item it pop-up a dialog that ask the user for user and password

4438315
folder	directory
even if you create directory under resource folder all resources go to a flat directory under app bundle

4438333
qlist	qtextstream
the first error namely no matching function for call to â qlist append qtextstream â is caused by you using operator in this line

4438355
children	parent
if you want to enumerate all the children of a node you just need to get your parent node with something like element parent root.getchild parentnodename then you can enumerate the children with the same methode list children parent.getchildren childname

4438395
firefox	safari
it produces the right results in safari and ie but fails to get the position of the img that you hover over in firefox - it returns 0 0

4438429
google-chrome	firefox
it seems to be working as expected on google-chrome and firefox but in ie 7 9 the min-width is not enforced

4438488
bmp	png
all i want to do is convert it to some kind of more universal format eg png bmp giff whatever which i can then allow the user to download

4438488
svg	vml
i would have thought the seeing as vml is microsoft s proprietary svg format they might have at least provided facilities within their own languages c# vb.net to convert vml to bitmaps

4438498
folder	directory
it works by copying the database from the assets directory to the data data com.myapp.db databases folder

4438539
imagick	ffmpeg-php
i m currently obtain the frames using ffmpeg-php and process each frame by imagick

4438572

the folder is a virtual directory setup unter the root of the site in iis and it s alias is admin

4438594
memcpy	strncpy	memcpy	strcpy	strcpy	strncpy
to copy the contents of a string into a or a for that matter you d need to use strcpy strncpy or my preference memcpy

pop-up	dialog
i want to have an edit link on each row that will pop-up a jquery dialog so that the row can be edited

4438638
google-chrome	firefox
in ie8 firefox google-chrome etc it works fine however in ie7 standards using the developer mode it doesn t show any content whatsoever

4438658
width	height
if the new image dimension width x height is exactly the same as the displayed image s dimension in html then web users will still see a sharp image

4438669
getter	setter
but because i need el syntax i still need to create getter setter for this public field

4438698
mouseleave	mouseenter
this shouldn t stop the mouseenter and mouseleave from working though

4438736
mouse	keyboard
you can turn off the navigation toolbar but that won t actually disable navigation - there are mouse buttons and keyboard shortcuts for navigating back

4438739
for-loop	loops
instead of comparing for-loop control scoping try using the for each loops since that actually uses iterator which in some collection implementations is a lot faster than iterating by using index

4438761
getter	setter
typically you should begin by writing a test testing a setter or a getter before implementing it

4438761
getter	setter
a not implemented setter or getter can look trivial but makes test fail

4438847
pop-up	dialog
there is no way to circumvent the pop-up dialog requesting the user to accept trust or deny the certificate

4438897
post	get
querystring is a get post adds items to the form collection

4438904
children	parent
for historic reasons all of this would have been done on the same form so user would have a form for the parent and one child and they would hit a button to add more children

4438968
int	double
known fixed arguments this is when you declare function with arguments foo int x double y

4438968
int	double
but when you try to call it as with count is of double type compiler will try to pass count through stack as it is not int

4438968
int	double
it is not abstract example as double in arument may be just result of computation involving floating point numbers and you may just miss this assuming result is int

4438969
public	protected
this means that the standard rules of inheritance apply to variable scoping - if you have a public or protected member variable declared in your code-behind class it will be directly accessible in the aspx just like in your example

4439045
button	checkbox
i am new to windows forms and localization.i have a windows form which is containing some radio button and checkbox and some button

i use caliburn micro and mef as ioc

4439056
viewmodel	caliburn
i bind event click of button with caliburn convention on viewmodel

4439206
innodb	myisam
if you use myisam as the db engine you will need to keep track of the ids manually but if you choose innodb as the engine you can use foreign keys

4439212
versioning	upgrade
another gotcha to watch out for is since you are modifying the xml future upgrade won t install newer versioning of the xml by default since it now has user data

a rectangular area of dst_image of width dst_w and height dst_h at

4443677
width	height
meaning if s width is longer src_x has to be 0 and if height is longer src_y has to be 0

4443689
width	height
after suspending painting you need call updatebounds method of the control and increase clientrectangle width or height by one and then decrease it back to the same value it was before

4443739
hash	md5
md5 isn t an encryption algorithm - it is a cryptographic hash function

4443739
hash	salt	pbkdf2	hash	pbkdf2	salt
when you store a hash password you should use a salt and key strengthening for example pbkdf2 to make these attacks more difficult

4443743
hash	md5
ref get md5 hash in a few lines of java

4443745
pull	push
gitolite will work just fine certainly for centralised repo push pull

backgrounding	multitasking
according to the talk session 105 - adopting multitasking on iphone os part 1 - 00 34 50 it is stated that the system releases non-visible uiviewcontroller views when entering the backgrounding

4443823
width	height
i entered some values for width height but you should use measurestring or similar method

4443828
salt	md5
4 md5 can be made more secure by using a salt

4443828
hash	md5
5 we use md5 for low level security because the hash can be easily duplicated across platforms

centos	linux
this hardware works with an hp dl360 g7 server with centos linux 5.4

4444269
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the solution to this is to create a uiviewcontroller project file which subclasses uitableviewcontroller and then you create a class called mytablewithnavigation as a sublcass of uiviewcontroller expose one method called init and in that you programatically create a uinavigationcontroller passing initwithrootviewcontroller and then return the resulting object to the appdelegate that called it

4444292
button	checkbox
my end goal is to show the div containing the submit button if any of the checkbox are checked

4444292
button	checkbox
the only time the div containing the submit button show be hidden is if all checkbox are unchecked

4444292
button	checkbox	hide	show
however the code i have come up with below show hide the submit button div for each checkbox instance

4444292
button	checkbox
in other words if i have three checkbox checked and i uncheck one of them the submit button div get hidden

4444363
qtableview	qitemdelegate

i ve added them to my buildpath and they are referenced above the jre system libs in properties-java build path-order and export

4444411
portrait	landscape
another thing to take into consideration that by using native widgets it will probably be easier to add support for different ui sizes portrait and landscape mode in various sizes can be a pain to get right in a single webview

4444415
post	get
ok was able to get it going thanks to the suggestions on this post

4444417
google-chrome	firefox
i have tried this exact thing on both google-chrome and firefox

4444418
post	get
now whenever you get your post they will be ordered by -timestamp

so first of i put a timeout test in there then i get my data from the web service and then i parse it

4444473
width	height
i have to know the size for setting images width and height dynamically according to the viewport size and orientation

4444556
hide	show
sometimes you want to change a content image on rollover and not a background image and putting two versions of a content image next to each other then using hover to hide and show them puts a foot into the realm of content not making sense without the presentation layer

4444558
mouse	keyboard
i m trying to build an expensive script with mouse and keyboard control on canvas

4444558
onkeyup	onkeydown
i m using document.onmousemove and document.onkeydown onkeyup to do this control but when i press any button i ve got a lot of onkeydown executions and mouse lags terribly

4444558
google-chrome	firefox
i tested it on firefox and google-chrome this problem exist only on firefox

4444574
ilist	iqueryable
i believe returning an iqueryable allows lazy enumeration whilst returning an ilist doesn t

4444608
getter	setter
showtitle if the row contains a title the getter setter would return set the actual tablerow s visible state

4444633
google-chrome	safari
the element is launched in a uiwebview which is rendered by the webkit engine google-chrome safari

4444645
google-chrome	firefox
these events can queue up in the browser s input queue and be dispatched to your script later which is probably happening in firefox or they may be discarded if your script doesn t process them quickly enough which might be happening in google-chrome

4444645
setinterval	settimeout
instead of using setinterval try using settimeout after each execution of tick -- this will prevent multiple timer events from queuing up and firing together

4444683
sorting	filtering
callers can add filtering paging sorting etc

4444683
ilist	iqueryable
if you need extra control beyond the dal you could add options to the interface or a not so good idea would be to return iqueryable of ilist to limit what the ui code can do

4444692
clang	llvm
i ve been working on a small tool with clang llvm but i haven t been able to successfully get g++ and gnu s linker to properly link my code against clang

4444783
interpreted-language	compiled-language
i have the impression that method overloading can be done on compiled-language java c# and can t be done on interpreted-language ruby python

4444809
width	height
when the user changes this setting the values for width and height are swapped to resize the control to its new orientation

4444809
width	height
for the vertical orientation i create a graphics object and set the height of the control to the width of the sizef object returned from graphics.measurestring text font

4444809
width	height
this means that i can t change the width or height when i want to change the label s orientation

4444839
octal	decimal
it only supports decimal hexadecimal and octal

4444862
octal	binary	octal	decimal
btw internally all java integers are binary but literals in the source code are decimal or octal

4444871
post	get
or as part of a form one of get or post defaults to get

4444871
post	get
this will run your program with the same query string as above or a different parameter if the text box is changed but request_method will be either get or post depending

4444914
octal	binary	octal	decimal
there s no way to explicitly assign an integer as binary only decimal octal and hexadecimal

4444932
width	height
i used to be doing this by calculating the scale of a cgaffinetransform and multiplying the xscale by the width of the related view and the yscale by the height

4445019
put	get
for this to work you are going to get put into the science loop - instead of the cycle being scientist rarr

4445022
dictionary	map
the mercurial convention is to put files name into the root of the repository and use them as dictionary of some kind to map file names to property values

4445121
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	iqueryable	ilist	iqueryable
you should return an ienumerable instead of ilist or iqueryable

4445121
sorting	filtering
iqueryable makes the caller think they can use lazy evaluation and add filtering sorting projection etc

4445147
pop-up	dialog
when the dialog first pop-up buttons on the page still highlight on mouse over but the buttons in the dialog do not

4445150
hide	show
personally i d loop over all the divs hide them all and then show the current one instead of holding a reference to the last div

4445159
children	parent
i ve got a table which contains a bunch of assets that are organized into multiple hierarchies such that the table has a many-to-many relationship with itself each asset can have multiple children and multiple parent

4445165
textarea	textbox
currently my form has both textbox and a textarea but only the text area is using the client side validation none of my textbox are

4445165
textarea	textbox
can anyone please help me understand why the client side validation will work for my textarea but won t work for my textbox

4445169
client-side	server-side	serializable	deserialization
it s a bit simpler all around and is faster since you ve removed a layer of serializable on the client-side and deserialization on the server-side

4445174
hash	salt
given that everything must be stored on the device i am basically treating the password hash and salt as already compromised as anyone who has spent 10 minutes reading can root a given device and access my database preferences

4445174
hash	salt
this single salt value will be appended to the current hash

4445174
hash	salt
the new hash + salt value will then be hash and steps 2 - 3 will be repeated

4445240
put	get
then divide this leading by 2 to get half-leading which is put above and below your text causing it to be vertically centered

4445260
stdout	stderr
tail -10 will give you last ten lines redirects stdout to stderr appends to logfile

4445281
carrierwave	paperclip
to handle the file uploads iâ ve switched from paperclip to carrierwave

4445281
carrierwave	paperclip
while paperclip has and continues to serve me well in many applications i work with i really appreciate the modular approach that carrierwave takes

4445319
hash	salt
you could hash the id of the row and use that for a zestier salt

4445328
public	protected
actually a protected data member is accessible only using protected and public inheritance

4445345
hash	salt
suppose you have a hash function that takes salt a number of iterations and a password as input and returns a hash as output

4445345
hash	salt
randomly generate one salt on the first run of the app and hash the newly chosen password

4445345
hash	salt
store this salt and the resulting hash in the application preferences

4445345
hash	salt
then randomly generate another salt and hash the password with it

4445345
hash	salt
use the resulting hash as the database encryption key but store only the new salt in the application preferences

4445345
hash	salt
later when a user wishes to use the app prompt for the password and use the first salt to hash it

4445345
hash	salt
hash it again with the second salt and use the resulting key to decrypt the database

4445353
vim	emacs
use nano vim or emacs

4445456
post	get
i think you should first try to get post from only then if it works try

4445456
post	get
i don t think it know the_title of what custom post type to get

4445477
hash	salt
assuming your hashing method is not weak it doesn t matter if the salt is known - salt is simply so that 2 users with the same password have different hash - and a casual inspection of hash wouldn t result in identical passwords being obvious

4445520
post	get
i need to access post and get variables inside a server control class there is no access to request object in server control class.

4445527
versioning	upgrade
protect your business by offering incentives to be a legitimate customer like technical support free minor versioning upgrade customer only discussion forums etc

4445546
screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi	mdpi	hdpi
it s my understanding that designing three unique interfaces ldpi mdpi and hdpi would be the best way to go about supporting all the potential android screens

4445560
x86	64bit
possibly c program files x86 if you re on a 64bit system

4445602
postgresql	mysql
the following is based on my postgresql experience but would probably also apply for mysql and others

4445651
imperative	declarative
you should read imperative vs declarative scenarios

4445686
inline	inlining
the keyword inline is more about telling the compiler that the symbol will be present in more than one object file without violating the one definition rule than about actual inlining which the compiler can decide to do or not to do

4445695
3des	aes
if you are running the 1.0 fips module in fips mode you get an ansi x9.31 rng which uses either 3des or aes at its core

4445736
folder	dir
it would appear that the application folder isn t actually being created although looking in the base dir i can see the tmp aruba folding is

4445744
put	get
you get add_one not defined because jslint thinks that function expressions should be declared in the right order and for the other issue implied global add_one 5 it s enough you put a comment such as globals add_one at the top of your script

4445756
implements	extends
then i looked at question code again and didn t understand why the custom cell extends a sprite when cellrenderer already implements the icellrenderer functions already

4445778
for-loop	arrays
my problem is that i am unable to figure out a way to dynamically sort the objects in the arrays based on the distance attribute which is a double as i am adding each object to the nsmutablearray in a for-loop from smallest to largest

4445793
memcached	apc
i would use memcached or apc

4445793
memcached	apc
memcached is a daemon you connect to where apc is actually inside of php instance a little faster

4445800
put	get
alternatively rather than using substr to get the first letter put param and change 5 to your regex of choice

4445827
google-chrome	firefox
for stuff like this i just use the built in tools in google-chrome or firebug in firefox if you swing that way

4445836
hex	binary
i ve tried numerous combinations binary and hex forms of the hash with and without the trailing newline and even hashing before passing into php function

4445950
profiling	debugging

4446005
subtraction	add
the subtraction will clear the alpha channel on color then you just add the desired alpha to the alpha channel

4446020
cdr	cons
basically you can t ever get a cons to be printed as a dotted pair inside parentheses when it is the cdr of another cons

4446030
cdr	cons
when you create a list you are creating a series of cons cells where the car of the cell is the value of that element in the list and the cdr is a reference to the next cons cell

4446031
cdr	cons
the car is the head element of the list or the first half of the cons cell and the cdr is the rest of the list or the second element of the cons cell

4446057
explode	implode
another solution would be to split title by a space using explode and provide a limit to say max 5 words than cut off the last element of array using array_pop and finally joining them with implode using that space as glue

4446085
folder	directory
now you want to add the folder you have the allegro libraries in to additional library directory

4446085
folder	directory
i would recommend putting the allegro files in the your project folder and then using local references in for the library and header directory

4446119

4446334
multiplying	add
no matter how many times you multiplying zero by things and add zero to it it s still zero

4446339
width	margin
using outerwidth true we can obtain the width of the element including its borders padding and margin

4446339
getter	setter	width	height
additionally the height and width functions are not just getter but also setter so this line

4446354
jobs	cron
i don t know if it s the best way but usually you setup cron jobs to that kind of things

4446354
jobs	cron
if you are on windows the scheduled task should be a drop in replacement for cron jobs

4446365
servicepoint	webrequest
if a unique connectiongroupname is assigned to a webrequest guid.newguid .tostring a new connection group with one connection will be created in the servicepoint for the request

google-chrome	firefox
tinkering with that allowed me to get the padding exactly the same in firefox google-chrome and ie

4446421
folder	directory
you can copy all the files and folder you need into a temp directory and then zip that up

4446422
put	get
perhaps you could also send the from variable using put instead of get which would keep it from appearing in the url

4446426
exponent	addition	subtraction	addition
the exponent -1 k is just a way to alternate between addition and subtraction -- you can replace that by having a variable that alternates its sign every iteration through the loop

4446477
udp	mtu
ensure that you do not send udp datagrams larger than the path mtu which is typically no more than 1400 bytes and sometimes less

vim	emacs
i tried to export my emacs and vim configurations into their own repositories and added them as submodles to a superrepository

although i have replied him that property provides a kind of secure safe indirect access to field instead of modifying them directly if they are declared public or protected

4446931

my canvas animation is smooth as ice in google-chrome but choppy as a bad haircut in firefox

4446976
getter	setter
to do that with a property you can simply wrap the getter and setter with a lock in one place

4446976
getter	setter
the ease of using lock in property getter and setter can give you a false sense of security if you re working with mutable types

my current idea is to get the left most and right most vertices as well as top most bottom most deriving the dimensions of the entire geometry based on that then going through each triangle and setting the uv of its vertices based on the triangles width height to a value that it will use a bit of the texture such that it will blend into the next one one vertex uv would be 0.1 0.3 and the next would be 0.2 0.4

both these methods work fine on their own but when put together in the same web service i get this error when calling method1

4450790
disk	ram
basically sql server will use as much memory as it can possible grab it is much more expensive to read from disk than from ram

4450790
disk	ram
to release the ram you can restart but then again all your queries will be slow because it will hit the disk

4450823
opensuse	linux
is the new gem just not compatible with my os i m running opensuse linux

4450828
disk	ram
starving sql server of ram will result is disk thrashing as data is churned through memory

i have a view that uses renderaction to render another view - it used to all work fine but i did a reasonably small refactoring and moved some of my model s properties to an abstract base class which my model inherited

4450871
jar	war
not sure this is related to the fact that you are deploying as a war but the path should be simply app-sevices-1.0.jar and the jar should be in the lib of the java ee application

4450871
jar	war
i would test making an ear containing a war for the webapp jar for the pu and your other jar for app-services like a traditional java ee deployment would be

4450873
inherited	properties
as the others say this situation is rare so most times you ll be creating new viewmodels although all viewmodels will probably inherited from a common base class for properties notification.

getter	setter
coming from c# php i would like to have full getter setter on the classes functions that i create with javascript

4450941
getter	setter
however in much of the javascript code i have encountered getter and setter are not used rather simple public variables

4450941
getter	setter
i was pleased to find john resig s article on getter and setter but some comments on it which state that some browsers do not support getter and setter which is confusing to me since they are not a feature of javascript but more of a simple pattern which uses basic javascript syntax

4450949
width	height
you can define the number of pixels for both width and height

4450956
min	max	width	height
min max width height

4450971

this code works in ie firefox google-chrome

4450978
implements	extends
extends your window class so that it has idisposable then implements the dispose method as before

4450994
getter	setter
getter and setter aren t features but design patterns code bloat in this case for languages that don t support property syntax

4450994
getter	setter
since javascript doesn t need getter and setter you don t want to write them

4451005
jar	war
the ear has a jar and war inside already

4451005
folder	dir
i have tried putting it in all lib folder in the glassfish dir and even inside various places in the ear only

4451030
versioning	upgrade
just make sure you have a good tracking mechanism to know what versioning each client is on and that you use source control to track all database changes by versioning so you can easily upgrade

4451033
getter	setter
the getter and setter methods here act on a private object used to store properties that cannot be accessed from any other methods

4451033
getter	setter
so you could for example implement a setter or getter that logs or does ajax or whatever whenever a property is modified one of the purposes of getter setter methods

4451048
rss	feed
after reading a bit more about database management i found another way to handle this was to have two tables the meta table and a table for every item in the rss feed and in that table have a column with the id of the feed it came from

4451053
children	parent
the environment shell which this parent lives in does not know anything about its children which means it does not know anything about the events they will be expecting

nfa	dfa
i m mostly confident in generating an initial nfa transition table from a state diagram but after that i lose the dfa in the epsilons and subsets

4451223
gridview	repeater
you might want to maybe think about using a repeater to generate the outer table and perhaps embed a gridview into each row to do the detail - i think this might give you a bit more flexibility in your layout

4451226
client-side	server-side
i think the answer might be that what s good for client-side isn t always good for server-side

4451262
restrict	shared
so if the your want shared the app from the phone to phone then i have to restrict to shared or ask for the payment

4451262
publishing	copy-protection
is there possible to publishing my app without licensing by selecting copy-protection option as off now and update it later

4451268
getter	setter
or maybe the other answerers are missing the point. ecmascript provides a behind-the-scenes getter setter mechanism so that

4451268
getter	setter
where putvalue and getvalue are unnamed not directly accessible functions for setter and getter for properties

4451268
getter	setter
and 8.7.2 the 3rd edition doesn t seem to explicitly define how users can set up custom getter and setter functions

4451268
getter	setter
see this so question on getter and setter

4451306
dictionary	map
it can be treated as an array list vector hash table an implementation of a map dictionary collection stack queue and probably more

google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox currently surround round-corners via the border-radius and -moz-border-radius css attributes so you can achieve a circle visually with 50 border radius

4451502
folder	directory
you can use searchoption.alldirectories to recursively search down folder you just need to create the directory before you copy.

4451517
firefox	safari
some of the calls were simply ignored by internet explorer 8 firefox 3.6 and safari 5 worked fine

4451546

uiview	subviews
i m doing uiview animation on individual subviews that have a number of sibling views that i don t want affected by the single-view animation

4451725
nfa	dfa
the core idea is probably to understand that the dfa is a sort of machine that is superimposed over the nfa

4451725
nfa	dfa
each state in the dfa is a subset of the states in the nfa

4451725
nfa	dfa
the start state of the dfa is the set containing only the start state of the nfa and the accept state for the dfa is all of its states which have the accept state of the nfa as elements

4451725
nfa	dfa
an nfa is non-deterministic because its output states for a given input is a set of states but the dfa has sets of the corresponding nfa states as its own states representing which of the nfa states the automaton could be in

4451725
nfa	dfa
so the output state of any dfa state for any given input is the union of output states of all of the nfa states of that dfa state

4451725
nfa	dfa
in terms of actual implementations the dfa has a state population that is essentially the powerset of the nfa s states

4451725
nfa	dfa
in practice it s usually much smaller but there s no general way to predict it s size so some practical nfa to dfa implementations generate the dfa states dynamically as they are reached and cache them

4451750
nfa	dfa
when you construct a dfa from an nfa you basically find those sets of states that the nfa can be in a time like simulating the nfa

4451750
nfa	dfa
those may lead to another nfa state for that you find the states reachable through epsilon inputs again and you will get another set of nfa states that will be a new dfa state

4451750
nfa	dfa
the point is that the resulting dfa states will become sets of the old nfa states that are compatible regarding to epsilon transitions

4451750
nfa	dfa
it shows the nfa state sets that form the given dfa state

4451750
nfa	dfa
any dfa states that contain at least one nfa accept state will become accept states in the dfa too

4451851

4452659
cos	sin
if you ellipse is defined by a cos x b sin x the tangent is -a sin x b cos x

4452659

4452743
post	get
i m using asp mvc 2 and i have a page which has some data on and i have a link which will execute an ajax request to get some data and post it to a div on the page

4452743

once i have the data i d like something to become visible which i could click to toggle the visibility of the div containing the data so the user could show hide this extra information but i don t want the original link to be visible anymore

4452743
hide	show
i don t mind if the original link changes what it does so that say before the data is loaded it says show data then once it is loaded it then changes to hide data and if it is hidden it changes to show data again and if it is clicked again then it just show the div again although reloading the data from the ajax call would not be the end of the world

4452767

4454587
equals	tostring
i was overriding the equals and tostring in playlist partial classes in silverlight

4454590

4455007
prepare	execute
the only workaround i can think of is to create a prepare statement from a dynamically created string where you can use the variables to specify the order by details and then execute that prepare statement

4455015
children	parent
specify it once in a parent pom instead and all the children should inherit the same setup.

4455057
public	protected
to have read only attributes in your model you should look at using private protected properties and then creating a public getter function for each property property can then be read but not set

however i ve been unable to get the plugin to execute the shortcode once it is not placed in the content area of the post

4455507
ilist	icollection
ilist is everything that icollection is but it also supports adding and removing items retrieving items by index etc

4455507
ilist	iqueryable
you can always create an iqueryable from an ilist and use linq to objects but you also find iqueryable used for deferred execution of sql statements in linq to sql and linq to entities

4455585

http.sys	httplistener
quick background i understand that httplistener uses http.sys kernel driver which supposedly makes it a great performer

4455910
post	get
what i m not sure from your question is whether you are meant to get visual studio to auto-generate a web-service proxy by adding a web-reference in your web-forms project or if you need to create and post the xml to the web-service over http yourself explicitly

4455919
public	protected
i guess i could rewrite mage_core_model_resource_transaction and add public wrappers for the protected methods but i m hesitant to override such a core class

4455937
google-chrome	safari
strangely the same url is accessible in google-chrome and safari

4455937
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i can also access the same url with firefox google-chrome or safari on my mac

4455953
margin	height
i ve tried several different solutions including setting the container div s height to auto overflow to auto bottom margin to 65 height of the footer and setting the overflow to scroll for the comments div resulted in very loose comments

4455982
width	height
you can use absolute numbers in window.setlayout just like you can everywhere else you specify layout width and height

4455999
cpython	ironpython
i m trying to do some very basic net framework programming windows forms etc. like you can do inside of ironpython using cpython

4456004
bash	subshell
bash seems to remove trailing newlines from the output of subshell

4456085
google-chrome	firefox
this behavior occurs in both google-chrome and firefox 3.6

4456091
width	height
make width and height of rectangle to 100

4456098
udp	rtp
i am implementing the atsc-153 specification which basically broadcasts a baseline h.264 video profile in ip udp rtp according to rfc 3984

4456107
addition	multiplication
if you think of false as of 0 and of true as of 1 then is like multiplication and || is like addition they are actually called logical multiplication and logical addition

4456107
addition	multiplication
the precedence relationship is the same multiplication is higher then addition

4456298
width	height
i m loading the map into my page in an iframe that has a width and height 400 x 200

4456308
udp	tcp
i work on a product that supports communications for udp and over tcp ip and educated guess the udp implementation involves probably 10 times as much code and has much greater complexity

4456328
google-chrome	safari
only works on google-chrome safari

4456405
google-chrome	firefox
i have a cgi script for which i ve successfully set a cookie which i can see in firefox google-chrome

4456496
put	get
i have searched google but all i seem to get is how to put it onto a treepanel

4456502
profiling	benchmarking
and when it s not premature any more always profiling benchmarking before during and after optimizing..

4456511
pbkdf2	hash
with a typical hashing scheme to store a password it is best to run the hash a bunch of iterations pbkdf2

4456527
atexit	main
if the main application uses the standard c library then you can make use of the atexit 3 function to register a function to be called when the application exits

4456580
dictionary	map
you ll need to map the tables properly and populate the fields in the imagined object routedetails including the defaults dictionary which would probably be the most complicated

4456601
cassini	iis
i was only able to get integrated trace output to work in iis 7.5 by running my mvc 3 application in cassini - then integrated tracing started working in iis 7.5

4456605
stdout	fflush
it sounds like the difference is that stdout is automatically being fflush in idle

4456625
getter	setter
code generation to work around the verbosity getter setter

4456667
post	get
option quotes you must post data to get the information you want

4456702
opera	firefox
the easiest way would be to use browser developer tools such as firebug for firefox or opera s dragonfly to capture a utm.gif request and copy the url

4456724
freebsd	linux
i tried it on linux and it worked but on freebsd i see the results you got

4456756
express	geddy
and while using a js based webframework like geddy or express is cool i have alot of existing rails code and 3rd party libraries such as active merchant that i would have to reinvent

4456777
post	get
it s getting a get requet not a post which would be required for a soap request

4456827
width	height
i have few windows each window can be moved and re sized but with specified ratio between width and height eg

4456827
width	height
2 1 height width

4456837
post	get
on the other hand if the post snippet classes do have different behavior depending on type then a better solution would be to use duck typing to get the output you want

4456838
post	get
the simplest would be to enforce by convention that all views only use get and post arguments and otherwise take some standard set of arguments request template_name

4456849
viewmodel	caliburn
when you re using caliburn micro it will automatically map keys in the query string to properties on the viewmodel

4456879
put	get
so if you put it together you can get a complete search

4456914
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in safari google-chrome and firefox but not ie 7 i don t care about 6 and i don t have 8 to test

4456926
inline	inlining	children	parent
for this my rule is only to inline children into parent to prevent infinite recursion but this precludes sibling functions inlining once into each other

4456926
inline	inlining
as mentioned i broke this regress by only allowing inlining a recursive call to a child preventing sibling recursions being inline

4456926
inline	inlining
if all the calls to a function are inline we should get rid of the function if it has not been inline into yet otherwise we ll waste time inlining into a function which is no longer used

4456926
polymorphism	specialization	inline	inlining
this makes the inlining routine extremely complex for example type-class instances replace abstract functions whenever possible due to type specialization when calling a polymorphism function it may be possible to find an instance whilst inlining so now we have a new function we can inline

4456983
put	get	post	get	post	put
rest-based services get post put

4456998

post	get
okay i can get it to work by selecting all the items in the list with javascript right before the post back

4457097
hash	salt
what if my server gets hacked and the hacker views my hash passwords and can see what salt i was using

4457098
google-chrome	firefox
the code works as expected in firefox but not ie or google-chrome

4457118
width	height
width and height are override properties of the stage

4457118
width	height
anyway you can alternatively set the width and height of the map object by assigning values to those properties map.width and map.height if you don t want to use their not-so-convenient setsize method

4457141
queue	fifo
i m looking for a way to serialize the requests into a fifo style queue meaning that any ajax request that s made check messages check contacts send message can be pushed onto the queue and will execute as soon as the previous ajax call is complete 100 done and returned

4457145
hash	salt
given a salt an attacker can build what s known as a rainbow table that s basically a reverse of the hash function

4457172
post	get
if so iphone app should get the page with the form and then post using the csrf token

4457201
hash	salt
the hacker has everything he wants except the users passwords which dont give anything he hasnt got already apart from the opperunity to spoof a user access -- which he can do very simply by putting his own hash and salt in the database

4457201
salt	md5
so yes md5 plus salt is good enough security in this case

4457240
hash	salt
i have some code here for a login system that is purely or learning purposes created with some major help from the great people of stackoverflow and i was told not to store the salt and the hash seperate but rather together

4457253

4457450
rsa	aes
i found lots and lots of different versions of rsa and aes floating around the web and

4457450
rsa	aes
anyhow i knocked up an example of a js webapp talking to a google app engine hosted python server that uses aes and public key and private key rsa stuff

4457469
width	height
this will act as a flag and once animation has been done it wont happen again on same element irrespective of height and width

4457469
width	height
your code will not depend upon height width params

4457469
width	height
if tomorrow animation changes and your blocks animate to a different height width this code will still be valid

4457564
hide	show
i have a comments section on a webpage that i have hidden initially and when the user clicks the comments link the div tag and comments appear using the jquery show hide functions

4457611
integer	unsigned
in c unsigned long is a 32-bit unsigned integer -- this corresponds to uint in c# not ulong which is a 64-bit unsigned integer

4457663
serializable	deserialization
sure that blob was serializable in java but that s irrelavent to the deserialization process

4457798
implements	extends
sounds like you need to create your own view-helper extends the standard zend framework headmeta view helper and implements a method called appendproperty mimicking the behavior of appendname

4457818
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
if for any reason log4net throws an uncaught exception except for argumentexception and argumentnullexception which may be thrown please send an email to the log4net-user logging.apache.org mailing list

4457834
firefox	safari
for example these all display as i expected in safari but no text is shown in firefox using inline styles just for the sake of this example

4457841
uiview	calayer
if you are drawing in an unusual context outside of uiview calayer drawing methods in a pure core graphics context you may need to wrap uikit drawing in uigraphicspushcontext uigraphicspopcontext calls

postgresql	mysql
i have another completely separate rails app that i need to import records from the external mysql database the rails app is powered by postgresql and it hosted remotely

4457998
int	chars
for example with the second example with p as an int and on a system with 8 bit chars and 32 bit int you are basically accomplishing p-1

4458032
children	parent
you know that parent is first node the rest are children

4458084
opensso	siteminder
i was only able to make fedlet work with an opensso identity provider but not with the ca siteminder

4458103
post	get
when using non-ajax post page reload or redirect on server side i can get inputs value of html form submitted by users

4458104
bluetooth	usb
i have researched and found some say it is possible to send serial data to the a855 either through the usb port or through bluetooth

4458143
innodb	myisam
unless you have a reason for using myisam i d recommend switching to innodb as your database engine

4458165
x86	64bit
i mean i have read a lot about normal console applications or executables with pe 32 x86 run as wow64 on 64bit servers

4458181

this case-sensitive search occurs even on filesystems such as hfs+ that are not case sensitive when it comes to file names

4458191
jar	war
the packaging type of views module is jar whereas that of core module is war

i wanted to ask is there similar attribute in adfs too which when set will send the saml response to the desired acs url instead of the default

4458198
int	chars
in the center of the document that uses a callback to report the chars and position of input that failed to parse an int

4458215
getter	setter	tostring	getter
as well as a method to add cities some getter and setter methods and a tostring

4458242
stdout	stderr
however if you also want to capture stderr errors such as why the java program couldn t be started you should also use the 2 1 tag which redirects stderr the 2 to stdout the 1

4458311
cherokee	lighttpd	pascal	delphi
consider using a dedicated optimized server instead of a delphi server like lighttpd or cherokee using fastcgi to handle the requests via a free pascal or crosskylix application under linux

4458323
lxml	elementtree
since you re getting the entire response as one large xml string you can use lxml s fromstring method to get it into a complete elementtree object

4458325
onresume	onpause
the only thing i can think of is to save a timestamp in a preference each time any activity pauses onpause and then whenever any activity resumes onresume check that value and if it is too long ago redirect to a splash screen activity

4458396
unsigned	short
char is unsigned while short is signed

4458398
pentaho	olap
i am evaluating a choice between oracle olap and pentaho mondrian

width	height
i want to draw the smaller first in a bitmapdata object which its width and height are 24 20

4458445
postgresql	mysql
if the primary keys always match up between mysql and postgresql you can just try to save the record setting the primary key explicitly

4458466
put	get	post	get	post	put
clients can send a dataless request using http get although even then data can be put in the url or headers or they can send data using http post and the server gets to send a response with headers and data

4458550
ienumerable	iqueryable
this would be very problematic when dealing with iqueryable and getting the ienumerable invoked resolved instead eg linq2sql

4458605
strsplit	substr
if you have significant performance concerns and the format of your input strings are static you may even want to consider abandoning regex s in favour of substr or even strsplit

4458682
hide	show
sudeepsr please make a note of that if you called show 0 it will show the media controller until hide is called

4458707
getter	setter
in our case the removal of a myriad unnecessary getter setter the increase in encapsulation the concentrating of business logic and resulting dramatic simplification of the services layers that come along with ddd have made the system so much more easy to maintain that now i believe we will be able to finish it whereas before it was dragging on into forever

4458720
twig	smarty	twig	dwoo	dwoo	smarty
a lot of people are using templates like smarty dwoo twig etc so dont afraid

4458761
sorting	filtering
if you filtering first you will remove some of the elements this making the sorting faster

4458766
sorting	filtering
in the first form you d be filtering and then sorting those two users.

4458792
sorting	filtering
however with a less intelligent provider you might find that doing the .where first would be more efficient as it would filtering your objects before sorting them which could make quite a difference with a large number of entities

4458811
scikit-learn	libsvm
scikit-learn hides most of the details of libsvm when handling custom kernels

4458817
spoofing	traffic
anyone can sniff the traffic and spoofing pretty much every aspect of it

4458823
width	margin
currently you are using margins to size everything this means that the actual width of your rectangle is the width of your grid container minus the left and right margin values

4458823
width	height
it is much better if you set the width height explicitly

4458897
int	chars
given the length of your strings 32 chars your numbers will not fit in a decimal let alone long or int

4459007
width	height
measuring graphicelements with strokes is slightly different between using width height and constraints

4459033
kerberos	ntlm
there is a server running on linux box which understand kerberos which also process spnego and understands only kerberos but it does not understand ntlm

4459166
cos	sin
but as you can see there is a blank space between each single stack because a chip have width of 20px with a regular cos sin it s ok but here the distance between each single stack is amplified by the ellipse coefficient i 20 sin a

4459179
hide	show
you would create a button and in the event handler of that button you would set the visible property of the panel that you want to show hide to true false

4459185
int	chars
what i thought was chars c oxaa will be aa and when it is typecasted to int it changes to 000000aa

4459185
int	chars
can anyone tell me what is happening when the chars is being typecasted to int

4459192
int	chars
it shouldn t have allowed any conversions between chars and int types except by using special utility methods

4459192
int	boolean
like boolean is impossible to convert to int and back

4459202
webclient	httpwebrequest
webclient httpwebrequest and the ui thread on windows phone 7

4459212
int	chars
the chars type of your compiler is signed so when it s converted to int it is sign-extended since the highest bit is set

4459241
int	chars
chars is often signed so when you cast to the signed by default int the first 1 means that it s interpreted as a negative twos-complement number

4459241
int	chars
to avoid this use an unsigned chars or an unsigned int

4459247
mef	prism
so i got my prism mvvm mef program running nicely along the user is entering data in the application then closes the application or shuts down the computer

4459259

realloc	malloc
malloc is not required you can use realloc only

4459308
realloc	malloc
malloc n is equivalent to realloc null n

4459308
realloc	malloc
however it is often clearer to use malloc instead of special semantics of realloc

4459308
free	realloc
edit removed mention of realloc acting as free since it s not standard c

4459336
tinyint	boolean
either create a separate deleted column which is a boolean tinyint to with false 0 to indicate the row is not deleted or use a default time in the deleted timestamp for non deleted rows

submit	submission
i m trying to have simple code that will allow a user to submit text and have the text appear right below the submission area

4459388
post	get
in my template i just enumerate and write out the desired html but the problem is i don t know how to get the data from the post back

4459395
rss	feed
you could automatically generate the rss xml on request with any of a number of different scripting languages from the database or flat file or you could update the static rss feed whenever you post

4459423
x86	64bit
i suspect that this is a 32 64bit issue so i tried re-compiling the dll for x64 architectures and now i can choose at runtime which dll to load between the x86 and the x64

4459539
width	height
all i m doing is creating a new vscrollbar setting it s coordinates a width and height and doing an addchild but it s not showing up

4459554
isapi	httpmodule
its when you try testing on your dev pc running iis6 or iis5 that you might have a problem and this will generally revolve around the fact that robertp does not have a recognizable file extension so your httpmodule code will not be executed unless you add a file extension that uses the .net isapi

4459696
put	get
for reference read the get and put principle originally from java generics and collections

4459704
wordpress	joomla
having said that i would probably prefer to use joomla if this were a project for myself you would only miss the simplicity of wordpress for plugin or template modifications or even creation from scratch

4459768
stdout	fflush
try fflush stdout before the loop

4459782
spweb	spsite
the takeaway would be to always pass in spweb and spsite guid into methods outside the workflow in library classes as deriving them from splistitem objects will cause errors that are hard to trace

4459795
x86	64bit
however i want to use the x86 one on x86 machines and the 64bit one on 64bit machines someassembly_x86.dll vs someassembly_x64.dll both have dependencies to numerous anycpu assemblies

versioning	upgrade
if you ever upgrade the versioning of the 3rd party library you are using your hibernate mappings may not match anymore

4459998
inherited	properties
the issue is that i ll be entering the schema tree at various points and i need to make sure that i m aware of interesting properties that are being inherited from base kinds as well as those that are directly defined on the kind that i m currently looking at

4460018
innodb	myisam
anyway i do believe that the descision between myisam and innodb now rests mostly on the questions

4460052
hide	show
the problem is just that you hide them all then toggle the clicked one - so it will always be show

4460058
jboss	glassfish
i m sure the guys who moved to jboss from glassfish say the same

i need to bring multiplication and division symbol in html codes.how to do that

4460124
put	get
now i want to have some get and put methods like these

mouseleave	mouseenter
i have several gui control elements of which some are supposed to generate the same action code-behind function call on mouse interaction mouseenter mouseleave

4460211

put	get	post	get	post	put
i noticed that the sign out action of devise uses get i think the best practice is to put all data state-changing actions behind a post

4460365
implements	extends
anonymous class by default extends the parent class or implements the parent interface and there is no further clause to extends any other class or implements any more interfaces

4460430
post	get
i am pretty sure that you can exchange get with post

4460445
post	get
i switched to g-wan which offers a transparent ansi c scripts interface for get and post forms and many other goodies like charts gif i o etc.

4460460
git-merge	git-rebase

4460507
int	double
i m constantly appending to a file of stock quotes int longs double etc.

4460514
google-chrome	firefox	xmlhttprequest	xdomainrequest
in ie8 it s there but you have to use an xdomainrequest instead of an xmlhttprequest other browsers like google-chrome and firefox handle cors completely transparently with xmlhttprequest

4460514
client-side	server-side
if all of those fail your only real option is to have a proxy script on your server that you query which then uses server-side code to query the resource from the other domain since this restriction only applies client-side

4460537
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
as a side note the modern browser support cors internet explorer 8+ firefox 3.5+ safari 4+ and google-chrome

having implemented this particular feature with criteria i have to say that the most straightforward way is generating a series of icriterion like s on the fly after having split the input using the spaces as a delimiter

4461323
versioning	upgrade
now there can be an issue with clients that are linked with different versioning of subversion i noticed this back when i upgrade tortoisesvn that used the new versioning 1.6 subversion libs but still used the old ankhsvn that was linked to v1.5 as a result tortoise automatically upgrade the wcs which meant ankh no longer recognised them

i have an application.war folder not as file which contains jaxen-1.1.1.jar in the web-inf lib directory

hazelcast	terracotta
you can try hazelcast which offer this functionality but has a lighter touch on the rest of your system than terracotta more than you need just for this

4462416
hide	show
so then when the checkbox named 04 is checked we look in its rel field for the id of the object to hide or show

4462444
hide	show
if you need it to run when the page loads so the show hide states match the checkbox just call that change handler with .change shortcut for .trigger change like this

i don t want to set min max sizes because i want the button to render correctly if someone has a different dpi setting or language or whatever

4462561
post	get
i am interested why when using post in contrast to get with the following code

4462561
post	get
probably since i don t get the command property in the javascript object with the post method and get it with the get method there is some problem on the server side

4462561
post	get
if you can t get the solution from the case i presented above i would be glad to post some additional code on your demand

4462568
stdout	stderr
there are two buttons on the console toolbar at the bottom that allow you to take focus or not ...one for stdout one for stderr

4462601
width	height
after finished loading the element you can save the width and height from the button as fixed values

4462601
width	height
if it s not working i suggest saving it in some properties and after changing the content you can set the saved width and height to the button

4462637
int	chars
answers are correct except nobody mentioned the reason c++ int promotions require that chars type is promoted to int in expression had the types be different the answer would be quite different as well

4462658
folder	directory
is quite responsive but the problem is that it does not provide an input field so for the user to select a folder he she has to walk into the directory which can take many mouse clicks and is not fun

4462703
google-chrome	firefox
although it works fine on firefox and google-chrome on ie8 it won t trigger functions behind edit or remove buttons

4462703
google-chrome	firefox
same thing works no problem on firefox and google-chrome

4462996
ubuntu	linux
i am running on linux ubuntu

4463023
x86	64bit
i did finally resolve this it turns out that the code is not the issue in my case but instead i had used a 32 bit version of the system.data.sqlite.dll and compiled my test assembly as x86 to get it to work correctly and my other assemblies as anycpu which on my system meant 64bit

4463026
jmenubar	jmenuitem
with 2 jmenuitem added to a jmenu which is finally added to the jmenubar

4463031
printf	strtod
others have already commented that 23.345466467 does not exist as a float but if your goal is just round-trip conversion of float values that do exist without accidentally changing their value slightly you can either use printf and strtod with at least decimal_dig places posix but not plain iso c guarantees this round-trip to be exact or print the float in hex instead of decimal

4463099
children	parent
1 - the first thing you ll need is to create a representation of your entire website a list of nodes which have children parent and so forth

4463273
post	get
post data is not allowed on a get method

4463273

if you can figure out how to get your post data across from flash to rails you ll need to do a post to users_url and then you can modify your create method to send back the id of the user that was created

4463311
google-chrome	safari
now this works in google-chrome and safari but not on the iphone

4463319
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
currently i am trying to extract a collection of dynamically created controls checkbox and dropdownlistfor from a recursive control collection repeater

pop-up	dialog
however i m noticing that when i view the information and close it via calling it with a dialog.cancel command that the next time i open the dialog it doesn t bother to get the information again it just pop-up the same dialog that i saw before

4463376
mouseover	mouseout
using mouseover and mouseout i can display and remove the icon but as soon as i move my mouse over the delete icon it is removed because it fires the mouseout event for the element wrapper

4463384
mouseleave	mouseenter
mouseenter and mouseleave events

4463384
mouseleave	mouseenter
mouseenter and mouseleave events

4463384
mouseleave	mouseenter
if css doesn t do it for you you re looking for the mouseenter and mouseleave events which are ie-specific but emulated by jquery on all other browsers

4463384
mouseover	mouseout
the reason you had trouble with mouseover and mouseout is that they bubble and so your mouseout handler on your parent element was seeing the bubbled mouseout from the underlying element when your mouse moved into the delete element

4463384
mouseleave	mouseenter
mouseenter and mouseleave don t bubble and so they don t have that problem

4463418
x86	64bit
the default is any cpu change the setting to x86 to match your unmanaged dll and you should be fine regardless if you run on a 64bit or 32-bit os

4463468
pthreads	fork
if that won t work you really should think about whether fork is the right tool for the job i ve seen a lot of fork -related questions here probably as a result of some old-timer professor with his head buried in the 70s not being aware that pthreads are the tool for most such jobs

4463488
client-side	server-side
usually this is done server-side but i can understand how if this is a simple one-page production you might want to do it client-side

4463521
cos	sin
you could try to populate the hough domain with m and c parameters instead so that y mx + c can be re-written as c y - mx so instead of the usual rho x cos theta + y sin theta you have c y - mx

4463546
performselector	delegation
the detail view controller then can use that delegation pointer to send messages to the list view controller either directly via willsetvalue or indirectly via performselector withobject . when using performselector withobject it is generally a good idea to call respondstoselector on the delegation first to make sure you won t throw an exception should the object not respond to that message

4463568
children	parent
the children are automatically deleted when the parent is deleted

4463570

4463616
backgroundworker	dispatchertimer
your best bet if you don t want to use the filesystemwatcher is to either use a dispatchertimer or a loop within a backgroundworker - for what you re doing i would highly recommend the dispatchertimer as it processes on the ui thread which means you can safely update your datagrid without any threading issues

4463649
phpstorm	rubymine
then there s rubymine and phpstorm which are nice but then i d have one ide for ruby and one for php

4463772
apache	lighttpd
lighttpd an alternative to apache supports this natively

4463786
mouseup	mousedown
you can pretty easily set changes to occur on the normal sorts of visible states hover focus mousedown mouseup and it ll animate those state changes correctly from whatever state you re in to whatever other state you need

4463786
mouseup	mousedown
if the kind of change you re looking for is more extensive changing the type of control to say a contentcontrol and then catching the mousedown mouseup events from there might be a better workaround

4463791
versioning	upgrade
if nothing else works- and it well might i am not an iphone developer just an ipad user- you could try going with only one versioning of your application with the pro versioning existing as an in-app upgrade

4463801
hide	show
and either show or hide #mydiv depending on the passed value

4463807
robotium	robolectric
for running test suites look at robotium robolectric or the sdk provided monkeyrunner

4463846
hide	show
the divs to show hide are

4463871
dialogresult	invokerequired
when it was removed from the property as such the codebihind still had the dialogresult cancel for it - so my form was indeed closing and of course it was missing the handle so the invokerequired didn t return correct info and hence the errors

4463875
xul	xbl
depending on what you need to test you can get away with firebug - for example xul page without much xbl

4463884

rhodecode is pylons framework based mercurial repository browser management with build in push pull server and full text search and permissions system.

4463906
lisp	scheme
although if i was just learning i d choose scheme and have a field-day with continuations call-cc - it s definitely one of the more academic lisp dialects

4463931
strophe	smack
you can use combination of smack strophe and openfire to get your java based app work as desired

4463954
serializable	deserialization
i m pretty sure the qtime is the time it takes for the query to execute in solr whereas the elapsed time is the total time taken including the transmission and serializable deserialization of the results

4463957
filtering	grouping
within my filtering functionality i select the checked radio buttons of both radio grouping sets

4463999
disk	ram
for example if you try to load a file which is on a hard disk but not mapped into ram a page fault occurs and the file is paged into memory

4464015

you will need to start a new terminal session after running the installer to see this. the current python.org installers for os x create a folder in your applications directory named python m.n depending on the python version

4464032
pop-up	dialog
but when i call the fb.ui method above from my javascript source the facebook dialog pop-up but displays this error message

post	get
get the publish_stream right of a user and use the api method of the connection object with parameters like userid feed post array of informations about the post

4464062
int	chars
ry is an int 0 is a chars

4464062
int	chars
in java it is possible to upward-cast chars to int

4464062
int	chars
that is int - chars as far as types are concerned

4464062
int	chars
thus your java vm will automagically cast the chars to int which will make both arguments of the minus match typewise

4464062
int	chars
you can check that by changing the declaration of rz from int rz to chars rz the compile will then complain that you re trying to assign a int the result of the subtraction to a chars variable rz without an explicit cast

4464113
cos	sine	cos	sin
if sin and cos are true sine cosines -sin cos is already a normalized vector since sin 2+cos 2 1

4464208
boost	stl
boost is fine stl is fine

4464226
width	height
if you want to do truly customizable width and height there is no built-in feature that i m aware of that is equipped to do this

4464235
hide	show
instead i was hoping there was a way i could show hide checkboxes via the change changestart function

4464238
hash	salt
instead it is usually best to store a one-way hash such as using sha1 of the password combined with a random salt

4464238
hash	salt
you can combine the salt with the password and generate a one-way hash as follows

4464238
hash	salt
store both the hash password and the salt

4464238
hash	salt
when authenticating a user use the same salt as that used when creating the stored hash to hash the password entered by the user

4464290
folder	directory
i could probably create a virtual directory on the admin application to point to the root s views shared folder but it d be nice not to have to do that as it seems a bit of a hack

4464323
vbscript	jscript	vbscript	vba
the secret to using the common dialog from vbscript or vba or jscript for that matter is that you have to have its license installed on your machine

4464441
submit	submission
this creates 2 buttons the insert being the submission button so i refer to it as the submit button

4464446
google-chrome	safari
as far as i ve seen this only happens in safari google-chrome

4464485
pop-up	dialog
i am trying to test whether a user closed a pop-up dialog or not

4464492
google-chrome	firefox
so for example a firefox plugin will not work in google-chrome or ie

4464492
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome do both utilize javascript and css but they are fundamentally different in their structure

4464520
submit	submission
if you use jquery you could simply catch the form submission from a submit button like so

4464540
sorting	grouping
hopefully this would do it in two sorts the first sorting numeric values in numeric order and lumping the alpha stuff in a grouping at -1 which would then get sorted by alpha by our second part

4464548
persistent	transient
more information on persistent detached and transient objects can be found here

width	height
i have a div with fixed height width

4464608
width	height
in the div have image with unknown height width

4464712
children	parent
most programmatic approaches i ve seen try to assume all controls are direct children of the same parent container

4464730
hash	md5
often unintended whitespace or capitalization result in different md5 hash for what was assumed to be identical data

4464755
google-chrome	firefox
this code works fine in google-chrome and firefox but in ie 8 the live event will not fire the first time i uncheck a box

4464758
text-align	height
set line-height to the height of the box and use text-align center

4464795
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the menu looks good on windows but it breaks in firefox google-chrome and safari on mac os saw this by using browsershots

4464858
inherited	base-class
second class could implement some interface which has that method or inherited by another class which has that method and is inherited by current base-class

4464864
hash	md5
d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e is the md5 hash of an empty string so somewhere you have failed to fill your string with something more useful.

4464864
hash	md5
as luck would have it your hash is simply the result of md5 is very common

4464878
getter	setter
if you re going to this level of complexity and mucking up your object model just because you don t want to have getter and setter do it in groovy instead

4464878
getter	setter
they will have to override get which you re basically using to encapsulate your getter and setter anyway why not just add that method and delegate to those other methods and write specific logic which is likely to degrade with time

4464910
jar	war
i had all my jar files in webcontent web-inf lib directory of my project - i soon realised that when i export this as a war file and deploy in tomcat it takes these jar files with it and stores them local to the application

4464910
folder	directory
so i removed all the jars out of my projects lib folder and put them in the common lib directory

4464922
getter	setter
it become very difficult to write non-trivial getter setter in future

4464971
nsurl	nsdata
you don t need nsdata to load local file loadrequest should work directly with nsurl

4464973

entity-relationship	diagram
i ve got some entity-relationship diagram representing several thousand tables in a database

4465495

fadein	fadeout
i am creating effects in my air application using actionscript like fadein and fadeout

4465547
post	get
in my case firebug will first show a post to the url then a get to the redirected url

google-chrome	safari
when i checked those buttons in safari they looked different than in any other browser even google-chrome

4465683
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
in general buttons looks the same in firefox ie6-8 opera and google-chrome

4465683
google-chrome	safari
but in safari buttons have 3px of unknown extra space on left and right sides so buttons looks wider in safari rather than in google-chrome or other browser

4465683
google-chrome	safari
total width of button in safari web inspector 6px larger than in google-chrome web inspector

4465683
google-chrome	safari
since safari and google-chrome have same layout engine webkit i m in a little embarrassment

4465683
google-chrome	safari
- check blue buttons in google-chrome and then compare with safari you can see exact difference in web inspector

4465697
puts	gets
i assume that if user puts in a legitimate backslash it gets escaped as well so stripslashes should do it s job

4465708
portrait	landscape
i have a uinavigationcontroller -based app that only supports portrait but need to push one view that requires landscape

4465708
portrait	landscape
i ve found a previous post that describes how to allow mixed rotations for a single view but what is the process for forcing a single view when pushed to be in landscape then returning the app to portrait mode when the view is popped

4465761

shadowing	named
the easiest improvement is just to use functions instead of vars and avoid shadowing the method named with the argument named so it s clearer whether you are calling a recursive function or not

4465826
post	get
another service may have strayed from a rest best practice and uses a get request to a specific url to post data and then you will have to know the query string format and use your http library or tool to munge it up for you based on it s apis

4465826
post	get
if your use case is to post data at a url resource using xml over http just get any library out there for your development system that supports http requests and tell it to make a post request to that url with your xml data

4465843
width	height
so i also check to see if formrectangle top left width and height are not all 0 before returning true

4465844
int	chars
i would also recommend against int for nrcombinations because with only six chars with your base 36 alphabet you will get in trouble 36 6 2 31

4465859
hash	salt
in fact the only reason to transmit passwords hash hash + salt or otherwise over the network is in order to adhere to a legacy system or a system that otherwise has what i would call legacy requirements

4465898
width	height
i need to find the entire size also called logical area of a tscrollbox - as opposite to visible area that you get via width and height property or clientwidth clientheight

4465937

also note that greasemonkey has some caveats about how to use setinterval and settimeout

4466102
ostream	istream
the poco library requires an istream for input and ostream for output to compress data using its zlib wrapper

4466130
puts	fflush	stdout	fflush
which puts 2 into the stdout output buffer but does not fflush it

4466130
stdout	fflush
the child executes exit 0 which as a side-effect fflush stdout

4466130
stdout	fflush
the parent executes exit 0 which as a side-effect fflush stdout

4466130
stdout	fflush
if you put fflush stdout

4466134
ostream	istream
you could use normal istream and ostream objects and use the pubsetbuf method of their streambuf s to set the internal buffer of the stream to the internal buffer of the vector

4466135
cart	oscommerce	magento	oscommerce
please don t take offense if i suggest that if you are having these problems and you are attempting to build a shopping cart that you instead utilize a mature ecommerce solution like magento or oscommerce

4466150
boost	allocator
no need to use boost even if it s nice or to split allocator between lines with multiple indirection this is quite bad as it usually gives big performance penalty when accessing data and it fragments memory

4466150
boost	stl
obviously even if the above code is still simple and straightforward stl or boost does it well hence no need to reinvent the wheel

4466176
pop-up	dialog
right-click on the model designer and choose update model from database and a dialog box will pop-up

4466208
equals	gethashcode
if two string objects are equals the gethashcode method returns identical values

4466283
button	checkbox
checkbox radio textfield textarea select button imagebutton hiddenfield

4466283
subscript	superscript
bold italic underline strike - subscript superscript

4466306
hide	show	mousemove	mouseleave
you need three things an absolutely positioned div that s not nested in anything else parent is a mousemove event handler to show the div and move it around and a mouseleave handler to hide it

4466357
width	height
setting only the width or height of an img element causes the image to be proportionately scaled

4466387
equals	gethashcode
if they re value types your class needs to override equals and gethashcode

4466387
equals	gethashcode
if they re objects the equals and gethashcode implementations that you inherit from system.object will use reference equality to determine whether two objects are the same and therefore should be treated as the same key in the dictionary which is what you want

4466387
equals	gethashcode
so as long as you don t inherit from something that itself overrides equals and gethashcode you don t need to do anything special to use an object as a key

4466412
min	max
max field1 then min field1 || ||max field1 else min field1 end

4466442
memcached	apc
the best way is to keep track of that in memory redis apc memcached etc back upped by any persistent store mysql mongodb redis etc

4466442
memcached	apc
apc memcached

4466442
memcached	apc
apc and memcached don t have persistent storage so you have to do that using for example mysql

4466537
post	get
html-forms uses either post or get

4466537
post	get
stick with post on any action that does more than get data avoid xss-issues

4466539
for-loop	loops
if you are using a for-loop to iterate over the different images you need to set your constraints on loops itself not the content of loops

4466548
put	get
to get to the original object you want to put the function code in a closure and make a reference to the object outside the closure where you still have the correct reference to this

4466569
put	get
for get requests - just put it in the parameter line

4466575
children	parent
i could attach event handlers to each of the children however the child already knows about its parent so having the child inform the parent directly seems like the way to go

4466598
post	get
no problem if you use scripting on the same domain if you want to use cross domain just provide each page .php html etc that call each other an exchange paramater query safely using post get

4466621

jar	war
so hypothetically you could have a web container that would end up returning bunny.class from the jar file instead of the one from the root hierarchy of the war file

4466670
innodb	myisam
i know that myisam is supposed to read faster but innodb doesn t have to lock the entire table on writes

4466672
128bit	64bit
as far as i know movq supports at most one memory operand and its arguments are of 64bit size anyway so even if two memory operands were supported it still wouldn t give you that atomic 128bit copy you re looking for

4466704
innodb	myisam
myisam supports fts but innodb does not

4466719
children	parent
when using for xml the order of the result set must have the parent xml nodes before their children in general xml files should not rely on being ordered

4467038
getter	setter
specifically the constructor and four getter setter

4467066
getter	setter
it s basically being used after that in a getter setter style with array_merge i guess

4467078
getter	setter
in particular having those function definitions readily available to the compiler at the call site may enable inlining which for setter getter usually improves both speed and size of the executable

4467082
firefox	safari
but error is different between safari and firefox

4467082
firefox	safari
browser safari 5.0.3 firefox 3.6.8

firefox google-chrome safari opera all work as expected but ie block access to this cookies

4467450
daemons	systemd
the focus at the moment is on nodejs-based web servers and network-based applications but the modules link includes many other things including parsers daemons and bindings to linux s notification systemd just to give you a taste of the diversity there

4467460
put	get
the code is quite straightforward i firstly parse the xml and get all the product nodes and put them into a nodelist and the productlist is an arraylist

4467544

to me it is better to create methods like mousedown mouseup and etc in the dragstate

4467659
firefox	safari
i m primarily using firefox on pc and mac but it seems to do the same thing on ie pc and safari mac

4467740
firefox	safari
i don t know why it works but the drawback is it essentially removes the cross-fade envelope in ie it doesn t appear to visibly affect firefox or safari

4467749
allocator	stl
the full declaration of unordered_map as well as of all stl containers includes allocator as the last parameter

4467767
put	get
i don t get the hosted and service provider definition - let s say i have a few web applications that i developed and i want to put those on a server and charge people monthly to use them is that scenario spla covered

4467916
dbcontext	objectcontext
in entity framework you have objectcontext and dbcontext

4467922

just because the anchor tag isn t a div doesn t mean you can t style it with display block a height width background border etc

4467923
wordpress	joomla
yesterday i started to write website content on and support customers of plugin s for example captchas etc. supporting different web cmses content management systems on different platforms mainly php-based ones like wordpress joomla drupal etc. though they can be for any non-php cms like dotnetnuke

4467952
range	minimum
it should also be noted that there is sometimes a range of minimum and maximum bit rates that can be employed so that at no time can the bit rate be less than x or more than y

4467968
wordpress	joomla
it would be helpful to read some tutorials on the various cmses that you ll be supporting the most popular ones are definitely wordpress drupal and joomla but like you said there are others

4467970
hide	show
you should either always show your actions on the screen or if they are unimportant or infrequent hide them behind another action button like a + or wrench icon

4467975
width	height
sure define a javascript object which has a function that takes in a width and height parameter

4467975
width	height
it should return your desired font size based on that width and height

4467995
client-side	server-side
php is a server-side language javascript is purely client-side

4468030
udp	tcp
even the tcp extensions to the ice specification note that tcp connections are much less likely to succeed than udp connections between natted peers

4468030
udp	tcp
that said you can workaround this by routing tcp packets over a udp bridge including all of the error correction and flow control features

4468034
margin	height
all i want is a div that is full height but with a 50px margin on top

4468057
glut	sdl
there are several ways to do that for example using glut or sdl

4468075
put	get
i know where to put the setinterval code as indicated by my comment but i can t seem to get it to work

4468096
width	height
about the above link image dimensions the question is - i have lots of dynamic images on my site that are uploaded via a cms and therefore vary in height width

4468096
put	get	width	height
b use php s getimagesize function to get the image dimension dynamically and put it in the img tag as a width and height

4468125
bazaar	svn
now i want to work on this read-only also i have better experience with bazaar than svn so i want to change this repository from svn to a bazaar repository for working locally how can i do that and one additional thing does svn support local repositories like bazaar

the code you put in your post is calculating the time between september 1 and october 1 not october 1 and november 1

4468258
bazaar	svn
you will want to take a look at the documentation for bzr-svn which describes how to simply check out from svn with bazaar

4468258
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
also for svn you would have to set up a local svn server repo on your machine not as simple as git mercurial bazaar

4468287
bazaar	git
subversion is based off of a server-client model whereas in distributed vcses like git bazaar and mercurial it s all sort of rolled into one

4468292
wordpress	joomla
learn php - the language that both joomla and wordpress are written in - and then learn the joomla wordpress frameworks

i am not sure what you mean since your example includes 2 identical url but urls for push and pull can differ because of

4468393
put	get
too late but usually i get flots fixed by adding or an absolute width a number in pixels points or any hard measure system instead on em and so or sometimes to put a min-width property solves it also beware of padding and borders because of the boxmodel sum

4468426
hide	show
why the less size is hide scollbar because the scrollbar some times is made because the one div is too big to fit the father div and the father div create scollbar to show it all

4468446
post	get
if you post a form to an aspx page you can get the submitted values through the request.form collection

4468455
disk	ram
only difference is in ram hard disk capacity mine is slower

4468598
diagramming	flowchart
it is not a dedicated flowchart or diagramming package but it s core use case-- efficient and aesthetic rendering of objects comprised of nodes and edges obviously subsumes flowchart drawing--particularly because its api allows the user to set various constraints on the layout to encourage rendering in the various formats--eg you can require all nodes of the same level same number of parents from the root to be rendered in a single center-aligned row

4468633
rapidsvn	tortoisesvn
some clients like tortoisesvn cache some of these but not sure about rapidsvn

4468707
viewmodel	caliburn
i have followed exactly what was specified in the caliburn documentation and i saw a post earlier that mentioned something about iconventionmanager but my concern is that even by putting the rescue method directly on the viewmodel class itself the rescue method never gets called

4468708
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
now i need to build support for firefox google-chrome and safari on mac

4468719
for-loop	arrays
also the for-loop you use is bad in conjunction with arrays

hide	show
in the case you ve described you want the sections show hide status to be kept between pages for a single client

4469033
children	parent
as for your multiple source folders a multi-module maven project would probably be the best fit with a and b being children of some new parent project

4469036
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome works quite well though

4469044
google-chrome	firefox
this bug only appears in firefox - google-chrome does not appear to exhibit this problem leading me to believe that this may be a problem with either firefox s javascript engine or the greasemonkey add-on

4469046
background-image	background-position	background-repeat	background-image	background-repeat	background-position

this code splits the string using a spaces as a delimiter and gets the number in the index 2 position

4469400
public	protected
now i have thought about creating an instance of chain inside chaintween but this does not allow me to override functions and then i should make lots of properties public instead of protected which is not preferred too

4469426

i m writing an application which takes data input from a series of arbitrary rss feed

4469455
nhibernate	automapper

you ll have to read that post to get a broad understanding of the issue but i can speak about some specifics in this context

4469751
wwdc	ibooks
you should get the wwdc 2010 videos available when you have a developer account on developer.apple.com and also get the free books from apple in the ibooks store search apple developer

4469752
g++	gcc
i m involved in a lib that s supposed to be compileable on windows xp and newer 32 or 64 bit using mingw and visual c++ on linux 32 and 64 bit using gcc g++ and on macos using i-don t-know-what i m not maintaining that but i assume it s a gcc port

so the subclassing constructor calls the superclass constructor - which then creates a new subclassing which calls into the superclass constructor which creates a new subclassing etc.

4469924
dictionary	map
first break down the dictionary into sets of words of the same length and populate the map as follows

4469925

on changing the orientation of ipad from portrait to landscape i am need to hide the master view and change the detail view s frame size to show up on full screen

4470082
radgrid	radmenu

4470096
keydown	keyup
keeping track of the keydown and keyup events isn t reliable you can miss a notification when your app gains or loses the focus with the key down

4470098
viewdidload	viewwillappear
the problem in my implementation was that within viewdidload of view controller vc1 i was setting its view property to a new view controller vc2 which forces i believe the framework to exit viewdidload of vc1 without reaching its end hence not calling the consequent delegate function of the view controller viewwillappear viewwilldisappear viewwillappear and viewwilldisappear

4470098
viewdidload	viewdidappear
so my solution was to delay all the code that has to do with creating and setting vc2 to be called from within viewdidappear instead of viewdidload

4470135
button	checkbox
you need to rewrite your code so that all checkbox and the submit button ends up in the same form

4470316
pylons	web2py
i guess pylons and web2py are good options

4470317

4470339
getter	setter
the class definition i am using is the following no getter setter for simplicity

4470391
width	height
apply height and width to the parent li elements and then

4470394
onresume	onpause
if you only want your app to receive a notification that an sms has arrived only when it is open you need to register a broadcastreciever for sms messages in the onresume method using one of the registerreceiver methods and then un-register it in your activity s onpause method using unregisterreceiver

4470405
prepare	execute
obviously i have overwritten the prepare and execute methods and the execute method of the statement class as well

4470422
mouse	keyboard
the biggest issue i see here is if i monitor user activity keyboard and mouse then i ll assume the user is waiting when they might be reading thinking on the phone etc

4470517
ssms	sqlcmd
i ve set ssms to be in sqlcmd mode and all of my variables parse okay with the exception of one

4470524
portrait	landscape
the modal view appears in the correct size when first launched in both landscape and portrait however if you rotate the device the modal view will then expand to fill the screen - regardless of how much you rotate the device from that point onwards

4470524
portrait	landscape
regardless of whether i use formsheet pagesheet they both appear the correct width when first launched whether in landscape or portrait - i m aware pagesheet will fill the portrait view however on rotation the modal view will then fill the screen as if i had presented the modalview with fullscreen

4470526
ubuntu	debian
will break on for example dash which is bin sh in debian ubuntu since a while

4470580
keydown	keyup
i need to retrieve the keyboard state when a key is pressed on a particular form rather quickly - fast enough that the standard keyup keydown events for windows forms are not fast enough

4470583

for get set height width use height and width functions

4470590
wav	caf	wav	aiff	aiff	caf

4470648
width	height
i have a new width and i want to calculate the appropriate height

4470717
min	max
i would advise you to use one of the aggregation functions such as min or max to get a abetter defined item_created to sort on

4470763
ostringstream	std
for example in c++03 you cannot copy-initialize a std ostringstream because it doesn t have a copy constructor

4470763
ostringstream	std
and while to maintain its illusion of being a stream a std ostringstream can t be directly copied it can be moved

4470763
ostringstream	std
and in c++11 and later due to move semantics it can be used in a much wider range of cases than in c++03 such as with a std ostringstream

4470787
utf8-decode	percent-encoding
which is the utf8-decode then percent-encoding form of

4470798

fast-forward	merge
now merge your changes to dev without a fast-forward

4470823
short	base
if you have a highlight image that you want to apply to the point that s been touched then in short you could apply the highlight image to the base texture first simply rendering one on top of the other in a separate rendering pass then using the compound image as your texture

4470844
google-chrome	firefox
selenium 2 opens webpages in firefox ie google-chrome or its own htmldriver and can do almost everything with a rendered page especially with qunit test results

4470860
hide	show
if this has to be done on a static page on client side you could use window.location.hash to show hide different parts of the page

4470862
powerpc	i386
export osx_cflags -isysroot osx_sdk -arch powerpc -arch i386

4470862
powerpc	i386
export osx_ldflags -wl -syslibroot osx_sdk -arch powerpc -arch i386

4470862
powerpc	i386
export archflags -arch powerpc -arch i386

4470880
keydown	keyup
the solution probably depends on what you mean when you say that the keyup keydown events for windows aren t fast enough

4470880
mouse	keyboard
you can see on microsoft s own documentation that the use of directinput for keyboard and mouse input is not recommended.

4470919
rss	feed
i m writing a rss feed parser with java and i ve encountered a problem while parsing feed that have arabic chinese japanese characters

4470933

a group of vars that describe the current game state these will have setter that send out events on change and getter so that the view can access what changed

4470939
int	double
each node has an int data and a double probability

4470972
rss	feed
xml is usually by default parsed as utf-8 so that part is fine as well unless explicitly otherwise specified in the xml declaration header which is likely not the case since that would be a mistake of the rss feed server

4471005
children	parent
getting parent and children are the easy part

4471026
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works and displays fine in firefox safari google-chrome

haskell	ocaml
for instance ocaml and haskell now both have compilers that can output javascript

4471245
jquery	curvycorners
i already linked to a resource that can do this for you the curvycorners jquery will detect the use of -webkit-border-radius and moz-border-radius on dom elements and duplicate the effect in ie using a series of small divs with no images

4471261
mouse	keyboard
...a result event is triggered on the autocomplete input whenever an option is selected by mouse or by keyboard

4471267
min	max
you need to tell mysql which of the dates in the group to use with max min or one of the other aggregating functions

4471298
sudoers	passwd
and assuming you are a sudoers enter your passwd at the prompt

4471304
free	malloc
however it is likely that the way malloc and free work together is completely different to the way c# manages memory

4471326
folder	directory
use the path class when working with file paths and use the file and directory class when working with actual files and folder

4471385
getter	setter
sidenote concerning getter and setter in python see this article

4471409
zoo	xts
keep in mind that xts or zoo is basically a matrix plus index

4471440
folder	directory
since every versioned folder has a .svn directory you have to put

4471450
jquery	curvycorners
the scripting jquery solution you are talking about does exist take a look at jquery curvycorners

4471454
width	height
kind of substring in a string in order to extract the width and height

4471496
imperative	declarative
a highly imperative style as opposed to declarative -- you are concerned with how more than what

4471509
equals	tostring
it has all the benefits of the answer from arturh except the comparability it has hashcode equals tostring and a static â œconstructorâ

4471576
google-chrome	firefox
firefox can be made to work with this and here you find some information about debugging in google-chrome

4471641
servicecontract	servicebehavior
how your service will behave depends not just on the sessionmode specified for the servicecontract but also on the instancecontextmode under which your service implementation runs controlled by the instancecontextmode property of the servicebehavior

4471690
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in ie and firefox but google-chrome is having trouble

4471698

i seldom get an empty response after a post request in android

4471712
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
this should work on a uiviewcontroller which is on top of a uinavigationcontroller

4471729

the message mainly says ie6 is not suitable for browsing this website along with links to the latest firefox safari and google-chrome download

4471951
google-chrome	safari
this has been a recurring strange issue for me when accessing urls using py-appscript first in safari and now in google-chrome

4471983
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
i know we have to put clientaccesspolicy.xml and crossdomain.xml in our web server root but that is possible only if i have control on my services

4472027
maven	m2e
make sure a build is done successfully and ensure that on your package explorer the org.apache.commons jar is found under the maven dependencies section given you have m2e plugin installed in your eclipse

4472128
qtcpsocket	qudpsocket	qtcpsocket	qbytearray	qbytearray	qudpsocket	qbytearray	qhash
i am trying to serialize a qhash object and store it in a qbytearray to be sent using qudpsocket or qtcpsocket

4472200

by assuming multiplication and division is o 1

4472204
put	get
when i put an image on a report i get 3 options - external embedded or database

4472205
google-chrome	firefox
another alternative for javascript ajax is writing a google-chrome add-on easier than firefox or embeding a web browser within your application

4472281
scheme	racket
i would suggest you start with scheme and more specifically with racket formerly plt scheme

4472333
children	parent
with inverse attribute on children property child is responsible for itself otherwise parent is responsible for deleting a child

4472333
children	parent
you do not need both properties children parent in most cases you need them if you specify inverse true on children

4472338
width	height
and apparently if i were to try that i d learn it doesn t work - ok well width and height definitely seem to be attributes of elements as far as ie is concerned

4472347
cvs	svn
the sdk 4.x.x introduced silly bug see adobe bugsystem issue fb-27440 which causes projects with svn or cvs meta data compile much slower than with sdk 3.x.x

4472355
int	double
i created some database with tables for the various standard types like int double and so on

4472362
bmp	png
our web app let users download dynamically generated images in different formats bmp png and jpeg

4472372
put	get
i believe that if you have a div for each column into which you put the numbered divs you will get what you want

4472430
google-chrome	safari
between firebug the developer tools for google-chrome safari and the developer tools for ie8+ developers have some truly excellent ways to identify javascript-based slowdowns

4472504
width	height
one thing you could do is set the height to 0 initially and then upon layout in code check the width and set the height

4472579
versioning	upgrade
i logged into my dx account and found to my surprise that dx was offering me an upgrade to a new hotfix versioning of the same 2008.3 release even though my subscription is expired

4472586
lisp	scheme
bringing in a language like ruby or lisp doesn t make sense because javascript is a powerful dynamic language very close to scheme

4472589
setinterval	settimeout
that is where that pattern comes in and you can do the same thing with settimeout in combination with self-executing anonymous function and avoid bad setinterval like this

4472722
button	checkbox
ok so the user can go and check uncheck each one of the email addresses manually or he can click on a button that selects or deselects all the checkbox

4472762
exif	jfif
its due to exif and jfif standard

4472781
post	get
post to stackoverflow if you get stuck anywhere

4472825

hash	md5
in c# you can use the md5cryptoserviceprovider class to calculate an md5 hash

4472862
chown	sudo

4472933
post	get
when i post the form values after entering deliveryaddress1 and billingaddress1 and then iterate over the formcollection keys i get the following value

4472962
ant	maven
most likely the ant build sets some sort of properties for the environment either via your ant script and properties files directly or via the ant task you are using and the maven build does not do that

4472962
ant	maven
that in turn leaves you with different test runtime configurations failing in maven but not in ant

4472974
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the advantage to this is that when you install the msi it installs everything for ie firefox safari google-chrome and opera as well as other browsers which are compatible with the same plugin technologies that those browsers use

4472974
versioning	upgrade
that means that you don t have to worry about supporting uninstalling 10 different old installer versioning that put things in different places etc because the msi system takes care of uninstalling everything cleanly when you upgrade

4472987
versioning	upgrade
few days back i upgrade my xcode versioning to 3.2.5 and i am not able to see ios sdk 4.0 in it

and then tried emptying the test with empty still works in firefox and mysteriously not in google-chrome

4473025
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
works in firefox safari google-chrome but no go in ie

4473043
maven	pom.xml
hudson is smart enough to figure out from the maven pom.xml s what is upstream and downstream and even knows to build the downstream stuff when the upstream changes but it doesn t know to build the upstream stuff before the downstream stuff if they ve both changed

4473063
post	get
i succeed when i m looking for get messages or status codes but i don t know why it doesn t work for the post requests

4473139

i have a bluetooth device that works with my app but i want to show or hide it s capability based on whether a bluetooth device is connected or not

4473205
typedef	struct
now lets remove the struct size from the source code and define it using typedef instead like this

4473227
filtering	grouping
when you do a grouping by aggregate query you can use the having clause to apply a filtering to the aggregated data set

4473269
profiling	instrumentation	profiling	debugging
apple supply instrumentation for monitoring runtime allocation of stuff and finding leaks shark for explicit profiling and guard malloc directly built into xcode for memory allocation debugging

4473298
width	height
this sets the width of the source image to the width of the view and the height of the source image to the height of the view without maintaining the aspect ratio of the source image

4473351
google-chrome	firefox
i thought these two pieces of code they work in google-chrome and firefox were supposed to do the same thing but they behave in different ways

4473352
getter	setter
note that if you don t care about protocols compiler warnings etc. you don t need the protocol and property declarations or the getter and setter

4473361
hide	show
i ve sometimes had issues with show and hide if you don t actually pass in the paramter of fast or slow

4473428
hide	show
when i am building the screen that lets a user edit their own profile i want to have a check box for change password so that i can show hide the password box and i also want a confirm password field so they don t mis-type it

4473429
put	get
you can however put multiple uiviews inside the uiscrollview and you ll be able to scroll the views to get where you want to but i don t think that s what you re aiming for.

4473449
ant	maven
in other words you have to forget ant and start using maven

4473540
punctuation	words
the key part being you keep two parallel lines of text one that you check for words to translate and the other you check for punctuation if your translation search comes up with a hit

4473540
punctuation	words
to check for punctuation i fed the words group that i was examining into re like so which will strip out all characters but no punctuation

4473566
rss	feed
however i would like to ask what is the difference between these two rss feed

4473567

4473707
nsurl	nsstring
but instead of accessing controls in view controller s views directly it d be better to declare the url string as a nsstring property called say urlstring in webviewcontroller and set it to filestring before the presentmodalviewcontroller call and don t create the nsurl etc there

4473707
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
finally in webviewcontroller in viewwillappear or viewdidappear create the nsurl using urlstring create the nsurlrequest and call loadrequest

postgresql	mysql
the data is stored in a mysql database currently but if i was going too keep this method of accessing the data i would have to switch to postgresql

4474062
postgresql	mysql
for this method i would be using the postgresql jdbc driver in the same way i accesed the data in my other program with mysql

4474062
postgresql	mysql
postgresql because of licensing issues with mysql how i use it is simple read a value then write a line containing the value to the file until the end of the database is reached

post	get
get and post requests can be syntactically equivalent.

4474233
post	get
the difference is entirely semantic - post requests are expected to do something while get s are supposed to be safe always

4474235
instances	transient
basically it s reusing transient component instances for constructor injection with

the good news is that switching to a full rdbms like mysql or postgresql is usually very straightforward

4474270
versioning	upgrade
for what it s worth .net versioning upgrade are mostly backwards compatible

4474270
versioning	upgrade
there really isn t a big deal in .net upgrade as opposed to say java versioning upgrade which i ve seen break things in new and mysterious ways

4474289
zoo	xts
i suggest switching to a time series class like xts or zoo

4474289
zoo	xts
if you re ready for xts or zoo this should work in either then i suggest using rollapply to get the forward look assuming you want the forward looking return which makes it a lot easier to form portfolios today and see how it works into the future

4475238
equals	gethashcode
in your class you need to override the equals and gethashcode methods to implement your desired method of determining equality

4475246
versioning	upgrade
i should note that versioning 2.3.9 is not the latest versioning of the 2.3.x branch and you should upgrade the the latest versioning available

4475256
width	height
turns out i can prevent the app from crashing by removing the width and height from the pushpin

4475256
width	height
the microsoft solution didn t include pushpin width and height - so i assumed creating the map control dynamically was the answer - but adding the width and height - same crash as my original app

4475256
width	height
i need to change my code back to the original version with the map control in the xaml - and remove the pushpin width and height to see if it solves both versions - but this seems to be the problem - my app is now running fine - dynamically created map control - pushpin with no width or height

4475260
ant	pom.xml	ant	maven	maven	pom.xml
maven or similar build tools help avoid this situation by allowing you to commit just your source and a pom.xml file which describes the compilation of the project sort of like an ant file this way it can be built by anyone with maven from the command line furthermore plugins provide the ability to generate the ide specific files for users for example i use the flexmojos flexbuilder plugin at work or eclipse eclipse to generate the project files for flexbuilder or eclipse

4475288
octal	binary	octal	hex	hex	binary
windows calculator has hex octal and binary modes

so if you upgrade to a new versioning of jquery say 1.4.5 and you wanted to make sure that the client got the most current versioning of the file you change the end of the url

4475327
pydev	virtualenv
if this works anything like ipython you will need to install pydev inside of your virtualenv

4475337
subtract	add
what i need to do is add up all the expenses for each car then subtract that plus the price sold for from the price purchased for in order to get the overall profit

4475360

i d suggest using onblur and maybe onmouseup and or onkeyup

4475368
opera	firefox
these tags donâ t work at all in firefox 3.6.11 and opera 11.0 â regardless of the css display property they simply donâ t parse correctly

4475368
opera	firefox
you get the correct result in webkit firefox 4 and opera 11.11

4475368
opera	firefox
but you get this in opera 11.0 and firefox 3.6

versioning	upgrade
i ve released a lite versioning of an app that i want to then sell the pro upgrade for - without having to release a totally new versioning

4475432
integer	unsigned
i m using a fragment shader to change 16bit unsigned integer data to 8bit bitmap using window level and window hight linear ramp and display on screen

4475432
google-chrome	firefox
i tested it on google-chrome 8 and firefox 4

4475504
post	get
if i understand the linked post correctly this does not necessarily mean that it will work now probably not but you will get an exception giving you more details about the problem

4475505
width	height
i know i have to find the width of each rectangle which would be the distance between a and b divided by the amount of intervals the height can be calculated by using the equation y x 2 where x would be where each interval is located on the x-axis

4475505
width	height
to find the area of those rectangles i would multiply the width which would be the same for all rectangles times the height

4475540
integer	unsigned
for example an array of 32 bit unsigned integers of which all 32 bits available for each integer

4475540
integer	unsigned
padding bits are user-accessible in an unsigned integer type

4475545
serializable	deserialization
if your object implements the iserializable interface you can control all the data that is stored serializable yourself and you can control the deserialization

4475560
wav	ogg
ok i have some progress i can play ogg files but not wav dunno why

4475585
min	max
traversing the container finding min max find next prev sort of

pbkdf2	salt
when encrypting the private key use something like pbkdf2 with salt and some fairly large number it iterations

4475617
translation	localization
just create a new folder with suffix like values-cs and put the xml with czech strings in it and the whole app will be translation to czech if you have set czech localization in your phone

4475672
width	height
it works fine except the width and height

4475672
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested this on google-chrome and firefox

4475689
int	chars
if you want to be portable either only use unsigned chars fixed-sized int a c99 addition or determine the number of value-bits programatically

4475689
integer	unsigned
in case of unsigned types the resulting integer has 32 value bits and a precision of 32

4475689
integer	unsigned
now if you access a 32-bit signed integer as an unsigned integer which is explicitly allowed and does not violate the c99 aliasing rules the padding bit becomes a user-accessible value bit

4475728
inherited	properties
when you setup inherited for entities the parent entity s properties are inherited

4475789
serializable	deserialization
here is a very stripped down version of the stringtype class as well as some tests that show that serializable deserialization work for stringtype by itself but not when as a field on userdata

4475792
width	height
id +id height 400 width 1150 modal false refreshonshow true

4475799
width	height
i know i have to find the width of each rectangle which would be the distance between a and b divided by the amount of intervals the height can be calculated by using the equation y x 2 where x would be where each interval is located on the x-axis

4475799
width	height
to find the area of those rectangles i would multiply the width which would be the same for all rectangles times the height

4475833
google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly in ie and firefox but not in google-chrome

4475837
hash	salt
i can t use the best practice of only storing a salt hash of the password in the database

4475890
actionscript	mxml
i want to use actionscript 3 to create mxml flex 4 controls dynamically and automatically taking care of layout

4475893
put	get
you ll have to loop trough all elements preceding the first h1 including and put them into intro str intro then get everything up to the 2nd h1 into chapter1

4475900
int	double
error cannot convert â double unsigned int int n + -0x00000000000000001 + 1 â to â double â for argument â 1â to â bool checkarray double â

4475903
width	height
so what i have now is those gif images scaling with the height and subsequent width of the browser

4475939
google-chrome	firefox
i have it working in firefox google-chrome but not in ie

4475973
hex	binary
to do this i found the string stored in the binary file and replaced the ascii for e with a at the offset in the binary i assume it s the data section where the string is stored using vi s hex editor

4476013
maven-plugin	pom.xml
add maven-plugin to pom.xml

4476068
typedef	struct
typedef struct dato

4476085
addition	modulo
make sure you use a modulo addition so the texture wraps nicely

4476089
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
i put the following code in touchesbegan as well as in touchesmoved

4476122
children	parent
essentially float the parent so they re next to each other don t float the children so they appear vertically as a list does by default

4476136
versioning	upgrade
the problem you encountered now is just one of the problems and there are many more problems specially around the issue schema changes done during an application versioning upgrade

4476137
width	height
the midpoint y co-ordinate and also the height of the top is 5 + 7 2 or 6 and the width is 2 so the area is 12

4476200
configobj	configparser
i recently switched from configparser to configobj and i m thrilled to have done so

4476212
put	get
it calls http get method and rest service code shown below will get inventory data of specified id database primary id and i put the ajax responsetext into the div id inventoryitem

4476220
google-chrome	firefox
the last one is under the first one but under ie7 firefox google-chrome

4476266
macports	homebrew	fink	macports	fink	homebrew
other options are to install a python 2.6 using macports fink or homebrew or build it yourself a little tricky to get all the batteries included

4476268
tcpdf	fpdf
i have one for fpdf but i can t get it to work in tcpdf

4476289
int	double
although you ve subsquently said that you actually have a double available to store the information i thought i might still share some thoughts on doing this with a 32 bit int

4476289
integer	unsigned
the largest number that can be represented by an unsigned 32 bit integer is 4 294 967 295 and we we have a score range of 0 to 1 000 000

4476292
primes	modulus
check the modulus of n with respect to a list of small primes

4476307
querypath	phpquery
while this is a case where regexs would work okayish the general consensus is that you should use querypath or phpquery or alike to extract html

4476315
width	height
width height is the texture size in pixel

4476356
iboutlet	ibaction
however it s appropriate to hook one ibaction with multiple iboutlet

4476366
int	chars
as i think every programming language compares an int and a chars on behave of ascii value of chars

4476373
post	get
post or get

4476452
post	get
look into the msdn documentation and examples about system.net.webclient doesn t lend itself as well to post favours get for quick usage methods

4476481
getter	setter
now we want to add custom methods to the jaxb generated classes so that the object would know more about itself rather than being a simple pojo with getter and setter

4476488
put	get
for some reason when i put my header file in i get this error expected init-declarator before int or void

4476497
multicastdelegate	delegation
the standard multicastdelegate wouldn t be suitable for dispatching events since each subscriber should receive a different unsubscription delegation but unsubscribing events wouldn t require a linear search through an invocation list

4476508
background-color	transparency
and the default for background-color is transparency

4476508
background-color	transparency
the image should still show up though if it s found so i m guessing it s not and instead the transparency background-color is being shown

4476547
move	drag
something like windows explorer right click move slightly and you get the adorner to indicate a drag drop in operation

4476577
glut	sdl
try the linux glut or linux sdl versions

4476644
hash	salt
hash the password sha256 with salt i use the same salt for every password

4476654
for-loop	loops
while there are a couple of problems with the code you ve posted the biggest issue is using a for-loop where it would be more natural to use a while loops

4476705
rss	feed
i ve only been able to find guides on making rss feed for your own site

4476717
hash	salt
this means if the salt is compromised so are all the hash values

4476724
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
hash a combination of the username and password md5 password + salt + username

4476726
rational-numbers	integer
if you limit yourself to rational-numbers you can express the steps with integers and divide the integer index by a single denominator as you convert each entry to a float if you have to have it in that form

4476735
udp	tcp
this client api uses normal tcp sockets udp sockets c++ namespaces and parts of the stl like std map and std vector and will be published as a set of header files and .a and .lib files to link against

4476788
udp	tcp
so_sndbuf i think only matters for tcp in udp whatever you send goes directly out to the network

4476804
octal	hex	octal	decimal
when using scanf and its variants the format specifier i will accept data as hex prefixed 0x octal prefixed 0 or decimal no prefix so for example the strings 0x10 020 and 16 are all converted to an integer with decimal value 16

4476804
octal	hex	octal	decimal
in case you might be wondering i am implementing an expression evaluator and i would like allowed integer operands to be hex octal or decimal using the c c++ prefix convention

4476810
post	get
also even though ajax is being called my java file with jax-rs annotated witn post is not even being called get version is working with separate data so this is the right file since the first line of its method that spit message is not showing up so i suspect my ajax statement has some bug or there is something beyond my thinking

4476826
swt	swing
i can see though that if i scaled out my application to an enterprise level mvc design requiring richer interactions with users that using swt and jface may not be as suitable as using swing

4476881
executable	upx
you may try upx - ultimate packer for executable

4476898
many-to-many	one-to-many
having two one-to-many relationships in opposite direction is not the same thing as having a many-to-many relationship

4476919
imap	nntp
technically it supports both imap and pop as well as nntp but not all capabilities functions are available for pop

4476965
jobs	cron
now when i compile and login as an admin local development dashboard doesn t show cron jobs link

int	double
value types in c# are either user-defined structs enumerations and numeric types such as int float double decimal etc. see the documentation on value types for more information

4477240
getter	setter
besides this kind of object typically consists of just getter and setter and can be written very quickly .

4477426
datamapper	activerecord
especially with rails 3 orms are pluggable - you can easily use datamapper or sequel instead of activerecord

4477467
concave	convex	concave	angle
remember that you can use a dot product to determine how sharp an angle is and a vector product to distinguish between convex and concave angle

4477479
jobs	cron
used on some bdd the host only provides some php script jobs no cron and mail are sent to gmail

4477480
google-chrome	firefox
for that i got error in ie that says invalid argument interesting that in firefox and google-chrome that aproach worked

4477554
versioning	upgrade
you ll also need to increment the productcode and packagecode to reflect that this is an upgrade versioning of the application

4477563
pop-up	dialog
pop-up dialog and blinking should be used very sparingly

4477569
sorting	grouping

4477661
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
this is mainly useful for malloc calloc realloc

4477684
datamapper	activerecord
if you don t want to use activerecord at all then i would encourage you to look at either datamapper or mongoid

4477684
datamapper	activerecord
datamapper provides much of the same functionality as activerecord and some have been known to prefer the syntax

4477714
hex	binary
i forgot and also how to convert from hex to binary

4477720

this library provides an api to capture packets wireshark is also able to capture frames but i haven t found in pcap docs that pcap is able to do that

4477748
winpcap	libpcap
libpcap or tcpdump on unix depending on how low-level you need it to be and winpcap or windows filtering platform on windows

4477758
post	get
the request-too-large.php file will probably get a standard get request - any post parameters will be lost but you can look inside and to see if there is anything else left over from the original request

4477768
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
no errors in firebug and same picture in all browsers opera ie google-chrome firefox

4477896
google-chrome	safari
yeah that s a mouthful.....my point is...i had a very strong grasp on css2 screen media covering ie6 7 ff2 safari opera....i don t even think google-chrome was out yet...i m rambling....my confidence and perceived knowledge plummeted as soon as i moved forward

4477915
put	get
i have the main view controller and the data is received back and put into a dictionary then that is looped through to get a couple of arrays of data

4477917
onstart	ondestroy
i guess i need to save some info with ondestroy and restoring it again with onstart but i do not know how to accomplish this

4477918
hex	binary
update hex - binary conversion

4477988
put	get
also this version of state doesn t have get and put actions and we don t export the constructor

4477993
hash	salt
i ve got a salt hash password for sha256 ssha256 sha256 password + salt + salt

4477993
hash	salt
when a user logs in need to separate the salt from the hash to hash the supplied password with the salt and compare the result to the one retrieved from the db

4477993
hash	salt
i don t seem to have the right unpack template separate the hash 8-bit binary fixed length in this case 32 byte from the salt 8-bit binary variable length

4478004
getter	setter
it can be edited unless marked as readonly or given a getter but no setter

4478021
width	margin
i wanted to set the size of the button and it shoud be centered in the souther position of the jframe but it shouldn t have the full width of the jframe and it shouln t be completly on the bottom of the jframe it should have a margin

4478021
width	height
it would be also possible to set a absolute pixel position of the button because the jframe has a fixed width height

4478021
width	height
at the moment the button has the full jframe width height

4478079
folder	directory
your href mystyle.css should have a correct reference by using .. dot-dot just like .. foldername in case your css file is one or more directory away from you main folder

4478094
width	height
then load the height and the widths and segment the image into a grid accordingly by height rows and width cols

4478101
width	height
for an image of mxn width x height you will have m cells in horizontal profile and n cells in vertical profile

4478103
pylons	pyramid
it s worth noting that pyramid is a base framework and pylons is being built on top of it

4478143
printf	strcpy
yet as usual c is giving me segmentation faults ive tried printf strcpy and still segmentation fault the code is

4478192

4478260
folder	directory
with this command the file hello.h in the same directory of the .pro file is copied to the debug folder

4478661
getter	setter
i m not a php developer so i m wondering if in php is more popular to use explicit getter setter in a pure oop style with private fields the way i like

4478672
post	put
put is the same as post except for this semantic difference with post the uri identifies a resource that will handle the entity such as a servlet

4478686
inherited	properties
the visible properties is present even on a hiddenfield object because of inherited

4478686
inherited	properties
the documentation indicates that the hiddenfield class inherited from the base control class which defines the visible properties

4478704
ienumerable	icollection
however i would like to return the .keys collection from a dictionary as an ienumerable or perhaps as an icollection from a method and enumerate through them in the order they were originally added to the dictionary

4478747
put	get
emacs is also nice for running adb logcat you get a searchable history and the messages are updated as they come and you can easily put interesting patterns in color m-x highlight-regexp and friends

4478813
put	get
while experimenting and trying to get things working it seems like i have to put an application url .

4478834

so you can use any hex editor to view and edit binary values

4478983
public	protected
has the same access control public private protected for all non-static members

4478997
gif	png
your other option would be to just have a transparent png and gif for ie6 on top and then the image underneath that and absolute positioned similarly to the other answer you referenced

4478999
translation	localization
the localization string from default file would be used whenever that key isn t found in the specified map new string that has just been added and no one translation it in spanish yet would be shown in language from default locale.properties

4479007
updatepanel	scriptmanager
a simple scriptmanager with updatepanel works but nothing with toolkit

4479037
vim	emacs
so even though you might be able to view individual commands in vim or emacs you won t be able to do this eclipse

4479070

4479090
width	height
console always tells me that the width and height of the image is 0

4479114
haskell	ocaml
i assume you re using linux or f# would be a much better choice than either ocaml or haskell

4479131
hash	md5
if you don t need the original file names as a handy way just calculate md5 or sha1 hash of the file content and rename the file to it

4479166
post	get
i ve been trying to get my django application to post all new news stories to the application s facebook page

4479166
post	get
it works posting to feed but if i try to post to links with the access token given like this i get the following error

4479169
width	height
remember that width and height return the actual content width and height regardless of css properties so those values should only be captured once the content images or whatever have been fully loaded

4479172
minimum	max
hint for x 2 the minimum is clamp 0 xmin xmax 2 and the maximum is max xmin 2 xmax 2

4479172
intersect	contains
if the resulting interval contains 0 the box intersect the surface of the cone

4479174
post	get
relevant code from my default.vcl file for varnish specifies that get and post requests for this webapp are passed directly to the backend

4479202
getter	setter
some of es5 s features that v8 implements are for example array methods like map and foreach the new object functions like create or keys string methods like trim as well as the ability to define getter and setter

4479257
jar	war
the problem is that war files are extended jar files which are essentially zip arhives and therefore compressed

4479260
width	height
i have tried with declaring height and width in a css file by the body tag

4479272
client-side	server-side
turns out sp doesn t do a server-side check for conflicting column names on fldedit.aspx so removing the client-side check allowed me to rename it

4479324
put	get
you just install both they get put in different directories

4479361
codeigniter	cakephp
i would suggest learning cakephp or try out codeigniter instead

for a small sample program that incuded structures arrays function pointers structure pointers chars and int the sb7 kit produced code that was about 2 3 the size of mcc18 and htc

4479470
ssl	https
in longer if you connect over ssl ie use https it will become much harder for casual observers to see what s going onâ but it would still be possible for someone to for example use an https proxy and sniff the connection that way

4479501
atof	strtod
the standard library function strtod handles the exponential component just fine so does atof but strtod allows you to differentiate between a failed parse and parsing the value zero

4479508
xslt	xquery
note hofs will become a standard feature of xpath xslt xquery with the forthcoming version 3.0

4479521
post	get
the problem is here and get send_reset in my opinion you are trying to post parameters when your conntroller expect get method

4479538
post	get
if you can t get it to work post a simple example of what you have and what you are trying to do and someone might be able to see what part is tripping you up

4479583
post	get
use jquery s get or post function

4479639
getter	setter
getter are usually called to retrieve data in the view for instance a jsp file while setter are used to insert the data from the view

4479639
getter	setter
in case you use nested objects it will call the getter on the object and then a setter on the property

4479681
put	get
if we put a wrong port we do get a timeout error as well

4479703
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops

4479714
min	max
i just returned first t i which is true instead of returning t n 2 in max to min order

4479739
pull	push
or if it is better to pull the remote changes first merge them locally and push the

4479739
pull	push
note that if you do a hg pull first your local changes aren t touched so you can inspect the remote changes side-by-side with your local ones and you can still decide not to merge and do a hg push -f anyway

4479771
sorting	grouping
to get a list of contributors to a book you ll have to select all role-contributor pairs related to it maybe sorting by role first for easier grouping and then grouping contributors by role and show on your page

instrumentation based profiling

4479810
postgresql	mysql
i am using postgresql driver here but i don t think it will be any different for mysql which i just don t have installed

4479811
hide	show
set so that is displayed all the time and then hide and show it manually

4479820
put	get
i just realized that the library i was calling to get the data i wanted to put into the array just outputs straight to the browser so i ended up using ob_start and ob_get_clean to get the data into a string

4479890
matplotlib	scipy
i ve installed numpy scipy matplotlib on snow leopard with python 2.6

4479916
width	height
you need to set width and height attributes on both the object and embed tags

4479989
width	height
google results and the jquery documentation indicate that jquery s height and width methods make no effort to maintain an element s proportionality

4479991
setinterval	clearinterval
setinterval returns an id that you can pass to clearinterval to stop the repeated calls

4479999
setinterval	clearinterval
you have to use clearinterval on the id you get when you call setinterval

4480004
avro	thrift
avro is an apache project that is designed for cross-language rpc see thrift for its spiritual predecessor

4480007
width	height
if you set only the width or only the height of an image it will automatically maintain it s proportions

4480013
width	height
if you set only the height of an image the width is adjusted in proportion and vice versa

4480059
post	put
json_data is a literal with an array inside that you put as parameter to the post and will be sent as encoded array in the post request to the server

4480059
post	get
what i said applies to get request and i believe also to post requests

4480071

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works 100 in google-chrome firefox and safari

4480116
memcpy	memmove
yes memmove is really memcpy with the ability to handle overlapping blocks

4480128
memcpy	memmove
however there is a difference between memmove and memcpy because memmove can treat correctly the case when the buffers overlap so it is recomended in these cases

4480128
memcpy	memmove
however because of additional checks that memmove performs when the buffers are small and surely does not overlap memcpy is better

4480146
memcpy	memmove
the difference between memcpy and memmove is that memmove is always safe to use regardless of aliasing between source and destination

4480146
memcpy	memmove
if you know buffers cannot overlap memcpy is fine and may in any given library use optimizations that allow it to be faster than memmove

4480146
memcpy	memmove
in another library memcpy may actually just be memmove

4480155
postgresql	mysql
i recently switched from mysql to postgresql and i noticed one additional query after following many regular queries

4480404
rss	feed
try the sample viewport rss feed app from sencha.com and you will notice that the left collapse fails in internet explorer

4480412
rss	feed
i have the skills to create an rss feed use my own payment processing system although i don t think android likes free apps to have a separate way of collecting money from the publisher

4480453
post	get
in my site the post content is always the name of a school so if i search for chicago i get a lot of post with different schools as content

4480453
post	get
what i want to do is to get the schools with the most post so i could display this somewhere

4480453
post	get
so what i need to get the most repeated post contents from a particular search including the ones that don t appear in first results page

4480490
hide	show
so here are two steps 1 hide 2 show

4480530
hide	show
you can use a view s method setvisibility you can hide or show views using setvisibility int visibility

4480590
button	checkbox
i ve added a checkbox to a table view cell which is a custom button with two images

4480590
button	checkbox
the problem is when you click the rest of the row it still selects the checkbox button

4480614
post	get
it appears in your post that you are providing the session as a parameter...which would make me assume that you would need to provide the session as a parameter in your get as well

4480646
kde	gnome
firefox gimp inkscape open office and many many other gnome and kde apps for example

4480716
requestfactory	gwt

4480839
cos	sin
x cos theta x - sin theta y

4480839
cos	sin
y sin theta x + cos theta y

4480839
cos	sin	cos	inverse
in your case let s say that theta is the angle of the ground you want to do the inverse rotation so with angle -theta to make the ground horizontal this is why the sign is different from the formula above cos -theta cos theta and sin -theta -sin theta

4480917
post	get
in general i d suggest using post instead of get assuming you re getting your variables from a form element

4480937
free	malloc
if you want to allocate an array of something you need malloc and free which deal with pointers to memory spaces

4480938
firefox	safari
not tested but this should work in firefox this works with a different syntax - i m not sure if safari webkit knows rgba

4480989
many-to-many	one-to-many

j ava desktop gui swing awt

4481061
lisp	scheme
you should know that common lisp does not require tail recursion from its implementors unlike scheme

4481088
textarea	textbox
i ve been using keyup to detect when content in a textarea changes but somehow facebook can detect a ctrl+x event in a textbox immediately when the x is pressed down

4481098
keydown	keyup
i would guess they make a bind to the keydown and set some sort of state variable when the control key is pressed then when they receive a keyup event they check the state variable and act accordingly

4481127
put	get
if you just want it to happen right away when the form loads then put your code in the onload event of the form instead double click on the form title bar to get to the onload event

4481179
ssl	https
transport seems to require https to encrypt credentials and throws an exception if there is no ssl

4481193

4481205
profiler	shark
if you find no solution then you may try out some other profiler like shark

4481243
ienumerable	iqueryable
since you don t need to add to the input list all you actually need to do is enumerate - so use ienumerable - then your method will also accept other types which implement ienumerable including iqueryable linked lists etc.

4481248
ienumerable	ilist
an ilist can be thought of as a particular implementation of ienumerable

4481257
lisp	scheme
the various lisp or scheme literature should describe that

4481292
multiplying	division
on many machines the only differences between signed and unsigned numbers are the way in which magnitude comparisons are performed and the way in which shorter values are converted to longer ones note that many processors multiplying operations effectively convert shorter types to longer ones and division inherently performs magnitude comparisons

4481308
move	drag
if the user move the mouse slow enough the expected behaviour the faces get colored by the mouse like a brush but if the user drag faster and this isn t really fast the entire mesh will be colored

4481313

etsy	ebay
ebay uses tables and etsy uses divs

4481764
lxml	beautifulsoup
beautifulsoup is pretty slow if you want better performance use lxml instead or if you have many cpu s perhaps you can try using multiprocessing with queues

4481787
accessor	properties
from my understanding of core data all that is necessary for primitive accessor to work is the dynamic directive for the properties name as well as declaring primitive accessor for that properties within the entity implementation

4481787
accessor	properties
for some reason when using the generated primitive accessor the setstate method is not modifying the state properties

4481800
tiff	bmp
i am looking for a way to encoding a bmp image as a tiff or some other standard compressed but lossless format in a browser javascript

4481800

memcpy	memmove
one thing you might want to consider is to still use memmove instead of memcpy by default unless you re working on an application where copy performance is critical

4482176
memcpy	memmove
in the kernel the optimized x86 memcpy we use is actually a memmove because while performance is really important so is repeatability and avoiding surprises strictly speaking we have two the rep movs version for the case where that is supposed to be fast and the open-coded copy version

4482223
ironruby	ironpython
as were ironpython and ironruby

4482248
redmine	bugzilla
for bugzilla i think you would be best off using the xml-rpc interface to do your issue comparison update sync so you d have to take a very different approach from redmine

4482306
webclient	httpwebrequest
here s an article on webclient versus httpwebrequest

4482350
super	implements
in your app you are trying to implements some kind of a super class

4482350
nsurlconnection	nsoperation
if you want to get really fancy use an nsoperation to encapsulate the download then you would use the a synchronous variant of nsurlconnection because the operation itself is already executed asynchronously the nice thing would be then if your parsing of the json string takes longer also this is performed in the background and your ui will stay responsive

4482354
rss	feed
i know you can get an rss feed of these but it only appears to return a subset of all of the ratings

4482356

as we know we can t to show hide the flash component which will cause the flash player to redraw it

4482364
mockito	easymock
this means they either implement an interface at runtime that s what easymock does if i m not mistaken or they inherit from the class to mock that s what mockito does if i m not mistaken

4482370
listadapter	simplecursoradapter
and then i use simplecursoradapter to populate cursor into listadapter and put listadapter into listview

4482401
typedef	struct
to my taste the easiest and clearest way is to do forward declarations of the struct and typedef to the struct and the pointer

4482401
typedef	struct
using the same name as typedef and struct tag in the forward declaration make things clearer and eases the api compability with c++

4482448
range	minimum
this is guaranteed by the minimum value range

4482466
uploadify	swfupload
so swfupload easy to understand and api looks like as uploadify api

4482472
width	height
i created two divs first a red background div and then a blue background div both having a width height 100px

4482477
folder	dir	folder	directory
the first line performs a dir directory listing of the source folder listing files in bare format b ignoring directory names a-d

4482513
bash	subshell
the notation instructs bash to launch these commands in the current shell rather than use a subshell as would be the case if the ... notation was used

4482526
switching	screens
after the user logged in the screens is supposed to switching to a split view

4482578
datamapper	activerecord
sidenote if you re new to rails it might be a good idea to learn how to use it with activerecord before trying on datamapper

4482597
ubuntu	debian
there are plenty of pages explaining how to do it but if you re on ubuntu or debian it can be a bit of a mystery

4482621
width	height
if you need that element would not take place you can just change height and width of parent div to zero

4482658
width	height
12-19 12 06 41.045 info hub 1762 height 340 width 380

4482658
gif	png
it looks like this code is working properly for png jpg images but the problem has to do with the fact that my images are gif images initially downloaded from the web

4482662
submit	submission
if you are doing something that yields to the browser from within the blur handler you ll have to prevent the form submission with a submit handler and then have it get submitted when everything including the various actions in the blur handler is ready

4482662
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested this on google-chrome firefox and opera on linux ie6 on windows 2000 and ie7 on windows xp

4482663
httpwebrequest	ftpwebrequest	webclient	webrequest	webclient	ftpwebrequest	webclient	httpwebrequest
basically webclient is just a wrapper for webrequest ftpwebrequest httpwebrequest ... to make it easier to use

4482669
min	max
your cashback column is varchar which is a text type therefore min max etc all operate on alphabetical sorting which is normal therefore b aaaa and of course 5 100

4482716
min	max
string 5 is greater than string 40 in other words if you arrange 5 and 40 as in a dictionary 5 comes after 40 hence ther result max - 5 and min 40

4482716
min	max
if you arrange 46 and 44 as in a dictionary 46 comes later than 44 hence max 46 and min 44

4482740
g++	gcc
i use gcc running as g++ and gnu make

4482785

but of course it takes a few seconds to output normally an int would be 4 bytes double 8 bytes etc

4482879
pylons	pyramid
now the problem is there s pyramid and it would seem pylons would be replaced by it soon

4482879
pylons	pyramid
also given that pylons itself was a very successful platform judging from its high-profile deployments do you recommend pyramid as a good replacement

4482896
google-chrome	firefox
this is supported in some browsers now firefox and google-chrome for instance and support is set to improve

4482904
portrait	landscape
the opposite to landscape is called portrait

4482904
portrait	landscape
if you want your application to work well when the user rotates the phone you need to design your user interface so that it display well in both landscape and portrait modes

4482908
portrait	landscape
landscape and portrait - are device orientation

4482908
portrait	landscape
in landscape mode we have 480x320 resolution and portrait resolution is vice versa - 320x480

4482916
getter	setter
you can use a property to wrap a getter setter pair for the seats

4482925
getter	setter
note the complete lack of getter and setter you don t need them

4482969
integer	unsigned
in order to avoid overflow time_t will probably be changed to an unsigned 32bit integer or a 64bit one

4483026
folder	directory
create a new workspace that points to your local project directory and the location of the source control folder on tfs

4483030
width	height
offset takes a starting cell and a number of rows columns and optional height and width to generate a reference to a cell range on the fly

4483044
hide	show
to show #red-products and hide #red-information

4483044
hide	show
to hide #red-products and show #red-information

4483048
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener	implements	extends
public class homepage extends activity implements onclicklistener onitemclicklistener

4483055
hide	show
this will hide both initially then show the hasd #red-hashhere or default to showing #red-information as you have now

4483070
codeigniter	cakephp
if you are using php you can opt to learn mvc frameworks such as codeigniter or cakephp which make this process a whole lot easier and more friendly for you as a developer

4483090
put	get
if you simply want to get a screenshot though just press the home and top button together which will put a screenshot in the photo album each time you do it

4483114
onclick	onmousedown
try using the mousedown event instead change onclick to onmousedown

4483160
hash	md5
since the introduction of rainbow tables and using only hash passwords e.x md5 to stored passwords in database is not the best secured way

4483160
hash	salt
when people talk about salt hash the always use it in this way hash password

4483160
hash	salt
salt or even hash hash password

4483174
ninject	spring.net
note i do not know much about ninject but i worked with spring.net that is much more complicated

4483176
hash	salt
see secure hash and salt for php passwords

4483177
hash	salt
edit just to be clear given that the salt is provided in plain-text as well you would still only have 100 000 000 possibilities to try to attack any one hash

4483177
hash	salt
without a salt an attacker could create a dictionary of 100 000 000 possibilities and then know all the passwords in a database given only their hash

4483177
hash	salt
without a salt you could compute the hash of every possible password before you get access to the hash themselves

4483185
hash	md5
you should hash the conten on the serverside using md5

4483205
hash	salt
hashing multiple times does not protect you without a salt because rainbow tables work by chaining hash together in exactly the way you describe hash hash password

4483205
hash	salt
as an added benefit two users with the same password will hash to different values if a salt is used

4483205
hash	salt
your idea of iterating the hash is still good but you need the salt too

4483205
hash	salt
the salt hashing algorithm and iteration count do not need to be secret and can be stored in your database alongside the computed hash

4483205
hash	salt
you can choose a fixed iteration count and hash algorithm but the salt must be randomly generated for each user

4483217
int	chars
conversion from string is actually o 1 as well because during parsing of it it s enough to consider only a bounded number of chars 10+1 in case of 32-bit int

4483231
hash	salt
both iterating the hash and using a salt increase the security of password hashing

4483236
apache	lighttpd
in a production environment we just use lighttpd or apache to translate from http to https

4483257
median	max	min	median	min	max
median max ar1 0 ar2 0 + min ar1 1 ar2 1 2

4483257
median	max	min	median	min	max
now size is 2 so median max ar1 0 ar2 0 + min ar1 1 ar2 1 2

4483257
min	max
max 15 13 + min 26 17 2

4483288
put	get
i want to get when i put the mouse key hover on the google

4483306
margin	height
because padding and or margin depending on the browser are non-zero for html and or body by default and padding and margin wrap around the content height

4483307
hash	salt
the user enters their password which is then hash with the salt and sent back

4483320

4483323
implements	extends
what about extends each one and making them implements the same interface that has the same method signatures to get the data you want

4483344

4483433
post	get
i ve referenced this post which was helpful but i m still lost as to why i can t get this to work

4483457
submit	submission
this can be done by adding a parameter to the url the form is submission to or changing the name of the submit button

4483458

it does not generate a uniform distribution over all permutation sequence but it can gives good permutation that is not easily distinguishable

4483633
sequence	permutation
second though it does not generate all permutation sequence it does generate part of them

4483633
sequence	permutation
if column permutation is also include it is exactly equal to so it is almost impossible to get the same sequence

tablet	galaxy
for tablet you re also going to want to specifically test against the galaxy tab see samsung s site for more details on testing in the emulator

4484711

hash	salt
so far i ve decided that i m going to be using a sha512 hash with an rng to generate a salt for each password obviously best practice against rainbow tables etc

4485232
hash	salt
it may seem like security through obscurity but i was thinking of storing the salt and the password hash together in one field concatenated together

4485276
post	get
in your button_to call and change the get to post in the routes file

4485321

octal	binary
it s interpreting them as octal base 8 numbers not binary

4485569
octal	decimal
so 10 in octal equals 8 in decimal and 100 in octal equals 64 in decimal and so on

4485574
octal	binary
in python 2.6 and newer you should use the syntax 0o10 for octal and 0b10010 for binary numbers

4485585
datalist	repeater

min	max
so since clojure has a min and a max function so you can replace your if s with

4486753
min	max
if those functions did not exist in clojure s standard library i would have recommended defining them because putting the logic for min and max into their own function leads to much nicer code than having it all in the foo function

4486842
linqdatasource	objectdatasource
alternatively consider using either a linqdatasource and wiring up the onselecting event or using an objectdatasource

4486842
linqdatasource	objectdatasource

4486994
config	ini
i am writing in perl by the way and i am using config inifiles for reading and writing to the ini file

4487496
flex	osmf
the newer version of the osmf classes that flex s videodisplay are based on handles this already

4487496
flex	osmf
the issue is that since the flex 4.1 sdk contains the majority of the osmf classes with their original package names a statement such as import org.osmf.media.mediaplayer

4487496
flex	osmf
flex uses an older less capable version of the osmf platform for its videoplayer

4487496
flex	osmf
the videoplayer i will implement is in a second project that does not duplicate the package names of either the flex sdk or osmf

4487496
flex	osmf
the conflict is between the flex sdk and osmf not between the classes i would build and either osfm or the sdk

4487496
flex	osmf
my project needs to access classes in the osmf project not those from the flex sdk that have the name package class names

4487496
flex	osmf
because the flex sdk is based on osmf flex has left the package and namespace identifies intact thus the naming ambiguity

or do i have to move the gem folder into the .bundle directory

4488058
public	protected
if so child will have access to all public and protected members of parent

4488064
jobs	cron
local development server does not have the cron jobs link neither does it execute cron jobs

then after creating this tabpanel i would like to dynamically change the content of the tabs but none of these work

4488574

haven t tried it myself but as long as you ve added the view as a child and called invalidate after you ve set the layoutparams i think you should be able to determine the width and height

4488595
multiplying	add
if you add a der3 class and that class defines either of the virtual functions the compiler will not be able to cleanly merge the three vtables and will complain with some error relating to the ambiguity of the multiplying defined method none of the overriders can be considered to be the final overrider

4488719
user-controls	elementhost
i am using elementhost to host the wpf user-controls within a windows form

4488735
octal	decimal
well the reason was we did some calculation in bash for statistics based on the output of the date command and this failed only from 8 00 till 9 59 in the morning because we d read the hour value as 08 which is an illegal octal value whereas 01 - 07 are valid octal values and from 10 onwards everything is treated as decimal again .

awt	swing	swt	swing
so the jvm port of scala uses awt swing or swt and the cli port of scala uses winforms or wpf

4490472
put	get	post	get	post	put
for example in the restful context sometimes you perform actions related to some objects that just don t fall clearly under the delete put post get verbs

4490484
google-chrome	firefox
tested it now for ie firefox and google-chrome

4490497
int	chars
if you are sure that int range between -9 and 9 and want to store them in a chars individually there is a trick though more number calculation included

4490511
qstring	qbytearray
if you re doing cross-platform coding you could use qt4 s qstring qbytearray

4490559
viewmodel	caliburn.micro
you can then implement the message box anyway you wish either using the windows system message box or nicer still use your own view viewmodel to display the message perhaps using the caliburn.micro windowmanager.showdialog

4490610
width	height
note it do not stretch on ie due to the code uses the css3 property background-size and you need to set your own width and height of the image in the code

4490612
centos	linux
using postgresql 8.4.5 under centos 5.5 linux 64 bit

4490638
folder	directory
inside this folder i have xml files which are set to build action content copy to output directory copy if newer i have tried setting to embedded resource as well as this i have a few text files and so on

4490638
folder	directory
in my bin debug output directory i have the exe the folder with the xml the stand alone .txt files and so on

4490678
multiplying	add
you ll need to create a vector between the two sprites normalize it multiplying that normalized vector by how much you want the sprite to move per frame then add that vector into the sprite you are moving s location

4490706
children	parent
it works because rii child_first iterates over the children before the parent element

4490711
webkit	gecko
i m trying to check if an html element is scrollable.only gecko support is needed and webkit support would be nice but not necessary

4490716
jboss	glassfish
implemented by many vendors bea oracle websphere jboss glassfish etc

4490720
jboss	weblogic	jboss	glassfish	glassfish	weblogic
on top of java ee specifications there are javaee implementations application servers like jboss glassfish websphere weblogic

4490734
accessor	properties
valueforkey is a method on nsobject for accessing any value associated with any object through the name of a accessor method properties and or instance variable

4490746
x86	64bit
if the machine runs a 64bit operating system then you ll get close to 4 gigabytes if the code runs in x86 mode

4490762
width	height
my chart width is 968 and height 432

4490765
folder	directory
if you actually moved the exe file to the desktop you also need to move any resources that it needs so if it wants a folder named datasources you would have to move that folder as well or set the current directory when you start the application

4490806
for-loop	loops
from my basic understanding its seems i ought to be able to do everything a foreach loops does within a for-loop

4490837
subtract	add
so if you take the top right left and bottom-most value add subtract a little or to make it fit a power of ten

4490841
inherited	properties
instead you can make the class a non-static singleton and allow implementations to inherited the class add properties to it and set the inherited version as the singleton instance

4490911
swt	swing
you re already mentioned swing s jfilechooser but you may want to consider swt for your widgets instead

4490915
int	boolean	tinyint	boolean
i concurr that i found check constraints to be missing and boolean to constrain to an int in the range of a tinyint instead of to true and false

4490919
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works as expected on firefox google-chrome safari opera ie8 - but in ie6 and 7 the map tiles are transparent

4490959
google-chrome	safari
can t seem to figure out why this works in safari but not in google-chrome

4490959
google-chrome	safari
throw it in jsfiddle in either browser works as intended in latest release of safari but no such luck in google-chrome

4491009
centos	linux
using postgresql 8.4.5 and php 5.1.6 under centos 5.5 linux

4491014
haskell	scheme
there s even a tutorial called write yourself a scheme in 48 hours for haskell

4491020
button	checkbox
using the same code as jobi joy from the question i linked you can change the button in datatemplate_level2 to a checkbox and bind ischecked for it to value instead since it will point to the ref class otherwise

4491134
int	double	int	chars
all you need is two int one chars and one double if it s not a must to use arrays so this is the code for you

4491167
scrollable	panels
which does not actually work to scroll the listbox it will only affect the position of the control when it is embedded in a scrollable container like panels

4491172
width	height
as is a div element is a block so should expand to the full width of the container although won t have any height

4491193
keyup	mouseup
edited changed mouseup to keyup

4491217
awt	swing	swt	swing
so youre only change is to use a dialog not based on awt swing or swt

4491403
screens	mdpi
medium screens mdpi

4491403
screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi	mdpi	hdpi
medium screens hdpi + large screens mdpi

4491424
min	max
i am using the following code to calculate the min max date and will then select all records in the table that are clear to update them

4491458
super	self
so when you call super handle self .__init__ handlename you are changing the properties of self instead of returning a new object

4491469
jar	war
note system dependencies are not copied into resulted jar war

4491470
int	double
i have seperate functions for reading from a text file depending on whether its an int float or double

4491490
allocator	stl
i am making extensive use of stl vectors to manage memory de- allocator of large arrays of data

4491512
opera	firefox
most browsers not firefox or opera - newlines will disappear support newlines in the title attribute

4491526
std	ostream
std ostream has numerous overloads including both of the following

4491554
carrierwave	paperclip
i tested paperclip vs carrierwave vs attachment_fu with rails3.0.3 for a project i am working on

4491571
inherited	properties
well you can do it simpler because the datacontext properties is among the few that are inherited which means that when set on an element somewhere in the tree all child elements get it implicitly if they do not override it

4491591
screens	hdpi
the best way is to have all device configurations listed here including the samsung galaxy tab simulater large screens hdpi available here in your development environment and test your app on them

4491611
google-chrome	safari
i use sys.browser.name for borwser detection but google-chrome detected as safari

4491644
ant	maven
i m not sure of the reasoning but without this option maven wasn t running pre-test code that ant was

4491669
hide	show
i basically hide the button and show a loading gif but that apparently is not enough.

4491708
jobs	cron
when i remove any print statements cron runs the jobs normally and does not terminate

4491727
for-loop	loops
a foreach loops works with ienumerator when a for-loop works with an index in i is the index

4491727
ienumerable	ienumerator
so actually the big strength of the foreach loop and the underlying use of ienumerator is that it applies to any type which implements ienumerable implementing ienumerable just means that you provide a method that returns an enumerator

4491727
for-loop	loops
so the for-loop can generally be considered as a specialized foreach loops

4491727
for-loop	loops
edit there is an other case where the for-loop is useful when you need indexing to go through a list in a special way or if you need to modify the list when in loops

4491727
for-loop	loops
you need the for-loop here because mylist cannot be modified from within a foreach loops and we need to go through it backwards because if you remove the element at the position i the position of all elements with an index i will change

4491756
jobs	cron
for jobs started by cron

4491770
persistent	transient
if you only want to serialize part of your object just set specific fields as transient marking them as not to be persistent and implement serializable

4491805
mouseout	mouseleave
the mouseleave event differs from mouseout in the way it handles event bubbling

4491816
rss	feed
you can use pubdate for those rss feed where it is provided

4491832
fadein	fadeout	mouseover	mouseout
my problem is that when i am using fadeout on mouseover and fadein on mouseout on a li component i am not getting the results that i am expecting

4491872
system.in	system.out
the workaround that i use is to just use system.in system.out instead of console when using eclipse

4491878
google-chrome	safari
that is because you re checking for webkit which happens to exist in both safari and google-chrome

4491878
google-chrome	safari
en-us applewebkit 534.10 khtml like gecko google-chrome 8.0.552.224 safari 534.10

4491912
post	put
it might be possible to use javascript cookies to retrieve the raw cookie data and put it into a post header or ajax call for some purpose but i believe the javascript cookie mechanism has the same expiration restrictions as the browser

4491914
folder	directory
i have this piece of code that searches for a folder given a starting directory

4491923
folder	directory
just go to your django installation directory browser to django- contrib- admin- directory and copy paste the media folder to your django projects media directory

4491930
requestfactory	gwt
use requestfactory which comes along with gwt 2.1

4491932
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseleave
using mouseenter mouseleave will solve most of the problems caused by mouseout mouseover

4491932
mouseleave	mouseenter
hover wraps around mouseenter and mouseleave to provide even better handling

4491981
draggable	droppable
i ve got a draggable thing outside an iframe and a droppable target inside it

4491981
draggable	droppable
i use some jquery ui draggable droppable to do stuff

4491981
draggable	droppable
the draggable become draggable and the droppable is successfully a drop target

4491987
ant	maven
also maven is quite possibly using a different classpath to ant - referring to jars in it s own local repo

4491988
int	chars
so first of all i m declaring a struct with three arrays of chars and an int

4491988
int	chars
after that i declare a function which takes three pointers to chars and an int value

4492019
portrait	landscape
i have everything looking nice in portrait of course but then when i go to landscape mode by hitting that arrow in the top-right corner everything gets all messed up

4492019
portrait	landscape
now because of the way the view is laid out i need to align 3 buttons along the bottom of an image view in portrait and then in landscape those three buttons need to be symmetrically aligned along the right side

4492048
jruby	mri
the same queue can be shared by multiple ruby implementations jruby mri ...

4492066
imperative	declarative
it s a way of representing windows installer databases which are declarative in nature not imperative

4492069
linefeed	delimiter
and it s up to your query to properly escape any characters that could be confused with a delimiter or a linefeed

4492075
hash	salt
if the salt is based on the value to be hash then you lose the value of the salt

4492075
hash	salt
if a password hash salt is based only on the value of the password then two users using the same password is very visible in the database for example

4492112
width	height
in your code just set the tooltip s height and width property to double.nan to have the width and height adjust dynamically

4492128
mouseup	mousedown
on the mousedown or mouseup event i want to capture what color the pixel is immeidately under the mouse pointer

4492136
tabs	tabpanel
i haven t tried this myself but i imagine that you could create a tabpanel with empty tabs and size the tabpanel so that only the tab strip is visible

4492236
pull	push
you don t necessarily need a script to pull the changes - developers could just push them to a separate branch then invoke a script to test that branch

4492248
min	max
im having a few problems with the code i have written to check my database on refresh if all record dates on the database are between the specified min and max values

4492293
google-chrome	safari
also - anytime you are working on performance issues like this try running some sample code through jsperf - it will help you test two different methods .parent .find td vs .siblings .children for instance this test shows that the siblings .children method is 78 slower than .parent .find td .not when using google-chrome 38 slower in safari

4492329
daemon	cron
i think the cron daemon is stuck somehow

4492329
jobs	cron
when i try to add new cron jobs they don t register as going off and it won t send emails to my email address when a cron should go off

4492329
jobs	cron
i access cron jobs in my cpanel x

4492332
min	max
will update all records if one tupel is not between min and max

4492335
colorbox	thickbox
thickbox colorbox prettyphoto etc

4492362
width	height
if you create a layer that is the full width height of your page and give it a higher z index than your whole page you can create this effect

4492372
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox ie8 google-chrome opera.

4492411
folder	directory
if you just added the clubinformationtracking folder yourself and did not configure it to be an iis application or virtual directory via the web hosting provider s control panel then that is the problem as asp.net is looking for any dlls in bin or perhaps public bin depending on how things are setup

4492411
folder	directory
from the web hosting provider s control panel make the clubinformationtracking folder a virtual directory or iis application

4492435
width	height
the arrows will stretch or compress the width and height and the bars |-| preserve distances from the top and bottom

4492438
sorting	filtering
for ex functionalities of listviewwebpart like sorting filtering export to excel are unavailable limited in functionality because of xsl limitations

4492458
onresume	onpause
use onpause and onresume instead

4492520
folder	directory
when i build my project in intellij and then start jboss the ear file does not appear in the deploy directory so i assume that there is some magic that intellij does so that jboss reads from a different folder

4492529
versioning	upgrade
in the case of going to a more major release you need to consider the api changes that could cause the upgrade to a new versioning of a library to take longer

4492542
pkcs#12	pfx
with other module types the user would need to load the certificate from pfx pkcs#12 file

4492563
portrait	landscape
we need to support both portrait and landscape orientation and retina-resolution iphone screens

4492679
post	put
you couldn t put it in the template itself as that would then need to be sent back to the server via a post for the next request

4492686
google-chrome	firefox
i m having trouble getting ie7 to float my elements correctly firefox and google-chrome work as expected

4492686
google-chrome	firefox
i get similar behavior on firefox and google-chrome if i remove the outer span the one with class right

4492712
sorting	filtering
if you use server-side processing all sorting filtering and paging needs to be handled by you on the server

4492712
sorting	filtering
if you configure datatables correctly it will request data from the server any time there is a paging filtering or sorting event

4492718
google-chrome	firefox
switching between browsers during debugging and noticed the scroll wheel does not work in firefox or google-chrome but is fine in internet explorer

4492721
hash	salt
if you have a model like uploadedfile activerecord base for each file you can just use the id of the model or if you want a string you can hash it with some string added as salt

4492722
portrait	landscape
set the dimensions to the correct size portrait 320x460 or 640x920 and landscape 480x300 or 960x600 and move the crop screen to the bottom of the image

4492734
move	drag
so if i have a textbox of say 150 wide 35 high postitioned on my form and the bottom left drag handle changes the width to 200 wide the right hand of the text box remains unchanged but the left hand edge move to the left

4492786
mvp	presenter
the algorithm runs in a presenter mvp pattern using a backgroundworker - enabling the view not to freeze

4492811
for-loop	arrays
the search method includes a for-loop that checks whether what is being searched is in an arrays

4492811
for-loop	arrays
now when i cancel the nsoperation by calling cancelalloperations the for-loop continues to run through the arrays

4492865
g++	gcc
gcc g++ resolves symbols from left to right during linking so despite your code having the function defined a copy of an object containing the __stack_chk_fail symbol needs to be on the linker line to the right of libgurobi_c++.a

4492866
sharepoint	splist
you can use sharepoint object model to achieve the same splist class will provide you all informations you need refer the attached link

4492877
pull	push
my current development flow now goes like edit code git commit -m comment git push fab deploy master production - this pull master from origin onto the server

4492905
min	max
this approach also works with other aggregate functions like min max avg sum.

4492941
xstream	xom
but if convenience is more important than efficiency yes you probably should consider a tree model not dom necessarily xom is better for example or data binding jaxb or xstream

4492941
children	parent
there are no accessors for children or parent because there is no guaranteed way to get to them as that is not necessarily possible considering current stream position

4492953
firefox	safari
updating the .net framework fixed the firefox and camino issues but not the safari problem

4492970
children	parent
i would like to create a cascading tree list of n number of children for a given parent where a child can also become a parent

4493023
put	get
so i tried this code below to go through and get all the elements that are suppose to be in the drop down box and put them back

4493025
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
the main catch is you have to do it in viewdidappear or similar because the movieplayer view sets itself up somewhere inside didmovetowindow or didmovetosuperview which happen after viewwillappear

4493065
put	get
for example print repr request.get is a helpful thing to put in a view function so that you can see the get dictionary

4493087
width	height
e.g rectangle i.e rectangle 100 150 50 50 as x y width height

4493101
viewdidload	viewwillappear
the simplest way to accomplish this is to put your loading code into viewwillappear instead of viewdidload

4493101
viewdidload	viewwillappear
while viewdidload may only get called once when your view is initialized viewwillappear is called any time your view controller is about to be presented whether it be in the tab bar in a navigation controller etc. which gives you a nice hook to implement loading and layout functionality

4493106
vxworks	qnx
make sure that os has a simulator that runs on pc win or linux typical embedded os with simulator include vxworks î¼c os-ii qnx uclinux .

4493129
post	get
another solution would be to use something like fiddler to analyze what exactly is being sent to the web site and then code that using the standard java http post get functionality sending a post request using a url

4493136
background-image	background-position
in your css set your background-image to the image in question background-position right and add the width of the image to the right padding

4493149
folder	directory
i have two folder where i store my templates and i would like to use extends -function across these two directory without having to do stuff like .. templates template.tpl or using absolute paths

4493277
opera	firefox
if you visit the same page with firefox and then save that page and reopen it in opera it works fine.

4493295
google-chrome	safari
but in google-chrome or safari you will see 1 3 5 7 .

4493299
post	get
the form data is apparently being sent to the moderate function within the topics controller using post and get methods simultaneously

4493317
cos	sin
sin and cos take a parameter in radians

4493358
inherited	properties
just the properties are being generated the inherited are not being generates

4493401
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
parand - it s not necessary because ie has a different box model than firefox or webkit which is the engine that powers google-chrome safari among others

4493406
happy	cup
i will be happy to hear more insights regarding what causes the extra time to elapse - 10msec sounds as eternity for a modern cpu - though i am not familiar with the specs of the ipod cpu it s ipod 4g and wikipedia says the cup is powervr sgx gpu 535 200 mhz

4493429
maven	pom.xml
maven won t let a child module be the parent pom.xml of the top level pom.xml

4493465
super	extends
pecs - producer extends consumer super - this mnemonic helps you remember that using extends means the generic type can produce the specific type but cannot accept it

4493475
datediff	difference
datediff now dob will give you the difference in days between two dates

4493499
zsh	tcsh
if you use other sh-style shells sh ksh zsh etc but not csh or tcsh don t use bash-only features and want the same setup no matter what shell you re in you should use .profile

4493499
bash	subshell
non-login interactive bash shells subshell source .bashrc instead

4493523
super	self
if you re using django 1.2 create another database connection in settings.py call it read_only and create a custom manager that returns querset using that connection like def get_query_set return super readonlymanager self .get_query_set .using read_only and mark the connection read-only

4493551
post	get
this method is called to uh initialize each request handler with the current request and response objects before the appropriate get or post or whatever methods are called

4493558
post	get
for example if you had a delete action method and get just asks for confirmation you might call the get method confirmdelete and the post method just delete

4493589
google-chrome	firefox
if i set cache-control to no-cache google-chrome and firefox correctly send a request to the server for the xap but use the cache if a 304 is returned

4493589
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
setting cache-control to must-revalidate again works correctly in google-chrome and firefox but safari always downloads the xap again while ie8 always uses the cache

4493592
hide	show
i also want to show tool tip when ever that corresponding input field get focused and hide when get blurred

4493621
g++	gcc
such as gcc or g++ must issue a diagnostic when these extensions are encountered

4493628
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox it is not

4493730
vsto	add-in
i am creating an outlook 2007 add-in using vsto

4493813
width	height
what about using a transparent div overlay div with an absolute position 100 width and height and positive z-index with cursor set to none

4493850
x86	64bit
the default install path for handbrakecli is in program files x86 handbrake x86 only in 64bit obviously however program files isn t in the search path as far as i can tell

4493898
vb.net	vb6
although vb.net supports try...catch type exception handling it still has something similar to vb6 s on error

4493944
folder	directory
name your class ie domain and below that you have options to set your base directory for the solution folder create new solution and provide a solution name with the create directory for solution

4493945
getter	setter
synthesizing a property will create setter and getter methods at runtime

4493999
atoi	atof
that means splitting the string at the + - calling atof on the left atoi or atof on the right and multiplying the first by the first to 10 raised to the second

4494019
magento	oscommerce
i need to migrate oscommerce database to magento database

4494058
google-chrome	firefox
i ve posted an example here that works for me in firefox google-chrome

4494066
disk	ram
if for example the sql server has not much ram and access only to a single disk forcing it to do multiple queries in parallel may lead to more seek activity on the harddisk which can dramatically slow down the overall read rate

4494091
querypath	phpquery
or a more reliable html parser with a readable api like phpquery or querypath

4494167
atof	strtod
there is indeed no way to make the stock number-parsing routines atof strtod process a number in the format you have

4494188
magento	oscommerce
import the csv from oscommerce into magento using the import tool

4494195
put	get
to check if components get registered properly you can put a breakpoint in the line after you call install and see what components were registered and if that s what you were expecting

4494220
inherited	properties
now everything compiles fine and the mixin stuff seems to work - until i try and save the component to a stream using tstream- writecomponent where the inherited properties eg tlabel.width height etc. don t get written

4494236
strtod	strtok
how about using strtok and strtod it should do it for you quite nicely

4494250
salt	md5
even with salt if you re using md5 or some other fast-hashing algorithm which aren t designed to solve this problem by the way

4494260
accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
i tried to do it by making properties accessor for hud but was not able to get around the line mbprogresshud alloc initwithwindow - and i don t want to keep on alloc ing an ivar

4494270
hash	salt
now if the kiddie has your database and of course the code - there is no point in keeping the code secret he she can only guess passwords calculate the salt hash and compare

4494276
hash	salt
salt hash sha1 username + salt + password

4494276
hash	salt
even though the attacker has the salt and hash pairs it s not possible to use rainbow tables because all the possible hash will need to be computed anyway using the salt that they ve been given so it s a brand new brute force attack for each user

4494276
hash	salt
salt hash bcrypt username + salt + password

4494294
width	height
if i only have a few bars in each graws the width is too big compared to the height

4494294
width	height
and unconvenient way is to specify the height and width output of the paper and manually i adjust it for the number of bars in the plots each time

4494295
cells	tablecell
i have table and inside the tablecell i have a pickerview and some textfields in other cells

4494296
hash	salt
this makes it that even if someone does get to your database they can t just re-generate the hash they have to calculate a hash table for each salt that you used

4494319
accessor	properties
i guess the moral would be never remove a binding that updates a properties from the set accessor of that properties

since the chars is 9 bytes long it needs 2x8 bytes to store it and the int even if taking only 4 bytes on 32bit machine will use 8 bytes

4495996
int	double	int	chars
it is likely that the payload is 21 bytes int 4 double 8 chars 9 but that your compiler adds padding between int and double to make the double 8-byte aligned

4495996
int	double
...it is likely that the need to add padding between int and double disappears and sizeof params_traitment_mmf may go down to 24

for example you could load it with file_get_contents use some regular expressions to find the img width and height and then use those values when echo ing the iframe

int	chars
now this seems a good idea but i wonder if the standard allows for the case where the alignment requirements for chars are more restrictive than that for int

there are also easy workarounds so that the client-side can pass it to the server-side cookie hidden fields ...

4498975
width	height
i d still suggest using height and width attributes in the img tag since that allows the browser to lay out the page even if the network or image-server is slow to respond with the actual image

4498975
google-chrome	firefox
i d definitely avoid using the browser to resize the image since it still requires the picture to be downloaded at its full size resolution and browser image manipulation is not particularly sensitive and varies from firefox to google-chrome to ie to opera... not to mention that people on mobile internet packages won t thank you for throwing potentially multi-megabyte images at them via their mobile tariff

4499010
jobs	cron
note that cron jobs can be easily configured at your cpanel if you have one

4499011

outputstream	inputstream
just read inputstream from the file source somewhere else on fixed disk or in a database etc and write to outputstream of the response along a correct set of response headers

4499042
actualheight	actualwidth
you could always attach a delgate to the propertymetatdata onvaluechanged and when actualheight actualwidth changes from 0 to something adjust your scrolling actualwidth actualheight will have a value once its rendered at least once

you are also not storing src in your image variable but its rel attribute here

4499666
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
since jquery mobile is built on the jquery core all pages should also work great on most recent versions of desktop browsers too - firefox google-chrome safari internet explorer opera etc

4499751

regarding data types you have to be careful when php not typed automatically converts a fraction to a double if necessary in java int 4 3 is 1 and 1.333.

4499795
folder	directory
the zoom level is the first level of folder in the directory structure

4499829

in some cases there are popup windows of which the width and height is bound to the application width and height

4499902
opera	firefox
in internet explorer not in firefox or opera

4499951
folder	directory
that means that even if you have groups or folder set up in xcode at runtime they are all lumped into one giant directory

4499989
google-chrome	firefox
i m not sure that the google-chrome firefox is strictly correct you have after all not told the browser that it should cache the content or even that the content is cacheable

4500069
folder	directory
in this folder there s a snapshot of yesterdays file structure and thus it has directory with the same name in the result

4500073
maven	pom.xml
the whole point of maven is that you describe all dependencies of your project in pom.xml rather than add them as jars in your ide

4500073
m2e	pom.xml
when you have dependencies configured in pom.xml you can easily generate eclipse project with the corresponding dependencies by running mvn eclipse eclipse or add them to the existing project with m2e plugin

4500103
folder	directory
create yourself a project directory with two folder code and test

4500112
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
how firefox opera and google-chrome don t

4500194
post	get
when php gets the data by get or post it doesn t know the id of the input that was associated with a given piece of data

4500194
client-side	server-side
since you have control of both server-side and client-side code you can determine what the id will be by choosing a naming convention as i suggested above

4500195
google-chrome	firefox
we use it to test in ie6 ie7 ie8 firefox google-chrome right now

4500199
serializable	deserialization
there s a huge amount of activity surrounding rdf.rb with over a score of database adapters serializable deserialization plugins and interfaces to other libraries

4500272

and give a fixed position with a height and width of 100

4500293
vb.net	vb6
there s a difference between vb6 and vb.net and visual studio 2010 includes vb.net

4500293
vb.net	vb6	versioning	upgrade
earlier versioning of vb.net included an upgrade wizard to help convert vb6 code to vb.net

4500293
vb.net	vb6	migrate	upgrade
you might want to use visual studio 2008 to help upgrade your vb6 to vb.net and then migrate to visual studio 2010 later

4500293
vb.net	vb6
upgrading vb6 to vb.net can be a large task

4500309
folder	directory
that should ensure that when doing an xcopy deploy the images will be in the right folder you will proabably need to change the logic for finding the image paths so the application finds them in the right directory

4500513
try-catch	exception-handling
i don t want to use try-catch block to catch the exception-handling i just want to be able to call the method successfully or a similar method like the one above

4500523
pem	pkcs#12	pkcs#12	pfx
you should note that pem format is not natively supported by windows or .net libraries so you need to convert it to pfx before deployment and then import a pfx or just create a store in memory based on pfx you will find plenty of information by looking for pfx or pkcs#12 on stackoverflow

4500525
free	malloc
and if you allocate with malloc release with free

4500525

4500677
hide	show
you can extend mx.controls.button to add a show hide label function

4500699
post	get
the best way to test is to have your html form element test with a get instead of a post this way you will see the key value pairs in the address bar when the form is submitted to the method by the action

4500708
accessor	properties
i then declare the properties dynamic to let ca create the accessor override +needsdisplayforkey and implement -drawincontext to pass the current value of the scenecenterpoint properties to the renderer and ask it to render the scene

4500749
cpu	hyperthreading
it might differentiate if it s using hyperthreading where a four-core cpu has hyperthreading and thus exposes 8 cpu s but even then i doubt it the framework will probably just see 8 cpu s

4500749
cpu	hyperthreading
a dual-quad-core system with hyperthreading would therefore potentially expose 16 cpu s

4500771
glassfish	resin
your web host runs a servlet container like tomcat jetty glassfish or resin

4500793
postgresql	mysql
postgresql mysql etc

4500807

mutators	getter	public	protected
briefly you describe and document what a mutators method is meant to do only in terms of values returned by its accessible public and protected getter methods

4501000
getter	setter
but now i have this abstraction which is just a bunch of getter and setter

4501043
post	get
however when i go onto the post 2010 12 site or any other date i get that amazing

4501045
width	height
however you could probably split it to several interfaces for example ipositionable x y iresizable width height ialignable ...

4501045
super	extends
then make some super interface itextfield that extends ipositionable iresizable and ialignable

4501097
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
google-chrome safari and opera show 1 2

4501111
post	get
i did some experimentation and it seems that when the post is submitted you will get two callbacks dialogcompletewithurl and then dialogdidcomplete

4501111
post	get
so if need be you could even peek at this value to further confirm your success although i expect that if the post really did fail as opposed to a skip you will get one of the fail callbacks instead

4501196
client-side	server-side
this runs through both client-side and server-side implementation of the keygen tag

spaces	delimiter
if delimiter are mixed and or you have to treat consecutive spaces as one using text parsewords might be easier

4501369
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
what i found in my tests is that the corners plugin loaded but using jquery 1.4.4 and testing with google-chrome 8.0.552.224 safari 5.0.3 firefox 3.6.13 and internet explorer 8 that only safari and fireefox showed the corners

4501418

also if you want super light php editing you could go with notepad ++ and take a look at webstorm which is a like a php-less subset to phpstorm designed to handle html javascript css etc

4501538
accessor	properties
no you re not doing anything wrong because you are using the properties accessor method self.aboutviewcontroller to set it to nil

4501546
for-loop	loops
in the first example where you declare str inside of loops all references to that string are going to be lost after the for-loop completes allowing java s garbage collector to remove all instances of the strings from memory

4501559
google-chrome	firefox
the text shows up fine in firefox and google-chrome however i can t seem to get this text to display in ie8

4501580
accessor	properties
much like a properties provides accessor for a field

4501580
accessor	properties
the advantage of a properties accessor is that the backing field can be private

4501606
implements	extends
and if at all someone needs those abstract methods and method x they can extends a and implements the new interface

4501621
int	chars
the initialization function takes a chars array but utf8_decode_next returns int

4501752
subclass	abstract-class
as to which of your two methods to use that depends entirely on what the abstract-class and your subclass are and what they re supposed to be doing

4501752

typically the only choice offered is mstest but i want to use mspec

4501818

4501832
google-chrome	firefox
i m sort of at a loss here i typically debug in firebug but this works perfectly in firefox and google-chrome

4501851
int	chars
on some implementations most importantly windows which uses surrogate pairs for chars outside the basic multilingual plane it still isn t big enough to represent any unicode chars which presumably is why the decoder you reference uses int

4501851
int	chars
wprintf deals in wchar_t so if the wide chars set is unicode and if wchar_t is int on your system as it is on linux then wprintf and friends will print the decoder output without further processing

4501980
getter	setter
i am trying to implement a custom java widget using gwt.this requires me to copy a class from the gwt api and pasting it in my own new class. i am not sure if this is a right approach.suggest me if its wrong to copy the api in my new class .the reason why i am doing this is i need to make modifications to the api because the api does not provide me getter setter s for a object

4501981
int	chars
since unicode is a 21-bit chars set it cannot return anything smaller than an int and it can be argued that technically it should be a long since an int could be a 16-bit quantity

4501990
gridbaglayout	miglayout
as an alternative you can use gridbaglayout or miglayout which can span columns

4502017

swt	swing
fixing bugs in swt is much harder than in swing most classes in swt are final or contain hostile checks in the constructor to make sure no one extends them the package is signed so you can t simply replace classes and so far i tried several times to compile swt from sources - and failed

4508736
swt	swing	swt	nebula
there are lots of custom components for swing swt just has project nebula which isn t very active

4509497
post	get
the post also contains a very useful link on how to get stated with theming

4509531
post	get
i don t see why you would need it though a post ajax call is just as visible as a get ajax call

4509540
setinterval	settimeout
firstly when using setinterval or settimeout don t pass the method in as a string as this calls the infamous eval which is poor coding practice

4509545

4510012
prng	random
once you have 128 truly random bits you can use them in a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator prng which will produce as many random bits as you need at a high rate limited only by the local computing power on a smartphone prng bandwidth will be in megabytes per second not kilobytes per second

4510012
prng	random
some say that getting true random protects you from any future cryptanalytic breach on the prng

4510012
prng	random
a stronger case for continuous entropy gathering can be made about seed storage the fear that an attacker getting hold of the prng could look at its entrails recover internal state and retroactively guess random bits which were previously emitted

4510085
width	height
and in some browsers to crash the browser by setting a huge width and height combo

4510097
hide	show
i don t show hide it even though it would work faster

4510153
gdal	ogr
in basic terms gdal is used for reading writing and transforming raster data while ogr can do the same with vector data

4510153
gdal	ogr
i am not as familiar with fdo but it appears to be an api used to access from database sources manipulate and analyze all kinds of geospatial data and relies on gdal and ogr for those purposes

4510156
fortran	ada
ada strings in fact all ada arrays are not 0 based like c or 1-based like fortran

second i don t see you setting the height or width of the image anywhere

4510252
inherited	properties
now that hasownproperty test in there is to make sure you don t stumble over properties inherited from the prototype

4510455
mp3	ogg
decoding audio via mp3 ogg etc.

4510456
actionscript	mxml
mxml is compiled down into actionscript

4510456
actionscript	mxml
mxml components are classes just like actionscript components are

4510456
actionscript	mxml
however if you use mxml to generate actionscript then the actual component that is running has a different code base

4510466
width	height
the javascript would be fairly simple you would animate the width and height of the a tag or image depending on what you used

4510470
width	height
this is also assuming the width and height are already defined

4510526
portrait	landscape
our application could support landscape mode without any problem but it is such a pain that we are thinking about forcing portrait mode

4510537
width	height
the path in works fine the preloader works fine and i can see the width height is being grabbed in the getwidthandheight function

4510555
ready	each
each feature when ready will need to get assigned to a release branch and merged to it

4510632
portrait	landscape
i changed the code to start the app in landscape the app opened in the simulator but the app was still in portrait mode in a horizontal simulator

then it will work only for portrait in landscape position will be change

4510759
mouseover	mouseout
so now - in ie 8 i have the problem that on mouseover the links jumps up and down on mouseout because of the border-bottom i think

4510791
base-class	derived-class
however i recall that c++ also allows you to use the using keyword which can come in handy in a derived-class function which frequently accesses a base-class variable

4510808
width	height
normalise your stored points such that the x y positions are relative to a surface of size 0..1 0..1 divide the x y by the width and height of the current surface

4510808
width	height
then whenever you want to change the size of the underlying surface multiply each point by this new surface s width and height

4510808
portrait	landscape
note the above will scale going from portrait to landscape the y will be compressed and the x expanded

4510879
width	height
in moss 2007 when you edit a web part you can set width and height using predetermined units of measure from the drop down list

4510902

4510994
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
webkit browsers safari google-chrome and opera will only animate span elements in certain positions within the parent element

width	height
if i have one background picture bg.png width 900px height 3000px i want to get this effection when open the page loading and show the background image from top to bottom

4511251
comparator	comparable
i believe the answer to the question about why you end up calling the comparator object method instead of the specific one is because your class definition says implements comparable without any type parameter

4511289
width	height
jquery can write width height attributes to image tags but it requires the browser to know their widths and height - and to know these the browser must have already loaded enough of each image to get these stats - so not very useful in your case

4511334
subtraction	addition
write those numbers as addition or subtraction

separation of summary + detailed build info get stdout + stderr of all build commands to redirect to a designated output file build-summary.txt but leave output from scons itself going to stdout stderr

4511713
stdout	stderr
structured build output using xml get stdout + stderr of all build commands to redirect to a designated output file and do so in an xml format as below

then when that dropdown changes i hide show the relevant rows in the table

4512350
rss	feed
i like to use syndicationfeed class to read rss feed but there remark about that for windows server 2008 r2 server core role not supported

4512477
width	height
i have many square images with different sizes and i want to first resize them so they are inside a 150pixel area so the images are not distorted so since most images are not exactly the same size on both height and width one of the sides would be smaller proportionally

4512482
vb6	vba
i ve worked a lot with asp classic vba access and vb6 so i have programming experience but little to no experience real programming - oop php or frameworks

4512506
int	chars
i ve got records from a table in sql server containing both int chars and text fields

4512508

4512651
rss	feed
i was trying to find a jquery plugin to parse an rss feed and found that jfeed was the most recommended option for quite some time but judging by the broken links on its plugin page and the fact that it hasn t been updated since 2008 i m guessing this is no longer the state-of-the-art in jquery rss parsing

4512653
stdout	fflush
std endl instead is an object that will cause to append the newline character n and to fflush stdout buffer

4512825
stdout	fflush
something else to try would be to fflush stdout after the printf call

4512845
getter	setter
hibernate does use proxy objects but the data is still stored in your object and hibernate will use the getter setter implementations you provide so your solution should work if you want to set the lowercase version although i m not clear why you need a separate instance variable to store the lowercase version

4512853
post	get
i don t have the excact usercontrol code here but i will edit this post when i get home..but here is the simplified idea

4512859

the events render perfectly in ie but in google-chrome firefox and safari the items do not show except for on the initial load

4514393
portrait	landscape
if you use the width device-width value for the viewport my guess is you shouldn t then have a fixed width in your design but better use widths in having in mind that in most recent mobile devices your css total width will be somewhere around 320px portrait or 500px landscape at a scale of 1.0

4515744
serializable	deserialization
there are good reasons to use a serializable deserialization technique like this

4515744
serializable	deserialization
but an efficient use of declarative serializable deserialization is a great approach in my experience

4515772
for-loop	loops
for example i added a second sphere directly above the first by putting a for-loop around the code block that creates the sphere and using loops variable to determine the origin y value and extended the simulation so it runs long enough for them both to reach the plane

4515774
addclass	removeclass
this is causing some weirdness with addclass and removeclass

4515787
width	height
as far as converting height and width from pixels to is concerned you would have to create a custom new tool part and remove the existing one from webpart tool part

4515813

4515884
cout	cin
in c++ why we go for cout and cin

4515894
subtract	add	rational-numbers	base
just like complex or rational-numbers numbers or address book entries or dictionary entries or any other non-basic type for that matter should be self contained in a class that knows how to add subtract or otherwise manipulate them separately from the base language the printing of those objects should also be left to the class as well

4515922
ddms	adb
however whenever i try to load the helloandroid example adb and ddms hang

4515922
ddms	adb
i make sure that only one ddms and adb are running

4515952
cout	cin
along with the ability to overload insertion and extraction operators for classes of your choice cin and cout are type-safe which scanf and printf are not -- a mismatch between the conversion format and actual type with printf is fairly common

4515959
min	max	range	max	range	min
the solution is to make a first pass over the data to find the min max of your range

4515959
min	max
there s really no quick fix to this and most libraries will ask for min max up front

4515976
cakephp	yii	codeigniter	cakephp	codeigniter	yii
yii has a higher learning curve than say codeigniter and cakephp

4516008

but note also that racket like many other lisp has a rich numeric tower with exact rationals etc

4516278
x86	64bit
if you re on a 64bit platform change your build target to x86 - that should run on both architectures

4516333
vim	emacs
saying you want c b to act like a compiler makes no more sense then saying you want vim emacs or visual studio to act like a compiler

4516360
mouse	keyboard
you could use a global keyboard mouse hook and just reset your counter to 0 when you receive an event from either

4516380
for-loop	arrays
i am fairly new to programming i can t figure out how to get the names of the java.io.file arrays for-loop in the createchildren function

4516383
persistent	transient
another approach would be to use an asynchronous job dispatch daemon such as beanstalk which would allow you to have a persistent service talking to the arduino and have transient web requests queueing jobs to manipulate it

4516414
pop-up	dialog
i want to get the file open dialog to pop-up via javascript

4516438

4516468
apache	nginx
1 using a popular web-server like nginx or apache - and invoking it through the application and running it as a process with

4516472

to assign uniform height width use wrappanel s itemheight itemwidth property

4516472
width	height
avoid assigning explicit height width to individual items

4516509
width	height
the only time i ever use inline styling is to declare the width or height of an object and maybe one more thing

4516618
mousemove	mousedown
you need to execute your code in the mousemove event as well as the mousedown event

4516642
width	height
the idea is that the user specifies the window width and height by typing in the two edit dialogue boxes within the window i have created

4516642
int	chars
but as you can imagine i can not use the xval or yval in the createwindow because i get a compile error stating i can not convert from int to chars

4516668
mouse	keyboard
if the focus is in the last required edit box the user has two ways to close the window either point the mouse and press it or just press the keyboard return key

4516688
min	max
the fist table contains the min and max value that a param may be

4516752
put	get
people get married or put silly nicknames for themselves which some people change frequently

4516761
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
this solves the custom action problem but other problems may occur since this approach has many restrictions the components need to maintain their names and guids between versioning your custom actions should be aware that the upgrade is performed at installation end etc.

4516826
post	get
i don t want to change my form method from get to post

4516851

i am currently using it for drawing entity-relationship diagram

4516906
dia	visio
but the home page of dia dia has this to say about dia dia is inspired by the commercial windows program visio though more geared towards informal diagrams for casual use

4516906
entity-relationship	diagram
dia is pretty slick tool and i am using it for designing entity-relationship diagram for my database schema but the above description contradicts my perception about dia

it want to be work in both safari and google-chrome

4516999
int	chars
i am trying to read a file in xcode which contains string of unicode characters.my code will traverse through string pick up chars one by one and prints its corresponding int value

4516999
int	chars
as it is obvious there is ambiguity for same int value chars differs depending on format specifier and also for same unicode chars their int value differs

4517048
int	chars
when your colleague only used int literals these will be converted to chars - you will however see a warning if the value of the int is too big

4517048
int	chars
funnily enough there is a definition of operator+ for string and chars but only when using the int literal is converted to chars i have to pass a chars literal or value for operator+ to be used

4517066
background-color	transparency
on an element without any background-color set you ll get transparency

4517090
subtract	addition
i will keep addition numbers and subtract numbers within different collections too

4517102
user-controls	elementhost
maybe it worths mentioning the list view control might be designed in wpf as an user-controls custom control with buttons in its listviewitems and then use this control in the winforms application in an elementhost control

4517146
extjs	smartgwt
now window builder supports gwt extjs gwt and smartgwt design

4517225
equals	compareto
since doing this does not enter the compareto method neither does it enter the equals method so i m at a loss atm

4517283
icomparable	compareto
if you implement icomparable than you implement the compareto method

4517283
equals	gethashcode
you should also implement the equals method simply call the operator and the gethashcode

4517291
vbscript	jscript
i think the key is having a pair of functions to translate between the jscript date object and the vbscript date type

4517291
vbscript	jscript
the jsdatefromvb in my example is a very crude function that translates from vbscript date to jscript date

4517340
min	max
group by columns max columns min columns etc

4517340
min	max
edit turns out that min and max work on string values and ignores null values taking the first and last values alphabetically

4517366
submit	submission
i need to change the values of a form after the submit button has been pressed but before the actual submission has taken place

4517378

width	margin
in the code below .content-container is the main content pane - this is contained in another div which is centered using the margin at 50 of the page width

4517405
ubuntu	linux
since you mentioned opengl and ubuntu i guess you want to start on a linux platform

4517416
jar	war
the deployable artifacts jar file war files will not contain the test classes or data

4517473
submit	submission
you can disable the link or submit button - but this is frustrating for the user in the case where the submission fails for some reason my bank does this and tbh it scares me that they don t realise they should instead program round the double-submit issue as you described it

4517477
pop-up	dialog
could anyone guide me creating a custom login activity and passing it to facebook...i dont want the dialog pop-up coming....any advice is welcome

4517489

4517512
mdpi	hdpi
that always be 12px in mdpi and so 18px in hdpi

4517525

opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
tested and working on ie6 and ie7 on windows and google-chrome firefox and opera on linux

4517586
put	get
in my option you can use a sync object to chat with the main thread after your add client connections to the pool the main thread can block at the accept and the sync object after you client handle it put the processed connection socket and response to a queue and then wakeup the sync object so the main thread can then get something from the queue and process it after main thread handle it block at accept and wait at the sync object

4517597
firefox	safari
that s the case in ie8 firefox and safari but in ie7 this shows up like

4517613
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
if you have control over the clients computers for an internal application that will be used from specific computers and you know which browser s will be used you could write a browser plugin or an extension in case of firefox google-chrome opera and install it on those computers - these have a much higher privileges of access to the rest of the os almost like normal processes

4517615
maven	pom.xml
write a maven pom.xml that has profiles and do this

4517669

for-loop	arrays
there is no for-loop however it is also not expandable to variable size arrays

4518441
dia	visio
i use both dia and visio extensively for these kinds of diagrams and have had no issues

4519094
ganglia	metrics	ganglia	nagios
the fastest way would be log on the machine via ssh and use cli tools like htop or top to check the current load however if you have multiple servers that performe different tasks it would make sense to install some kind of monitoring to collect metrics and getter informations about load usage there a lot of sophisticated tools for that like ganglia munin or as mentioned nagios

4519102
width	height
note that though you can force a specific size through the width and height fields in general the correct way to do this is let the window do its normal layout and determine the window size automatically that way

for-loop	loops
stylistically i d use a while loops in place of your for-loop

if i put top 10 in each seperate query i get 20 results total

4519320
folder	dir
the dir command doesn t appear to return folder size

4519350
width	height
a better solution is to let them upload it check the width and height of the picture and if isn t what you want then present a message to the user like error picture is too big decrease picture size

4519362
superclass	subclassing
then in your main method polymorphism allows you to assign a subclassing instance callmeimpl to a superclass or superinterface reference - in this particular case the me reference of type callmeifc you have a typo here btw

inherited	properties
but there is one thing - the inherited of course allowdrop properties isn t accessible from code or properties window of picturebox class

4519775
int	double
for example in vb.net there are value and reference types while in c# there are only references and also int double are treated as objects they are objects while in vb.net a value type is not a object and there is a split in types for this reason

4519802
websphere	ibm
c program files ibm websphere mq tools dotnet samples

4519804
jar	war
the problem you may be running into is that maven can guarantee on some plugins like the jar and war plugins but others plugins like your proguard plugin it may not

4519804
jar	war
i think if you changed the execution phase from package to prepare-package that should get the jsp files obfuscated before they are packaged into the the jar file and subsequently into the war file

4519805
jax-ws	jax-rs
with java these are covered by jax-ws and jax-rs

4519807

4519875
expander	grid
1. when i click my expander button and it expands it should stretch down to the end of the grid

4519889
int	double
this means that in most scenarios you do not need to specify that variable is an int double or any reference type like you would in c#

4519900
setinterval	settimeout
one more note many people might rightly suggest that instead of a timer driven by the browser s setinterval mechanism it might be better to use settimeout and do the work of setting up each subsequent timer yourself

4519968
folder	dir
for example when you move a file from one dir to another the file can carry an acl that is not the inherited acl you would expect if you just create the file in the folder originally

4519982
width	height
then it outputs a small empty image 1 pix width and 1 pix height transparent

4520009
width	height
the image loaded is larger than screen on both width and height

4520009
portrait	landscape
the most close i am getting now i manually resize imgview in loadview portrait mode would display correctly since app always starts with portrait mode but in landscape mode the width fits correctly but image is centered vertically rather than top aligned

4520101
accessor	properties
a properties is actually a method the get and set accessor for an indexer get compiled to get_index and set_index methods

i ve placed the conf directory on the web-inf folder the root folder and the meta-inf folder

4520275
profiling	benchmarking
i would avoid benchmarking sub-queries vs joins until the query itself has been optimized removing extraneous joins tautologous where clauses excessive column retrieval and profiling demonstrates the need to optimize a particular query

equals	gethashcode
if you have a list of a given class to use distinct you need to either a override equals and gethashcode inside your class so that appropriate equality comparisons can be made

4520391
equals	gethashcode
this will also allow you to specify the equals and gethashcode implementations without having to modify the source of the actual class

4520433
folder	directory
so that works but the problem if i m not mistaken is that this adds the parent directory of foo to sys.path and thus searches all of the sibling folder of foo for python modules

4520443
short	base
in short it will help you track all versions and you can create official builds base line

4520448
pyopengl	pyglet
obviously for 3d games you are going to have to muck around with opengl functions anyway in which case i recommend pyglet over pygame + pyopengl

svn and cvs are similar but many consider svn the easiest to use and learn

4520554
post	put
additional hint your code is open to email header injection - i can post any headers i want separated by line breaks in _post name and your code will put it into the email headers

4520568
xul	xbl
within a xbl method the only way to access the element that was defined in the xul file the gui description file without using this as it may not be the this i expect is with getelementbyid and this makes the code not reusable so i m looking for alternatives

4520665
jtextfield	jtextpane
then this can be used on a jtextfield or jtextarea or jtextpane

x86	64bit
i m running win 7 64bit so if you re on a 32 bit os drop the x86

4520743
portrait	landscape
so the problem appears when i pass from another scene to main menu in portrait mode the app doesn t rotate to landscape automatically and i can t find a code method to manually rotate it

4520743
portrait	landscape
so before i enter menu from portrait scene i set uirootviewcontroller shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation to return yes for landscape only

4520755
client-side	server-side
when add service reference is performed it uses that metadata to create a client-side class that looks like your server-side class

input checked looks for checked checkbox or radio button looks for text input fields whose value is not an empty string and textarea not empty selects textareas that have some text within them even if that s just whitespace

4520902
width	height
and you also have a vector from the center of the rectangle to your point you can project that point onto your width and height vectors

4520902
width	height
p point vector h height vector w width vector

4520902
width	height
correct me if i m wrong but if the magnitude of the projection of your point on the height vector is less then the magnitude of the height vector which is half of the height of the rectangle and the magnitude of the projection of your point on the width vector is then you have a point inside of your rectangle

4520902
width	height
if you have a universal coordinate system you might have to figure out the height width point vectors using vector subtraction

4520911
multiplication	modulo
projective transformations in 3d have an associated 4x4 matrix modulo a constant multiplication

4520930
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
inotifycollectionchanged isn t thread safe unline inotifypropertychanged so you should use the dispatcher to add items from the ui thread instead when adding items to your linklist from a worker thread

4521220
free	calloc	strlen	calloc
you will probably find functions such as strlen calloc free and strcat useful

4521236
strcpy	strncpy
note that in this case since the path is composed of strings known a priori strcpy strcat would have sufficed insted of strncpy strncat but whenever using user input you should usually use the strncpy strncat or even strlcpy strlcat if available unless you properly dynamically allocate memory

4521252
unsigned	short
what this means is that instead of wchar_t being a typedef for some internal type __wchar_t i think it becomes a typedef for unsigned short

4521255
min	max
by crafting a nice linq query you will get only the stuff you need you can select group by count min max whatever you like

versioning	upgrade
i need to upgrade a product that could be installed in per-user context to a new versioning that is always in per-machine context

4521402
versioning	upgrade
whether the old versioning was installed in a per-user no matter who or per-machine context should be completely seamless to an administrator user that performs the upgrade

4521402
versioning	upgrade
the msi upgrade should succeed without the need to know the password of the user that originally installed the previous versioning of the product in a per-user context

4521402
versioning	upgrade
if before running the msi the previous product was in per-user context findrelatedproducts will look at the cache and not apply the upgrade and remove the previous versioning because the new product is in per-machine context even though the previous product versioning is already configured to per-machine context in the registry by that time by my custom action

width	height
you need to have an algorithm for determining where to place the next element given a set of existing elements and a bounding box the container width height

4521488
width	height
once you have that you ll use the jquery width and height functions to get the sizes of the elements to position and i believe you ll want the css function for setting the top left

and then do the grouping filtering yourself in python

4527030
filtering	grouping
again this is perhaps more clear than using raw sql and only requires one query but this one query could be very large it will return all items and their categories and doing the grouping filtering yourself is probably less efficient than letting the database do it for you

4527040
concave	convex
i m guessing that i ll have to do some sort of tessellation and will have to deal with concave convex polygons

4527063

getter	setter
my question is beside the setter getter methods what are the other methods do i need in these classes

4527610
getter	setter
your property is correct but you ve written your own setter and getter that do not retain the object

4527610
getter	setter
you don t need to use both property synthesize and supply your own getter setter

4527625
post	get
when sending data you can use post or get methods to send data using http protocol

4527625
post	put
post tells your browser to build an http message and put all content in the body of the message a very useful way of doing things more safe and also flexible

4527650
getter	setter
for these getter and setter might be all you need

4527650
getter	setter
using getter setter rather than public fields leaves open the possibility that you may change the representation later without affecting callers

4527663
vbscript	vb6
i was asked to convert some vb6 vbscript code to javascript so after googling it and not finding anything i can use i wrote a small javascript function to help me do the conversion

4527992
folder	directory
i want to be able to load ruby files in the folder directory even the ones in the sub-directories

instead of giving the parent fixed height you can try to give padding to the child and as the upper and bottom margin will be the same it will be in the middle of the container

post	put
however assuming you just put that in there as an example if you own the page your trying to post to have it reply with an access-control header

4528250
width	height
you may need to make use of an ivalueconverter to deal with the way in which you are binding as well as setting the width and height to a fixed size to guarantee your 8x8 representation but the uniformgrid as a container should suffice to meet your goal of an 8x8 table

4528280

google-chrome	firefox
i m not mistyping anything in my input - and the programs i want to kill google-chrome and firefox are open

4528318
int	boolean
one example where an int could be more efficient than a boolean would be in a relational database

4528318
int	boolean
keep in mind that depending on the use and on the system using it while a boolean takes less space because it s just a single bit depending on the implementation an int is the native word size of the hardware

4528318
int	boolean
in high-level programming languages the choice between a boolean and an int is really more of code readability supportability than one of efficiency

4528318
int	boolean
it will never be a third option. if on the other hand there are currently two options but there could be more someday it might be tempting to use a boolean even just for now but it would logically make more sense to use an int or an enum

4528349
xmlhttprequest	xdomainrequest
also while you can use the same api as with normal ajax requests in most browsers in ie8 you will need to create an xdomainrequest object instead of an xmlhttprequest

4528353
hide	show
this code works like a charm to show hide table rows based on selected filters

4528360

now on my website i publish min max data for day and for the entire existence of my weatherstation which is around 1 year

4528426

google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome when you press ctrl+mouse wheel to zoom in and out

4528578
google-chrome	firefox
in ie it shows zoom percentage but no idea if i have correct resolution in firefox or google-chrome

4528583
google-chrome	firefox
in my example it breaks nothing because it s in a separate block. which brings us to once again google-chrome lags behind firefox --edit

4528627
illegalstateexception	illegalargumentexception
i also suggest breaking on arrayindexoutofboundsexception illegalargumentexception and illegalstateexception

4528630

4528798
rss	feed
i am parsing an rss feed and then caching the images from the rss feed and then displaying them in the cell s imageview

aptana	rubymine
some ide s like aptana and rubymine seem to offer some very basic refactoring but nothing really big compared to eclipse s java refactorings

4528805
vim	textmate
then there is another fact most railers even the pros prefer some lightweight editors like vim or textmate instead of ides

4528824

4529090
rss	feed
craigslist has rss feed so i suppose you could just get the link parse the feed and display it on a table

4529094
post	get
i ve got encryption but i ve copied the payroll data to five places so that people can get at it when they forget their encryption key . every time i think i have seen the limit of insanity someone post a question on so and teaches me again that there is no limit to insanity

4529097

4529215
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine on localhost server with ie firefox google-chrome

i don t think this is just an issue for firefox because the header row is first made to hide and the code deosn t show it up later

4529325
punctuation	words
note even if you doesn t want support for other languages than english i still would use the below as the words boundarie punctuation grammar etc are locale language dependent which might not be well addressed by stringtokenizer string.split ... and other basic apis

4529338
intersect	contains
we know that the old rectangle didn t intersect any other old rectangles and so because the newly created ones are contains in it we know that they don t intersect any either so you don t have to perform collision detection on them

4529695
vim	textmate	vim	emacs	emacs	textmate
i d recommend you teach yourself a flexible editor like vim emacs or textmate and then use that for all your coding requirements rather than ide hop depending on language

4529742
int	chars
is just an abstraction of offsets in that huge chain of ones and zeroes that we interpret as bytes int chars etc

swt	swing
i use ubuntu and thus gnome when developing and immediately i noticed that something as simple as drop down menus are totally improperly rendered with swing but work fine with swt in swing no border is drawn around them and disabled menu items are rendered totally differently than they would otherwise be

4532599

4532744
i2c	spi
dacs are often external sometimes serial so you may have to bit bang spi or i2c or look into what hardware the microcontroller might have for speaking spi or i2c or if there is a dac in the microcontroller how to use it what registers to write etc

4532765
hide	show
basically i want to load a html document and using controls such as multiple check boxes which will be programmed to hide delete or show html elements with certain id s

4532765
button	checkbox
i am able to get the result that i want by wrapping any html elements in a and just setting that place holders visibility to false after the associated checkbox is checked and a postback occurs finally i add a checkbox button control that removes all the checkbox including itself etc for final html

4532765

4532863
width	height
an inner with a fixed height and a very long width

richfaces	icefaces	primefaces	icefaces	primefaces	richfaces
note that i don t take any 3rd party componant libraries like primefaces richfaces icefaces into account in this answer it would then be impossible to write a reliable answer since it basically boils down to it depends

4532870

in general it s sufficient to just upgrade the component library to a -by themselves verified- jsf 2.0 compatible versioning as per their instructions

4532907
mongoid	cancan
just recently cancan added support for mongoid and renamed candefinition to rule so the error you are getting indicates you are using the latest cancan code from the git repo

i see that the story entity inherited from the card entity you created but you don t know why you have product_id and sprint_id properties in the story table schema since they re virtual properties in the card class

4533001
for-loop	loops
calling a loops index variable loops is really no more expressive than calling it i and using a in a for-loop instead of a is certainly uncommon in my experience

4533045

4533103
box-sizing	border-box
on supported browsers set box-sizing to border-box css3 only

4533103

this causes the browser to calculate the width of an element as content + padding + border + margin as opposed to content-box in the css1 2 box model

4533111
srp	principles
however i am trying to understand each principles and it s not clear to me how srp applies

4533176
mouseup	mousedown

known structures that can be used are b+ tree avl tree skip-lists hash table union-find rank tree and of course all the basics like arrays and such

4533562

from what it looks you have to subclass qstyle and override pe_indicatortabclose and return a different qicon path

4533568
integer	unsigned
i m now thinking about adding an id as autoincerment unsigned integer to the user table

4533593
int	chars
this is commonly true with all dbms int are always faster than strings you compare it using artithmetical ã¼ber fast cpu operations instead of comparing strings chars to chars

other protocols such as icmp used by ping can run over ip but have nothing to do with tcp

4533745
width	margin
i think it is better to use fill_parent with a padding margin instead an exact width value

4533750
width	height
if you want the buttons to fill the space but divide it among themselves use a linearlayout give each button a height or width depending if column or row of 0px then use android layout_weight to allocate space between them on a percentage basis

4533766
udp	tcp
connectionless protocols like ip and udp are used for example with the video conferencing when you don t care if some packets are lost while you have to use a connection-oriented protocol like tcp when you send a file because you want to insure that all the packets are sent successfully actually we use ftp to transfer files

4533771
integer	unsigned
however the header offer the additional exact-width integer types int8_t int16_t int32_t int64_t and their unsigned counterpart

casting	autoboxing
autoboxing and implicit upcasting is only performed if there s no method which can be called without casting autoboxing

4534203
hash	md5
in my current project i have to compare 128bit values actually md5 hash and i thought it would be possible to accelerate the comparison by using sse instructions

4534252
int	boolean
however instead of using an int for true false you should use a boolean

4534288
rss	feed
you can read their rss feed and just display them on your site it will be live updating too

4534313
typedef	typename
edit i corrected the wrong keyword typedef to typename

4534396
nstextfield	nstableview
the same goes for other nsview subclasses such as nstextfield nstableview

4534415
implements	extends
create a class that extends android.telephony.phonestatelistener and implements its oncallstatechanged

4534459
setinterval	settimeout
the source of that page is actually and if you look at the javascript it s obfuscated but i suspect some settimeout setinterval function that increases the number by an amount every period of time

4534459
cpu	processors
simple arithmetic does consume cpu but modern processors like my 3.4 ghz dual core can blast through them in no time and you don t even see that cpu usage spike in task manager

4534459
cpu	processors
oh and as an added side note running on the x64 version of firefox is lowering the cpu usage on my x64 processors

4534475
post	get
i ask for the wall post of a user and i also get the post of other people who posted there

4534477

in swing swt i can do it like this

4534584
post	get
if both source_id and actor_id are the same you will get only that user s post to his own wall

4534593
128bit	64bit
sse4.1 added vector 64bit integer comparisons pcmpeqq and pcmpgtq but because of the way they are implemented it is not straightforward to piece two of them together into a 128bit comparison

4534593
128bit	64bit
the preferred way to accomplish a 128bit comparison on x86_64 is to use a 64bit comparison on the high word then an additional 64bit comparison on the low word only if the high words compare equal

4534607
put	get
everyone - you rent from - will put their profit in the price you get so it is possible to create a service this way it would just be too expensive to sell

pecl	pear
it doesn t rely on any other pear pecl or php files

4534824
width	height	portrait	landscape
you ll need to fix your cells frame width assuming the height is same in portrait and landscape mode within your cellforrowatindexpath method

4534832
width	height
i mean when you drag the borders you can increase or decrease the grid s height and width

basically i m sending all request via ajax jquery - for post it works like a charm but when i m sending data with put the parameters are empty not processed

4535119
selecteditem	selectedindex
seems to me that selecteditem is driven by selectedindex

4535119
selecteditem	selectedindex
selecteditem updates only when selectedindex updates

4535141
int	double
however you could pull apart the format string use it to determine the object types double float int etc and print each one out individually with it s own format string a subsection of the original format string

4535199
mouse	keyboard
i havent been able to find any errors logged but the program will turn off the backlight if no keyboard or mouse events are registered in 20 or more seconds and turn it back on when one it registered and this doesnt happen at the gdm and neither in gnome

jobs	cron
can it be done with cron jobs

4535376
children	parent
well there s more information when you set b s mother a s gender and we know any individual will need exactly two parent versus a 0-or-more number of children

4535376
children	parent
you can always find out the children of any individual by iterating over all to pick out the set whose parent is equal to the individual in question

4535386
bufferedreader	fileinputstream

and not to forget on the 32 bit machines choose x86 as target platform while on the 64bit machines choose x64

4535430
hide	show
if the elements you want to show hide have fixed ids then this might be a quick and dirty solution

4535460
appkit	nsapplication
but i don t want to require the appkit framework or nsapplication i might use the functionality in command-line applications so i d like to wrap the block in an #ifdef

even a file with the correct extension can contain malicious code that can be executed in the context of your site by an authenticated user allowing server-side or client-side attacks

4535697
nstextstorage	nstextcontainer
i m using an nstextstorage an nslayoutmanager and an nstextcontainer

4535745

4535907
sqldatasource	datalist
i have added functionality with datalist and sqldatasource

4535930
super	extends
if it produces you extends consumes you use super

4535958
super	extends
pecs â producer extends consumer super

4535966
super	self
for some reason in methods i can t use super a self but super b self works great

4536019
inherited	properties
here proto keeps track of the raw properties of each class but it s still available to extend which then can add those properties to other classes when they inherited from another

4536047
querypath	phpquery
for example with phpquery or querypath it s as simple as

4536071
width	height
the result of this step is a map from integers to width height pairs

4536071
width	height
save the mapping from codepoints to x y width height to another file

4536071
width	height
the in-memory representation could be a few arrays that contain x y width height

4536071
width	height
and probably you only need 8 bits for width and height anyway

4536090
for-loop	loops
i ve already converted my foreach loops to a for-loop but i want to know the details on why this error occurs

4536095

4536208
short	base
you should really read up on object-oriented development and what method overriding actually means but the short version is that you have a function in your code that has the override modifier attached to it but none of its base classes define a function with the same signature marked as virtual in this specific case they don t define a member with that signature at all

these include cocoa touch the counterpart of the os x cocoa ui framework the mach darwin xnu kernel and code from the berkeley software distribution bsd

4536663
portrait	landscape
internal accelerometers and gyroscopes can be used by applications to respond to the user shaking the device one application is the undo command or rotating it in three dimensions one common result is switching from portrait to landscape mode or autorotation

4536663
swift	objective-c
cocoapods is a dependency manager for swift and objective-c cocoa projects

4536663
swift	objective-c
you will get lots of custom controls animation libraries and much more which is available in swift and objective-c

4536663
swift	objective-c
if you are moving from objective-c to swift but you don t know anything about swift then you can convert your objective-c code project to swift

4536663

4536664
swift	objective-c
use the related tags objective-c and swift for issues specific to those programming languages

4536716
hex	binary
well we typically don t do too well reading binary and hex is a better substitute for that

4536731
portrait	landscape
also is the code to recrop an image with a mask if the image is portrait or landscape

4536781
uiview	subviews
i am creating subviews of uiview of small dimensions and adding it to the view using the statement self.view addsubview myview

4536804
post	put
and then you would be able to write the plist file on server.and more over you could also use the method for parsing like post put and you can also send asynchronousrequest to the server that depends upon you

4536860
versioning	upgrade
in my case there were 2 different sdk settings in the project file due to 2 separate versioning of xcode editing the file this could be very likely if you restored from backup and had upgrade sdks in the interim

4536862
int	chars
array of chars or simply a string and not in an array of int

4536875
printf	strlen
when you use functions that operate on strings like strlen for string-length or using printf to output a string then those functions will read through the data until a null is encountered

4536879
printf	strcpy
this is baked into the language in the form of interpreting string literals and is adopted by all the standard library functions like strcpy and printf and etc

4536902
ceil	floor
you can then choice to ceil or floor this value to get a whole number or you could just use the value returned depends on your logic really

4536902
ceil	floor
in other words when you player puts the slider at the 50 section you are able to get a value of 50.0 back from the above code without using ceil or floor

4536909
openjpa	datanucleus
eclipseling datanucleus openjpa are some example implementations of jpa spec

4536913

if your range of light levels begins at 10lux then the max source resistance you ll see will be 100k which is well above required source impedance

4536941
simplecursoradapter	listactivity
i have a listactivity that s populated with a simplecursoradapter which pulls the data from a database

4536955
listview	gridview
it drives me nuts that listview and gridview can t be expanded to wrap their children because we all know that they have more beneficial features in addition to their scrolling and the recycling of their children

4536965
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
and btw versioning 1.2.4 is out you may upgrade your django installation to see if the problem solves itself

4536968
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfect on firefox google-chrome etc.

4536992
width	height
the scrollviewer could only work when it is smaller than which it contains either width or height

4536992
width	height
if you do not indict the width or height of the scrollviewer it will be stretched to fit its content and as a result the effect would not be perfect

4536997
integer	unsigned
because this was not done the c99 standard contains non-normative gibberish and consequently all of the rules for behaviour of signed and unsigned integer conversions are non-normative gibberish as well

4537059
hash	salt
you use a salt to make it more difficult for the attacker to get at your passwords because then he would need to know the salt so that he can use it in computing the hash for your passwords

4537074
fgets	fread
you have to call some function to request data to be read anyways and if it hasn t done it by the time you call fread fgets read etc.

4537082
hash	md5
if you don t believe in md5 you can try a higher algorithm by using the hash function

4537160
hash	salt
the salt is not normally kept secret but it s relatively random so an attacker who s doing a dictionary attack can t just hash each word as-is but has to take each possible salt value into account

4537167
put	get
in order to further put constraints on the mesh i get i will supply a list of fix points which must lie inside the polygon so that they must be connected by the triangle elements generated

4537167
concave	convex
i tried delaunay command but it can t work on concave polygon because the delaunay command will always return me a list of elements that encompass a convex area

4537265
concave	convex
as you noted this will create a triangulation of the convex hull even if you have a concave polygon so you would have to remove triangles outside of the constrained edges using the method inoutstatus also illustrated in the answers linked above

4537265
concave	convex
for example if you re faced with triangulating a concave polygon you can create a mex-file to interface one of the convex partitioning routines in cgal in order to break the concave polygon into a set of convex polygons

4537265
concave	convex
then delaunay could be used to triangulate each convex polygon and the final set of triangulations grouped into one larger triangulation of the concave polygon

4537279
updatepanel	scriptmanager
if the updatemode of all the updatepanel on your page are set to conditional and your scriptmanager has partial updating enabled it really shouldn t undo everything the script did

to my knowledge this is a mechanism of php internally seeing and parsing elements passed via form get post with the postfix and interpreting them as an array of elements

4543556
post	get
in fact the http protocol does not forbid the use of multiple identical get post parameters

4543584

udp	tcp
each implementation in this layer called a connector provides my application with a way of exchanging data with a connected peer through http tcp sockets udp sockets etc.

4543839
google-chrome	firefox
for firefox it s firephp and gor google-chrome it s php console

4543866
hash	salt
adding a dynamic salt to each user would mean that you will have to hit a datastore to retrieve the dynamic salt and the hash version of the user s password then you will have to perform the cpu intensive hash function in your code twice -- you are hashing a hash which is less secure and more likely to have collisions

4543866
hash	salt
having a simple known static salt and a hash password will allow you to use key value storage systems like memcache should you application grow

4543867

i am currently working on a program that has two edittext boxes one for a screens width and one for the screens height

4544058
width	height
what i want to be able to do is that when a user knows either the height or width and they enter the measurement they have into the edittext box that corresponds with the measurement that they have and when they press enter it will give them the unknown dimension for a 16 9 screen

4544065
width	height	subtract	add
you need to devide your growth into half and add it to width height and subtract it from left top

4544081

your best bet is to determine why the animation has 54 images that are all the width height of the screen

4544118
union	distinct
the distinct actually speeds up the query even though union already does a distinct

4544122
uitableview	nsindexpath
then in your uiviewcontroller s action method you can utilize the uitableview s indexpathforcell method to obtain the correct nsindexpath

4544195

4545049
mouseover	mouseout
side note the code you ve found is using the mouseover and mouseout events

4545049
mouseover	mouseout
that means that as the user s mouse travels from left-to-right you ll see a series of mouseover events as the mouse travels over the text 11 space then your code will see a mouseout event as the mouse moves over into the word gurney

4545049
mouseleave	mouseenter
internet explorer has the mouseenter and mouseleave events which are more suited to what you re doing mdash

4545049

x86	64bit
any .net application can be compiled for both x86 32-bit and x64 64bit at once

4545432
x86	64bit
supported targets are any will just-in-time compile to 32 or 64bit depending on operative system support x86 will compile to 32-bit which works on all platforms and x64 will compile to 64bit which only works on 64bit platforms

4545453
x86	64bit
yes you can - actually vs installs the 32 bit version of clr on x86 computer and 32 bit and 64bit both of them versions of clr on 64bit windows

4545453
x86	64bit
the same as advantage of 64bit operating systems vs x86 ones

as long as your concern is limited to ie7 and ie8 only ignoring firefox google-chrome etc i think you are pretty safe

4545595
int	boolean
performance points aside i consider boolean and int to be two fundamentally different concepts in programming

4545595
int	boolean
boolean represents a condition an int represents a number

4545595
int	boolean
also your examples about why int would be better than boolean are kinda flawed

the length of the file can be obtained by fseek fp 0 seek_end and then calling ftell .you can then allocate enough memory for the whole file.once in memory parsing the file should be relatively easy

4546022
int	double
so you re guaranteed uniform behaviour and while i don t have access to the official ieee standard document i m pretty sure that it implicitly guarantees that operations on int that can be represented exactly as a float double work as expected

folder	dir
from the above link user wrikken suggested that we possible workaround is to create a folder trunk now and move the current content of the root sans branches dir into that location

4546410
innodb	myisam
in my opinion myisam use to be faster than innodb now they are pretty much the same in speed

4546410
innodb	myisam
one of advantages of myisam over innodb is support of full text indexes it might be helpful if you planing to use full power of search queries

4546410

i recall an application i inherited that faced a similar situation the programmer who wrote the app keyed off two fields in the database one - the current versioning number prior to any installer running it would check the versioning number so if the database had a higher versioning than the installer was attempting the install would abort secondly in the same table that stored the versioning build another column stored the state of the database operational upgrade in process etc so if the versioning # was older that was the second check if an install was already in progress the secondly launched installer would abort

4546832
installation	upgrade
when installation begins write a record into that table that indicates an upgrade is in progress

4546836
hide	show
i tried using jquery to hide the table on load but then show it on submit but after i submit the whole page is refreshed so the table is hidden again

4546839
websphere	ibm
modify the file opt ibm websphere appserver java jre lib security java.security

4546841
width	height
in php i could use phpthumb library that allows me to specify a filename and max width height in a query string

4546841
width	height
the library resizes the images accordingly in addition it caches the copy of the image so that next time the same image with same width height is requested it is served from the cache

4546886
udp	rtp
i make 2 connections to ip cam by ip1 and ip2 addresses from the same ip and i need to receive corresponding streams thru correct network card but both streams rtp over udp go thru ip1

4546910
hide	show
well the hide and show stuff is pretty simple

4546912
gif	png
the problem here is that the most common image formats such as jpg png or gif have no concept of layers - so that the base would be one layer and the watermark another the result is just one layer onto which both were redrawn

4546914
google-chrome	firefox
works fine in google-chrome and ie unfortunately firefox disable by default the option to raise windows in code so focus has no effect in that browser - could not find any work around

4546923
children	parent
how can i track down which parentinstance s property isvalid is not checked unchecked that i can easily set parent s children property isvalid

4546925
goto	break
if i had a goto in my game java doesnt really provide one i wouldn t have wasted so much time fiddling with break and brackets

4546984
udp	tcp
other techniques are udp hole punching or tcp hole punching

4547000
innodb	myisam
also note that myisam will lock the entire table when doing updates whereas innodb will only lock the affected rows

4547006
children	parent
deleting the parent could cascade the delete of the children in two ways

4547140
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
i tried to do the same thing inside the view controller s viewdidappear and viewwillappear methods but this also did not work

4547156
mousemove	mousedown
everything seems to be working fine except when i bind the mousemove event on mousedown the dom scrollleft property is not changing

4547243
goto	break
you can use them as goto statements on break and continue though admittedly you rarely see this in practice

4547253
folder	directory
all files and directory in priv cvs are chmodded to cvs cvs and all folder in priv cvs have been chmodded to 775 read by all write by owner group

this is somewhat advanced functionality which is abstracted away by both httpwebrequest webrequest webclient and the like

4547273
agile	sprint
having gone through many agile scrum methodology articles and books one way to do this would be a requirements review during a sprint review but i was wondering if there were any other techniques tools out there

4547280
ssl	https
tcp 443 https - the remote service supports the use of weak ssl ciphers

4547315
put	get
also i am using the gae datastore to put and get the supps and suppsets so i m not clear why i m not acting on the unique instances that i should be pulling from the db

4547343
ubuntu	linux
i received input from someone who is successfully running chuck programs in a beagle board ubuntu linux on a beagle board running chuck but his choice of language and hardware was made very lightly his setup is not using the dsp in the beagle board and it seems like overkill to run a whole linux install to process audio signals

4547358
entities	entitymanager
instead a separate class called the entitymanager is provided to work with entities

4547358
jax-ws	jax-rs
this is done via among others jax-ws web services soap and jax-rs rest

4547383
set	bag
a list in nhibernate is an ordered set if you want an unordered set use bag mapping

4547398
post	get
i think if you post specific instances than you can get the specific ways to those using multiprocessing

4547408
feedback	review
a sprint review is one place to gather feedback and new requirements

4547416
hide	show
i have a legacy js function that show or hide child nodes of argument element

4547416
mouseover	mouseout
it is used in mouseover and mouseout event handlers to show-hide img tags

4547427
perl	tcl
for the most part most languages out there are either written in c perl python ruby tcl ... or is compatible with c c++ c# objective-c

4547455
stdout	stderr
i assumed that in ruby would merge the stdout and stderr handles of the shell command with the ruby script

4547480
typedef	struct
at line 29 i declare a pclimage variable defined with typedef like an array of struct

4547493
public	protected

4547501
x86	64bit
i am trying to remote-debug an x86 32-bit application running on a windows 7 64bit vm

4547554
post	get
to use form_for you need to define a post method that the form can submit to at the moment you are only setting up a get for returning the form that you then will fill in

4547562
unsigned	short
note that if i had used unsigned short int explicitly everywhere for the counter i d have to go through all files and only change the unsigned short int uses for a counter

4547562
unsigned	short
i can t just globally replace unsigned short int in all code because i might use it for other things besides the counter

4547578
hide	show
how can i show button for specific user and hide it for another one based on security role in asp.net mvc 2

4547578
hide	show
for example if i have create button in my view how to show it only for admin and hide it for any other user

4547656
min	max
start with max and min equal to the value of the first top-left pixel

4547656
min	max
loop through the pixel values updating min to pixel if and max to pixel if where pixel is the pixel value in the current iteration

4547692
nsautoreleasepool	nsrunloop
no every nsthread has its own nsrunloop but not its own nsautoreleasepool

4547693
hide	show
then if the device is rotated they hide the toolbar or show it and add a popover button which will show the root controller

4547700
pull	push
you need to transform the values stored within the array into something core data can use and then save the data in the store so that you can push and pull it to your nsarray as needed

4547729
subtraction	multiplication	division	multiplication	division	subtraction
you may want to check for p until it is null then proceed with the next operation say subtraction then multiplication then division

4547746
distance	polygons
then for each point per degree around the circle get the point at the radial distance and make a polygons that way

4547753
postgresql	mysql
in my previous experience with oracle and php i used oracle sequences to make autonumbered fields and i m aware that there are broadly similar features in mysql postgresql and probably other database systems but i haven t been able to find how autonumbering works in db2

4547755
spaces	linefeed
there are a linefeed and four spaces between and

4547764
goto	break
the main reason goto is unnecessary is that usually it can be replaced with more readable statements like break continue or by extracting a piece of code into a method

4547785
super	self
besides allowing the database to be self contained and enforcing it s own authorization checks even if they were able to acquire a valid super user account it becomes time consuming to do large swaths of damage

4547834
getter	setter
enable your model to support types as other nested models and implement v or c layer tricks to deal with it each layer will have to process the model-complex instead of just using getter and setter

4547858
post	get
check the link below and read through to robert rossney s post to get a fair overview

4547860
versioning	upgrade
it involves enumerating through all the folders in appdata companyname to find the latest user.config file in a folder name of the versioning you wish to upgrade from

4547860
versioning	upgrade
copying the old user.config file and versioning folder name from the old folder into the new folder structure created under .net 4.0 with the old versioning folder name fixes the problem - it will now upgrade

4547904
serializable	deserialization
gson provides default serializable and deserialization for enums map java.net.url java.net.uri java.util.locale java.util.date java.math.bigdecimal and java.math.biginteger classes

4547904
serializable	deserialization
by default gson excludes transient or static fields from consideration for serializable and deserialization

entity-relationship	diagram
entity-relationship diagram

4547966
entity-relationship	diagram
diagram created by this process are called entity-relationship diagram

4547984
getter	setter
or whatever data type your getter setter properties are

4548004
min	max
it would be also nice to have float and double limits min and max values

4548033
hash	md5
but in general you can t get a meaningful range of rows when using randompartitioner because rows are ordered by the md5 hash of their keys

4548036
lisp	prolog
although some languages are more strongly associated with ai programming than others -- lisp prolog -- many different languages can be used

4548037
lisp	prolog
some old time favorites are lisp and prolog

4548053
inherited	properties
the in operator is used to enumerate the properties the names not the values of a javascript object - and in javascript all non-primitives are objects inherited from object

4548053
inherited	properties
since in also enumerates properties inherited through the prototype chain we must use hasownproperty to check if these are indeed the objects own properties and not just inherited ones

4548077
autocomplete	autosuggest
information is being scanned into them therefore i need to disable the autocomplete autosuggest feature

width	height
you can assign that directly to a tbitmap s handle property and then divide the width by 4 and the height by 3 to get the subbitmap measurements

4548119
setinterval	settimeout
the difference using settimeout to loop will wait 3 seconds in between loops whereas setinterval will make it take 3 seconds total for the loop including however much time the animation takes as long as it s less than 3 seconds

4548162
jobs	cron
turns out the domain was moved to a new server and the cron jobs were still running on the old one

4548163
min	max	range	max	range	min
hopefully this makes sense basically i m looking to figure out the min max range of the intervals by provider date for the range where they increment by one.

4548163
min	max
once there is a break in the interval incrementer more than one then it would indicate a new min max range.

4548171
google-chrome	firefox
open in firefox or google-chrome or ie8

4548184
punctuation	words
including cases where these words are next to characters such as quotes and other punctuation

4548199
int	double
if i perform a double cast from varchar - int - numeric the cast works

4548207
public	protected
it seems that the only way i can have everything i want is to remove the public constructor of the generated proxy and replace it with a protected constructor then allow a reference to this assembly - they ll be able to work with the complex types but won t be able to call the constructor

4548208
overwrite	preserve
it overwrite the input which you may want to preserve for use later

4548251
touchesbegan	touchesended
i tried adding the touchesbegan withevent and touchesended withevent methods to the window but they are not called possibly due to the window being covered by uiimageviews.

4548283
x86	64bit
if your msi is 32-bit make sure the platform target of your custom action project is set to x86 otherwise if your installer is a 64bit one set it to x64

4548299
oncreate	findviewbyid
override the oncreate method and then use the method findviewbyid

4548313
innodb	myisam
i heard correct me if i am wrong that innodb is better for tables that will be updated a lot because of row locking opposed to myisam s table locking

4548328
keydown	keyup
i am able to handle keydown events but keyup events never fire

4548335
innodb	myisam
if you need row-level locking foreign key constrains etc you should go for innodb but if you don t need it you can go for myisam

4548337
portrait	landscape
i had a similar issue with the pinch gesture reorienting the video display from landscape to portrait

4548345
innodb	myisam
yes you can mix myisam and innodb in same database if required without any problem

4548349
innodb	myisam
myisam is faster for certain queries and supports fulltext and spatial indexes while innodb is transactional and more concurrent

4548358
des	aes
symmetric ciphers aes des blowfish

4548358
rsa	dsa

it is a common idiom in scheme lisp primarily used for encapsulation especially when doing meta programming

4548419
gson	jackson
so you may want to consider other libraries i would recommend jackson gson also works

4548449
keystore	jks
this is probably because i have kept the jks keystore and truststore files under res raw folder in my app. just a guess

4548457
cpu	affinity
i ve almost ruled out deploying into an existing web container as we often like to set per application resource limits and cpu affinity which i believe would affect all apps deployed into a web container app server and not just a specific application

4548460
button	checkbox
there s a click method on links button checkbox

4548515
int	chars
i have a struct with three variables two unsigned int and an unsigned chars

4548579
ienumerable	ienumerator
whats the difference between ienumerator and ienumerable

4548579
ienumerable	ienumerator
the difference between ienumerator and ienumerable is that the former represents the contract for objects that let you enumerate a sequence and the latter represents the contract for objects that are a sequence that can be enumerated over

4548580
ienumerable	ienumerator
whats the difference between ienumerator and ienumerable

4548590
hash	salt
in short the crc algorithme should be the same as any other but some times programs have their own salt to spice up the hash algorithme

4548613
put	get
you can put each view in a separate nib file if they re different or loaded from a separate viewcontroller instance if they re the same and you get some of the advantages of apple s automatica memory management of vc s nibs

4548621
x86	64bit
if you are concerned with 32-bit windows 64bit windows linux x86 and amd64 and mac x86 amd64 ppc then it s more easy

4548622
twos-complement	modulo	twos-complement	ones-complement
fortunately all current processors i m aware of use twos-complement for integer representation rather than ones-complement or sign-magnitude so integers at least have the same binary representation modulo byte order

4548645
installation	upgrade
if you consider a fixed installation of tomcat 6 as the deployment platform then a single application can not just upgrade to servlet 3.0 from tomcat 7 since this will effect all other applications running on that same tomcat

4548650
filtering	grouping	sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping
filtering sorting grouping working with stored procedures and functions working with graphs of objects prefetch path lazyload

4548672
keydown	keyup
i just found out that if you set a breakpoint on a keydown event in the chrome developer tools javascript console the corresponding keyup event is never sent

4548672
keydown	keyup
so use console.log instead of breakpoints to debug keyup keydown events

4548688
post	get
the simplest way to communicate it to the source server might be a get url makeupload which is text plain and contains only the url to post to

4548688
post	get
to prevent unauthorized uploads you can require a password either in the post or already in the get as a query parameter

4548713
textmate	jedit
and beyond these efforts most programming editors such as jedit or textmate also have some scala support to one degree or another

4548746
nsdata	nserror
use nserror-aware api for nspropertylistserialization to get the data and the nsdata nserror aware write api so you get a meaningful error helping you understand what your problem might be

4548768
scheme	prolog
prolog into scheme

4548820
gif	png
generate it once encode it as a gif or png image and only send those bytes back to the http client

centos	linux
using postgresql 8.4.6 with centos 5.5 linux

4548881
firefox	safari
this works in ie firefox safari etc

4548955
postgresql	mysql
i couldn t make query_reviewer work with rails 3.0.1 also i had to switch to mysql because postgresql is not supported

4548959
inherited	properties
nested properties don t need to be lookup up more then once potentially in the inherited chain which is slow

4548984
google-chrome	firefox
i tried subscribing to the load event and if this event is not fired after some time then i failover but this only works in firefox since ie and google-chrome fires the load event when the page not found is displayed

4549015
emacs	aquamacs
i m using aquamacs 2.1 which is based on gnu emacs 23.2.50.1 on os x 10.6.5 if that makes a difference

4549017
textview	imageview
you can set any view imageview textview linearlayout relativelayout... clickable

4549051
width	height
the images are fit into the bar by setting their height to 50 and letting their width rescale automatically

wmic	tasklist
you can use tasklist wmic process list on most windows machines or get-process if you are using powershell

4549092
subtract	add
add or subtract a specific number of time units to a source string

4549098
qtcore	qtgui
well i just needed to place qtcore and qtgui libraries to same folder with hook.dll

4549099
multiplying	multiplication
starting with x and repeatedly multiplying by x we can compute x 31 with thirty multiplication

4549099
division	multiplication
by multiplication and division starting with x for the given positive integer n and

4549135
udp	mtu
note that udp packets bigger than the mtu s at every hope between your hosts will be split by ip

4549218
put	get
if you put another table inside the td with two td s one left and one right aligned it will work and i will get down voted for such a suggestion

4549229
abc	subclassing
you can formalize python interfaces to some extent using the abc module which allows you to declare that a given class is a subclassing of a given abstract base class interface using any criteria you desire such as it has attributes color tail_length and quack and quack is callable. but this is still much less strict than static languages having an interface feature

4549266
put	get
basically the approach is to break you server requests into whatever operations you need to get data and each one can put data into different parts of a model

4549271
min	max
to get the bounding box you need to look at the four resulting points and find the min and max for y and x

4549312
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the nice thing about douglas crockford s reference implementation is that it will use browser-native json parser if available fast efficient - available on ie8+ in standards mode latest opera google-chrome safari firefox - that s what felix s link talks about only falling back to javascript implementation slow in browsers where native json parser is not available

4549419
ienumerable	iqueryable
or some other way to get an iqueryable ienumerable reference to check against other rows already in the db

4549419
getter	setter
what i have is a usermetadata class that has all of the property setter and getter for a user along with all of the appropriate dataannotations and entlib validation attributes

4549423
versioning	upgrade
it may be passenger which means the best you can hope for is to upgrade to the latest versioning of sinatra

4549440

but no matter what declaration i give to stream public private protected or no permission at all i still get this error

4549463
twig	smarty
i know there are many engines that exist like smarty twig and pattemplate that could do exactly what i want but i am looking to learn how to build one

4549466
int	chars
chars are int types that are copied on assignment

4549477
wordpress	joomla
i am running joomla and wordpress both and i wanted to integrate the back-end-menus into each other

4549477
wordpress	joomla
some joomla admin menu links into wordpress back-end and similarly some wordpress menu links into joomla backend menu

4549509
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
it works great on opera google-chrome and firefox 3.6.13 but in newest version nothing happens

4549553

the true solution is to have server-side validation not client-side

4549589
getter	setter
i tried creating getter setter methods for name in ingredient but i m not sure how to fetch the name attribute of tag

4549598
coffeescript	haml
i feel quite excited about haml and coffeescript and am working on tutorial showing how to use them in non-rails environment

4549598
coffeescript	haml
and what is great there exist a project one of many forks aimed at providing custom filter that converts coffeescript into js inside of haml files

4549648
hash	md5
if you just need to check if the e-mail is in the system you should probably store a hash of some sort md5 or sha both of which mysql supports natively instead of the actual e-mail address

4549655
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
you can hash the values using md5 and a salt - a salt is just some extra stuff in this case a string to add a little more randomness to the results

4549655
hash	salt
then if you want to see if an email address already exists - take the one provided add the salt do the hash check if that value is in the db

4549655
hash	salt
if they do that they can see your hash function and salt

4549659
width	height
upon the viewdidrotate event you will have to adjust the table views width and height now uitableviewcontroller did that job for you before

4549668
multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	division	division	multiplication
update also for those wondering why i chose to multiplying by 0.5f rather than divide by 2 the arm processor doesn t support division in hardware so there is a minuscule performance bump by going with multiplication

4549710
google-chrome	firefox
this ide comes with an ie control webbrowser but the content that i want to display is broken on that browser xhtml+css also i want to remove the dependency of an external ie dll so the only solution that comes to my mind is use an engine of other browser like firefox or google-chrome

4549724
versioning	upgrade
i have an iphone app that i ve been working on and have recently upgrade my versioning of xcode

4549764
packets	multicast
there are other alternatives such as udp or even udp multicast but these usually end up being a lot more complicated because udp doesn t guarantee that packets always arrive at the destination and they may even be duplicated or out of order

4549815
getter	setter
i m building a generic ui that can hook into a range of underlying object properties so i d like to call the getter and setter by name

4549817
hide	show
i am trying to hide or show a certain section of my table depending on the value of a property in my binding object s

4549830
width	height
something in there might stick out like an element with 0 width height or completely missing data

4549845
post	get
that form secifies that the data is passed via post and not get as you are trying to pass it

4549845
post	get
if a form wants data back specifically as post data that page will ignore get data

4549857
post	get
you are confusing get and post in php

4549863
javassist	cglib
this solution isn t easy either but it could work using javassist or cglib you can insert code at the beginning of each internal method the ones presumably being called by the main run method to check if the thread is alive or some other flag if it s some other flag you ll have to add it as well along with a method to set it

4549863
javassist	cglib
i m proposing javassist cglib instead of extending the class through code because you mention it s external and you don t want to change the source code and it may change in the future

for example the div containing the text could be 80 of the window width and 80 of its height

4551975
width	margin
this should cause the margin around the box and the dimensions to be proportional to the window width

4551975

this might be a bit easier but i think you will still need to use the percentage-based width and height attributes and auto margin to center it nicely

when you increase the number of tcp connections or data over tcp on a connection that s lossy enough you ll end up increasing your udp packet loss as your tcp connections will end up re-sending their data more and more and or reducing their window causing your 10 packet loss to actually be more like 90 udp packet loss now

udp	tcp
those are interdependent testing 10 udp loss and 10 tcp loss is no different than the above

superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
i have been asked to identify any methods that overload or override any other methods as far as i understand overloading occurs when a class has more than one method with the same name but with different signatures the type number or order of their formal arguments must differ and a method definition in a subclassing overrides an inherited method from a superclass or one of its ancestral classes if the signature of the method in the subclassing exactly matches the signature of an inherited method and they have the same return type

plural	inflection
look into how cakephp or rails handle inflection for a more thorough discussion of the concept including how to handle edge cases - you don t want to inflect deer as deers in the plural for example or goose as gooses so they need to be handled individually just like your own edge cases like universe or aspirated non-aspirated h s

stdout	stderr
it just happens that both stdout and stderr are typically mapped to the same output stream usually the console

4570427
stdout	stderr
if you redirect stdout to a file for example you will find that stderr remains directed to the console

4570435
width	height
you can play around with text fontfamily emsize width and height until you get the result you require

4570441
width	height
interestingly you never check to see if the drop is out of the screen interms of it s x co-ordinate you check the height but not the width you could save yourself some calculations and rendering time if you did this check as well

4570457
serializable	deserialization
least amount of serializable deserialization

4570496
client-side	server-side
it can t be done from the server-side in the c# code but rather must be done on the client-side in javascript

4570530
maven	pom.xml
my error was that my maven pom.xml file was being overridden by another pom.xml file which was importing an older version of the library

4570531
min	max
note that as long as the order by clause is deterministic then the max min in t important but is needed because that is the way the function is constructed

4570553
google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox but not in google-chrome changing the css property background-image via jquery

4570554
width	height
you can use winfo_width and winfo_height to get the width and height of the window

4570565
outputstream	inputstream
i am not familiar with .dd as a file type but once you have the stream of data you can then use other inputstream or outputstream subclasses to manipulate it such as fileoutputstream to write the data to a file

4570583
accessor	properties
in addition to that 1 that forces me to specify names twice i already did so in the properties accessor names and in a manner that is invisible to refactoring tools 2 it is wrong -- the quotes aren t part of the name 3 it forces me to fix quoting at pojo level when it is actually a specific trait of the database system i am using

4570631
gif	png
draw a png jpeg or gif on your

4570671

4570954
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox and opera can handle it correctly whereas google-chrome and safari throw a console error saying inref is undefined

4570955
getter	setter	accessor	properties
the only way a function call could be triggered by your assigning to the id properties of x would be if you were using a browser that supported properties accessor getter and setter which is very unlikely and there s nothing in your code doing so

4570955
setinterval	settimeout
as jonathon pointed out in his comment on the question this could be something you ve set up with settimeout or setinterval or in an even handler on mouse move for instance etc. but it s nothing in the quoted code

4571051
interpolation	splines
bicubic splines interpolation

4571130
width	height
you will have to set the width and height properties of the div otherwise the div is basically invisible since it has no content

4571130
width	height
set width height to the dimension of the background image

4571134
width	height
if you want the div to display when it is empty you have to specify a width and height for it in the css

4571137
width	height
you specify width and or height in the css too

4571189
min	max
take the min and max values and just split the difference

vsto	add-in
ms vsto makes it look as though writing an office add-in is a piece of cake.

4571312
16-bit	64bit
16-bit arithmetic is generally believed to be inefficient on 64bit computers and 32-bit arithmetic should perform faster or just as fast as 64bit arithmetic but like i said your mileage may vary especially with future cpus

4571323
serializable	deserialization
i suggest that you design a object model which will cater for this structure and logic and use the xml serializable deserialization to persist or hydrate

4571436
int	double
so instead of generating struct_int_double you might generate sid struct int double or si32f64 struct 32-bit int 64-bit float or whatever

4571437
hide	show
you can show a loader image by putting it somewhere im tag and use below js code to hide it later on when all images are show

4571490
put	get
it certainly put the .class on to the filename but gave me phpclass.class in the file name field on the new php class dialog file|new file...|etc. or any of the number of other ways to get to a new file dialog

4571496

pclxform converts it into any raster format tiff jpg pdf bmp etc. however we can also extract the text during the conversion and we can extract individual raster objects from the pcl for re-arrangement in the downstream application

4571622
filesystems	ntfs
junctions and reparse points are key concepts that i needed to consider and are the most confusing thing in the ntfs filesystems

4571736
folder	directory
for example if you are using visual studio then it won t be in the debug or release folder but will show up one level up since that is what the working directory will be by default

4571779
put	get
i have put this in routes.py but i get an invalid request

4571783
post	get
i am not doing a post i am doing a get by going directly to the url with params

4571793
mp3	ogg
it was because of the conversion of the files from mp3 to ogg

4571793
mp3	ogg
mp3 files were of higher bitrate and when converted to ogg ended up in the loss of quality which resulted in the noise

4571813

x86	64bit
for example 64bit integer divide is part of libgcc on x86 _32 â â the infamous __udivdi3

4571927
submit	submission
you could move the add form outside of the parent form and hide it using css then as another poster said replace the submit button for the add form with a button with a correct id and finally hook into both onkeypress on the input and onclick on the button to simulate a submission of the actual add form

4572007
translation	transliteration
text unidecode translation budä jovickã½ budvar into budejovicky budvar - which didn t seem to me a particularly impressive attempt at a phonetic transliteration but then i don t speak czech

4572018
sudoers	visudo
access your sudoers file by using the command visudo

4572053
hash	salt
i would never ever use just a hash against a string without a salt added to it

4572088
mouseover	mouseout
you ll have to disable the mouseover and mouseout events to see the effects of the click event handler properly

4572088
mouseover	mouseout
uses a flag to enable continuous scrolling on when the link s mouseover event handler is called and disable scrolling when the link s mouseout event handler

4572125
google-chrome	safari
it works great in safari 5 and google-chrome 8 except that google-chrome completely ignores the preload attribute and starts loading not playing the file after page load

4572125
google-chrome	safari
is there a way to make google-chrome behave like safari 5 ie

4572179
setinterval	settimeout
the setinterval method will run a function every x milliseconds unlike settimeout which only runs it once

4572179
setinterval	settimeout
you should never pass a string to setinterval or settimeout

4572186
versioning	upgrade
in the most recent 2.0.1 snapshot releases there are some further fixes to issues arising in upgrade from older versioning

4572212
int	double
i hoped that the implicit operator would have ensured that the double be converted to class a or the int to class b and the error avoided

4572248
implements	extends
upd the idea is that i don t want any explicit implements or extends classes

4572252
rss	feed
i m writing an test app that retrieves data from several outside sources think twitter rss feed etc. and under certain circumstances it stores that data in a db or presents it to the user

4572276
public	protected
however you could accomplish this by mapping the integer value for the enums as a protected field in the base class and use public properties in the extended classes to cast to and from the appropriate enum

4572302
rss	feed
i want to create a rss feed for a windows network folder something like acme test

4572345

4572430
folder	directory
netbeans creates resource files in the src directory by default default package so i added the src folder in step 5 above

4572462
traceback	attributeerror
the traceback should alert you to the attribute access that raised the attributeerror exception

4572464
inherited	properties
another interesting thing to note the current version of odata wcf data services does not support querying on properties of inherited classes so i had to move the start end date properties up to the base class in order to be able to restrict my search on them

4572496
button	checkbox
if i have a set of checkbox or radio button they might fit well if i stack them vertically when the user holds the phone in a vertical orientation

4572497
multiplying	subtract
if you look at the left child subtract multiplying 4 etc you see it is also a tree

4572497
multiplying	add
and so is the left half of that multiplying 2 add etc

4572506
width	height
upper bounds - the worst case is that each rectangle must be packed on a separate row so for each input rectangle calculate min width height and sum those pretend input rectangles are stacked upon one another using the minimum width or height of each input such that the other dimension of the input does not exceed the width of the enclosing rectangle

4572533
voip	sip
i have developed a voip application that uses pjsip to communicate over sip channel

4572549
visualvm	jhat
and you can analyse the heap dumps using a variety of programs such as jhat or visualvm both of which come with the jdk

4572554
glut	fltk
fltk provides modern gui functionality without the bloat and supports 3d graphics via openglâ and its built-in glut emulation

4572561
getter	setter
this way you can use self.myarray as both the setter and getter while retaining the variable

4572566
visualvm	jhat
then you can use some heap dump reader and analyze the results visualvm or jhat for example

4572568
explode	substr
if you only want to split by the first space and therefore into 2 substr pass a limit of 2 to explode like so

rss	feed
i have a simple question regarding rss feed and xml

4572619
rss	feed
i have quite a bit of experience with xml but no experience parsing rss feed

4572624
rss	feed
in some browsers when you try to view an rss feed it only shows the text

4572674
min	max
i can live with some fairly basic features drag and drop to configure dimensions sort by a column allow totals min max for a column and optionally expand collapse or drill down to sub-categories

4572677
integer	fractions
ieee 754 recommends the round half to even approach if the fractions part of d is 0.5 then round to the nearest even integer

4572677
integer	fractions
so you have to round a fractions 0.5 up half the time and down half the time hence the round to the nearest even integer bit rounding to the nearest odd would also work as would flipping a fair coin to determine which way to go

4572685
yourkit	jprofiler
jprofiler and yourkit are non-free and more useful

4572733
post	put
i put together a blog post about some interesting things you can do with css3 gradients

4572872
requestfactory	gwt
either use the new gwt 2.1 requestfactory entitypro xy approach or

4572875
min	max
by the way you can make your code a little simpler and easier to read by using min and max functions

4572922
google-chrome	firefox
it happens in google-chrome 8.0.552.224 firefox 3.6.12 ie 8.0.7600.16385

4572934
mvp	presenter
i think the main point of gwt mvp is that presenter activities in 2.1 do not depend on view implementation so that you can easily swap in mock views for easy testing

4572962
post	get
except for firefox which according to my server logs tries to do both the get and the post leaving me with a page that s rather confused

4572993
integer	unsigned
the 1.8 documentation says that u is for a 32-bit unsigned integer and you re seeing it on a 64-bit unsigned integer so that behavior is off

4573005
put	get
you can also skip linking just get glew.c and put it in include not include gl like glew.h and then change your

i have some initialisation code in the viewdidload and viewwillappear methods that is used across a number of my uiviewcontroller subclasses which implement uitableviewdatasource uitableviewdelegate

4573186
disk	ram
the chat messages won t be saved on disk nor in mysql but in ram as an array or object for best speed

4573199
uilabel	uibutton
uitableviewcell uilabel and uibutton are all subclasses of uiview and the documentation for uiview says

4573199
width	height
for example if you resize a button based on the the text of the titlelabel you ll probably want to pad some to the width and height otherwise the button will be the size of the label and will look odd

4573246
didreceivememorywarning	dealloc
this way the standard methods i nitwithnibname -viewdidload shouldautorotateinterfaceorientation didreceivememorywarning -viewdidunload and dealloc as provided by xcode would be the only methods defined in your viewcontroller.m file

4573261
cvs	svn
from the bash prompt should work whether xxx is cvs svn or git

4573277
mouse	keyboard
therefore when activity occurs in your application mouse movements and maybe keyboard presses your application is given more processor time

4573305
put	get	post	get	post	put
and some of them suggest using all types of http requests like put delete post get

4573305
post	get
but wouldn t it be easier to just accept json object through regular post or get that would contain method name and all parameters and then respond in json as well

4573305
xml-rpc	json-rpc
ok - after digging through various api s and learning a lot about xml-rpc json-rpc soap rest i came to a conclusion that this type of api is sound

4573320
put	get
whenever possible you should use idempotent methods such as get head put and delete which can t have side effects and are therefore less error prone easier to control

4573345
free	malloc
if your user has a different compiler then you can t free the string even if they did use malloc

4573372
width	height
note you have to give floated items a width and height

4573402
google-chrome	firefox
you can use firefox firebug google-chrome and ie8 dev tool to find out whether the file is downloaded and the plugin is available in the client

4573406
installation	upgrade
another option would be to have an upgrade routine that during installation copies their old document replaces it with the new and then traverses the old copy for new sheets and what not to bring over

4573426
put	get	post	get	post	put
http uses get put post and delete for the requests

4573426
put	get
get put and delete are idempotent

4573432
inherited	properties
however they donâ t share the same namespace as declared properties which means that a class can declare a properties named somedata or inherited it from one of its superclasses have the backing instance variable with some other name and the implementation of a method of that class can also have a parameter local variable named somedata â the compiler wonâ t give a warning in that case

4573576

google-chrome	firefox
i can t get rid of this error message in google-chrome 9.0 beta google-chrome 8.0 or firefox 3.6.13

4573792
versioning	upgrade
note that the signature of _print is exactly that of the print function in more recent versioning of python so as soon as you upgrade you can just change it to use print

4573914
jboss	glassfish
older java ee implementations jboss 5.1 glassfish 2 websphere used their own naming pattern

4574101
put	get
the only problem i have now when i put my derived jpanel class onto the cardlayout using the choose bean function from netbeans netbeans always sets a new layout for the panel so my original layout from the jpanel class gets overridden and all i get is a blank jpanel

4574107
codeigniter	kohana
one downside of codeigniter is that it is built for php4 compatibility and so does suffer in a number of structural ways when you come to push the framework kohana is a fork that addresses this issue

4574126
decoder	encoder
this assumed you have flv decoder filter and h.264 encoder filers installed as mft or dmo

4574238
glfw	sdl
another is that other wrappers glfw sdl are not only under active development but generally more powerful

4574238
glfw	sdl
i mean it works and it is certainly possible to use it but both glfw and sdl want you to write the main loop of your program yourself sdl also has platform-independent yet explicit message handling which at least in my opinion results in much more clear and flexible code

4574256
jar	war
i am looking for a tool where i can search several jar war .

4574306
jar	war
i don t know about a standalone tool but if you create a simple java project in eclipse and add the jar war etc files to that you can use the java search search dialog in eclipse

pull	push
with a plugin like hg-git you can at least push to and pull from a git server repository from mercurial allowing you to pull from the github repo to your local mercurial repo

4574375
pull	push
that makes senses if both repos have been developed separately you cannot push pull 2 mercurial repos one into another

4574376
google-chrome	safari
p.s - i am using a mac so theres no ie for testing yet this looks good in safari and google-chrome

4574387

watch the focus and blur of the comment box and change the css class of another element to show and hide it

4574454
sdl	freeglut	glut	sdl
i find freeglut better then glut different license and provides better flexibility but it should be fairly easy to switch from glut to qt or sdl

4574479
getter	setter
the thing is that also from what i have seen and it seems logical is that using private fields but using getter and setter to access them is also not good as it defeats the point of using private fields in the first place

4574479
getter	setter
or do i really have to use private fields with getter and setter

4574479
getter	setter
conclusion getter and setter are fine as long as they are used smartly and only used when needed

4574486
post	get
i decided to point every form tag s onsubmit event to a js function to post stuff using ajax and to get results and i got to know this is not possible with asp.net as every time where is a button click there will be post back so it s hard to let page know what button was clicked

4574488
getter	setter
private fields and setter and getter is indeed your best way to go

4574488
getter	setter
all in all go with setter and getter it s just good practice even if you find options

4574494
rss	feed
i am parsing a rss feed using php but the problem is that is has some names like

4574495
sysml	uml
i suggest you to use topcased for modeling it is based on emf and provides you a good ide for uml sysml modeling

4574507
getter	setter
in java using private fields with getter setter is the recommend practice provided external clients of your class really need access to those fields

4574507
getter	setter
otherwise keep them as private fields and simply don t provide a getter setter

4574507
getter	setter
there is something called the javabeans specification that requires you to use getter setter

4574512
getter	setter
it s common to use getter and setter instead of giving other objects permission to change your fields directly

4574512
getter	setter
that might not make any sense when you see that 99.99 of your getter and setter don t do anything except what you could have done with direct access to the fields

4574514
getter	setter
getter and setter are part of the public interface of your class

4574514
getter	setter
when you define getter and setter you should be committed to maintain them in future versions

4574515
internationalization	translation
to translation taxonomy terms you should use the taxonomy translation module part of the internationalization package

4574523
getter	setter
if you have a private field with a method get and a method set that don t do anything other than retrieve and assign the value you should just make the field public as the field isn t really private and the getter and setter only hurt performance

4574523
getter	setter
if the getter and setter check the value being set or if the value is allowed to retrieve then go ahead and use getter and setter

4574523
getter	setter
this would be a good use of getter and setter

4574523
getter	setter
use getter and setter when doing anything other than retrieving or assigning a value

4574529
getter	setter
an advantage of using getter and especially setter is that it is much easier to debug write access to the fields

4574531
getter	setter
which also means this -- when you make a field private that does not automatically mean that you should make getter and setter for the field

4574531
getter	setter
private fields does not necessitate getter and setter

4574531
getter	setter
getter and setter are usually a way to directly affect a field that an object has maybe with some validation to prevent bad input from making your object have a state that it shouldn t but there are going to be times where the object itself should be in charge of affecting the data rather than an outside entity

4574549
rspec	capybara
i use rails 3 capybara 0.4.0 akephalos selenium-webdriver and rspec 2

4574553
getter	setter
the thing is that also from what i have seen and it seems logical is that using private fields but using getter and setter to access them is also not good as it defeats the point of using private fields in the first place

4574553
getter	setter
the main problem is that many developers automatically generate getter and setter for all private fields

4574553
getter	setter
but you should hardly ever exception value objects assume that all private fields will have getter and setter and let your ide generate them all

4574566
width	height
this is not a google maps related issue the thing is you need to set a specific width and height for your map canvas your code could be rewritten like

4574568
scheme	common-lisp	lisp	scheme
common-lisp and scheme are both dialects of lisp

4574605
ubuntu	linux
i wrote a simple python script using the socketserver it works well on windows but when i execute it on a remote linux machine ubuntu it doesn t work at all.

4574678
udp	tcp
for udp and new tcp connections there can be data loss

4574688
subtract	add
to rotate about a point you can subtract the pivot point before rotating it and add them after the rotation again so the rotation is virtually around 0 0

4574694
onkeydown	onfocus
you wouldn t be looking for the onfocus event though you would be looking for the onkeydown or similar event on the select box which could look something like this

4574708
button	checkbox
2 right mouse click on the friday jtextfield drop down a menu with either button or checkbox that let me choose then close the menu and get the value

4574715
width	height
an image has a certain width and height in pixels

4574717
prepare	execute
the os doesn t know how long the new process will be aware so it must prepare itself as if the entire process will be long lived thus it sets up the virtual clone of all 240gb before obliterating it with the execute call

4574724
curb	libcurl
you need to install libcurl not for curb gem but for taf2-curb gem just looking carefull in error log

4574741
jedit	scite
jedit and scite you may like it

4574759
pthreads	fork	waitpid	fork
if you are working with pthreads compliant systems of which macos and unix generally are use fork execv and waitpid instead of system .an example can be found here

4574800
post	get
the new action expects a get request but the create action expects a post request

4574865
pylons	pyramid
choose any wsgi-compatible framework like already mentioned pyramid django or pylons to name a few and you will have plenty of deployment possibilities

4574883
post	get
for example when you post and you get to the next page and go back you will get all given information in the fields before you post it

4574912
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox 3 and google-chrome 8.0 the following works as expected

4574914
min	max
loop min max func

4574914
min	max	range	max	range	min
this loop should perform the func between the range min and max integers

4574967
sudo	passwd
alternatively you can override the error by prefixing the last command with sudo and entering your admin passwd

4574968
srp	principles
one might also consider that dry can violate the single responsibility principles srp

4574990
min	max
what you want this to do is to execute fn min and then loop + min 1 max fn afterwards

4574990
min	max
what it actually does do is it executes fn min then loop + min 1 max fn and then it tries to apply the result of fn min to the result of loop + min 1 max fn

4574990
min	max
to get what you want do begin fn min loop + min 1 max fn

4575012
folder	directory
often there is an asset folder within the root directory with an image js and css folder within it

4575043
superclass	subclassing
but i am unable to obtain subclassing harddrive.cs methods only the superclass abstract deviceinfo methods such as .named

4575065
post	get
to make it simple for them i thought it will be better if they just send a mail to post mydomain.com and that will get posted to their respective web pages created by me

4575097
post	get
i am working with wordpress and trying to get the information from all the post created the current day

4575097
post	get
i know that there is data there because when i do a print_r on the post array i get the following

4575126
put	get	post	get	post	put
but i still don t understand why we need to utilize different http requests delete put post get in order to build nice api

4575128
content-disposition	content-type
the content-disposition header appears to be right however the correct mime-type content-type for text files is text plain

4575209
integer	unsigned
i think your problem may be that standard c will compare a signed integer and an unsigned integer by promoting -1 to an unsigned quantity value preserving instead of sign preserving which in turn means that x is never greater than the converted -1 and the comparison is always false

4575231
free	malloc
if c++ didn t have malloc free you couldn t compile existing c code as c++ because you d have to pay some poor shmuck to go through and find all the malloc calls and replace them which is expensive

4575246
put	get
hope this helps its should also get rid of the cannot modify header info if you put it before the doctype and html tags

4575257
put	get
in sql server management studio put both queries in the same query window and get the query plan for both at once

4575265
free	malloc
it would be silly to exclude part of the library like malloc and free just because there are more idiomatic c++ alternatives if you want to do stupid things c++ gives you the power to do so

4575270
width	height
i need to fit the window s width and height to its content

4575318
post	get
if you do then every textual data send to server via get or post gets escaped with slashes

4575356
updatepanel	scriptmanager
the scriptmanager and updatepanel controls will make you task easy and fast to convert to and ajax enabled website

4575420
put	get
however you can still get the behavior you want inside the column by putting a framelayout into the column which stretches the width of the column and then put your button inside there

4575477
hash	salt
take a salt hash and forget the plain text password immediately

4575496
decoder	encoder
you have an encoder and a decoder for bmp

4575498
put	get
for example if you have domain objects which you want to transport then these can be retrieved via a get updated via put all through a standard url

4575553
getter	setter
but if you can t come up with any better names than getfoo and setfoo for the methods it s a good clue that your getter and setter are probably worthless

4575558
nemerle	boo
i read somewhere that nemerle s macro service is more powerful than boo s

4575560
udp	tcp
usually one packet per second is sent to ping a remote machine and the route may differ from the tcp and udp usually used for data transfers

4575578
button	checkbox
a button is selected when it has a checkbox radio icon

4575585
pop-up	dialog
among other things my app displays photos in an imageview in a pop-up dialog

4575593
sorting	filtering
firstly memory tables can t don t use b-tree indexes hash indexes only so queries which could otherwise use an index for ordering or ranging operations resort to sorting filtering manually exhaustively

4575596
post	get
i know how to redirect with redirect function on other asp.net page and read parameters from url from request but i don t want get i need post i am sending ids over url so user doesn t need to see that

4575602
iboutlet	ibaction
go ahead and create an iboutlet property in your view controller for the segmented control and then hook it up to the control you create in interface builder may as well create an ibaction method as well for responding to changes in the control

4575616
prepare	execute
you established the connection and prepare the query but you didn t actually execute it

4575632
post	get
a redirect by definition is a get you can t do a 301 or 302 redirect with a post

4575648
post	get
your php script will send mail in some way and likely expect a few parameters sent through an http request using either a post or get method

4575650
google-chrome	firefox
it works on godaddy and fails on both ipage and startlogic on my network at work using firefox ie and google-chrome

4575652
int	double
if you use double then the mantissa is easily large enough for a 32-bit int and an expression like i double int_max should be sufficient obviously allow for unsignedness if you need to

4575663
for-loop	loops
when x 1 it breaks out of loops and doesn t get included in the contents of the for-loop

4575674
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
however in this case all browsers print the same page ie google-chrome opera safari and firefox displays it in another way

4575705
ubuntu	linux
i am not seasoned with vmware or linux so i may be missing something obvious here -- it seems like somewhere along the way either ubuntu or the vm has a networking issue

4575709
apache	nginx
please comment on apache if you think nginx etc

4575874
vbo	normals
then set vertex normals and texcoord pointers - they point at the beginning of vbo plus their offsets in vertex structure

4575874
vbo	normals
one suspicious place is setting vertex normals texcoord pointers - they get set only once - and set to the beginning of the vbo

4575875
apache	nginx
personally my preferred setup is still nginx - apache - mod_wsgi with multiple apache servers for heavy sites

4575879
bresenham	dda
using either digital differential analizer dda or the bresenham algorithm will yield the same results you see for gdi+ but if you look at the standard gdi line drawing implementation you will notice that the standard gdi lineto implementation actually draws the line one pixel shorter than what you specify to quote the msdn

4575956
pop-up	dialog
if the server returns a url or something distinguishable from no messages then you ll get the pop-up and if they hit ok are sent to the url using a basic confirm dialog in javascript

4575965
hide	show
possible option to deal with it - hide elements before they are pimped out with jquery ui and show them with js after load

4576019
mouse	keyboard
it would be also great to be able to handle simple keyboard mouse events for this program but it isn t my primary target here maybe some other third party libraries will help with it

4576033
post	get
hmm thanks but i want to get the total number of all post but only one post of each category also the categories are fully trimmed

4576044
allegro	sdl
i recommend sdl small probably exactly what you need allegro similar or qt largeish

4576059
glut	glfw
i suggest you to try opengl coupled with either glfw or glut

4576059
glut	glfw
personnal note go for glfw because glut isn t maintained anymore i think.

4576091
width	height
i want it transparent and width 60px and height 40px

4576102
cakephp	kohana
if you think you need a less complicated framework i suggest toro it has nothing to do with frameworks such as kohana or cakephp

4576115
dictionary	map
let s say i have a list a in python whose entries conveniently map to a dictionary

4576118
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i add the uitabbarcontroller like this as subview to my uiviewcontroller view

4576122
nemerle	boo
adding caas to a language like c# or even macros to boo is not nearly enough to reach nemerle s level of metaprogramming for which the language has been designed from the start

4576122
nemerle	boo
boo primarily integrates with sharpdevelop while nemerle has visual studio 2008 integration

4576123
maven	pom.xml
i am guessing maven is trying to install the artifact proivded in the parent pom.xml

4576125
post	get
it seems that every get or post is causing the debugger to stop there and i have to push continue multiple times to get the site to show anything

4576148
organization	naming
organization of naming namespaces folders assemblies database s

4576176
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
uitabbarcontroller should never be embedded in a uiviewcontroller because as it descends from uiviewcontroller it already is one

4576176
uitabbarcontroller	uiwindow
make the uitabbarcontroller s view the subview of your uiwindow in the app delegate

4576221
folder	directory
i deleted the web applications obj directory and bin folder and rebuild but it still occurs

4576227
fileoutputstream	filechannel
java nio filechannel versus fileoutputstream performance usefulness

4576267
dxcore	coderush
check out coderush xpress and dxcore from devexpress they are both free and dxcore gives you some easy ways of hooking into things like that

4576278
viewdidload	viewdidappear
put the same code inside viewdidappear and not viewdidload since the view cannot be initialized yet

4576304
pascal	delphi
delphi is from mid nineties so that probably means delphi s ancestor turbo pascal not delphi

4576350
google-chrome	firefox
go into portable firefox s view menu and turn off all of the google-chrome - the navbar bookmark bar status bar etc

4576356
getter	setter
if it is a custom getter you want then you might look into using getter and setter in javascript - they are not supported by ecmascript prior to es5 but many engines support them nonetheless

4576421
width	height
if you remove width 350 from the textblock then the canvas and the rectangle will have 0 height and width on the stack panel

4576421
width	height
you need to set the height and width properties of the textblock manually since the other two elements depend on it

4576477
actualheight	actualwidth
the changes were in onvisualchanged i added an eventhandler for layoutupdated and changed rendersize to actualwidth actualheight

4576495
int	chars
index arrays such as your that you d have to cast from chars to int smell of a weak type design

4576521
slideup	slidedown
i have a simple question about jquery slidedown slideup

4576536
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
runtimeexception are known as unchecked-exception meaning you don t have to check for them occurring by way of a try catch

4576560
move	drag
i am using the drag gesture to move elements on a canvas

4576565
children	parent
the problem is however that in ie not 9 the white spaces isn t part of the children list of the parent node rendering the method useless in ie

4576619
debian	linux
another possibility although probably more complicated is to install a full-blown linux distribution on your phone for example debian which has everything you d need to install a compiler -- there is a guide on how to do that here and you can search for more on google

4576654
free	malloc
malloc and free are required so that you can call into c language libraries from c++ code

4576654
free	malloc
the c language library might return a pointer to memory allocated with malloc that must be free by the caller with free

4576654
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
or less commonly it might require a pointer to memory allocated with malloc that it can internally reallocate with realloc or free with free

4576657
hash	md5
you could also store passwords in a stronger hash encryption hash instead of md5

4576661
hash	md5
you appear to be storing passwords hash - good - though using md5 not so good arguably but with no salting of any kind - this means that if someone s gotten hold of your password hash then they could use rainbow tables brute force to try to crack passwords

4576661
salt	md5
i d recommend having a read of which will explain why a per-user salt will help and the real reason md5 is probably not the best choice for a password hashing function any more

4576681
codeigniter	cakephp
you need to compare php and ruby or compare codeigniter cakephp etc php frameworks to rails

4576736
quicksort	mergesort
if you are counting duplicates then do a quicksort or a mergesort first that would then make your comparison operation an o n operation

4576750
hide	show
i assume you are currently using jquery s show and hide methods to work with the those divs

4576750
fadein	fadeout
instead jquery has a fadein and a fadeout function which do exactly as they sound you can find the docs for fadein here

4576837
wordpress	joomla
hi i am using joomla and wordpress both and i use a single sign-on plugin which is joomla based

4576837
wordpress	joomla
what i mean is when a user logs into joomla he automatically gets logged into wordpress and similarly when a user registers into joomla his details are automatically replicated into wordpress

4576837
wordpress	joomla
so i wanted to know is there a way to display the joomla login module in the wordpress pages so that when a user logs in from a wordpress page he gets his credentials checked from the joomla database and the rest is handled by my joomla single-signon plugin

4576854
equals	gethashcode
the items are required to have a valid equals and gethashcode implementation

4576865
put	get
i was thinking if i put them into ints that would get rid of the decimal but it did not look right as the decimals were just dropping off

4576870
ceil	math.h
use math.h function ceil number

4576898
getter	setter
entity objects shouldn t contain business logic so i think you d be okay having a service class use the xmlreader to perform operations on the data and then use the getter setter to manipulate the data in the object

4576928
hash	salt
hash hash vs salt hash

4576940
folder	directory
was i supposed to create some sort of file within the new directory or folder i created called mydb

4576955
width	height
i think the ie5 box model is more similar to human s logic about box s concept withing including padding and border.it can defined the box width and height directly

4576970
awt	swing
it is similar to the graphics class in awt swing if you are familiar with that

4576973
r-tree	quadtree
depending on the data type and usage pattern either an r-tree or variant r r+ or a quadtree or perhaps even a kd-tree

4576993
ant	maven
if you re using ant the best way to use maven repositories to download jar dependencies is to use ivy with ant

4576993
nexus	artifactory
it works with nexus and artifactory if you use those as your local maven repositories

4577004
folder	directory
however i have multiple applications which all use some common assemblies and my goal is to relocate these particular assemblies to the common files folder in the program files directory

4577057
innodb	myisam
i ve read various threads about which is better between innodb and myisam

4577057
innodb	myisam
therefore certain tables which are often read can be set to myisam but tables that need transaction support can use innodb

4577122
children	parent
.htaccess files are hierarchical in scope any such files in parent directories apply to their children

4577138
submit	submission
what this does is never submit directly but if the check is ok calls the native submit method submission the form and not running this handler again

4577139
innodb	myisam
you don t choose innodb or myisam on a database level but instead on a table level

4577139
innodb	myisam
so within the one database you could have some tables running the innodb engine and some running myisam

4577139
innodb	myisam
as you pointed out you could choose to use innodb on the tables that require transactions etc and myisam where you need other features such as fulltext searching

4577167
nscoding	nsmutablecopying
here is the .h file--- it cut off nscoding and nsmutablecopying protocals and my imports but they are there

4577179
ready	each
then using that stored data we can attach a single handler to the #mail-in-inbox container one time on dom ready rather than one to each each time this function runs it should look like this

4577202
superclass	subclassing
it does refer to the correct class it s just that unless redeclared or otherwise the reference set is broken static properties in subclassing are in the same reference set as in the superclass

4577225
calloc	malloc
use calloc instead of malloc to initialize the contents of buffer to 0

4577241
innodb	myisam
you can have both myisam and innodb tables in the same database

4577241
innodb	myisam
innodb can be slower at searches because it doesn t offer full text search like myisam but that isn t a big problem when you compare it to table-level locking of myisam

4577251
ubuntu	debian
now to wait for debian and ubuntu to upgrade.

4577283
move	drag
and then you can handle this manually when the user clicks the label a popup menu will open and when the user drag the label the window will move

4577306
versioning	upgrade
it looks like the latest versioning of monotouch i had to upgrade to ios 4.2 first to get it now implements a strongly typed delegate for handleevent and a new nsstreamevent type so it can be more easily handled

4577373
submit	submission
if it really submit the form then you ll want to handle this server-side because submission the form will tear down the current page and replace it with what you return from the form submission

4577385
mouse	keyboard
with no keyboard or mouse and the front panel switches disabled she is enough of a luddite that i don t think that she will think of pulling the cord out of the wall socket

4577394
hash	salt
you should either take care to avoid the hash extension issue or include a salt value into the data to be hash either by communicating the salt across the link or having differing vales for each code path

4577398
public	protected
the naming guidelines for fields apply to static public and protected fields

4577398
public	protected
you should not define public or protected instance fields

4577411
kde	gnome
for example a scheduler might be 2000 lines of code but linux is about 50 million lines of code and if you add stuff like apache x gnome kde mozilla etc on top of that then you can imagine how much potential for gritty work might be involved in an entire os.

4577430
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i was prepared to file this as a bug but then i found that the behavior is identical on safari v5 google-chrome v8 and firefox v3.6 and v4.0b

4577446
integer	unsigned
use 0xc0000000u for an unsigned integer variable

4577450
post	put
in this example something triggers the get_items javascript function which fires off the ajax call a post request to ajax-handler.php with parameters get-store-updates true which satisfy the if isset _post get-store-updates i put in the php

4577453
ubuntu	linux
i am attempting to build fastcgi on a linux ubuntu 10.x machine

4577460
boost	stl
of stl and boost into that layer

4577464
int	double
the group key in the pattern should match the data followed by an int value and the if there exist a comma then the next string i.e a double value

4577469
post	get
the request is the same except after the blank line that terminates the get is the post data

4577476
dictionary	map
the map can keep track of which chunks are loaded using a dictionary

4577517
pop-up	dialog
15+ jquery pop-up modal dialog plugins and tutorials

4577530
children	parent
goldberg s low-level operators alter how children are formed from the parent and the high-level operators are modifying how selection chooses the parent

4577542
bluetooth	usb
i don t think you need to worry about the specifics of usb bluetooth more so it should be a process of connecting the scanner to your computer and then opening a serial stream which is exposed through usb bluetooth

4577542
bluetooth	usb
i suspect that all of the scanners are programmed via rs232 over some standard where that standard could be bluetooth or usb

4577546
width	height
setup open excel 2007 set the width of the first column to 15.0 110 px the height of the first row to 30.0 40 px split the widow pane in four at the first cell and save the file

4577546
width	height
when you open the file with the open xml sdk 2.0 productivity tool the column width is 15.7109375 and the height is 30 yet the xsplit value is 2040 and the ysplit value is 795

4577568
jqgrid	datatables
but if you are further interested you go deep into some other plugins like datatables or jqgrid which are quite good grid data frameworks using jquery

4577592
switching	screens
as soon as i touch the screens this will switching to 0

4577606
subset-sum	np-complete
i believe this problem by itself to be np-complete based on similaries to subset-sum problem

4577699
google-chrome	safari
en-us applewebkit 534.10 khtml like gecko google-chrome 8.0.552.224 safari 534.10 browser system.web.mobile.mobilecapabilities host 67.142.173.27

4577736
rss	feed
i am trying to build a rss feed parser using rssutil.jar

4577737
devise	cancan
hi i m wanting to do some functional testing of my rails 3 app that uses devise and cancan

4577758
photoshop	paint.net
with the release of the .net framework however the preferred development language is less of an issue and c# vb.net c++ cli and other .net languages may be used but few major consumer applications that i am aware of yet use .net and if you compare the performance of say the excellent but slow paint.net with photoshop elements for example you can probably see why

4577796
vb.net	vb6	vb6	vba
other business sectors prefer either the java environment or the microsoft programming world vb6 vba vb.net c#

4577814
pong	pacman
after implementing pacman and snake i m implementing the next very very classic game pong

4577815
hash	md5
if they don t remember their security passwords for example your server could store an md5 hash of their password to match up their mobile device with their record on your server so you can send them a key to reset the app

4577824
nginx	lighttpd	g-wan	lighttpd
even lighttpd or nginx with natively pre-compiled c++ is slower than g-wan s c scripts

4577838
boost	stl
i am aware of c++0x and boost libraries but for now i would prefer to stick to a stl approach

4577862
post	get
i assumed that a predefined set of form elements whose names are in process_form_field hash get translated into xml elements with the same name all stored flatly under a parent element and that your perl web framework has a method process_form_data which translates from form data query_string or post data into a hash mapping form s input element names to submitted values embperl has a built-in fdat hash that automatically achieves this

4577874
pull	push
this is extra annoying because if i later do a git push on master it says that non-fast-forward updates were rejected on the tracking branches since they weren t fast-forwarded on the initial git pull

4577885
toolchain	binutils	binutils	glibc
i would like to compile only the toolchain binutils + gcc + glibc for a specific target ar71xx and also the kernel

4577890
implements	extends
if you find a douglas-peucker algorithm implements in your language it might have some 2d vector math implements and you ll need to extends those to use 3 dimensions

4577894
jar	war
since tomcat 6.0 obviously comes with all of the tomcat 6.0 jar files it stands to reason that you won t have any conflicts if you just use a fresh tomcat 6.0 install and then move your war file applications to the new tomcat 6

4577899
vim	notepad++
use a decent text editor like notepad++ or vim

4582042
width	height
to get the height and width of the source you need to change you code to

4582042
width	height
imginput.width and imginput.height gives the height and width of the control

4582042
width	height
imginput.source.width and imginput.source.height gives the height and width of the source

webclient	webrequest
use webrequest instead of webclient

4582115
width	height
once you ve sent the wm_gettext message as i suggested above to get the text that is displayed on the control you can get the position of the mouse relative to the control using a combination of getcursorpos and windowfrompoint and check that against the width and height of the text string returned by gettextextentpoint32

4582151
komodo	aptana
from my part i have not used aptana and komodo edit

4582170
width	height
the xaml image will re-size depending on the width height of the bitmap itself and how much space is available

4582170
width	height
wpf uses a two pass layout system - in the first round each control is asked how much space it desires in the second each control is assigned a width height

4582170
width	height
before binding the bitmap and if none of the ancestors of your image control have a fixed maximum width you cannot retrieve the image height simply because there is none set yet

4582170
width	height
one approach would be setting the width height of the image based on an ancestor via binding again this would require some set width height on the container

4582170
width	height
also you want to choose your container carefully - a stackpanel will always grow with its children vertically if orientation is horizontal and vice versa unless you specify a fixed or maximum width height

4582246
put	get
you might as well just get rid of them and have the put and get methods as well as copy in the mapcopier class either take object or some suitable base interface such as iunknownfield

haskell	ocaml
the other way to do this and i m sorry about this is to use a real programming language like ocaml or haskell first then try to translate the nice clean code into c++

4582779
post	get
i don t see you mention a language you want to use in order to get those post but here are 2 simple examples of how to do it using

4582818
width	height
the top area should have a fixed height fill_parent width

4582818
width	height
the third below the second should have fixed height fill_parent width

4583422
put	get
in postgresql you will get an advantage if you put fixed-width columns first because that access path is specially optimized

4583438
post	get
another tip i will offer is that you will get better help sooner if you post an sscce

4583441
min	max
you could also compute the center of the points - run through all points get max min points in all directions as when computing boundingbox take the center of this and measure longest distance to your max min points as radius

4583509
versioning	upgrade
i m not sure if it s exactly your problem but in my case i wasn t able to upgrade django to 1.2.4 - i was always finishing with 1.2.3 versioning so i uninstalled django with

sorting and filtering is enabled

4583712
post	get
however the moment i do a post i get an authentication required dialog box that says enter a username and password for

put	get
for that you d be using node#childnodes for walking through the dom node#nodetype to know what kind of node you re dealing with node#nodevalue to get the text of a text node node#splittext on the text nodes to split them in two so you can move one of them into your span and node#appendchild to rehome the text node that you need to put in your span

4583845
aggregate-functions	sum
try this uses sum aggregate-functions

4583906
implements	extends
the most simplest and straightforward way i found of implements this without effecting jetspeed too much was to write a custom authenticationprovider extends the defaultauthenticationprovider class and overriding the login method

4583907
iprincipal	iidentity
it s possible to store data in session and to overwrite the iidentity and iprincipal with that data but this does means that the user identity will have some data for the events before session is available and different data for the events after session is available which may or may not be a problem

4583967
hash	md5
i need to encode md5 hash to base 64

4584240
cpu	affinity
setting cpu affinity for the producer and consumer threads had no effect except when restricting them to the same core

4584247

uitableview	uipickerview
i have seen this behavior a couple of times but not in a uitableview it was a uipickerview

4584338

4584369
put	get
it seems that if i do not put the sleep 100 milliseconds or use lower values like 20 or 50 i eventually get an exception that says the process cannot access the file because another process has locked a portion of the file

4584376
portrait	landscape
everytime i switch orientation in the emulator via ctrl+f11 and or num 7 it prints -1 which corresponds to screen_orientation_unspecified and it gets stuck in landscape doesn t switch back to portrait unless i relaunch the app

4585097
width	height
none of the divs should exceed the screens height or width

4585122
hash	md5
you should use md5 hash there is built in function in iphone

hash	md5
if the server db has the password in plain text he can also make md5 hash

4585296
put	get
i was planning on open sourcing the code put haven t had time to get it ready

4585405
width	height
the size is a complex datatype that requires two numbers width and height to be initialized

4585405
width	height
you need to seperate the width and height and store them in two seperate keys see my previous post

4585410
listview	gridview
you can however as adinia suggested achieve the same effect by using either a gridview or listview and rather than changing the number of columns instead change the content rendered in the cells

4585446
put	get
however i would get the error missing subscript the sizes of the arrays are different so i can t put the subscript in the array parameter

4585467

edit apparently jpegtran google it can do operations such as cropping without first decompressing the image as long as the image size follows certain constraints usually width and height a multiple of 16 pixels

4585470
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
note cs means case-sensitive ci - case-insensitive

4585492
submit	submission
you would need some mechanism to tie them together for instance if you are submission info about the image have step 1 return the id of the database row where that info is stored so that the iframe upload form can submit that id so it knows where to store the picture

4585500
width	height

4585781
jruby	mri
at least with mri you re using jruby though you can get similar behavior on ruby 1.8 with activesupport 2.3.9

4585798
post	get
generally json requests need to be post but you can configure it to allow get too

4585816
mbunit	nunit
in addition to matthew vines answer nunit and mbunit i think xunit.net is the 3rd active open source unittesting solution

4585885
longlistselector	listpicker
i also considered the listpicker and longlistselector but my data really lends itself to the loopingselector format

i m trying to create a script to fill out a multi-page form that i have to fill out weekly unemployment form actually the 4th page ends up giving you a checkbox and 2 radio button all built by javascript

4586120
svnkit	subclipse
i use subclipse with svnkit

4586122
pop-up	dialog
when you click on the first button the one whose handler creates new thread objects you should see 8 dialog pop-up all at once

4586122
pop-up	dialog
when you click on the second one which calls begininvoke you should see up to 4 dialog pop-up

4586122
pop-up	dialog
the first four times you dismiss one of these by clicking ok another dialog should pop-up with the same thread id as the closed dialog s thread is returned to the pool

4586132
wsimport	wsdl2java
the idea is that you run the corresponding automatic tool wsdl2java for cxf or wsimport shipped with java for jax-ws to parse the service s wsdl and the client stubs and required artifacts to communicate with the web service will be created

4586132
jax-ws	saaj
there is also jax-ws you can look into and if you want something simple you can use saaj to send soap messages directly to the web service endpoint

4586148
children	parent
the problem is that pcntl_waitpid is always setting to 0 so the very first time this loop is run the parent thinks that all of its children have exited normally even though they are still running

4586204
button	checkbox
expanded the uncategorized plugin group check the checkbox for antenna eclipse plugins version 1.1.8 then click on the next button

versioning	upgrade
i m working in c# and i have a custom settings object in my software that s saved on disk that i need to be able to test when i upgrade versioning of my software

4586323
versioning	upgrade
for example if i have software with versioning a and have settings from that versioning when i upgrade to versioning b of my software i want to make sure that settings a can be upgrade cleanly

4586323
versioning	upgrade
when later i upgrade to versioning c of my software i have to test the upgrade paths from a- c as well as b- c versioning n+1 requires n+1 more test cases than versioning n did

4586347
atof	strtod
the second form is recommended for newer code as atof is deprecated in favor of strtod .

4586388
sorting	filtering
i have everything working from a technical sense paging sorting filtering but i m trying to figure out to use a themeroller theme to make it look like they have on their website

4586389
put	get
most of these projects you ll need to get someone with commit rights to put your code in but that isn t too hard

4586413
client-side	server-side
if you want to read out query string parameters in a url you would need to do that with a client-side or server-side language of your choice mainly javascript on the client or various frameworks languages like asp.net servlet php on the server and then run the transformation with any api exposed to that language or by that framework

4586431
ubuntu	debian
in the ubuntu debian package i include dependencies on for example

4586455
rss	feed
if the root node is named feed it is atom if the root node is rss it is rss

4586484
installation	upgrade
good dev pc can be used to upgrade your machine as you wish custom setup and installation is possible

4586492
wan	lan
all you should need to do is access the current version s app config or a registry key if you did it that way and get the file location then use a filestream to pull it across whether that s from the local comp the local server or a corporate server as long as you can do it over the lan wan

4586510
button	checkbox
when i click the button to collect all the visible checkbox on the page i want to make sure that it is not already in the ol list

4586536
put	get
to get the exact output you posted put it in a loop like

4586596
domxpath	domdocument
it may be worth looking into php s domdocument and domxpath this will allow you to query html and xml using xpath s query language

4586613
installation	upgrade
it isn t clear to me if your concern is with having to develop all these upgrade paths or with getting this integrated into your installation upgrade procedure

4586613
versioning	upgrade
so for each new versioning you only have to follow this convention and implement the upgrade from the previous versioning

4586654
versioning	upgrade
at the end of this you only have to build an upgrade script to take you from the immediate previous versioning to the current one

4586678
rss	feed
we do something sort of like this with rss feed using python -- we use elementtree since rss is usually guaranteed to be well-formed

4586678
eventlet	gevent
scrapers are usually i o bound -- look into coroutine libraries like eventlet or gevent to exploit some i o parallelism and speed up the whole process

4586763
client-side	server-side
rest apis are generally stateless therefore you should avoid the use of server-side sessions or client-side cookies

4586782
post	get
the app is not that complicated and only makes http post and get requests

4586814
addition	multiplication	subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction
the aim is to use the six given numbers and the four common arithmetic operations addition subtraction multiplication division

4586828
int	chars
convert the int to your chars representation by modding and dividing by 36 iterativly

4586867
implements	extends
you can t extends classes with records but you can implements interfaces

4586875
put	get	post	get	post	put
nancy is designed to handle delete get head options post put and patch requests

4586937
textview	listadapter
just use the link above to create a custom listadapter that takes in an array of your searchresult objects and inserts the necessary data into the corresponding textview

4586962
unsigned	short
due to default promotions which are required by the standard to be applied for variadic functions it is impossible to pass arguments of type char or short or any signed unsigned variants thereof to printf

4586962
unsigned	short
short int or unsigned short int argument the argument will

4586962
unsigned	short
be converted to short int or unsigned short int before printing

4586962
unsigned	short
if the argument was actually of type short or unsigned short then promotion to int followed by a conversion back to short or unsigned short will yield the same value as promotion to int without any conversion back

4586962
unsigned	short
thus for arguments of type short or unsigned short d u etc

4586962
unsigned	short
as far as i can tell the only situation where the h or hh modifier could possibly be useful is when the argument passed it an int outside the range of short or unsigned short

4586962
int	chars
note what s going on is that the original type was chars which gets promoted to int and converted back to unsigned chars instead of chars thus changing the value that gets printed

4587003
gzipinputstream	gzipoutputstream
a class compresses and decompresses files using gzipinputstream and gzipoutputstream

4587005
mouse	keyboard
mainviewcontroller extends timertask initiates the mainview and handles its mouse and keyboard events

4587014
ubuntu	linux
i am developing testing on linux ubuntu 10.x

4587021
implements	modifiers
another idea would be to implements these properties just as regular floats or vectors and create special modifiers -types binding to these properties

4587091
h.264	webm
i vote for webm as a better quality and freer alternative to h.264

4587093
g++	gcc
using gcc instead of g++ on my system turns that error into a warning on my system mandriva linux 2010.1 64-bit and allows the compilation to complete

4587102
unsigned	short
a negative short displayed as an unsigned long in hexidecimal will therefore on any machine be padded with f due to implicit sign extension in the promotion which printf will print

4587124
subtract	add
subtract the target position from the camera position then scale it then add the target position in again

4587140
accessor	properties
note that i m caching the length value as the array s length properties is actually an accessor which is marginally slower than an internal variable

4587144
post	get
it s basically just presentation of data information that is able to transfer data to the server either as get post delete put...

4587144
post	put
postbacks wouldn t even work unless you d put a submit button on it because there s no __dopostback client side functionality that would make a post request to the server

4587149
ready	each
each object should be in its own file and can be instantiated perhaps multiple times or perhaps as a singleton once the document is ready

4587174
prepare	execute
originally the audit logging was done with a custom audit handler class that extends java.util.logging.handler and the publish method would open a database connection populate a prepare statement from the logrecord and execute the insert

4587231
xtext	graphiti
i d suggest to look into the xtext for a textual editor and graphiti for a graphical editor projects

4587273
width	height
what i am trying to do is animate + and - 20px top and left on some absolutely positioned divs and then add 40px to the width height returning to the original position width height on mouse out

4587286
division	modulo
keep in mind that the modulo is the remainder after integer division

4587286
addition	modulo
the addition adjusts the negative modulo so that it is positive but of course moves the positive values above 7

the regular expression matches anything that ends with a period followed by one of png gif jpg or jpeg and replaces it with the first part the path + filename the string -over a period and the original extension

4587355
multibyte	htmlspecialchars
htmlspecialchars invalid multibyte

4587358
tax	shipping
most of the fields seem to be okay but i keep getting numbers showing that the credits for shipping tax exceed the shipping tax for the gross

4587401
folder	directory
i see in the documentation that instead of populated by the direct file the folder are populated by server.php but no where in the php code does it point to any directory or files

4587406
solaris	aix	unix	solaris	unix	aix
and preferably work across all unix based systems including linux solaris hp-ux aix

4587413
hide	show
i know a little bit about json soap and http requests but the only way that i know how to do this right now would be to create a page in my project that i could request from each returned result and have that page validate the user from the cookie query sql for the answer and finally return a true or false to the client on whether to hide or show the favorite icon

4587479
sum	floor	multiplying	subtract
alternatively you can see if you can figure out a closed form for the sum in principle sum the numbers from 1 to floor max n multiplying this by n do this for both your ns 3 and 5 but then you ll have to subtract the double-counted numbers but that s essentially subtract the same for n 15

4587504
g++	gcc
you could try setting lang see selecting message language in gcc and g++ for a detailed description of related environment variables

4587529
put	get
you put all these components together and you get class definitions which are harmful to the ocular nerves

4587545
flask	django	bottle	flask
for python the best solution would be a wsgi compatible framework such as flask bottle or django

4587555
cvs	svn
this is usually a directory you most definitely want checked into svn cvs git etc as it will ensure that all users who check that project out into eclipse use the right project specific settings

4587579
width	height
the height and width are used to center the pop-up below the selected row in the grid

4587591
gtk	gdk
i don t want to use any features except very basic gdk gtk calls to create and manage the window and receive input events

4587605
stdout	stderr
you might have to tweak this a bit but here s some slightly modified from the original code that redirects stdout and stderr for a process

4587610
codeigniter	cakephp
the python way to do web applications has more in common with something like codeigniter or cakephp

4587615
margin	height
just make sure to not place margin and height in the same tag

4587635
multiplying	add
converting to time_t should be easy multiplying by 86400 and add a constant offset then you can use the localtime function

4587748
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
now the modern browsers google-chrome firefox safari opera bahave like so if you open the select element and hover over its items option elements the div box will keep its red background - which means that the hover state is still active

4587789
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome firefox safari and opera the box is red which means that the hover state is still active

4587826
hash	md5	hash	whirlpool	whirlpool	md5
also want to add that you can also store a hash md5 is a function readily available in php you can opt for something like whirlpool as well but you ll have to find a library for that of the data on a separate database and check against it when you access it to ensure that your database hasn t been compromised

4587827
ssl	https
as long as you re not using ssl https the main disadvantage is

4587853
unsigned	short
ul is an unsigned long in the c implementation but you re using an unsigned short

4587862
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
on the first tier simply have the front-end servers apache lighttpd nginx etc connect to fastcgi servers on the second tier

4587904
cpu	affinity
fwiw i concur with the times peter lawrey stated if latency is really critical then you need to think about busy waiting with appropriate cpu affinity dedicate a core to that thread

4587916
post	get
without going into details i haven t been able to use the rgoogleanalytics package as i get the same error that is found in this post

4587918
lisp	scheme
that said it is a scheme which has fewer batteries included as compared to common lisp

4587918
lisp	scheme
scheme has fewer libraries than common lisp

4587918
lisp	scheme
however gambit scheme has smoother access to c c++ code libraries which far outnumber common lisp s libraries

4587950
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the other day i asked about using a uinavigationcontroller as a child of a uiviewcontroller

4587992
explode	implode
similar to php implode explode functions

4588000
put	get
right now once again i can put a name in a1 a name in a2 and get the value in a3

4588044
g++	gcc
gcc has driver programs like gcc g++ and gfortran which call the language compilers named cc1 cc1plus and f951 to generated assembler code then calls the assembler to create object files and then the linker well this last step is a bit more complicated because it involves determining the correct order of object files and libraries which is done by a program named collect2

4588064
nsmatrix	nscell
i would like to track a mouseover event of a nscell in a nsmatrix

4588066
int	chars
the variadic arguments to printf et al are automatically promoted using the default conversions so any short or chars values are promoted to int when passed to the function

4588092
versioning	upgrade
for this last group applications written in an earlier versioning than the latest framework do not get upgrade

4588108
multiplying	addition
in addition you might also want to review your constraints since these can be used by the optimizer to eliminate joins if a table is not used for any output columns when the optimizer can determine there will not be an outer join or cross join which would eliminate or multiplying rows

4588136
stdout	stderr
the first one redirects all stdout and stderr to nul

4588136
stdout	stderr
but the second line redirects the stdout to nul and stderr to the empty stdout

4588152
versioning	upgrade
for the most part i try to keep my teams on the cutting edge since we have learned through experience that maintaining various versioning of frameworks can create a lot of confusion and ultimately requires the same or more costs as just doing a one-time upgrade

4588154
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the uinavigationcontroller is inside of a uitabbarcontroller

4588158
versioning	upgrade
if it were up to me we would upgrade as soon as a new versioning of .net and visual studio is released

4588159
mockito	easymock
i really like mockito but this is the one place where easymock wins out

4588188
width	height
i usually change the height depending on the text and set the width to a fixed width and set my positioning how i like

4588202
centos	linux
operating system centos linux 5.5

4588202
cpu	processors
processors information intel r xeon r cpu e5420 2.50ghz 8 cores

4588231
int	double
since coordinate ranges are well-defined you can add a few digits of accuracy compared to double by using a 64 bit int representation or even multiple

4588274
subtract	add
edit i have an angle from using math.atan2 which i then want to add or subtract values from

4588274
subtraction	addition
however this addition and subtraction sometimes means the angle is greater that pi or less than -pi and i m looking for a way to get one of these outside angles back into the correct range

4588277
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
however when i abstracted out the header and footer contents into server side includes the layout changes marginally in firefox opera safari but in ie the layout changes makes the page look broken

4588389
int	double
any int double will return the int side

4588412
firefox	safari
works in firefox and safari # form#ajaxform trigger submit

4588435
put	get
it can get a bit tedious specifying each directory but you could put shell and batch scripts in the root of the working directory to help you in this endeavor

4588436
lxml	beautifulsoup
yes you use beautifulsoup or lxml

4588454
postgresql	mysql
first and foremost i would advice you or anyone to avoid using mysql there s a lot of free rdbms available my favorite being postgresql which in my view is way better

4588464
qpainter	qimage
while tracking down a bug i want to single-step in gdb kdbg ddd whatever while watching what gets drawn into a qimage using a qpainter that s carried about from method to method

4588469
vbscript	jscript
i m trying to recreate the following jscript code in vbscript

4588549
jar	war
if you have multiple jar war files each file have its own log4j.xml and you don t want to worry about which log4j.xml get loaded you can explicitly load the configuration yourself

4588560
google-chrome	firefox
i tested in google-chrome and firefox and neither worked

4588566
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
the key point is that you want to do a grouping on the id2 column and perform some sort of aggregate-functions on id1 min max sum avg

4588570
postgresql	mysql
top 1 is sql server specific if you are on mysql postgresql you d need to select .

strcpy	strncpy
strcpy strcat strncpy

4588597
superclass	subclassing
change a subclassing variable from the superclass

4588634
int	boolean
i would expect to fix the state 28 conflict by distinguishing between a boolean variable and an int variable using the symbol table to help determine which type of token is returned

4588641
folder	directory
additionally i have chmodded all of the smarty library folder as well as the other required directory to 777 just for the sake of testing

4588660
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
i ve encountered a problem if i redirect the malloc calloc realloc free calls to heapalloc heaprealloc heapfree with getprocessheap for the handle the memory seems to be allocated correctly no bad pointer returned and no exceptions thrown but the library i m porting says failed to allocate memory for some reason

4588660
calloc	malloc
and if not then why does the static microsoft crt included with visual studio take some extra steps in malloc calloc before calling heapalloc

4588668
post	get
i m currently trying to to get my unregistered question merged with this account after which i ll be able to accept eichin s answer and edit my post to include my solution

4588673
bottle	flask
as was suggested in your other question flask and bottle are good contenders

4588735
getter	setter
i m pretty sure the propertychangelistener mechanism only works if you set the properties through the propertyeditor mechanis not through getter and setter

4588770
explode	implode
reference trim explode array_reverse implode

4588793
superclass	subclassing	public	protected
you need to declare the variable that is being accessed from the subclassing as protected or public by default the variable is private so only accesible by the superclass

4588835
maven	pom.xml
the problem is that we need the jar to be pluggable so that we can replace it or add more jar as more plugins to the project without having to change the original code base including not changing the maven pom.xml file for each new jar plugin so i cannot hard code the dependency on this jar in the pom.xml file

4588916
prepare	execute
you could very well prepare statements with pdo and then get the query string form it and execute them using mysql functions

4588945
subtract	add
if you don t have a 400-year range starting on 1 1 xxxx where you need to manipulate the date slightly different to get the right result instead of adding 1600 to the year add x 400 where x is an integer such that some of the dates will be in the range then add or subtract 400 to the year for those dates that are outside of the range

4588966
hide	show
user clicks the div and my script grabs the html of the element and puts it into a var show the form and dumps the html var into a textarea and hide the element

4588998
mp3	flv
from asp.net i am using ffmpeg to convert flv files on a flash media server to wavs that i need to mix into a single mp3 file

4589031
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
once you have your connection string defined you will probably use the sqlconnection sqlcommand and sqldatareader classes for all interactions with the database

4589046
free	malloc
it s safe to pass a null pointer to free but passing any pointer not allocated by malloc or one of its relatives will cause undefined behaviour

4589051
hash	md5
if you use sha1 sha256 md5 other hash it then will be easy validate file data -- read

4589067
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
the only thing you can pass to free is a pointer returned to you from malloc or calloc realloc etc or null

4589083
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works great in webkit safari google-chrome but not in firefox 4 beta

4589105
hash	md5
i need to be able to compute an md5 hash value for the entire contents as they will be posted including the boundary markers etc

4589202
uilabel	uibutton
here is the correct solution to add an uilabel to an uibutton to align the button text to better control the button title

4589245
getter	setter
one potential disadvantage to something like lombok is that with the setter getter missing source tools may not recognize aspects of the resulting object that give it bean qualities since those qualities only manifest in the compiled class

4589258
post	get
the problem is i m not sure how ef are going to handle lookup table how will i get the tags of a post or a collection of the post when i select a tag

4589261
getchar	isspace
...you would convert it to the wide character version by changing c to a wint_t getchar to getwchar eof to weof and isspace to iswspace

4589277
versioning	upgrade
to resolve it i upgrade to the latest development versioning using trunk of the bazaar repository

clang	llvm
in latest ios sdk apple provides three compiler options gcc llvm with clang and llvm-gcc

4589335
clang	llvm
i understand more or less what these 3 mean what llvm and clang are and so on

4589362
verilog	hdl
my instruction set simulators these days are actually written in a hardware design language verilog for example not the hdl i use but it converts to verilog then use something like verilator with a c c++ wrapper

4589362
verilog	hdl	verilog	vhdl
if you happen to be working on a project where this new instruction set is realized in vhdl or verilog i highly recommend a hybrid hdl simulator plus software solution either through vpi if it is a commercial hdl simulator or through other simpler methods if you go with verilator or icarus verilog or ghdl or others

4589376
profiling	benchmarking
my team has done a great deal of profiling and benchmarking in this area

4589384
integer	unsigned
remember that although the width of an unsigned integer type is equal to the amount of value bits the width of a signed integer type is one greater â 6.2.6.2 6

4589384
integer	unsigned
also note that while it is easy to get a compile-time constant for the maximum value of an unsigned integer type imax_bits unsigned type -1 at the time of this writing i don t know any way to do the same thing for a signed integer type without invoking implementation defined behavior

4589399
groupbox	panel
if you remove the height from your groupbox which as far as i understand is what you want to do then it will fill its container unless there s a panel upstream that imposes its own sizing rules

4589399
groupbox	panel
headeredcontentcontrol isn t a panel so it doesn t do any layout of its own and its descendant groupbox doesn t have this same problem

4589422
cdr	cons
it assumes quote atom eq cons car cdr and cond and defines null and not append list pair assoc eval evcon and evlis

4589447

4589473
mp3	wav
moreover i didn t find how to change the pitch of a wav file and if possibl a mp3 file

4589473
mp3	wav
i am listening to music using javasound for the wav and jlayer for the mp3

4589477
french	persian
utf-8 seems to be fine and certainly will be for german french but you ll need to set the text direction to rtl right-to-left for persian

4589555
clang	llvm
the standard xcode 3.2.5 install contains llvm-1.6 not the latest so i d recommend either running some speed tests to see if there s a noticeable difference between gcc and llvm or compiling clang from source and getting the latest version

4589555
clang	llvm
essentially there s no need for gcc any more llvm + clang is more than enough

4589579
hide	show
rows should only hide or be show when the apply filter button is pressed

4589607
fadein	fadeout
the fadein 200 should be placed inside the callback otherwise it is running before the fadeout completes so there s no fade effect at all

4589614
unsigned	short
the only use i can think of is for passing an unsigned short or unsigned char and using the x conversion specifier

4589637
qmainwindow	qwidget
assuming you have a qwidget or qmainwindow derived class for your gui you could add the following to it

4589649
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly in google-chrome and firefox but in internet explorer it doesn t work at all

4589675
implements	extends
if you implements your own database backend that extends the postgresql backend than you can change it

4589681
subtract	add
edit as suggested by one of answers java.math.bigdecimal is a good example with its add subtract etc methods

4589689
min	max
let s alternate between a min and max property for each level making it every odd row is less than its children and its grandchildren and the inverse for even rows

4589742

boost	stl
the overall design isn t that bad don t need to rewrite it from scratch however there are many things that i don t like this is mostly because i wrote it in a hurry no comments and magic numbers everywhere ... and because the way i use c++ tools is changed i d say improved in the meanwhile i tend to use much more references smart pointers stl boost ...

4590441
portrait	landscape
the scripting needs to resize uploaded images regardless of whether they are portrait or landscape and regardless of proportions to adhere to these dimensions without getting stretched

4590443
free	realloc
a lot of time i ve seen people write realloc when they mean free

4590443
memcpy	realloc	memcpy	malloc	realloc	malloc	free	memcpy	free	realloc	free	malloc
if used correctly with growing data in a way that avoids worst-case o n 2 performance for growing an object to size n growing the buffer geometrically instead of linearly when you run out of space realloc has doubtful benefit over simply doing your own new malloc memcpy and free cycle

4590443
realloc	calloc
if you like to zero-fill new objects with calloc it s easy to forget that realloc won t zero-fill the new part

4590443
free	memcpy
but this can actually be harmful additional allocation and memcpy on implementations that strictly segregate chunks by size and in other cases might increase fragmentation by splitting off part of a large free chunk to store a new small object instead of using an existing small free chunk

i know the width and height of the screen in window coordinates i know the z-coordinates of the quad in 3d

4590588
width	height
i want to find out the width and height of the quad in 3d coordinates that will fit exactly onto my screen

4590588
width	height
i would like to put a quad along the z-axis at the specified offset z i would like to find out the width and height of the quad that will exactly fill the entire screen

4590588
width	height
though it s similar it is still different because i remembered in that working formula they do make use of screenwidth and screenheight which are the width and height of the screen in window coordinates

4590588
width	height
it s not some gl calls it s just a math formula that can find out the width and height in 3d space that can fill the entire screen if z offset width in window coordinates and height in window coordinates are known

4590600

4591154
allocator	stl
about string and vector and other stl containers you should not worry because they use dynamic allocator internally

4591170
width	height
this will shrink any images down proportionally based on whichever side is longer width or height to the maximum size

4591170
width	height
it will also blow up any images smaller than max which you can stop with a bit of checking on whether or not both width and height are less than their max

4591202
crypt	salt
using characters outside of this range in the salt will cause crypt to return a zero-length string

4591202
hash	salt
returns the hash string or a string that is shorter than 13 characters and is guaranteed to differ from the salt on failure

4591202
hash	salt
but as shown in the reply by dereleased if the input salt string is valid the output consists of the input salt padded out to a fixed length with characters with the 32-character computed hash value appended to it

4591202
hash	salt
this is shown by the last three lines in that reply where we see one for 20 digits no for 21 and when there are 22 base64 digits in the salt the first character of the hash result replaces the 22nd digit of the input salt

4591202
hash	salt
here s a little snippet showing that the 22nd base64 digit contributes just two more bits to the salt actually used in the computation there are only 4 distinct hash produced

4591202
hash	salt
in light of the comments it seems clear there is no bug just incredibly taciturn documentation - since i m not a cryptographer i can t say this with any authority but it seems to me that it s a weakness of the algorithm that a 21-digit salt apparently can produce all possible hash values while a 22-digit salt limits the first digit of the hash to only one of four values

width	height
namely get the bounding box circle of the path calculate the predefined rectangular ratio of height width compare that to the same value of bb stretch the bb accordingly e.g if predefined ration is less than 1 the bb is stretched horizontally and vertically otherwise to match the same ratio finally scale the whole thing to the predefined rectangular size

4591374
width	height
the scale factor is now just the minimum between predefined height divided by bb height and predefined width divided by bb width

to be explicit but by default it should be the whole height and width of the td provided the td and table have a height

4593612
unsigned	short
i was able to delve fairly deeply into that logic but was stalled on two problems the #ifdefs reference a bunch of tokens that are not actually defined anywhere in perl code that i can find - and i don t know how to find out from within perl what those define s values were and the ultimate default value assuming i m right and those #ifdef s always end up with the default of #define perl_ushort_max unsigned short unsigned 0 the actual limit is gotten by removing 1 bit off that resulting all-ones number - details below

4593612
unsigned	short
which seems to imply that it s set by default to #define perl_ushort_max unsigned short unsigned 0

4593612
unsigned	short
how to extract that value from perl side i have no clue - it s basically a number you get by bitwise negating a short 0 so if unsigned short is 16 bytes then perl_ushort_max will be 16 ones and perl_short_max will be 15 ones 2 15-1 32767

4593613
post	get
there are two common methods used to send data to a php application get and post

memcpy	strncpy
as for the question of strncpy versus memcpy the difference is that strncpy adds a null-terminator for you

4593948
subtract	add
if 1291590000000 is your starting point then subtract it your current number remembering to add 1 if you are treating this as week 1

4593980
linefeed	delimiter
as adam hints in the comments if there is no tab cr linefeed or similar delimiter there is not enough information in your string to parse the data by

4593992
jpql	hql
hql documentation describes the following syntax it also works in hibernate s jpql

4593996
memcpy	strncpy
you need to understand null-termination before you understand the difference between memcpy and strncpy

4593996
memcpy	strncpy
the difference is that memcpy will copy all n characters you ask for while strncpy will copy up to the first null terminator inclusive or n characters whichever is fewer

textmate	bbedit	vim	textmate	vim	bbedit
other editors like textmate vim bbedit ... work well

4594163
post	get
this would make things considerably easier as the android library has native support for json serialization and making http get requests to restful urls is much simpler than http post requests it s not a huge deal but just less stuff you have to worry about

4594207
min	max
min expr and expr max

4594260
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i tried ie 8 google-chrome 10.0.612.3 dev firefox 3.6.13 safari 5.0.3 and opera 11

4594323
getter	setter
if your second example had both a getter and a setter they would be functionally equivalent

4594346
implements	extends
yes because you re assuming that getcontent returns something that implements multipart and in this case it does not imapinputstream extends inputstream

4594367
unix	aix
i have two unix machines both running aix 5.3

4594370
range	max
i don t know if this is a standard statistical approach so what i was considering doing was splitting the x-axis data into small range calculating the max for these range and then trying to identify a function to describe these points

4594422
magento	oscommerce
having used oscommerce magento and prestashop i can say that prestashop is by far the better choice in terms of being easy to install and get running

4594475
maven	pom.xml
i am very interested in how i can find out what are the jars that the dependences in the maven s pom.xml depend on

4594552
int	double
this means you can add an int or a double etc

4594605
int	chars
int and int chars and chars

4594697
min	max	range	max	range	min
for each variable compute the min max by starting off with the range -inf inf and update it for each inequality

4594708
any	set-intersection
you just need a .any in the lambda to check if the set-intersection contains any elements

4594749
minimum	max
the max of the gt and gte arrays would be the minimum value with or depending on which array it came from

4594749
minimum	max
the minimum of lt and lte arrays would be the max value

4594756
versioning	upgrade
in order for two setup projects to be considered the same application they should have different product codes identical upgrade codes and different versioning numbers

4594756
installation	upgrade
it s hard to tell from your question if this affects you but there is a serious issue in the way visual studio 2010 setup projects handle upgrade installation

4594766
hash	salt
if you sent the parts and the hash but not the salt anywhere just to be sure

4594766
hash	salt
so send your hash and your codeparts and recreate the hash from the codeparts and salt secretstring and you re set

4594787
public	protected
with regards to your requirements password protected public key authentication + ssh-agent still seems to fit

4594824
min	max
once you zoom out a bit the max value is always a positive integer and the min value is always a negative integer

4594824
min	max
so you need a function that scans the waveform data in chunks and keeps track of the accumulated max and min for that chunk

4594824
min	max
this is slow process so professional audio editors keep a pre-calculated table of min and max values at some fixed zoom ratio

4594824
min	max
its worthwhile to write code that handles all of the channels of the file in an single pass when doing this scanning slowness here will make your whole program feel sluggish it s the disk io that matters here the cpu has no trouble keeping up so straightforward c++ code is fine for building the min max tables but you don t want to go through the file more than once and you want to do it sequentially

4594824
min	max
once you have the min max tables keep them around

4594824
min	max
you want to go back to the disk as little as possible and many of the reasons for wanting to repaint your window will not require you to rescan your min max tables

4594824
min	max
then you draw the waveform by drawing a series of 1 pixel wide vertical lines between the max value and the min value for the time represented by that pixel

4594824
min	max
this should be quite fast if you are drawing from pre built min max tables

4594830
client-side	server-side
what you need is a server-side or a more robust client-side language to access the remote server

4594843
background-image	background-position
i d suggest using background-image on your div instead of a separate tag and background-position right

uiview	subviews
to add subviews within the uiview

4595127
uiview	subviews
i cannot find a way to load subviews within a uiview using a nav controller hence the use of insertsubview

4595127
uiview	subviews
could someone a method to either use nav controllers to load subviews within a uiview or suggest a way to retain data values between the loading and unloading of subviews

4595161
hash	md5
i would then run that through an md5 hash and get.

4595209
google-chrome	firefox
both firefox and google-chrome reject it as an xml document but their source viewers strip out the leading bytes so it looks fine

onreadystatechange	onload
from there make the onload or onreadystatechange fire twice by wrapping the original like so

4595411
tostring	string.format
to display it in the format you created it in you will either need to use string.format or you can even use tostring with a pattern

4595418
hash	md5
if you then want to make this a string to pass to your md5 hash

4595458
versioning	upgrade
the renames should be atomic so that the old versioning won t be touched until the upgrade is complete

4595471
django	turbogears	pylons	pyramid	pylons	turbogears	turbogears	pyramid
pylons repoze.bfg and turbogears recently merged into one umbrella the pyramid project which makes that project the front-runner to challenge django s dominance in the python framework world

4595471
pylons	turbogears
unfortunately you can also read that in another way pylons and turbogears admitted that their projects respective approaches weren t working particularly well and shifted focus to helping develop repoze.bfg

4595473
put	get
the only alternative would be to put something in the get parameters of the redirected request

4595511

4595566
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
i didnt get chance to check on opera google-chrome and safari will try it later

4595585

4595654
ant	pom.xml
even if it s in french i put my ant stuff and the play s pom.xml i wrote

4595670
config	ini
it would be easyer to save the routes to a config file or an ini file or database or xml or whatever will make you re life easyer in to long run if you need to edit add delete new routes

4595677
put	get
this seperate database.properties file gets filtered but since it is a test resource located in src main test it doesn t get put into the final artifact

4595686
mouseout	mouseup
when you add an event handler you used for mouseup and for mouseout these two are different

4595707
equals	gethashcode
chances are you haven t overridden gethashcode in a manner consistent with equals

4595707
equals	gethashcode
iirc you ll get a compiler error or at least a warning if you override equals without overriding gethashcode

4595710
jython	jacl
2 writing a wsadmin jacl jython script that could be run each time after the plugin file is regenerated

4595715
hide	show
this makes for a max of 2 show hide if they are just wildly moving over things and doesn t have a stutter when you use .stop i wrote the following real fast but you should get the idea

4595723
equals	gethashcode
when you override equals you must override gethashcode as well else dictionary won t work for you

4595749
free	malloc
first of all in the standard there s nothing that guarantees such a thing free ing a non- malloc ed pointer is undefined behavior

4595768

4595805
nfa	dfa
convert the regular expression into a nondeterministic finite automaton nfa and reduce it down to the minimal determinsitic finite automaton dfa

4595843
folder	directory
it s probably the directory from which you started eclipse or maybe the folder in which eclipse is installed

4595880
submit	submission
off the top of my head to prevent the enter button from submission the form don t use a submit button rather use a to call javascript to submit the form

4595884
tiff	png	tiff	bmp	bmp	png	gif	bmp	gif	png
the desired process will take an existing jpg gif png tiff or bmp and do the following

4595915
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome display strange chars but report the page to be utf-8

4595936
free	malloc
the start-up routine initializes the crt creates the crt heap so that malloc free work initializes standard i o streams etc.

4595981
packets	multicast
by default the android wifi stack filters out multicast packets

4596107
int	chars
entities in the xml code are parsed and transformed to a chars int value before they get checked by candisplay

4596117
x86	64bit
for this specific activity you need to create and activity project change it from .net 4 client profile to .net 4 and reference microsoft.build.framework and microsoft.build.utilities.v4.0 from the gac and then microsoft.web.publishing.tasks from programfiles msbuild microsoft visualstudio v10.0 webapplications programfiles x86 if you re on a 64bit system

4596141
put	get
if i take _this_object .tostring inside the try block and put it into dior -i i get this

4596143
required	placeholder
i had this exact same problem and worked out it was because the i was not using html.beginform to create my form resulting in the required input attributes and the placeholder for the validation was not being injected into the page even though i had the inserted on my view page

4596177
submit	submission
assuming that you want to do this because the submit button has a click handler you d like to happen for every form submission you should instead move that code into a separate function and invoke it from a the form s submit event

4596199
listview	gridview
i realized then that the columns and such where not set in the itemtemplate but at the gridview itself and listview of course has no templateselector for itself

4596199
listview	gridview
as i have learned a little bit more about listview and it s view property i m pretty sure i could define the gridview in a staticresource

4596214
daemons	launchd
a daemons or a launchd agent can do that

4596234
uinavigationbar	uinavigationitem
i d like to have a left arrow in my uinavigationbar as a back uinavigationitem

4596242
hash	salt
salt is only meaningful for hash

4596247
post	get
make sure that you are retruning stream only to full page request get post issued by browser itself not by some script on the page that expects some particular type of responce

4596265
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
works perfectly in ie in firefox it s a gamble on each refresh and in safari google-chrome opera not at all

4596326
thin	unicorn
the headers x-forwarded-for x-forwarded-proto and x-forwarded-port are a way for http reverse proxies such as nginx squid or varnish to communicate to the back-end http application server your rails application running in thin or unicorn who the user actually is and how the user actually connected

4596327
maven	cobertura
the workaround i use works in hudson 1.391 is to configure cobertura in separate maven profile and run it in a hudson job as a post-build step

4596361
hash	salt
the salt prevents dictionary attacks aka rainbow tables where people have gone through and pre-calculated the hash values for several inputs

4596436
width	height
when the textbox is single-line acceptsreturn false i need the width to be 150 and the height to be 22

4596436
width	height
when it is multi-line acceptsreturn true obviously i need the width and height to stretch and take up the entire space

4596436
width	height
when using the multilineintrigger style the textbox will have the height and width set statically regardless of acceptsreturn but when using the singlelineintrigger style the controls will be stretched regardless of acceptsreturn value

4596456
int	boolean
i can t see how you can use formula mapping other than to map strings int and boolean

4596469
try-catch	exception-handling
i would like to know your opinions of what is the correct way of applying the try-catch block to capture exception-handling

4596503
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
you should use an uinavigationcontroller in order to pop push uiviewcontroller on your screen

4596530
opera	firefox
this link shows a way to use the domparser interface in webkit opera firefox as well as the activex dom object in ie

4596547
hash	salt
so if you use the same key and iv for all the password encryptions the scenario is the same as when using a hash functions and using salt has the same advantages

4596558
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested the form on google-chrome and firefox both gave the same result

4596571
ubuntu	debian
for debian ubuntu it would be apt-get install libboost-system1.45-dev -- but this package does not exists while writing this

4596603
parsley	mate
good choices are swiz parsley or mate

4596603
parsley	mate
however most are moving to swiz or parsley now away from mate and caringorm

4596640
pop-up	dialog
if a user tries to open a document which is already opened in another instance i need to pop-up a dialog to tell them and allow them to switch to the other app instance if required

4596646
internationalization	localization
internationalization and localization is a good place to start

4596718
salt	md5
you could use the macaddress with an md5 function around it with a salt that was only known to the system owners

4596718
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
md5 hash with salt for keeping password in db in c#

4596762
post	get
use a messaging infrastructure like activemq behind your webservice - get the webservice request normally take the request message and post it to an inbound queue in activemq and respond with an acknowledgement synchronously

4596792
uiview	calayer
if the lines need not be updated you should as richard and nacho4d suggested draw all of them in one object by a custom uiview or by a delegate of calayer implementing the drawlayer incontext method

4596812
ubuntu	debian
this will work for ubuntu debian

4596842
pop-up	dialog
i am trying to make a pop-up dialog form with jquery ui but the buttons that are generated do not have any text in them

4596916
ffmpeg	libavformat
i ve recompiled ffmpeg with debugging info and from the backtrace the offending line is libavformat mpegtsenc.c 800

4596916
free	malloc
tried efence but it doesnt seem to work with ffmpeg cause they use their own malloc free routines to get the memory aligned blocks

4596920
free	malloc
you apparently have determined that you re done with an object that you currently have a pointer to and if that object was malloc ed you want to free it

4596920
free	malloc
whenever you hear people complain about properly pairing each malloc with free each new with delete and each with etc. you know that they are making their lives harder than necessary by not following a disciplined memory management regime

4596925
subclass	abstract-class
1 if classa and classb can be treated in a uniform fashion make deriveddata an interface abstract-class then subclass classa and classb from deriveddata jzd already pointed out that

4596929
ienumerable	iqueryable
even though my example was instantiating the var as iqueryable my actual code was doing so as ienumerable

4596929
ienumerable	iqueryable
ienumerable handles where differently apparently such that only the first expression will get executed against the db and all subsequent ones do so in memory unlike iqueryable

4596973
put	get
if you put a clustering index on these you will encounter performance problems due to the high number of page splits you ll encounter as rows get moved around in the index

4597017
vb.net	vb6
there is nothing we could do about this - this was done automatically by the visual studio vb6 -- vb.net converter

4597108
int	chars
chars above 0x7f 127 are probably converting to negative int values

4597160
put	get
one option might be to create a blank .aspx put the user control on the .aspx page and then get that page via jquery and dump the result on the page

4597167
client-side	server-side
links is a lisp-like functional web programming language framework that makes it easy to write a single piece of code that is compiled to server-side code client-side js and html thus making it much easier to write web applications

4597167
client-side	server-side
note that i don t just mean writing server side and client side code in the same language but writing server-side and client-side functions that can call each other and generate the html

4597206
post	get
http provides two methods post and get

4597212
mutators	setter
if you declare a setter aka mutators using attr_writer or attr_accessor or be careful of calling it from inside the class

4597232
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
i m sending the data wrapped in a class through an objectoutputstream and objectinputstream

4597254
profiling	debugging	aqtime	madexcept
you could do a lot with jcl debugging madexcept and other profiling and logging tools but codesite and aqtime are the two best for their respective tasks

4597268
ilist	iqueryable
iqueryable also works but i cannot get ilist to work and i have no idea why

4597268
ienumerable	iqueryable
using iqueryable doesn t work nor does ienumerable

4597268
ienumerable	iqueryable
neither iqueryable or ienumerable allow you to add or remove objects

4597268
ilist	icollection
instead an icollection or ilist must be used

4597315
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i haven t found any differences in ie 6â 9 google-chrome safari and firefox

4597340
min	max
apparently the namespace trick does not work because min max are macros and the preprocessor does not look at namespace scope

4597344
hide	show
if you want to be able to show hide based on context you can use toggle

4597367
hide	show
the bar had a button to show hide filters which would animate down from the top

4597415
portrait	landscape
it means the transition from portrait to landscape on an iphone is really smooth with no zoom problems at all.

4597490
stdout	stderr
doesn t output anything to stdout or stderr

4597551
firefox	safari
here is another upload script which uses xhr when possible firefox safari and falls back gracefully to iframe if necessary ie

4597587
stdout	stderr
then use that to redirect both stdout and stderr to it

4597595
x86	64bit
in order to #import the correct version of ado for my 32-bit program i need to know whether i m compiling on a 32-bit windows os meaning the file is in program files or a 64bit os meaning the file is in program files x86

4597643
pop-up	dialog
the only thing which is being displayed is a blank pop-up window which is part of the code dialog and it set to modal and visible

4597653
pull	push
on a sidenote you can see that each of the approaches above either use a push or pull model the tcp one can be implemented in both ways this might affect your final decision of which way to go

4597653
pull	push
push lv signals the c app directly pull c app has to poll a flag or ask lv for the value

4597659
centos	linux
i ve created an amazon ec2 ami running centos linux 5.5 and postgresql 8.4

4597662
pull	push
the other options would be to declare said second developer as a collaborator on your github project he would be able to push directly but that wouldn t change the fact that a pull first is necessary to ensure the push will be straightforward

4597723
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome + safari - padding must no be included to center correctly

4597723
opera	firefox
firefox ie opera - padding must not be included to center correctly

4597743
maven	pom.xml
this command will install this shaded parent without running shade plugin pom.xml -alwaysactiveprofiles option supress shade plugin execution and after that your maven dependent projects will work

4597749
int	chars
if i put ansi in notepad it works int parsing and there are no weird chars as in the picture above but of course my special chars aren t working

4597842
pull	push
you can both push and pull directly to your repo without forking on github and without your collaborator having to constantly submit github pull requests

4597842
pull	push
if you continue to have conflicts push and pull more frequently so the differences are smaller and easier to handle

4597856
int	double
change the types of a through h from int to float or double and change the corresponding conversion specifiers from d to f in the printf and scanf calls

4597862
width	margin
depending on your implementation you could contain the element that needs to be centered in a div that is 100 width and absolutely positioned and then with the current element that you have use the margin 0 auto to center it within the absolutely positioned element

4597894
children	parent
from the link here i have an example of a hiererchical cte a little massage and it will represent the parent rather than children

4597911
gdal	ogr
you can use the python bindings to the gdal ogr toolkit

4597963
hide	removeclass
i ve used a variable to hold a settimeout to delay firing the hide method in your case the removeclass

4597963
mouseover	mouseout
i d also add a mouseover listener to the children that would clear the timeout if it exists which would prevent the mouseout from executing

4597966
labwindows	cvi
i m an employee at national instruments and i wanted to make sure you didn t miss the network variable api that is provided with labwindows cvi the national instruments c development environment

4597966
labwindows	cvi
you can obtain this api by installing labwindows cvi but it is not necessary to use the labwindows cvi environment

4597975
onresume	onpause
the correct pattern is to register in onresume and unregister in onpause

4597986
put	get
by far the easiest way to get this right is to remove the surrogate key from the db generate the edmx and then put this model on your original db

4597992
for-loop	arrays
the way i ve done this is to do a double for-loop like you would for looping through the 2d arrays normally

4598087
strlen	implode
you can use implode to transform your array of strings in a single string and then strlen the result

4598110
jquery	nyromodal
i m using the nyromodal jquery plugin

4598114
hash	md5
anyone experienced enough to crack binaries would likely just disable the call to your verify the md5 against a file code anyway eliminating the need to replace the saved hash altogether

4598151
datamapper	activerecord
finally it may be worth considering the use of datamapper which i believe is more suited to existing brownfield databases than activerecord because it allows you to map everything but of course you will need to learn that api if you don t already know it

4598284
post	get
don t use use post that s what causes the warning if you submit using get you won t get the warning

note that this currently assumes that elementcomparer will cope with null values for both gethashcode and equals

4598456
hide	show
the delete button should appear immediately but it only appears when you hide the menu and then show it again

free	malloc
even if there are mbs of contiguous free space in the malloc heap it will not use it for requests over 512kb

4598804
free	malloc
in my case this free unused yet reserved malloc memory chewed up huge parts of my process 2gb address space eventually leading to memory allocation failures

4598851
setinterval	settimeout
note that unlike settimeout setinterval establishes a timed routine that will run over and over again until the last syllable of recorded time.

4598851
setinterval	settimeout
instead of calling setinterval in the ajax success handler call settimeout

4598870
jboss	glassfish
there are several java ee implementations available either full fledged implementations like oracle glassfish 3 jboss 6 etc or partial only jsp servlet implementations like apache tomcat 7 eclipse jetty 8 etc

4599125
google-chrome	firefox
it works for ie and firefox but not google-chrome

4599149
equals	tostring
it also has the benefit of working with any object with a correct equals hashcode implementation not just strings and objects with equals-compatable tostring implementations

4599195
google-chrome	firefox
disclaimer i haven t tried this in ie but google-chrome and firefox work fine

4599197
avro	thrift
if messaging does become a bottleneck we will look first to bert we rejected it because it currently does not appear to have java support then to msgpack rejected because it appears that there isn t a large community of java developers using it then to avro rejected because it requires you to define your message format up-front then protocol buffers rejected because of the extra code generation step and lack of heterogeneous collections and then thrift rejected for the reasons mentioned for protocol buffers

4599214
punctuation	words
similar as already posted but using str_word_count to extract the words by just splitting at spaces punctuation marks will be counted too

the advantage to using a java back end with gwt-rpc communications is that you can use the requestfactory with entityproxy so that you only have to maintain one version of the object from the client through the persistence layer

4599314
hash	salt
rather than the token being random you can make it serve as a signature by generating it from a hash of the user id session expiry time and whatever else you want in the cookie plus a salt just like the login system

4599316
createelement	each
you need to call createelement each time

4599322
int	boolean
wassick boolean or int with values 0 for false or 1 for true

4599335

4599337
hide	show
then i bound to the .change event of the select box which gets the currently selected value hide all of the messages then show the related one

4599359
innodb	myisam
one that runs innodb but doesn t get much usage it has been replaced by the other app and one that runs myisam and gets lots of use

4599394
hash	salt
you could also select the salt and the hash from the database and do the hash comparison server-side rather than on the db to reduce the number of round-trips to the database

4599399
google-chrome	firefox
here in both browsers google-chrome and firefox the rewind option seems to work i m on firefox version 3.6.13

4599440
inherited	properties
sometimes that s sufficient or if you want your models to exist as their own classes then you can have the models inherited from a base class that takes care of turning the nsdictionary nsarray into properties

4599449
firefox	safari
and also it happened with firefox and safari only

4599483
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
an advantage of using monodevelop or sharpdevelop is that they re open-source so you can be sure to have full access to the ast - you can go into the core and modify things if necessary

4599500
bazaar	git
i ll try to find a tool with it other tha git and bazaar and report back

4599511
src	attr
it s a simple attr src change

4599528
rsa	dsa
use dsa it tends to be more compact than rsa

4599528
hash	md5
making your input shorter truncating the sha1 hash or using md5 instead for example might make the output shorter too

4599536
post	put
the post action should return an object where you can put tourl right after the post is performed like this

4599566
bytearrayoutputstream	inputstream
i don t have an ide installed here but here s how i think it should go open a bytearrayoutputstream to which you write byte by byte or better buffering in some way of course what you read from your inputstream in

4599626
scrollable	panels
but i can t tell which div has focus in the scrollable panels

4599646
post	get
then it appears that with swfupload v2 you can send additional post values along with the upload and this would be the way to send the autologin key which would then allow your controller to get the user_id

4599649
dlsym	dlopen
my reasoning for this is that ldd on b does not show c and objdump -x b shows references to dlopen dlclose dlsym

4599649
dlsym	dlopen
normally i d use dlsym for this but i need to pass it the handle returned from dlopen which i don t have since b does not expose this

4599649
dlsym	dlopen
edit after writing this i realized i can probably just do another dlopen on the file in my code and the symbols returned via dlsym on that handle should be the same as received via the original dlopen if i m reading the dlopen man page correctly

4599684
serializable	deserialization
i think the topic you need to understand is serializable and deserialization

4599684
serializable	deserialization
serializable briefly is the act of transforming a data structure or object into another format such as xml json binary that can be then turned back into a data structure or object through deserialization

4599684
serializable	deserialization
the answer you linked to discusses how cocoa suggests a developer handle this serializable deserialization lifecycle

4599692
postgresql	mysql
i am converting a few simple mysql stored procedures to postgresql functions and for some reason when i execute the following function it throws an error when executed

4599741
unix	bsd
systems like bsd or unix

4599782
inotifypropertychanged	icommand
these have some base classes like above my viewmodel inherits from viewmodelbase that help expedite the mvvm development like exposing inotifypropertychanged icommand etc

4599790
serializable	deserialization
serializable deserialization from that message instance to actual parameters for a call is usually done by an idispatchmessageformatter iclientmessageformatter

4599790
serializable	deserialization
notice that an ioperationinvoker wouldn t help all that much since that presumes you ve already done message serializable deserialization so it s not really all that useful and the rest of the functionality is fairly simple for basic use cases if you want to roll it yourself

4599800
unix	bsd
some of the original unix commands or rewrites of them are available with bsd licenses and you will run into many of those on true unix bsd and on the mac

4599803
int	boolean
zend will automagically turn int floats and boolean into their respective types with json and yaml

4599816
int	boolean
it seems likeâ aside from performance issuesâ a seq is a map from int to values and a set is a map from values to boolean true if the value is in the set false otherwise

4599852
postgresql	mysql
test means the string test whereas test means the identifier test which postgresql tries to resolve as a column same as using backquotes in mysql

4599919
min	max
now if i change the min and max to -12 and -9 and as for 4 divisions its more complicated

4599943
button	checkbox
where there are checkbox signifying which image the admin has selected and then three submit button approve edit delete

4599943
button	checkbox
if not then if i just use simple button how can i connect them to gather data from the selected checkbox

both your examples work in recent firefox and opera but only the second works in webkit-based browsers google-chrome and safari

4600129
firefox	safari
it s working in firefox and safari on os x but not in firefox or internet explorer 8 on windows

4600151
boost	stl
i ll be more elegant with a good library stl boost whatever you have on the implementation platform and the normalization should be in a separate function so you can replace it with other variations like log as the need arises

4600155
portrait	landscape
i want to create a view controller that supports both landscape and portrait orientations but that can not rotate between them - that is the view should retain its original orientation

4600176

i have a web app that you can choose to click items out of the side bar and it retrieves the contents and displays a popup when you click them in google-chrome and it also works in firefox with firebug enabled but not when its disable

4600203
hash	hmac
also instead of concatenating your secret with the hash string use an hmac

4600216
put	get
that way you can construct an array of known length and put every object in vocabdeckarray into the correct position in a single pass get first object from vocabdeckarray lookup where in belongs in group1array from the dictionary insert into group1array move on to next object

4600234
width	height
i thought that this will be correct but i see red line under return statement and resharper says that new savedstate width height cannot be converted to ts

4600241
free	malloc
basically malloc isn t defined to be thread safe but implementors are free to add implementation to make it thread safe

4600241
sbrk	setrlimit
you might however need to read down into brk sbrk getrlimit and setrlimit and the like to find out what the kernel does

4600281
hide	show
note that the above will hide the delete option completely but the plugin also allows you to show an item while disabling its behaviour by adding _disabled true to the relevant item

4600318
button	checkbox
i have a page where roles are displayed in a list of checkbox you can select which roles you want a user to have and then you click a button to save it

4600330
int	double
i wanted to create a generic vector structure where the user could define the element type int long float double etc. and dimensions

4600364
folder	directory
my guess is it cannot find the javascripts directory even though it is clearly sitting in the site_one folder

4600407
int	boolean
that is a map is a function of a key into a value a seq is a function of an int into a value and a set is a function of a value into a boolean

4600422
children	parent
i m brand new to javascript and jquery so i ve been reading up on it and am trying to check and set inactive a checkbox in a parent list-item when one of the children are checked

4600442
free	malloc
in multithreaded systems malloc and free and new delete do typically use synchronisation primitives to make them safe to call from multiple threads

4600459
pascal	delphi
while learning c# and delphi prism for use with monotouch is rewarding i am looking for a way to re-use code written in ordinary object pascal

4600461
portrait	landscape
i have a separate landscape view of a clock i ve made and i want this to cross dissolve in when the phone is rotated to landscape and then cross dissolve back when it returns to portrait but when i ve tried this in different ways i ve been having problems

4600484
draggable	droppable
ui.draggable is the draggable item that was dropped on the droppable

4600496
min	max
if you notice in his article he never posted the benchmarks for it and instead posted benchmarks for other working code such as calculating averages and finding the min max in parallel

4600499
versioning	upgrade
in any case i agree withthe answer from christopher - tools such as installshield can be used to create a single msi that is either a full install if you haven t already got the product on your machine or it will switch to upgrade mode if it detects an item with the same product code and a lesser versioning number already installed

4600516
swt	windowbuilder	swt	swing	swing	windowbuilder
windowbuilder supports creating swt rcp xwt and swing apps in addition to gwt apps

4600516
swt	windowbuilder	swt	swing	swing	windowbuilder
it was recently announced that google is donating the windowbuilder engine along with the swt and swing tooling to eclipse.org

4600516
swt	windowbuilder	swt	swing	swing	windowbuilder
if you are unable to open a non-gwt file and receive an unknown gui toolkit error this means that you either have a classpath problem our project has not been configured to use any ui toolkit or you have an incomplete installation of windowbuilder for example if you only have the gwt portion of wb loaded you would not be able to edit swt or swing uis

4600535
client-side	server-side
using showdown.js on the client-side and then a different parser on the server-side will result in inconsistent markup between the preview displayed to the client and the version stored in the database

4600598
ubuntu	linux
the client must be available for linux under console as a daemon if possible while on windows it can be something like dropbox or ubuntu one

4600624
explode	fgetcsv
you may have to create a custom parser just using fgets rather than fgetcsv and then explode each line pulled in on the separator character which is pretty much what fgetcsv is supposed to do

4600652
freemarker	velocity
i believe don t quote me freemarker came about because velocity lost momentum

4600662
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
everything works fine in localhost but i have a problem login from other browsers like safari and google-chrome in firefox its ok

subtraction	addition
most systems nowadays use two s complement since it lets the computer do the same exact operation for addition subtraction without caring about the particular sign of the number

4600737
sqldatasource	linqdatasource
probably the easiest way to do it would be to utilize the sqldatasource control to use parameterized stored procedures in leu of the linqdatasource

4600737
gridview	sqldatasource
here is an article with an example of utilizing stored procedures for crud operaitons using a gridview bound to a sqldatasource

4600755
width	height
if i assign width and height to any value as in the code below i don t see anything drawn

4600755
width	height
what is the use of width and height

4600755
width	height
i assumed the width height would set the area that this sprite could be drawn upon but based on this i m probably wrong

4600764
rss	feed
you can use the syndication feed tool under my settings and tools to generate an rss url documentation here and track changes versus build results to determine the status building and previously succeeded failed

4600772
actualheight	actualwidth
i have to select wpf path from 0 0 because actualwidth and actualheight start from 0 0

4600805
pull	push
communication from server to client can be based on pull or push model

4600807
boost	stl
with that in mind learn the stl and learn boost

4600874
for-loop	arrays
you can use a similar technique of moving things into arrays to take your block of cout lines listing each material and ore requirements and turn it into a for-loop

4600877
post	get
to get the latest post for any topic you get a slice off the end of the most recent row for that topic

it wasn t that actualwidth and actualheight were zero but that their values were relative to 0 0 on the inkcanvas

4600987
hide	show
there s no way to hide the key if you embed it in the source code a debugger f.i. will show it

4601032
put	get	for-loop	arrays
type casting juggling didnt get me anywhere put the whole string as one element of arrays and the best solution i ve found is simply using a for-loop to construct the arrays

4601044
apache	lighttpd
consider that php is usually hosted behind some web server that is already using a front controller pattern - apache or lighttpd or similar

4601049
button	checkbox
just cannot get the feedback to the checkbox to say yes it was ticked when the search button was selected

4601082

4601177
width	height
the width and the height of the canvas are determined from the maximum x and y coordinates of the control points

4601177
actualheight	actualwidth
the only way i see around this is to find the actualwidth and actualheight manually from the coordinates in the path

4601208
spaces	delimiter
use the string.split method and use the spaces character as the delimiter

4601214
post	get
you can send a post or get variable in your iphone http call and use that with a switch on the php end to get a function name

due to the way browsers handle css selectors you cannot select a parent element based on its children

4601291
letter-spacing	font-size
text styling determination css equivalents of font-size font-weight line-height letter-spacing font-variant text-decoration etc.

4601307
width	margin
i ve tried varying the width property to see how that affects the rendering of the pages and found that in all cases the page renders incorrectly always adding in a margin of some sort

4601401
children	parent
find the element with class gallery_lightview find all of its children elements no matter how deeply nested that are img elements then remove each of their immediate parent elements in this case a tags

4601647
versioning	upgrade
try to upgrade to the latest versioning and try again

4601719
jar	war
the solution of the above problem is that this particular gateauthorisationmanagerremote class remove from multiple jar and war

4601719
jar	war
class file exist in multiple jar or war file so we have to remove multiple existence of this classes and only keep one existence of this class

4601744
getter	setter
a pojo does not need to have setter or getter and it would more clearly be a pojo without them

4601744
getter	setter
your comments suggests you intended to add getter and setter to follow the javabean standard and as such this is not a pojo as it is intended to comply with the javabean convention

4601756
jar	war
also i use exploded deployment so the question is only about jar files not unpacking ear war

4601757
freemarker	velocity
while i would probably go with freemarker or velocity myself i am surprised at what you call

4601775
xwpf	hwpf
the partner to hwpf for the new word 2007 .docx format is xwpf

when first encountering the animation system most people imagine that it works by repeatedly calling the set accessor for the properties

4602508
accessor	properties
properties set in the usual fashion via the set accessor or via attributes in xaml are the next highest priority but you can see that templates styles and triggers all provide other sources for when there s no local properties value

4602508
persistent	transient
you could consider this to be a sort of demotion of the property - it converts it from a high-priority but transient animation-supplied property value into a slightly lower-priority but more persistent local value. i d be inclined to modify the code a little

4604316
maven	m2e
do i have some clash between the versions of eclipse maven and m2e

4604324
free	realloc
if you were lucky and the same block was used you just continue writing otherwise you are writing to the old place and end up writing in a place you shouldn t because realloc free s the old block internally

4604357
free	realloc
the problem is that after realloc the memory pointed to by d_array is considered free so the code actually writes to the free memory

4604363
folder	directory
the database has the same about of free space as before the mdf file is the same in size and there s no additional files in the directory with the mdf and ldf files so it looks like the data has been moved between tabled but have not been migrated to the blobstorage folder as i expected

4604418

without the clearfix the parent div wouldn t have a height due to it s floating children

4604492
children	parent
the clearfix will make the parent consider the floating children

4604505
sorting	filtering
note that this gets very complex if you re doing other things to the table such as client-side sorting filtering etc

4604517
subtract	add
you should probably have a database of holidays to check against and if the value of day plus minus x equals a value in the database add subtract another since not everyone has the same holidays

groovy	gpath
i would recommend doing this in groovy which provides gpath essentially an xpath implementation for the groovy language. the groovy syntax is very succint and powerful as described in my blog and mixes seamlessly with the he java language groovy is compiled down to java class files

4604721
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested this in firefox 3.6 and google-chrome 9

4604801
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
you can either use a different container than the primitive array anything that implements inotifycollectionchanged liked should do or you have to call raisepropertychanged statuses each time you update the statuses array or as metioned in another answer use one class that implement inotifypropertychanged that contains 4 properties

4604804
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

as for coalescing an expression to a certain default in case it is null there are functions that do this in all major databases ex. coalesce nvl isnull ifnull

4604891
m2e	pom.xml
use the dependency hierachy view in the eclipse m2e pom.xml editor and find your jar on the right hand side...then click on it

4604891
maven	m2e
if it is gone from the project specific maven dependencies library and yet still within the deploy directory then you have the honor of filing a bug with m2e

4604893
zipoutputstream	zipfile
i create zipfile using zipoutputstream

4604919
hex	binary
if your assembler compiler output is binary code you need a bin2hex utility to convert the binary code to hex format

i m not that concerned with a solution that works in ie--just one that works in safari google-chrome firefox

4604968
hash	md5
if you want to be as secure as possible you should use some different hash algorithm md5 is known to have some collision attacks

4604975
getter	setter
the best way is to use getter and setter - for example

4604976
hash	salt
adding a salt to each letter would achieve nothing more than adding the same salt to the whole string and could possibly reduce the entropy of the hash rather than increasing it

4604978
implements	extends
i ask this because i have like 10 of them that implements the same interface but they also have the same implementation for some methods so i would like to reuse the code by placing all the same implementations in middle object that extends enum and it is also the superclass of all the others i need

4604993
hash	salt
a better hash algorithm and a good salt would be a good start

4605003
filtering	grouping
people fields filtering to a chosen sharepoint grouping where the user did not have permissions to view the membership of the grouping

4605019
superclass	subclassing
this in brief states that every instance of a subclassing should be acceptable whenever an instance of a superclass is expected

4605019
superclass	subclassing
and generally a proper subclassing is a specialization of its superclass

4605019
superclass	subclassing
in other words the set of valid subclassing instances is should be always a subset of the superclass instance set

4605033
width	height
i would think since the canvas uses data points and not screen coordinates that i should still be able to use my salary to determine the height of the background element but still use the chart width to make sure the rectangle goes all the way cross screen

4605034
put	get
to get a helpful answer to your question you might want to put some more effort into phrasing it

4605093
implements	extends
i ask this because i have like 10 of them that implements the same interface but they also have the same implementation for some methods so i would like to reuse the code by placing all the same implementations in middle object that extends enum and it is also the superclass of all the others i need

4605111
ostream	istream
it occurs even in the standard library where iostream derives from both istream and ostream and both of these derive from ios_base

4605156
mvp	presenter
i guess if you were using mvp your view and presenter would have no idea no references to whatever orm you are using

4605220
put	get
when i put in a cd i get a uri string which looks like file media cdrom0 which i can understand

4605302
console.readline	console.writeline
console.writeline console.readline and console.readkey are your friends

4605508

4605992
versioning	upgrade
if any bugs are identified and the vendor wants to deliver a new versioning you should ideally roll back the cloned environment back to when you took the snapshot and have them perform the upgrade scenario again

4606026
versioning	upgrade
upgrade your php versioning - 5.3.5 and 5.2.17 once released probably today include the fix

4606027
opera	firefox
this code is more robust and if firefox or opera supports one of the api s you don t have to check for their browsers anyway

freebsd	linux
this won t work on anything but linux 2.6.20 onwards but at least if you re on freebsd instead it s described in a man page

4606459
converter	multibinding
sounds like you re looking for a multibinding with a converter capable of evaluating an expression

4606503
google-chrome	firefox
try testing this on 2 different browsers firefox and google-chrome as they will not share the session as the session id is normally stored in a cookie

4606512
stateless	stateful
in java the difference between stateful stateless web frameworks is usually described as the difference between action-based and component-based frameworks

4606513
hash	md5
reversing an md5 hash

4606542
hash	salt
if the hash was salt this will become troublesome ofcourse

4606571
hash	md5
i wrote an app a few years back that brute-forces md5 hash against wordlists and previously-cracked md5 hash it finds via search engines see if it comes up with anything for you

4606597
cvs	svn
take for example any version control system svn cvs git etc.

4606624
draggable	droppable
you could give each of your draggable and droppable a reference to their parent model and access the property this way it s up to you

4606653
accelerometer	gyroscope
the emulator has accelerometer and gyroscope enabled in config.ini but it uses api 8 android 2.2

4606653
accelerometer	gyroscope
when i list the available sensors i only get the accelerometer no gyroscope or compass

4606728
width	height
my problem is canvas is too much big i would like automatic resize stretch canvas on window height width

4606728
width	height
so set width and height is not solution because this canvas consist other canvas

4606733
junit	testng
to test a rest service you can try rest assured which makes it very simple to test rest services and validating the response in java using junit or testng

4606806
many-to-many	one-to-many
an msdn blog linked over to asp.net mvc entity framework modifying one-to-many and many-to-many relationships there s a link to the previous in the series in the first paragraph

4606811
converter	multibinding
the code worked just fine when i wasn t using a multibinding and converter but i need the multibinding so i can pass some extra information to the command

4606823
width	height
how about removing specified width and height

4606847
google-chrome	firefox
when running the following block of code firefox and google-chrome output while ie7 8 output

4606865
invalidoperationexception	argumentexception
in this case it doesn t really matter what exception type you use because you should never see it in production anyway - argumentexception if the problem was with name or invalidoperationexception if the problem was with the state of the object defining mymethod would be fine choices in that situation but the specific exception type shouldn t be documented or else it becomes part of the api

4606914
portrait	landscape
i have this code set to make the clockview appear when the phone is rotated to landscape and then to make it go back to the mainview when it s returned to portrait

4606914
portrait	landscape
but when it does go back to portrait the portrait view is in landscape mode

4606918
submit	submission
i would suggest not allowing a submit at all and submission it via ajax and not using a blank action attribute

4606960
mouseup	mousedown
instead the problem is that if the element is changed between mousedown and mouseup the click does not fire

4606960
mouseup	mousedown
the click event will occur after the mousedown and mouseup events

4606960
mouseup	mousedown
ie8 fires mousedown for first node mouseup for updated node but does in fact fire click using the updated node as the event source

4606990
min	max
none of the elements have their max occurs or min occurs value set

4607007
daemon	cron
i need to invoke my shell script every two days i read about cron daemon that it can help me invoking scripts periodically so can you give an example how can i make my script able to be invoked by cron daemon

4607016
multiplying	add
you can copy one into 1 or 2 channels of the other you can use logical operations like and or or xor you can use arithmetic operations like add multiplying and multiplyscale these operations will saturate values larger than 255

4607027
typedef	struct
typedef struct queue list

4607034
integer	unsigned
casting an ns u integer to an unsigned int runs the risk of truncating it on some architectures x86_64 for instance

4607036
implements	extends
elimination of the need to extends a base class implements an interface

4607037
strcpy	strtok	strcpy	strcmp	strtok	strcmp
forgot to check for null on strtok it will return null when done and you cannot use that null on strcpy strcmp etc

4607037
strcpy	strtok
note that you do a strcpy right after the strtok you should check for null before doing that using p as a source

4607059
salt	md5
how about an autonumber field and having a 2nd field that s an md5 of the id + a secret salt

4607080
strncmp	strcmp
if you insist on using c strings i d suggest using strncmp instead of strcmp

4607092
google-chrome	firefox
support for the scoped feature was added to firefox in version 21 and added in google-chrome behind a flag in version 20

4607121
daemon	cron
note it s actually a bit ambiguous if your cron daemon will run that every two days on even days 2 4 6.. or odd days 1 3 5.. and it may switch these depending on how many days are in the current month

4607160
range	max
will flag -1 if a number can t be chosen within the max range and not in the disqualifying list

4607168
width	height
as some height width info is farther out in the header

4607168
width	height
return array width width height height

4607168
width	height
return array width width height height

4607168
width	height
return array width width height height

4607180
min	max
progressbar wants you to enter min value starting point and max value ending point and wants how much step will passed at performstep function

4607182
hide	show
you can ideally program it to show hide elements based on the current section and also toggle certain classes based on the section

4607210
libxml2	tinyxml
you could use libxml2 included in iphone sdk touchxml tinyxml or tbxml

4607285
width	height
let s say the camera is at the origin and z units away from the box the screen is one unit away from the camera and the box was depth d width 2w and height 2h

4607285
width	height
therefore the width of the outer box on the screen is 2w z the width of the inner box 2w z+d and analogously for the height

4607310
lisp	scheme
i imagine scheme and perhaps lisp could be made more user friendly by using a different syntax

4607324
nullreferenceexception	argumentexception
throw argumentexception if you have reason to think that the caller might have screwed up nullreferenceexception if you think that the getobject author might have a bug in his code

4607327
google-chrome	firefox
users are not logging into this site and users are using anything from ie to firefox to google-chrome

4607342
disk	ram
this is the basis for virtual memory from the point of view the process has some ram but the kernel has moved it to the hard disk in swap space

4607353
public	protected
public methods are intended to be used by other objects while protected private methods are to be hidden from the outside

4607353
public	protected
addendum correction for controllers you should mark the helper methods as protected private and only the actions themselves should be public

4607353
public	protected
the framework will never route any incoming http calls to actions methods that are not public so your helper methods should be protected in that way

4607360
google-chrome	safari
the resource tracking tools in safari and google-chrome are great for visualizing load times of various page components but the view is totally obscured when keep-alive pings take place periodically in my case chartbeat sends a ping every 15 seconds so all the other load times are compressed into a tiny unhelpful section while the chartbeat pings are stretched out across the view

4607403
accessor	properties
declared properties fundamentally take the place of accessor method declarations

4607403
accessor	properties
when you synthesize a properties the compiler only creates any absent accessor methods

4607457
valgrind	callgrind
valgrind includes the callgrind tool that can profile your code

4607460
content-disposition	content-length	content-disposition	content-type	content-length	content-type
that said the text csv content-type header you were using is correct although you may also want to output the content-length and content-disposition headers

4607474
mouse	keyboard
i have an alternate language installed but it can only be switched via the mouse i have disabled the keyboard shortcuts

4607509
int	double	int	chars
i was able to create safearrays with arrays with fixed size elements like double int chars arrays and it works fine using something like this

4607511
jlabel	jprogressbar
i have a progress dialog window which contains 3 jcomponents jlabel jprogressbar jbutton which is used as default dialog window in different parts of the application from different threads

4607533
rss	feed
this is the kind of problem rss or atom feed were designed for so look for a link for an rss feed if there is one

4607533
rss	feed
if you re lucky they ll provide many different rss feed for different aspects of the site the way stackoverflow does for questions for instance

4607550
rss	feed
sounds to me like you re referring to rss or atom feed

4607562
dictionary	map
i like to use a datatemplate defined in a resource dictionary within app.xaml or elsewhere to map a viewmodel to a view like this

4607565
children	parent
but then selects from those ctes in parent ctes using children ctes doesn t use nolock in presumption that it is already nolock d

4607574
onresume	onpause
your onstart method just enables the timer while the onstop method disables it onpause and onresume can do likewise if you want

4607579
gif	png
unfortuantely actionscript doesn t support gif encoding so when dealing with a gif with transparency we have to png encode it in actionscript before posting it to php

4607583
width	height
notice they are coping a buffer of width height 3

4607609
google-chrome	firefox
i am using the latest syntaxhighlighter within my app and for some reason the toolbars do not show in ie firefox or google-chrome

4607610
post	get
you will pass all the information of your customer service and invoice across pages via form post or get

4607625
int	chars
and not as int with lookup table or mapped string constants or chars or anything like that

4607654
post	get
any other variables passed would be available via the get request or post

4607654
post	get
the controller initialized by the get post using a router a router is a class that detects the class method from the uri and then finds the correct controller and executes it along with its method

4607780
opml	xml	opml	rss	georss	kml
dataformats listed at this particular sites are csv georss html json kml opml opensearch php rdf rss text xml xspf yaml csv georss

4607805
mouse	keyboard
i still want to be able to use the mouse wheel to scroll as well as use the keyboard shortcuts that i have written

4607806
public	protected
it would be impossible to prevent protected methods from being public if the derived class wanted it so as you could just write a minor wrapper and done

4607835
getter	setter
the proxy derives from the object under test and doesn t hide or override any behavior but it does provide internally-visible getter setter and or methods that make calls to non-public members of the object under test allowing me to tell the object to perform certain actions of which i can then view the results without requiring the test to also depend on proper integration within the object or making the method or some other member of interest public in production code just for testing purposes

4607897
folder	directory
however if you are planning to deploy assemblies a b c separately from assemblies d e f for one reason or another keeping the output directory separate will ensure that the correct assemnbly and only its dependencies are in the output folder

4607900
uiview	subviews
i have many views in my nib and most of them contain subviews uiview s uilabel s etc.

4607922
implements	extends
so soon i decided to extends my main object class to implements a parcelable one as shown below

4607929
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this looks fine in google-chrome firefox safari

4607931
firefox	safari
if you add a negative margin to the button span it will move half the distance in firefox than it does in safari

4607997
versioning	upgrade
the previous stable versioning of nhibernate was 2.1.2 and as far as i can tell there hasn t yet been a 2.2 although in the future there might yet be one -- as i understand it nh 3 targets .net 3.5 and i d imagine there are a lot of people who can t upgrade yet

4608058
paradox	bde
probably written using some borland tools i guess it uses bde and paradox as its database

4608059
mp3	speex
it would likely be far easier to convert speex to mp3 server-side

4608073
put	get
1 the simplest way to get custom class data in intent is get the data to primitive types then put this data by putstring or whatever data type then add a constructor to corresponding sent data to activity from set in custom object in activity

4608105
width	height
edit make sure you set the height and width of the div s to match your image size

4608126
rss	feed
i have added an rss feed on a zen-cart store php 5.2 apache2

4608141
google-chrome	firefox
this works in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

4608158
public	protected
there are 3 modifiers private protected default and public

4608173
rss	feed
you could set a cron to write the rss feed to the filesystem every 5 10 ..

4608190
decoder	encoder
i m looking for an aac encoder decoder library that works on linux and windows for a c c++ app

4608277
post	get
an alternative to doing get on the login resource is doing a post rest purists will probably not like me now and passing in the creds in the body

4608291
accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
i guess it s a good idea to always use private but i ve never bothered in the past because i generally use properties accessor for almost all ivar access except in init and dealloc methods

4608293
put	get
my web application will need to be able to tell my daemon to do list get put delete move and rename files to a given ftp server for a given user account

4608362
post	get
so the best recommendation one could get you if you append your question with the current jqgrid definition define which is the best id for the data row and post the test xml data

4608375
put	get
just put a hack together to get the

4608451
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
with regards to the second part of your question how to vary the width of the line depending on the speed of writing you should be able to achieve this by taking advantage of uitouch s timestamp property in your touchesbegan withevent and touchesmoved withevent method

4608472
public	protected
and i found in my current workspace intellisense can only show the public methods it cannot show me the protected methods but it can compile and the app runs well

4608472
public	protected
if i create a new workspace it s the same that the intellisense can only show me the public methods not protected methods

4608527
move	drag
whenever the drag helper move sortable runs through its list of elements and uses this method to determine whether the drag helper has passed over one

4608557
implements	extends
i have a base class that extends listactivity that i want to use to implements a lot of common code used on multiple different activity implementations

4608633
mouse	keyboard
three models - keyboard mouse monitor

4608635
min	max
for example if max is set to 100 and the user slides min to 150 you can set max at 150 as well

4608638
nscoding	nscopying
it s a nice sanity check since it will error if you try to do it outside the class -- pretty much the only place to use direct structure access is when implementing nscoding or nscopying and those will still work -- but it doesn t really buy you much

4608642
post	get
you ll need to post the error messages you get if it doesn t work out or consult someone with solid dotnetnuke experience

4608694
post	get
this is a valid pattern also known as gpg get post get pattern

4608717
awt	swing
i would also just drop the desktop application stuff awt swing

4608721
hash	hmac
if you want integrity not possible to tamper with the content of the cookie you should use a keyed hash hmac for example

4608730
awt	swing
i m able to use fullscreen exclusive mode with normal swing components but for some reason when i use awt components i only see a black screen in fullscreen mode

4608730
switching	screens
upon switching back into the application i get a black screens again

4608733
client-side	server-side
to be clear my goal is to register a click on a button server-side not just client-side

4608736
ceil	floor	sum	floor
for a fixed value of m the numbers to choose are ceil n-m m+1 and floor n-m m+1 in whatever combination makes the sum work out

4608741
daemon	cron
another way to go about this might be to run your script as a daemon and instead of having cron run it every five minutes put your logic in a loop

4608771
put	get
i won t go into details but you really want to put your extensions into an initializer or a gem since they get reloaded between requests in dev mode

4608771
put	get
if you put the code into a plugin it won t get reloaded and you ll get very mysterious errors such as a copy of xxx has been removed from the module tree but is still active

4608863
ubuntu	linux
my system is linux ubuntu 10.10

4608864
uibutton	uinavigationitem
but you don t specify a uibutton for the leftbarbuttonitem property of the returned uinavigationitem

4608885
jobs	cron
i agree with what other people have said above basically cron always runs the job at the specified time there is a tool called at which lets you run jobs in the future so you could batch a job for 5 minutes and then at runtime decide when do i need to run again and submit a job to at for whatever time you need it to run again be it 5 minutes 10 minutes or an hour

4608889
children	parent
unfortunately the order of the db elements is not guaranteed but what i d like to do is have the information displayed sort of like in windows explorer with the children directly underneath the parent

4608913
google-chrome	firefox
my code works perfectly in google-chrome and ie7 but fails in firefox 3 and presumably firefox 2 but for different reasons - notably the lack of a paste event

4608913
put	get
set a timeout to get the html from the new div clean it and put it into the old selection which i grabbed in step 1

4609003
rsa	3des
i would take 2 or 3 of the fields - memberid datecreated and perhaps email and concatenate them together with a random secret key and use an encryption algorithm like rsa or 3des to encrypt the whole string and pass it as a parameter in the link you include in the activation email

4609037
jlist	jtable
try using a jlist or jtable that contains items in your queue

4609057
put	get	post	get	post	put
note that while get put and delete have very specific meanings in the context of rest post is more vague and essentially means to take some action

4609057
put	get	post	get	post	put
only use post in this manner when get put and delete do not have the intended meaning

4609057
put	get
but when the client does get to determine the url of the newly created resource the correct verb would be put

4609069
ubuntu	linux
i have also compiled and am using opencv 2.2 on linux ubuntu without any problem

4609070
hide	show
i want to implement a simple client side javascript function to hide the expand button after press it and show the collapse button and vice versa

4609087
ant	maven
there are plenty ways to automate this with ant maven or other tools but manual is just fine

4609137
pop-up	dialog
below i have extended the command to pop-up a dialog for the commit message and to give a nice warning if no git repository was found

4609142
int	chars
my guess would be that since you didn t enclose it in quotes and the column was a chars varchar column mysql tried to do an implicit conversion of the varchar column to an int

4609176
profiling	benchmarking
they seem like the sort of thing which would be more useful to a webgl browser implementer with a profiling than to someone trying to choose between webgl implementations platforms to decide which is likely to run apps best c.f the history of opengl benchmarking where all sorts of nonsense used to be claimed for synthetic polygon-per-second numbers until specviewperf came along and imposed some realistic real-world test cases

4609179
post	get
i get an access token and try to post to the page s wall

4609182
boost	stl
the point that bugs me the most is that not only those simple a and b structs are binary compatible but about any container is if you use it with types you can expect to be binary compatible i ran some tests with gcc 4.5 and clang 2.8 on both custom containers and stl boost ones

4609187
int	chars
i want to know if there is some kind of typeof operator to see if you re dealing with int float long chars unsigned chars long long or whatever

4609231
objectcontext	transactionscope
using transactionscope in your controller service is a good start since the objectcontext respects it

4609241
hide	show
in the function where you are implementing the hide and show template put

4609258
onfocus	onblur	subtract	add
it d probably be cleaner to add and subtract a class with the onblur and onfocus

4609284
ndepend	fxcop
i m thinking of things like stylecop fxcop and ndepend all of which allow the creation of custom rules with varying amounts of pain

4609302
fadein	hide
#prod_div hide .html data fadein

4609319
pull	push
so pull from the client rather than push from the master

4609337
multiplying	multiplication
when performing compile-time multiplication you should probably multiplying 32-bit numbers having 64-bit results

4609351
pop-up	dialog
which works fine but if i run the same compiled app on a different computer where google chrome is renamed chrome i get a pop-up dialog asking where google chrome is

4609353
google-chrome	firefox
with jquery on firefox and google-chrome i can just dynamically change the data in a listbox with statements or whichever way i need to

4609380
rss	feed
i m attempting to parse an rss feed to display images only

4609380
post	get
i found this old simplepie forum post but was unable to get the code working

4609426
ilist	iqueryable
where repository returns iqueryable and services returns ilist

4609426
ilist	iqueryable
and then get the ria services domain service methods to always return ilist or domain class and mark all these methods as invoke so that we don t need to return iqueryable

4609475
hide	show
what i need to do is when a user checks unchecks the permission_check input then it should show hide the radio_option elements for that list item

4609550
fadein	fadeout
i m not sure if i got your fadein fadeout exactly the same but you see where to change it

4609607
google-chrome	firefox
i am not worried about this working on ie 6 but currently am on my mac and have only tried firefox and google-chrome at this point

4609617
rss	feed
rss feed - we use rss feed a lot at my company to integrate existing site s data with our apps

4609617
rss	feed
it s fast and most sites already have an rss feed available

4609617
rss	feed
the problem with this is not all sites implement the rss standard properly so if you re pulling data from many rss feed across many sites then make sure you write your code so that you can add exceptions and filters easily

4609644
hash	md5
since all data can then be described in 128bits using md5 then its possible to encounter hash collisions

4609697
vsto	add-in
josh vsto already loads each add-in into it s own appdomain

4609699
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
tested in ie7-8 opera google-chrome and firefox

4609699
google-chrome	firefox
but sadly i checked it on my mac box and for whatever reason it s so slow it s almost not even useable in google-chrome and firefox

4609705
g++	gcc
compiler g++ gcc 4.5.1 20100924 red hat 4.5.1-4

4609731
folder	directory
it copies all of the files into the share folder in the staging area but the underlying directory structure is lost

4609770
config	ini
there is a lot of modules on cpan about reading writing ini files but every modules i have tested so far config general config inifiles config simple config tiny failed to read my mysql my.cnf file

4609795
int	double
works for int floats double unsigned shorts or any custom types constructible from int 0 and orderable

4609830
inherited	properties
for example some properties are inherited from their parents meaning that a span not inside a div will be rendered differently in my original css example

4609862
apache	nginx
just to add to that it s recommended to set up static files on a different server running nginx or other optimized server not apache

4609893
int	double
in a nutshell the double type defines a value for infinity while the int type doesn t

4609897
filtering	grouping
it can exports as csv then we use excel do filtering grouping the data

4609959
cvs	svn
cvs2svn -s repo svn my favorite project src repo cvs my favorite project src

4609959
cvs	svn
the basic idea is to just use svn or git instead of cvs -

4609959
cvs	svn
and that can be done by converting the cvs repo to svn or git using cvs2svn or cvs2git which we should be doing anyway

4609981
pop-up	dialog
i have windows application form on which i have lookup search form which pop-up as dialog form on top of first form

4610014
post	get
i did this for building a pseudo 3d bar chart and it was actually easier than expected i haven t yet but i ll post the code along with some other charts i ve made at need to reboot to linux to get that example will post within the next 4 hours

4610021
pop-up	dialog
this pop-up a modal dialog with a textbox and returns the entered string

4610027
wtforms	formencode
i also recommend wtforms it s much easier to use than formencode and have builtin sqlalchemy extensions

4610062
int	double
in short this method should keep asking for the value of querytxt where t is always int or double .

4610085
post	put
rails determines the post put or delete request by using the _method attribute instead

4610105
folder	directory
i had this problem and indeed my pyqt source folder was in a directory which had a space character somewhere in the path

4610136
ilist	iqueryable
in reality whether your methods return ilist or iqueryable execution of the expression is still deferred to the server so from the client s perspective it probably doesn t make a lot of difference

4610140
button	checkbox
there s a checkbox next to each name and button for add to group and remove from group

4610140
button	checkbox	draggable	droppable
this works as a plain html form with no javascript required however when the javascript runs all the checkbox and the two button are removed and the two lists become draggable and droppable

4610184
jms	jta
the really confusing thing is that i can successfully update the logging level for every other category in the system jms jta etc

4619119
accessor	ivar
i d go the accessor route personally mostly because class members shouldn t have to be told where to find an object dereferenced by an ivar anyway

4619119
accessor	ivar
if you re accessing something that s an ivar within the same class i d use the ivar directly or an accessor

4619160
textview	imageview
you need to wrap each imageview textview pair in a linearlayout

tell each textview to layout below the one above and each imageview to layout to the right of it s textview

4619202
modifiers	sealed
use the sealed modifiers in

4619205
put	get
maybe not the ideal solution but if you put your inset div in the middle of your text rather than at the top and get rid of the top margin it will wrap like you want it to

4619237
filesystems	ntfs
on the other hand you could use something like fuse and ntfs-3g to access those two dirs in the original ntfs filesystems corresponding to c

4619249
textview	imageview
your getview needs to return a linearlayout or relativelayout or whatever containing an imageview and a textview

4619270

uiview	subviews
i got a question to you i got a uiscrollview in my application containing numerous subviews all direct subclasses of uiview

post	put
i understand that i have to put the post url somewhere but the attribute in doens t work

4619847
public	protected

however such consideration is restricted by the public protected private inhertiance modifier to but only by itself private inherited or it s subclassing protected inherited

4619950
int	chars
this could probably work but i suspect it might be horribly inefficient in practice given that every int value from every item of every type in the whole system would end up in the same massive table - and the same for every chars 128 value etc

4619952
children	parent
if this is not your case then you should use the xpath expression to select the parent elc and after that use simple dom method to get the children

4619955

it works flawlessly in firefox and safari but in ie6 the vtip tooltip displays properly then right afterwards the original browser-generated tooltip also displays right over the top of the vtip tooltip

4620124
put	get
anything you put at the end of the url counts as the querystring which is what get fills

4620147
google-chrome	firefox
unless you set what the default browser is ie firefox google-chrome etc then you ll have to figure out what the default browser is and use its api to do this work if it s possible

4620147
post	get
what would probably be must faster and more efficient would be to open the default browser by invoking a url with start process and pass the information on the query string this is doing a get instead of a post which i know isn t what you re asking for

4620157
nsbezierpath	nsimage
specifically the nsbezierpath lets you draw shapes and nsimage lets you work with pngs

4620158

awt	swing
if you are using java2d to paint your game graphics you should be able to use the the awt or swing text components to render your text

4620534
migrate	upgrade
also i ve thought about writing the __callstatic method as usual with the 5.2 and then calling the methods explicitly for example registry __callstatic some_func array val val2 val3 and keeping things simpler that way even being easier to migrate when they do upgrade to 5.3

4620636
int	boolean
gfortran is expecting boolean for the logical operators and the code is providing int

what you could do is create a class that produces this sort of block given a certain width and height of two blocks it s trying to link up

4620735

4620845
int	boolean
it is not standard fortran to apply logical boolean operators to int variables

4620855

google-chrome	firefox
reading the contents of a file selected by an upload input will be possible with the file api which has some support in newer browsers firefox and more recently google-chrome

2 i also would like to make it that when i click on one of the images it expands grow animation to the full width and height of the containing div the black area

4621039
fflush	gets
if you really can t refactor the erroneous business code in your jsp s into fullworthy servlet business classes there where they belongs then your best bet is to increase the http response buffer size in the server config and pray that nowhere a fflush is been invoked before the exception occurs in the jsp and you don t get outofmemoryerror failures when it gets busy on your webapp

i have a custom listview made up of an imageview and a textview

4621695
width	height
sounds like ie is computing the width and height attributes for #bigimage when it is created and then not updating them when the src is changed

-- basically blocks have children which are wrapped within the parent block

4621828
children	parent
as you can see at the bottom i am checking if parent has children and if it does i call a completely seperate function to output the child blocks outputchildchildblocks -- so instead i would like to have the function recognize the depth of the current location and when it gets to the if statement at bottom if it does have children run itself again add a counter for each level and then instead of

4622272
accessor	properties
but i used a homegrown object framework that uses onmissingmethod for accessor and cfproperty with lots of custom metadata to define properties of the objects

4622272

4623037
width	height
each rectangle will have width height x y

4623037
width	height
i noticed i could do something width 20 height 20 and then object will resize but if the aspect ration is diffenent the rectangles will look distorted

4623056
min	max
that is when row m is inserted into table 1 in table 2 against column 1 which is the row key of table 2 i would save its summation or other aggregational results be it average standard deviation max min etc

google-chrome	firefox
keep in mind that recent webgl implementations from google-chrome and firefox use directx via angle on windows per default

4623123

ria	smartclient	extjs	mootools
extjs smartclient yui mootools etc are all rich internet application ria frameworks that allow you to integrate at the javascript and or google web toolkit levels

4623212
dictionary	map
generator expressions are generally preferred to map and using the dictionary constructor is more canonical than dict.fromkeys

4623241
profiler	visualvm
visualvm is a profiler which comes with java

4623241
profiler	yourkit
yourkit is a commercial profiler which i find better

4623247

4623300
dojo	dwr
they merged with dojo which in my opinion is a better choice than dwr

4623310
ria	smartclient
my recommendation is a ria framework like smartclient or extjs + a rest-based backend built on jersey for example

4623312
put	get
if a lot of your emails get reported as spam then your emails will get put in spam folders

4623381
shadowing	named
the problem isn t that the loop is shadowing the class field the named is already used by the parameter

4623387
config	ini
see the ini file config docs

4623389
inline-functions	inlining
then you use the preprocessor to conditionally include the implementation as part of the header when you want inline-functions so the implementation will be available to all modules but don t include it if you re not inlining so you follow the one definition rule in that case

4623511
superclass	subclassing
but anyway a constructor of a subclassing should always invoke a constructor of the superclass super in your case or super my viewframe for a titled frame

4623555
width	height
i know ie converts width and height differently when there is borders and padding so i included codes in my css to make the navigation look the same in ie as in mozilla and chrome

4623562
google-chrome	firefox
this solution is targeting html4 across google-chrome firefox and ie i don t know if ie6 is needed

4623565
draggable	droppable
i have several pictures in div s the kids can move around on the virtual living room using jquery draggable and droppable but my problem comes from where i want to have a light bulb png image #bulb1 when dragged over the lamp #lamp1 that the background image bulb-off.png of #bulb1 will change to image bulb-on.png once dropped on #lamp1

4623565

fatal download error - libcurl was built with ssl disabled https not supported

4623666
devise	cancan
i ve followed tony amoyal s guide rails authentication with devise and cancan part 2 â restful resources for administrators and created the user controller

4623666
put	get
now when i use curl to make get put delete requests it works fine

4623666
post	get
post requests don t seem to work and get redirected which suggests authentication did not kick in using the provided token

4623702
post	get
i tried to use the _parse_signed_request from the get and post function

4623745
post	get
http protocol dictate that an empty get url and an image or url in css is a get implicit request must be a call to the same url as the one which render the original page and it can be a post as well if you get your page as a post request

4623746
folder	directory
i already added rus folder in directory application languages

4623761
interpreted-language	compiled-language
forget what programming language you use also given that you have huge memory support in these modern computer era you could write good fast programs using interpreted-language and also very bad slow running programs using c c++ compiled-language vice versa

4623815
isometric	draw
it can draw square hexagonal and isometric staggered viewpoints

4623848
min	max
you can use tickinterval 1 day after you set min yyyy-mm-dd and max yyyy-mm-dd of xais

4623988
httprequest	httpresponse
httprequest httpresponse send get through stream and receive the result in c#

4624022
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
explorercanvas â modern browsers like firefox safari google-chrome and opera support the html5 canvas tag to allow 2d command-based drawing

4624030
portrait	landscape
if we have only one layout for both landscape and portrait mode then we can we can solve this by

4624030
portrait	landscape
but the problem is still the if i need to use different layout for both landscape and portrait mode each have a listview with progress bar in each row

4624045
qtreewidget	qtreeview
since qtreewidget inherits from qtreeview you can use

4624047
post	get
this can also be done with other combinations get cookie post cookie etc you get the idea

4624068
next	document.write
javascript document.write hello world works at first but if you change the text it does not work for the next text

4624084
jgit	egit
but as egit uses jgit a git clone written in java i m concerned about its compatibility with the original git

4624084
repo	egit
i won t use egit if there is any chance that my repo get broken just because git and egit didn t agree on how to manage them

4624092
xsl-fo	xslt
because of this i decided to go the pdf generation route using xslt to generate the xsl-fo and using nfop to generate the pdf

4624093
phpunit	simpletest
i have see that some people use phpunit and others use simpletest

4624120
google-chrome	firefox
well at least i thought i could since it works on firefox and google-chrome

4624154
tex	mathjax
i m trying to add tex support to my application and i would like to use mathjax to render mathematics formulas client side since i gave up the

4624172
phpunit	simpletest
simpletest is slightly easier to grasp but phpunit is the best in my opinion at least so if you want to start learning and using a framework start with the one you re going to use when you ll be a master in tdd

4624172
phpunit	simpletest
don t look at if it s easier or harder now because if you start with simpletest for example then you start using zend framework because your boss tells you so you ll have to use phpunit with zf

4624173
hide	show
for starters how would i make it so i can hide it once its up and then show it again via double clicking the bottom of the app

4624178
post	get
is the post and get data a data source and should that kind of data be handled by the model or should it be by the controller

4624198
perforce	svn
so think hard if you really need to branch or if you just do with and live with svn or perforce

4624203
post	get
the reason its not working is because performs a http get and does not post your form

4624313
memcpy	memset
if then things like memset memcpy etc

4624369
post	get
in my approach the controller just makes sure the data sent is using the right method post get and complete via setting defaults or validating forms before sending them to the model

4624426
innodb	myisam
in high performance mysql from o reilly i ve read that myisam could be a good alternative to innodb for logging situations

4624426
innodb	myisam
could myisam really be a good choice to innodb which we are currently using

4624451
post	get
of course there s a lot more to it you can make use of request method get or post in the requestmapping you can define a method annotated with initbinder etc

4624452
children	parent
this is what im after the idea of a parent solution which has many children models that will always be loaded together then if one fails it all fails so the feedback on the breaking tests are given before its too late

4624452
maven	pom.xml
my other problem is also different developers use different ides i.e intellij eclipse netbeans so if this sort of project structure is possible using a maven style pom.xml approach then i need it so different ides should recognise this without manual steps of having to include other modules etc.

4624573
post	get
remember that post implies potential data changes that get request should nt imply

4624577
pylons	pyramid
i d recommend pylons pyramid because it s in python and because i agree with the design decisions and thirdly because you can run it on google app engine as well as on other servers

4624610
repo	egit
even if egit is perfectly compatible with your git repo s it is still buggy as hell

4624614
google-chrome	firefox
the two screenshots are from google-chrome left and firefox right

4624614
width	height
height 200 left 30 top 30 width 300 radius 3

4624677
persistent	transient
i suppose it depends on your needs but it s unlikely you need to stray from the documentation which suggests the application deactivated event as the appropriate place to save persistent and transient state data while close should only save persistent

4624687
google-chrome	firefox
remove this if your browser is not firefox or google-chrome or it will crash

4624701
width	height
for instance i want to create a simple wrapper for functions like png filename width height that would take device name file name and a list of options

4624703
hide	show
i run a program which looks at the listings a decides whether to hide them from being show on the site

4624717
apache	nginx
you often set that website behind apache or nginx used as a proxy but it doesn t call an external progam in any reasonable sense it forwards the http request to the proxied server

4624717
apache	nginx
this is mostly done so you can have multiple sites on the same server and also so you can have apache nginx protect you against incorrect requests

4624717
apache	nginx
most of them are platform language dependent and the only one that is platform independent is really to make a complete webserver and then use apache nginx as a proxy in front in which case the apache nginx strictly isn t necessary any more

4624733
getter	setter
browsers are not obliged to provide a prototype for host objects and neither are they obliged to allow you to override getter and setter for host object properties or respect any attempts to override default behaviour

4624761
rss	feed
applying the ideas discussed above your rss feed will look something like this

4624762
opera	firefox
firefox and opera work fine

4624762
google-chrome	safari
but safari and google-chrome complain that the file input is blank

4624775
post	get
how do i get the submit to post to my login action in my account controller

4624823
rar	gzip	rar	zip
if you don t want to complicate things just use a well defined compression algorithm like zip 7zip gzip rar or something else

4624837
addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication
an addition is faster than a division and a multiplication

4624851
junit	testng
but i never seen any project using assertions except in junit testng tests...

4624884
post	get
javascript initiates an xhr object which calls to a server-side ajax helper using either get post parameters or a json encoded object

4624890
int	double
because my values are of type double or int

4624908
persistent	transient
i can t vote up the previous answer because i don t have sufficient reputation but yes any transient state information should be persistent in the application.deactivated event and then restored in the application.activated event for tombstoning support

4624925
tinyint	boolean
if you do use a bit boolean tinyint field for this

4624958
apache	nginx
but if you mean different domains pointing same ip then it depends on how your server application apache nginx iis etc. handles different domain names

4624966
serializable	deserialization
i had been trying to do an object serialiation deserialization program.when i am giving the file name directly in the fileinputstream my program runs quite finely and i was able to deserialise the object successsfully.but when i tried to use filedialog the serializable program runs finely but the deserialization cannot be done

4624999
nscoding	nscopying
uiimageview doesn t conform to nscopying but it does conform to nscoding

4625066
sudo	passwd
but sudo asks for your passwd

4625088
persistent	transient
any transient state information should be persistent in the application.deactivated event and then restored in the application.activated event for tombstoning support

4625114
imagemagick	minimagick
i don t know if the same applies to minimagick but i guess it does since it uses imagemagick as well

4625128
rss	feed
i provide a dynamic rss feed for search so that a user can subscribe to search results for any search term he likes

4625133
ibatis	mybatis
if hand-optimised sql is something you want then i suggest mybatis formerly known as ibatis

4625167
portrait	landscape
i have the widget working the way i want it until i flip the phone from landscape to portrait

4625168
inherited	subclassing
i m pretty sure that when you do inherited in this manner deleting the subclassing will automatically delete its parent class table data

4625170
put	get
if you send a single couchdb server a put request for a new user document you should get the behavior you want already

4625207
accessor	properties
the stack trace should give you some information about where the call has come from if you break in the properties accessor

4625258
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox google-chrome properly

4625293
rss	feed
do the least surprising thing and return an empty feed - the structure remains the same as with any other rss feed but there are no item elements

4625293
rss	feed
edit before you take the user to the rss feed you could show some sort of preview - here s the link to your feed which currently contains n results

4625295
pygobject	pycairo	pygtk	pycairo	pygtk	pygobject
the error you describe is usually caused by the python bindings pygtk pygobject pycairo being unable to load a dll it needs to function properly

4625295
pygobject	pycairo	pygtk	pycairo	pygtk	pygobject
leftmost one is not compatible with the pygtk pygobject pycairo versions you use

4625295
pygobject	pycairo	pygtk	pycairo	pygtk	pygobject
the separate pygtk pygobject pycairo packages you ve used before or you ll be in

4625309
bash	subshell
as far as i know there are two ways to create local variables in a bash function create a subshell or declare every variable as local

4625354
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it s the same whether google-chrome firefox or safari so it s clearly just my code

4625386
portrait	landscape
after letting a messagebox popup and change orientation from portrait to landscape i found that the ui under the messagebox didnâ t change orientation from portrait to landscape as expected

4625426
folder	directory
i m trying to keep my root directory clean by not dumping the cake folder in the directory but i don t want the url to be www.example.com cake

4625506
put	get
id 99999999999999 what do i put to in to get it to redirect to another page or echo fail

4625545
post	get
from the two inputs i can see your values should appear in the _post variable as _post textfield222 and _post textfield2222 for the post method and _get textfield222 and _get textfield2222 if the form is using the get method

4625557
ienumerable	iqueryable
and it should work the same way for iqueryable and ienumerable

4625587
des	aes
the problem is that you are encrypting in c# with aes also known as rjindael but trying to decrypt in java with des

4625588
draggable	droppable
i ve made a two small examples on jsfiddle the first one using sortable and the second using draggable droppable

4625589
calloc	malloc
alternatively you could use calloc instead of malloc

4625619
maven	m2e
you can configure this in project properties build path order and export or use maven and m2e

4625670
hide	show
to show a div on textbox click i would use the jquery show and hide methods

4625670
hide	show
create your content in asp.net and use 1 jquery function to hide the div when the page loads on browser not server and another to show them

4625740
width	height
updatedisplaylist will give you the height and width of the container which you can use to recalculate size and position of the rectangles

4625750
ienumerable	iqueryable
if you cast an iqueryable to an ienumerable and then call one of the extension methods where ... in your question then the one on enumerable version will be called not the queryable one

4625765
inherited	properties
note no versions of internet explorer including ie8 support the properties values inherited or collapse

4625766
rss	feed
i used this solution to read and parse a rss feed from an asp.net website

4625773
post	get
create a simple http server could be php ruby whatever with a simple interface get post with a backing database could my mysql sql server so nosql whatever

4625787
stdout	stderr
while and until and admittedly if look at the exit code of the test not at any text that may or may not be generated on stdout or stderr

4625809
post	get
the url for both is meetings but when i get meetings i am routed to the def index action and when i post meetings i am routed to the def create action

4625821
x86	64bit
and on top of that 64bit sp1 needs to be installed like this install x86 file and then install x64 file on 64bit machine

4625830
typedef	typename
however i d suggest that you make moopack a typedef or nested class called pack inside moo itself in which case you can easily access it by typename x pack inside the template

4625887
jboss	glassfish
note the above code is jboss specific but same can be achieved for glassfish

4625892
longlistselector	silverlight
it looks to me like your trying to display grouped data in a single control from a single nested data source in which case you should consider using the longlistselector control from the silverlight toolkit for wp7

4625892
textblock	itemscontrol
for the itemscontrol the datacontext will be an individual categoryitem so you can add a textblock header that binds to the name property if necessary

4625909
phpunit	simpletest
i m really really baffled that simpletest still is considered an alternative to phpunit

4625909
phpunit	simpletest
subjective phpunit provides much nicer code coverage reports than simpletest

4625992
put	get
on win 7 with uac on writes fail i can do a write followed by a read and not get the value i just put in there

4626006
post	get
you can make sure it is executed in the page_load regardless of get or post

4626024
post	get
i believe that working with post and get data falls under the responsibilities of the controller

4626046
firefox	safari
this however does not seem to work in i.e. safari and firefox when the image is hosted on my local machine

4626047
equals	compareto
treeset normally uses the compareto method of the elements not the hashcode or equals

4626047
equals	compareto
a compareto method or a comparator.compare method must implement an order which may be a bit trickier than a simple hashcode -and- equals but this usually not hard either

4626047
int	boolean
conceptually there could be a hash equivalent of comparator for hashset an interface hasherandequalizer with int hashcode object obj and boolean equals object obj1 object obj2 methods

4626109
datamapper	activerecord
two popular ways to handle this are activerecord and datamapper

4626109
datamapper	activerecord
doctrine 1 used activerecord pattern and doctrine 2 uses datamapper

4626150
qstring	qbytearray
i really need to print a qstring variable not a qbytearray or other object

4626160
equals	gethashcode
that will work except that you need to override equals and gethashcode to make the names compare by value

4626187
centos	linux
i m using centos 5.5 linux same as rhel and have just copied the .wine directory from my home and changed the owner recursively

4626194
dreamweaver	fireworks
i am planning to use macromedia dreamweaver flash fireworks mx 2004 just because i have them and have installed the apache with php and mysql servers on a windows computer

4626205
width	height
usually it happens when modalbox doesn t know the width height of the content that it s loading

4626205
width	height
1 wrap the content that will be shown in modalbox in a div and set the height width css properties for it

4626205
width	height
2 make sure that if there are images in the modalbox content that they have the width height also set

4626222
filtering	grouping
variable filtering is an array of floats that never changes it s values stays the same for all work grouping and for all kernel calls

4626231
config	ini
if it is yours it may be wiser to use an other config file format json ini yaml etc

4626285
implements	extends
you should really implements options too and use this.setoptions options instead of your current extends

4626317
superclass	subclassing
to be possible if x is either a b or a both subclassing of a and superclass of b

4626325
justmock	typemock
you d have to use typemock or maybe telerik justmock which have this capability but also cost money

4626388
onclick	onfocus
use the onfocus event rather than the onclick event

4626400
observer-pattern	mediator
if you want to use the mediator pattern instead of observer-pattern it would be fairly trivial to do this using qt

4626404
hash	md5
this needs a cryptographically secure hash function hence sha-256 avoid md5

4626404
prng	random
using a random 16-byte iv generated with a cryptographically secure prng is still the safe way and the one i recommend

4626407
goto	break
such a construct is used as a kind of goto to be able to jump after the end of the loop using a break statement inside

4626423
put	get
as an example if you were to set a 500 error internal server error you could put a further description in to allow invokers to get additional information relating to the error that occurred

4626458
hash	md5
hash it md5 should be available on both

4626466
folder	directory
it is a bad practice to have a wc spanning the branch tags directory you should only have a checkout of the directory repository trunk then use branch tag to branch tag the files folder as you need and if in the future you need to access those files make a switch to the branch changing your wc to that branch tag

4626494
subtract	add
the easiest way to get these expression is to first add the expressions for x and y and solve for column then subtract them and solve for row

4626540
firefox	safari
clicking run effect literally does nothing in both safari and firefox 3.6 on mac for me

4626554
many-to-many	one-to-many
note not a many-to-many reference just a one-to-many on a single table

4626558
goto	break
doing so in order to pretend that goto is written as break is abusive

4626611
inherited	properties
this button is a properties of an object which inherited from tablelayoutpanel

4626612
multiplying	addition
addition multiplying addition8bitsat etc

4626689
post	get
i will post any updates here in case i learn anything new or get a response from the ie team

4626692
oncreate	setcontentview
if i create a new class mypainter which extends view hook mypainter.ondraw and then setcontentview mp in oncreate from the activity all i get are the drawn lines

4626712
switching	screens
currently when i try to open the window on the secondary screens based on window position or by dragging it there cpu usage jumps by about 10 which seems to indicate that windows is switching to a software fallback rather than the hardware accelaration

4626727
pop-up	dialog
i am trying to get this to pop-up in a dialog box to show that it is working with something like test.account getting showed in the message box not sure quite what the problem is

4626729
ant	maven
if you re using ant or maven i would suggest seeing if there is a way to force a copy of the jsp files regardless of modified time

4626753
auto-generate	edmx
i have a table like and auto-generate edmx model

4626791
folder	directory
the one piece of the puzzle i m missing though is how to change the default logging directory from systemdrive inetpub logs logfiles to my own folder that s not on the boot drive of the server

4626794
sqldatasource	detailsview
suppose i have a detailsview which is bound to a sqldatasource

4626842
nsstring	nsdata
one method would be to obtain a nsfilehandle using filehandleforwritingatpath method converting your nsstring to nsdata and then calling writedata on your nsfilehandle after moving the file pointer to the end of the file

4626856
int	boolean
you could have 1-bit boolean and 4 and 2-bit int

4626871
put	get
in words that would look like get me all unique user emails from table1 and table2 that are not in table3 and put them in 1 list

4626873
post	get
if i get far enough on my own i ll post it for future reference

4626881
struts	sitemesh
i d recommend sitemesh if you must stick with struts

4626933
width	height
so when the biggest item in your list shrinks and therefor the listbox itself could shrink because now there is unused space the listbox width and height for that matter will still stay the same because of virtualizationstackpanel doesn t shrink properly

4626943
udp	tcp
unless i misunderstand your question you should be able to just use standard sockets tcp or udp depending on your needs for communication between any all devices

4626964
piston	tastypie
then again i m probably not leveraging tastypie piston functionality to the fullest

4626974
getter	setter
in fact using getter and setter is considered a best practice

4626989
min	max
starting with mysql 5.0 we can bundle the computations of the min max pairs together with the select in a convenient stored procedure

4626998
url.action	actionlink
when they click on the link that is created by url.action edit new with .id item.id i m not using actionlink because i need to add html content inside the link the id shows up as a querystring parameter

4627000
public	protected
a tool that blindly extracted all public protected elements and blindly built an interface hierarchy to mirror an implementation hierarchy is far from smart and the end product wouldn t be pretty

4627019
pop-up	dialog
on click i am just opening jquery dialog pop-up window

4627073
hide	show
now the idea here is that if you have this action or event based on selection of option using toggle will show or hide toggle-menu depending on the selection ie i selected it once it will appear i deselect or select it again menu disappears

hide	show
using show will make the toggle-menu appear but not hide it if deselected in which case you would want to use a hide in all other event selections to hide the toggle-menu

4627089
required	placeholder
i put scripts and styles which are used on every page in the master and then leave a content placeholder so that every page has the possibility to include required scripts and styles

gitorious	gitosis
finally a plethora of frameworks exist to simplify this gitosis gitorious ...

4627144
superclass	subclassing
in this version different subclassing of foo all share foo as a superclass but to hold the return value of bar2 or the parameters to bar1 or bar2 in a setting where all you know about your object let s say it s named obj is that it s a foo you need to use the type obj.t as the type of the variable

4627147
put	get
to put it another way i suspect that fixing the definite assignment rules to allow a local variable to be read within a lambda expression only where it would be safe to do so where the lambda expression is part of assigning the variable and the delegate doesn t get executed until after the assignment has taken place would add more complexity than the relatively small amount of benefit

4627183
fflush	gets
basically index writers have a virtual index in memory until it gets fflush to disk

4627199
post	get
however when i try to post my form i get the following error

4627303
children	parent
you have a parent that has a reference to its children and each child has a reference back to its parent

4627303
children	parent
when you var_dump the root object it iterates over the children to print them and since each child has a reference to the parent it walks back up

4627329
hide	show
basically i am trying to show hide divs and links but having some trouble

4627376
width	height
it basically gets the native hbitmap width height and the pointer to the location of the pixel data using getobject and the bitmap structure and then calls the managed bitmap constructor

4627402
nsmutablestring	nsstring
nsstring are immutable so you ll have to create a new nsmutablestring from it and mutate this copy or to allocate a buffer copy data from the nsstring perform the correction and then recreate a new nsstring from the result

4627420
apk	dex
an apk is just a modified jar file that includes the dex bytecode classes.dex

4627438
hide	show
my problem is that i need feedback on this click so i wanted to show a loading message provided by jquerymobile and then hide it once the image loads

4627480
post	get
it is vital that you do this with an http post and not a get which is what a simple link would do because get requests should never have a side-effect to their main function of retrieving data from a server

4627484
put	get
get in touch with them and they ll happily put you on their community edition i know they ve already got 7-8 open source projects and are wanting more in exchange for feedback

4627492
hide	show
the code that should be able to read the value is used to show hide a label depending on the values of each bit of the enum

4627492
put	get
as a side node when debugging the code if i put the expression in a watch expression i get the correct value

4627555
squash	merge
you can also try to squash your merge in progress git squash save but i don t know if it is possible to push a squash reference on a server

4627586
hide	show
you don t need to hide show divs

4627591
firefox	safari
i faced the same issue it seems to be a browser bug tested in firefox and safari

4627615
width	height
and my solution was a bit of a hack i called toolkit.getscreensize determined if i was in a multi-monitor situation by comparing the height to the width and assuming that width twice height indicated multi-monitor then setting the initial x and y position of the frame

4627660
prepare	execute
i am trying to see what would the query look but all i get is the statement that has been passed into the prepare statement but not the query that would be execute

4627660
prepare	execute
i tried to var_dump the result- execute and result- fetch but the execute statement gives me my prepare statement s sql with place holders while fetch statement gives me the result of that query

4627693
pthreads	fork
if you can access the server over ssh and can run your own scripts you can make a simple fifo server using php although you will have to recompile php with pthreads support for fork

4627742
opencart	magento
i would suggest opencart and magento

4627763

4627792
xna	spritebatch
if you go the xna route you will be drawing sprites using the spritebatch you tell them where and how to draw and that s where they will go

4627812
pdostatement	bindvalue
you ve probably thought that pdostatement bindvalue does something like

4627847
width	height
it would have a fixed height but the width would depend on the contents of the flowdocument

4627911
width	height
or why doesn t onresize pass in the new width and height

4627940
portrait	landscape
for a given video asset i want to determine whether it was shot in portrait or landscape mode

4627940
portrait	landscape
maybe this is to be expected all videos are up right but a portrait video is represented in mpeg-4 as a landscape video turned 90 degrees all videos are actually landscape try the mediainfo app on the mac if you don t believe me

4627940
width	height
which always yields a width height so for iphone 4 width 1280 height 720 and the transform a and d values are 1.0 the others are 0.0 regardless of the capture orientation

4627940
portrait	landscape
i have looked at the meta data using mediainfo app on the mac i have done a hexdump and so far have not found any difference between a landscape and portrait video

4627940
portrait	landscape
but quicktime knows and displays portrait videos vertically and the phone knows by rotating a portrait video if you are holding the phone in landscape orientation on playback and correctly displaying it if holding it in portrait

4627941
post	get
another question is the decision between post and get form submission

4627944
post	get
however if you really want to have nice urls all the time you ll have to send a form get post - doesn t matter and redirect user

4627965
post	get
thats a good and classy one about the subject basically get is the way to go if the resulting url coresponds with content for an example don t use get to pass information you want to save don t use post do transmit a id of content you want to show the user

4627985
post	get
i ve seen other post on this subject and have fiddled with variations but still cannot not get the json model binding to work correctly

4627990
post	get
the php frameworks i ve used typically exclude get data and rely soly on post data

4628144
stdout	stderr
there are three standard streams stdin is a pointer to the standard input stream stdout is a pointer to the standard output stream and stderr is a pointer to the standard error output stream

4628144
stdout	stderr
in this example stdin now points to inputfile.dat stdout points to output.txt and stderr points to errors.txt

4628152
width	height
the left column a b c is a fixed width and the cap pieces a c e are fixed height

4628182

many-to-many	one-to-many
i m trying to convert a one-to-many relationship in entity framework to a many-to-many

4628387
for-loop	arrays
so if you want to iterate over an arrays in javascript always use the classic for-loop construct

4628452
int	boolean
in that environment it made a lot of sense to pack as many boolean into an int as you could and so we would regularly use operations to take them out and put them in

4628510
width	height
appleâ s frameworks make use of them â for instance nssize cgsize is a simple structure that holds two attributes width and height and there are a few functions that operate on them

4628524
range	min
in excel i have the following formula that is supposed to return the min of a range and divide it by the current cell 1 h18 then multiply by 10

4628549
implements	extends
and even at that you wouldn t replace array with stdclass you d replace it with a custom class one that likely extends arrayobject or at least implements iterator and arrayaccess interfaces

4628569
division	modulo
i currently use the maybe or obviously somewhat naive way of continuously calculating the modulo and remainder through division through ten

4628638
client-side	server-side
you should always perform validation server-side to begin with and only afterwards do client-side validation

4628681
slideup	slidedown
i am familiar with slideup and slidedown s callback functionality and have used this to achieve the changing of classes after animations have completed

4628689
draggable	droppable
you can accomplish this by using a combination of draggable droppable options

4628689
move	drag
every time you move the draggable div the drag event is called which determines if the red boxes are inside the green ones and assigns a valid class to the draggable div

4628689
draggable	droppable
the droppable object only accepts valid draggable

4628691

i have added it as a subreport and linked up all of the parameters but when i run the report in bids i get the error message in the subject of this post

4628751
clang	llvm
llvm compiles code faster than gcc may create code that runs faster and the clang frontend provides more accurate error messages than gcc â so there are definitely reasons for switching

4628768
nsmenu	nsstatusitem
i have an nsmenu which opens when a user clicks an nsstatusitem in the status bar

4628880
hash	md5
one wonderful way you can check is to compare md5 hash

4628880
hash	md5
while md5 hash doesn t mean they are the same either it is better than checking the length albeit a longer process

4628882
width	height
i used setbounds method in windows.forms instead of left top width height properties assignment because each time i assign value that changes location property - window changes it s position

4628882
width	height
left top width height assignment causes window to move 4 times while setbounds move windows once better ui experience no window hesitation

4628894
accessor	properties
what kind of properties should i write if i want an attribute not be modified by its accessor return by copy and be set by reference retain

4628913
webclient	httpwebrequest
you could skip the ie window and just use one of the web classes webclient httpwebrequest httpwebresponse to load up a object version of the page

4628920
getter	setter
in such case you should write getter and setter by yourself

4628929
firefox	safari
ps i ve tested in safari and firefox

4628954
width	height
height and width wonâ t do anything

4628975
httphandler	httpmodule
you can have only one httphandler but can plug in more than one httpmodule to examine and handle the requests

4628986
accessor	properties
the idiomatic way of accomplishing copy this is to have a normal retain properties for accessor and support the -copy or -mutablecopy method also

4629021
prepare	execute
now you can just prepare and execute the query select from table qrystr

4629062

aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
if you use aggregate-functions min max sum avg etc. that will be applied for each group

4629122
hide	show
note that the user never actually leaves the html page they have loaded in memory it was just using javascript css to show hide different portions of the panel as the user progressed

4629145
postgresql	mysql
i would like to use a standalone database for the central database mysql postgresql oracle sql server etc. and then have a reliable export to an embedded database probably sqlite for distribution

wordpress or umbraco or kentico question still remains the same

4629251
width	height
are you talking about the width of the website or the height

4629255
readdirectorychangesw	filesystemwatcher
according to this answer on so the filesystemwatcher is based on the api function readdirectorychangesw

4629255
readdirectorychangesw	createfile
as documented on msdn readdirectorychangesw needs the privilege sebackupprivilege which is requested by the parameter file_flag_backup_semantics to createfile

4629256
implements	extends
a nicely implements scripting system also makes it easier for people to get involved or to mod extends the game without bothering a programmer

4629288
readdirectorychangesw	filesystemwatcher
if the filesystemwatcher is based on readdirectorychangesw it needs

4629323
floating-point	integer
if targetweight height and targetcalories are floating-point or integer values they don t need to be surrounded by quotes in the sql statement

4629358
squash	merge	squash	branch
whenever the dev branch is stable and the team decides it s time for a release we merge the dev branch into the master branch without using squash and tag that commit as a version release

4629396
width	height
what is the width height of the rectangular region surrounding the path

4629405
union	distinct
you could try using the distinct keyword on those two fields and in a union you can use count along with group by and some operators to pull non-unique greatest and less-than today records

4629412
jscrollpane	jviewport
getcellrect returns a rectangle which bounds the cell at the given row and column and scrollrecttovisible tells the table s parent which should be a jviewport if you are using a jscrollpane to scroll there

4629423
onresume	onpause
here s what i ve tried i ve tried using the onpause onresume onstop and ondestroy events

4629478
min	max	width	height
i assume you are using lineto s the only way i could think of would be to keep a min max stored for the height and width as the user is drawing paths

4629478
min	max
the main thing to remember is set the min max vals to the coords of the first path a user creates

4629483
width	height
what happens is that once i rotate a nonuniform sprite for example a rectangle the width and height are no longer correct because they assume they are in an nonrotated state

4629499
uitableview	uipickerview
consider having a uipickerview inside of a uitableview

atan2	sin	cos	sin	cos	atan2
for example in your collision code you end up calling atan2 to turn the vector dx dy into an angle and then you call sin and cos to turn the angle back into a vector again

4629667
int	double
for a and b int type converted or double but float or double x -13f 12f 1.083333 that s right

4629668
int	double
i need to use random function with int argument that i get from operations that theoretically can return double

4629672
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have an app that has uitabbarcontroller as the base controller with uinavigationcontroller for the two tabs

4629672
portrait	landscape
both of the tab s main view controllers support both portrait and landscape orientations but the grandchild view needs to be in landscape only

4629672
portrait	landscape
the problem i m having is that if you start in portrait before going into the grandchild view the grandchild s view is being shown in portrait even though childviewcontroller s shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation returns yes only for landscape modes

4629672
portrait	landscape
contentonelistcontroller s shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation returns yes to support both portrait and landscape orientations whereas childviewcontroller s shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation returns yes only for landscape orientations

4629732
children	parent
the top node is all locations and each node has children that represent removing one of the remaining conflicting locations that s greater in some arbitrary ordering scheme than the location removed by the parent node if any

4629740
int	double
rather it will do the division with int truncate the result and store it in a double

4629745
daemon	cron
running a daemon cron elsewhere is a hack that will become problematic very quickly

4629748
fast-forward	merge
a1-a2-a3-a4-a5-a6-a7-a8 and so on it s linear just fast-forward with a merge

maven	m2e
after installing m2e and restarting eclipse select file- import- maven- existing maven project

4629785
m2e	pom.xml
the m2e plugin reads the pom.xml and creates an eclipse project this is the step that mvn eclipse eclipse gives

4629785
m2e	pom.xml
there are other useful features of the m2e plugin including pom.xml editor

4629891
int	chars
i need to write an array of int whose values can be up to 4095 using this function that only takes unsigned chars

4629891
int	chars
i therefore need to use 4 unsigned chars for every int

4629899
pop-up	dialog
till now it was working fine but now i have to include my page to another site where they have used jquery for pop-up dialog and asked me to load my page using the same

4629939
iprincipal	iidentity
while you can assign an iidentity to the iprincipal.iidentity property........you should be more interested in the iprincipal your custom concrete version rather than the iidentity

4629939
iprincipal	iidentity
i would create a single iprincipal your own version ex mysupercoolprincipal.cs an abstract iidentity your own abstract version like myabractiidenity iidentity

4629939
iprincipal	iidentity
and i think will help with the iidentity vs iprincipal stuff i mention above

4629969
firefox	safari
it s working with firefox safari on a mac and android but i get strange results in ios

4630123
post	get
also it doesn t really matter if you use the url as in get method of http requests or you use the post method both can be easily generated by programs like soap or hackers could write their own client to send the appropriate requests

4630128
children	parent
what i d like to do is ensure the deletion of all children whenever a parent gets deleted

4630128
children	parent
parent and their children are linked with a recursive php function

4630138
implements	extends
for example building a generic interface and then having and a similar technique with a sub-class and extends rather than implements but this just results in a type error bar.java 1 type parameter a is not within its bound

4630148
getter	setter
for instance you might want to validate the value in the setter or lazily load the value in the getter

4630148
getter	setter
the second form allows no customization except accessibility of the getter and setter

4630148
getter	setter
if you don t need to do anything specific in the getter and setter the second form is usually more convenient

4630152
post	get
if this is the problem then here is a neat trick to get around the issue stolen from another stackoverflow post

4630155
folder	directory
the pop-up window says cannot remove folder text-base the directory is not empty or prop-base or other folder under .svn

4630162
getter	setter
far as advantages of one over the other go the first way allows you to do extra work in the getter or setter such as a check for null or a property change notification

4630168
qlistwidget	qtreewidget
vcl s tlistbox and ttreeview classes are quite different from qt s view and model classes although you could use qlistwidget and qtreewidget instead

google-chrome	firefox
my site displays fine in firefox and ie but appears as an empty page when attempting to view in google-chrome

4630205
int	chars
the part of the assignment of int whose values can be up to 4095 using this function that only takes unsigned chars should be giving you a huge hint

4630208
min	max
currently working with a mls data dump in which all their dates are formatted in mm dd yyyy trying to get the min max age

4630339
int	chars
in the c family strings are always composite data types because a single machine int is not big enough for more than a few chars

what i came up with is to have the checking code in .emacs to exit break if it s text based emacs darwin system but not aquamacs

4630383
int	chars
for a 4 byte int you can use an array of 4 unsigned chars

4630409
versioning	upgrade
you might also need to purchase a newer versioning -- only the most recent versioning work with dev10 the 2.xx series and it is not a free upgrade

i think the reason random hashing isn t used much is that hash-collision when a small hash value is computed from a 32-bit hash are apt to be rare unless there s something wrong with the hash function and in that case there s a fair likelihood that all 32 bits of the hash function will match because only part of the key was used in computing the hash

books were my way into lisp ml ocaml and haskell

4635077
haskell	ocaml
a personal opinion something disliked here is that it s easier to do functional in python c# or java than it is to do statefull oo in haskell or ocaml

4635091
int	chars
non-bmp basic multilingual plane chars can t be represented as a java chars or thus a chars because a chars is only a 16-bit unsigned int

the first for-loop works normally and prints 1-find equal 7 but second loops does not print anything

4635167
post	get
post parameters are similar to get but they are not visible to the user because they aren part of the url string

4635205
post	get
take note that once you build the post array like i have shown in the model for each post item you have a post- comments that is simply an array of comments that are associated with that post so knowing that you can call in the controller or view to get the number of comments related to a single post

4635207
gif	png
the script works fine with jpeg and gif but when running on a png the file will be corrupted

maven	pom.xml
here s a baseline pom.xml for a gwt project in maven

4635570
post	get
since the http server can only send one type of request get or post your form will send a post request

4635570
post	get
i recall that depending on the browser and also your php configuration get variables might be ignored when using post requests

4635570
post	get
and remember a get request should be used to retrieve and a post request should be used to create

4635581
post	get
i m not so sure you can have both a get an a post parameter when doing a request

4635604
udp	tcp
one is opening a port with bind for udp or listen for tcp another one is opening a port in a firewall

4635604
udp	tcp
this applies both to tcp and udp unless your firewall is set up in a very paranoid mode

4635604
udp	tcp
you can just bind a udp socket then use connect and recv send or read write exactly in the same way as you d do with tcp

4635679

i have been trying use the httputility.htmlencode and server.htmlencode method to sanitize textbox and textarea

4635828
put	get
i would like to allow get and put operations on this resource

4635828
put	get
i m afraid this might violate the rules for proper restful get and put resources because what you are sending to the server is not exactly what you are getting back out since other information is being included in the payloads

4635848
width	margin
then by calculating that the popup would be off-screen we can reduce the width of the content and give it a negative margin so that the portion that is on-screen is clipped to what would have appeared if the popup were to allow this

4635872
hide	show
where showdiv id show a div and hide the other div

4635890

4635945
put	get
if not i really hope they get put into xe2

4635994
uiview	subviews
a good choice is to create a separate uiview class and set the uiviewcontroller s view to this or add it as a subviews to the controller s view then use delegate methods for any user interaction from your uiview subclass to the controller

4636000
client-side	server-side
i needed to share a template between my razor and javascript so one could use it server-side and the other client-side

pear systemd daemons

4636111
width	height
i am interested in width height and kb size

4636131
hash	salt
random salt will make precalculated hash tables attack impossible each user will require his own calculated hash tables

4636131
hash	salt
position salt before password will help to hide hash patterns in case some users have same password

4636131
hash	hmac
using hmac to prevent collisions is useless because a we use hash not for mac b to make probability of collision 50 for sha-512 you need to calculate about 2 256 values

4636152
width	height
for determining the width height of many image formats you only need some bytes at the beginning of the file so you could start with that - as mentioned it depends on the actual image format though

4636156
width	height
you can get the file size using the content-length header but you would need to at least start downloading the image to get the width height

4636156
width	height
once the image starts downloading you could parse the stream and as brokenglass and ed swangren suggest try to find the image width height that way

4636156
width	height
having said that it sounds like an awful lot of work given that you can quickly find the image width height using available libraries if you download the entire image

4636160
vim	gedit
your text editors gedit vim do some encoding detection - you can check which encoding do they detect i don t know how - i don t use any of them and use that as -f iconv option or save the open file with your desired encoding using one of those text editors

4636206
oncreate	findviewbyid
so while you assign the local variable to the view instance located by findviewbyid it falls out of scope and ceases to exist after oncreate returns

4636226
int	chars	tinyint	varchar
tinyint or int for that purpose is indexed faster and gives better performance in sort or selects than varchar or chars

4636250
google-chrome	firefox
i have already constructed this and works fine in google-chrome and firefox but not in ie

4636250
google-chrome	firefox

4636276
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome safari firefox etc

4636285
width	margin
in the first case you could create a cell or multicell for text that splits across many lines with no borders background with zero width so that it reaches the right margin of the page and centre alignment

4636290
width	height
would restrict the maximum width and height to 150px and it can be anything from less than 150 up to 150 and anything that doesn t fit inside that will be clipped off and hidden from view

4636290
width	height
you can also just use height and width to specify a fixed size if you don t want the table to expand or shrink at all

4636319
width	margin
this will set top and bottom margin to 0 and left and right margin to auto which will let the div auto-center itself when its width is known fixed

4636321
put	get
i put a test view in place to pass the path to on iis6 i get

4636329
backbone.js	javascriptmvc
you may also want to look at backbone.js a javascriptmvc framework

4636335
rtp	rtcp
here you can find description of widely used protocols for voice over ip - rtp for data transmission and rtcp for coordination and qos

4636371
calloc	malloc
reading large files into memory might not be desirable either but if you must then you should maybe look into first using the stat and fstat functions to find out how large the file really is then allocate the buffer dynamically using malloc calloc or use mmap

4636407
google-chrome	firefox
i m serving an xpi to firefox users and a crx to google-chrome users

4636424
width	height
the width and height refer to the dialog-box itself without the faded thick blue border

4636424
width	height
the width + height appear in the following code in 3 places

4636453
google-chrome	safari
navigator.plugins does work for me in safari google-chrome

4636464
getter	setter
and if technique 2 uses a better performing getter does it follow that technique 1 uses a better performing setter since title gets an explicit and presumably immediate release

4636526
children	parent
say we have a typical parent-children type relationship where each one parent could have many children but we need to keep track of the parent s single gasp favorite child.

4636572
nswindow	nsapplication
i build with make and only added a few .mm files to access the necessities from nsapplication nswindow and nsopenglview

4636622
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
we have an old legacy asp application that stored customer passwords as salt md5 hash

4636622
hash	md5
my thoughts were to hash the existing md5 hash using sha1

4636622
hash	md5
it means i d still need to hash with md5 and then hash again with sha1 when customers logon and when they reset passwords but i can live with that

4636722
hash	md5
default to md5 since that s the current hash

4636722
hash	md5
if you can t spare another column then widen the existing one to support prefixing with some indicator of the hash - old hash will not be prefixed and can assumed to be md5

4636726
implements	extends
you can solve your first problem by extends focuspanel to implements the requiresresize and providesresize interfaces

4636770
shadowing	named
since list is a built-in function you re shadowing that named which is poor practice

4636787
post	get
this is my add.php the file that get the post information from the form in the main.html

4636854
int	double
the idea is to use the normal int divison but adjust for negative results to match the behaviour of the double floor double function

4636913
subtract	addition
because the -- and ++ operators map to inc rement and dec rement instructions in addition to adding and subtract in the cpu and these operators are supposed to map to the instructions hence why they exist as separate operators

4636990
width	height
i cannot figure out the height and width of the table cell

4636998
post	put
then again while the idea for pre post increment decrement operators might have been influenced by machine operations it looks like they weren t put into the language specifically to take advantage of such

4637000
int	chars
so some fields in the database which i would like to represent as enums in my application are of type int and some of type chars 2

4637001
put	get
with public key encrypt data and put it in database and with private key you are able to get plain text

4637027
hide	show
for example if in some future version you were to occasionally remove the view from the view hierarchy with a desire to stick it back later -- the ultimate show hide if you will -- then retain #1 above will keep it around

4637039
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
for most of the conforming browsers read firefox safari opera google-chrome you have to give html5 elements a display style before they will be shown

4637041
width	height
the problem is using the middle x and y and subtracting adding the half of the windows width and height is not enough

4637041
width	height
so i start it at 10x10 then i take the full width and full height of the window and subtract 20 of it because 10 on the left side and 10 on the right side

4637041
width	height
but the right and bottom side of the rectangle is out of the window so the width and the height given to the drawrect method is too high

4637041
width	height
this means the left border has 8px width and the top bar showing the windows title and close minimize buttons has 30px height

4637068
google-chrome	firefox
for me the following is working in google-chrome firefox and ie

4637070
put	get
but i do know how to use it i ve put it in in all the griffon lifecycle controller service and i get the exception

4637100
google-chrome	firefox
it works on firefox and google-chrome you should test it into the remaining browsers

4637126
concave	convex
define each area as a convex polygon posibly including the map edges split concave polygons prefer horizontal or vertical lines then test of the mouse is in one of the polygons see this answer for an implementatio

4637127
typedef	struct
your problem is that npc isn t the name of a type until the declaration of the struct typedef is complete

4637156
typedef	struct
i don t think you can use typedef npc inside the struct def

4637193
put	get
the out put is ã james and how do i get rid of ã

4637203
min	max
for min and max and to scale the image values

4637275
easymock	jmock
i had problems using hamcrest-all and junit-dep - you then need jmock an easymock and ant.tasks

4637284
cpython	pypy
raph s suggestin of using array is good but it won t help on cpython in fact i d expect it to be 10-15 slower however if you use it on pypy i d expect excellent results

websphere	ibm
the web app is built on top of an ibm stack rad db2 websphere and basically uses jsps and servlets

4637433
sorting	grouping
be aware that this code does not compile i have just pulled together various code snippets that i have in my own list results framework which includes paging sorting grouping and caching

4637451
nsurl	nsstring
i think you need an nsstring not an nsurl object to pass to the parser so the extra part you are doing with changing the nsstring to an nsurl is the issue

4637454
user-controls	elementhost
just put your wpf content in a wpf user-controls and then add an elementhost to your form and host the wpf control inside that

4637457

i would like to put that into a function i can call but i cant seem to get it to work this is what i have tried and it fails to work for me

4637458
firefox	safari
in safari and firefox trying to use isnotundefined isundefined or isfunction fails

4637462
post	put
the code is stripped from my post if i put it all so i ll just say that each image links to a website and uses a separate image to change color when you hover over it

4637464
width	height
when we click on any of the generated divs we should be able to change the size of the div by choosing a width height value from the drop down menus

4637483

i am not quite sure what memory you are looking for ram or disk

4637541
put	get	post	get	post	put
we would simulate a get post or put method to a particular controller and check the acceptance criteria

4637568
width	height
when you ll change the value .change event will kick in and if selecteddiv isn t empty then it will change the width and height

4637573
width	height
then all i m doing is setting the width and height based on the browser width height multiplied by .25

4637578
width	height
in order to find the size of the graphicsbase i added width and height properties to graphicsbase which are set in the constructor of graphicsrectangle

4637587
jquery	anythingslider
you can use the same loop that is setting your anythingslider content s li to set a js array and then echo it before your jquery calls or using something like

4637634
spaces	delimiter
i.e. calling new mynumrange 32000 nothing should equate after calling mynumrange s overridden tostring method to 32000 note the trailing spaces and assume is the delimiter

4637642
post	get
i am using simple javascript to post a form via ajax.when i use get everything works well but as it is get request all the parameters are visible

4637642
post	get
with post this is my code but when i use it the request still uses get any suggestions to fix it

4637753
cpython	ironpython
ironpython will probably always lag the reference implementation of cpython in terms of standard library support etc. but in general the development is not that far behind that it would hard to work with coming from a cpython background

4637753
cpython	ironpython
lastly there are a few substantial differences between cpython and ironpython to which one should pay attention

4637761
installation	upgrade
i think if you unpublish your app and publish again your current users wont be able to upgrade their current installation

4637808
mouse	keyboard
it implements three different types of hooks a mouse hook a keyboard hook and a clipboard hook

4637819

at the time i was playing around with setting various min max and preferred sizes using the methods provided for by the components not the layout manager

4637881
awt	swing
i also fooled a bit with pack validate visible opaque etc. and yes i read the article about swing and awt painting here and i switched to relying more and more on miglayout

4637891
hash	md5
note the password in database in encryted using md5 hash

4637898
hash	md5
md5 is a cryptographic hash not an encryption scheme

4637898
hash	md5
md5 is used to hash the passwords so that if the password database should be hacked the hackers will only have access to the hash of the passwords and not the original passwords making it difficult for them to discover your users passwords

4637907
for-loop	arrays
i am currently using 2 nested for-loop to process the arrays

4637914
short	base	int	chars
all base types like chars short and int align to their size and they align to the next available position regardless of the alignment of the parent

4637920
hash	md5
you will then update the users password with the md5 hash of the new password

4637956
aggregate-functions	sum
i was under the impression that with aggregate-functions like sum the query requires a group by clause.

4637965
int	chars
when created the field for a table i don t know which type int chars varchar.... and size i should use on the field

4637967

c# socket server which gets the data and puts into a msmq

4638005
int	chars
i don t for example plan to code the int 123 as the chars string 123

4638063
exist-db	sedna
i am evaluating various nxd native xml databases exist-db sedna basex and monetdb as a next step to see if this would suite my purposes

4638090
innodb	myisam
if you must use a large compound key one solution is to use innodb tables rather than the default myisam tables which support a larger key length 3500 bytes -- you can do this by swapping instead of in the declaration above

4638093
gridview	formview
it allows for purely-declarative web forms where you can declare the data in one control and have a formview or gridview control consume that doing crud operations with no additional code at all

4638098
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
if you re going to add subtract multiplying or compare ranges of numbers definitely make them numeric types

4638100
cpu	processors	disk	ram
then sql server can worry about disk i o and utilise the full ram of it s machine while the network handler data processors burns cpu cycles which are easily scaled up or out via multiple copies on different machines that get adressed by a load balancer

bazaar	git
one of the big advantages of distributed version control systems like git mercurial and bazaar is that they allow you to make a local commit for back-up purposes without sending it to the main repository immediately

4638207
getter	setter
it s probably what will be in the final recommendation but i try not to predict the future in these things -- too easy to predict in haste and regret in leisure. some browsers have implemented this using essentially the getter and setter you note just with native functions implemented in the browser to back them akin to how say document.appendchild is a js function with a native browser-provided implementation behind it

4638207
getter	setter
others have an entirely different approach for dom getter and setter than for user-definable getter and setter

4638207
getter	setter
this is why you can t use object.getownpropertydescriptor in firefox 4 betas to examine dom getter and setter

4638249
width	height
this means that the maximum value that level can get is the log-2 of the the minimum of the image width and height

4638254

if you re willing to pay for a mocking framework that would enable you to mock sealed classes consider purchasing either typemock isolator or justmock - both can mock virtually any .net class and method including sealed classes and static methods

4638271
int	boolean
however i can tell you that input menu and password hin are in in the domain library preferences com.apple.loginwindow with the keys showinputmenu boolean - false or no key for off and retriesuntilhint int 1 is on 0 or non-existant is off respectively

4638304
inline	inlining
__no_inline__ is defined if no functions will be inline into their callers when not optimizing or when inlining has been specifically disabled by -fno-inline

a chars is an int

4638554
range	infinity
and m is a parameter that range from 1.1 to infinity and c is the number of clusters

4638600
int	chars
thus when you want to store the new chars enums write a function that generates an int value for you and store this in the propertry and now save it or if you want to make it simple the function can have a switch case

4638614
getter	setter
edit if you wish to be able to modify doors through car object just add setter to these properties with decoupling logic being reverse to concatenation done in getter

4638617
pop-up	dialog
dialog pop-up

4638695
mouseleave	mouseenter
but as lasseespeholt just pointed out in a comment .hover is shorthand for binding to mouseenter and mouseleave and is not an event in itself

uitabbarcontroller - uinavigationcontroller - uiviewcontroller

4638734
mouseleave	mouseenter
hover is not a real event but a shorthand method that binds handlers for two events mouseenter and mouseleave and as such doesn t work with .one as shown here

4638734
mouseleave	mouseenter
if you want to do different things on mouseenter and mouseleave you need to bind separate handlers

this is normally achieved by checking the containing viewgroup if it has a layoutparams inner child then that s the one you should use

4639119
post	get
you can then use your queries to get the remaining number of post comments votes for the user

4639121

4639197
mouseleave	mouseenter	hide	show
which i m using to show hide a button when mouseenter mouseleave events are fired on a box

4639197
move	drag
what happes is that the mouse events are fired only for the last box i added i add them by drag and dropping pratically it works fine for the first box if i add a second one the events are fired correctly for it but when i move the mouse over the first box nothing happens

4639203
hash	md5
user s password is stored on the server as an md5 hash

4639203
hash	md5
server issues a public key md5 hash of current time in milliseconds

4639203
hash	md5
client javascript function takes user password as input and calculates its md5 hash

4639203

4639350
width	height
yes you can set the height and width of the uiscrollview as per your requirement

4639353
int	double
double can exactly represent all the int we care about for that matter on most implementations it can exactly represent all the values of int

4639429
xslt	xquery
this is a shortcoming of wsdl2py rather than jaxb but it s so easy to fix using xslt or xquery

4639464
multiplying	modulo
modulo m and then multiplying the nominator by the denominator s modular multiplicative inverse in m

4639472
for-loop	loops
declare the variable str before loops starts.because the variable str declared inside the for-loop goes out of scope and hence is an error in compilation

4639553
opera	firefox
this seems to work in firefox no linebreaks between normal and generated content but in opera it fails

4639560
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
unchecked-exception are those that extend runtimeexception class

4639598
button	checkbox
this example uses a button to toggle the checkbox on off

4639608
button	checkbox
label creates label for the checkbox or radio button

4639708
for-loop	loops
there are various looping constructs available to programmers the 2 most common ones are the for-loop and the while loops

4639708
for-loop	loops
the for-loop is good for looping a number of times and the while loops is for looping while some value is true

4639796
google-chrome	firefox
how you tried debugging the javascript in a browser such as google-chrome or in firefox with firebug

4639804
pull	push
so to contribute they push to their forks send you pull requests

4639881
rss	feed
a newer extension for importing an rss feed is gkh_rss_import

4639920
jobs	cron
cron jobs are more robust than daemons

4639921
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox it works as expected pointer appears over the div and clicking it alerts divinner and then divouter

4639942
udp	tcp
because udp is connectionless i can t check the return value of connect like i can with tcp

4639977
chown	chmod
chmod chown clock_gettime

4639977
fcntl	fork
fcntl fdatasync fork fpathconf

4640005
mouseleave	mouseenter
however hover is actually only a shortcut for the two events mouseenter and mouseleave so it s actually very easy to mimic the functionality using these events

4640046
uigesturerecognizer	uiswipegesturerecognizer
use the documentation for uigesturerecognizer and uiswipegesturerecognizer

4640051
put	get
but if i put the same code into the main function for the nsoperation i get sporadic exc_bad_access errors

4640062
width	height
this works fine is both the width and height are large

4640062
width	height
however if width is over 604 and height is under 453 604x300 m then this will skip the resize procedure

4640062
width	height
the opposite is the same width is under height is over

4640063
int	double
i am using only int s in this example but get the same result testing with float or double

4640087
vb.net	vb6
unfortunately i am converting someone else s vb6 program into vb.net

4640105
width	height
if i get your question correctly then if width 605 and height 300 then it is false and nothing in the if block will be executed

4640119
width	height
if you want to set a maximum height or width you need to use || instead of in your conditional

4640204
required	placeholder
if your translations required strings with variables placeholder use blocktrans instead

4640232
put	get
not only does it make more sense to put the entire sentence in one translation string it may be impossible for translators to get the sentence correct when it s split into pieces

4640249
hide	show
note that modern browsers will hide the real full path showing something like c fakepath realname.txt so to show only the name which is real change to

4640274
versioning	upgrade
i strongly suggest you upgrade to the current versioning 1.6.0_23 at time of writing this

4640308
folder	directory
the easiest way to start developing an extension is putting a pointer file in the extensions folder in the profile directory

4640323
ssl	https
https is simple http with ssl the implementations of which is the point of openssl

4640334
fast-forward	merge
the two tree version is best if the remote branch is a fast-forward of your current head if not then the three way merge option may be better

4640336
put	get
i want to put the current and oneyear values for each date into the calc sheet and get the result into the result column

4640336
put	get
i also tried writing a udf but like i said it needs to put in the values and get the result which means the udf will modify the sheet

4640371
postgresql	mysql
postgresql or mysql will cost you nothing or ms-sql server if you ve got cash rattling around

4640380
children	parent
the children need to specify the build-helper-maven-plugin under the build plugins so that code from the parent gets run

4640421
debian	linux
i m working on a web site under a linux environment debian

4640443
rss	feed
e.g i wish to filter the following rss feed where the description contains a certain team name say liverpool

4640538
ati	nvidia
metaphorically speaking ati has a good engine compared to nvidia

4640539
floating-point	fixed-point
in practice this becomes more tricky in the general case due to the limitations of fixed-point or floating-point

4640575
rss	feed
think about a service like a rss feed aggregator

4640587
multiplying	add
let me add some example code and sample data which you can multiplying until getting 7 million entries

4640615
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
uinavigationcontroller attached to the window the rootcontroller in this navigationcontroller is a uiviewcontroller that presents a tableview

4640617
for-loop	loops
we can use for-loop and while loops for same purpose

4640650
erd	diagram
i m not really sure if erd is the proper term but occasionally i see diagram created where the line in between two entities is labeled with text to describe the relationship

4640651
for-loop	loops
in general a for-loop might be preferable for simple loops since the logic of loops is contained in a single line

4640680
unsigned	short
short to unsigned short is a conversion thus having conversion rank

4640692
for-loop	loops
scope of loops variable s for example with the for-loop i has local scope with a while this has to be defined before which means it is available after of course you can do that with for as well..

4640692
for-loop	loops
frankly if you need to increment decrement a for-loop makes sense if you don t know the bounds and there is no real increment decrement a while loops makes more sense

4640755
cos	sin
you d probably want either setlookatm with the lookat point calculated from your camera angles using sin cos as you are doing in your code - i assume you know how to do this.

4640770
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
as per marc_s s comment it makes sense to wrap all the disposable components sqlconnection sqlcommand and sqldatareader in a using block to make sure they are disposed of properly rather than my original solution that only wrapped the sqlconnection with a using block

4640794
ubuntu	linux
this is on linux - ubuntu 10.04

4640799
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
you may notice the use of the using statement which ensures that the sqlconnection and the sqldatareader objects are properly disposed

4640822
jms	jta
a full spring stack typically still uses jpa jta jms and servlet from java ee

4640822
jsf	wicket
wicket on its turn only replaces jsf or when used with a spring stack replaces spring mvc

4640822
jsf	wicket
wicket by itself is a very nice web framework but in practice it isn t used as often as jsf

4640822
jsf	wicket
i won t go into the discussion whether wicket or jsf is better this is mostly a religious battle anyway but due to the popularity of jsf there are simply more people experienced with it and there is a large community offering many things for jsf like component libraries and extensions

4640949
post	get
when i post the form i get only the header fields

4640958
int	double
a typical usage is sequential accesss from the first element to the last element with reading and modification of constituent values int and double

4640962
textview	imageview
linearlayout have one imageview and one textview

4641014
min	max
min 1 max 4 and in this example steps 2 since we want to divide the span into two steps

4641023
inline	inlining
namely inlining you can t inline something if you depend on the caller nor on the function since the code might have just put somewhere without the function around it

4641059
integer	unsigned	unsigned	short
in short you convert the float to unsigned integer sort them and then convert them back to float this is required otherwise the negatives values would be incorrectly sorted after the positive ones

4641220
inherited	properties
first to cover inherited properties

4641252
for-loop	loops
because when i see a for-loop i can expect all of loops bookeeping is kept in a single statement

4641298
hide	show
then show the textfield by settings itsãÿ hidden property to yes when the cell is selected and hide the label

4641308
apache	nginx
i have a slicehost slice running django through nginx and apache

4641352
onfocus	onblur
anyways for switching background on elements use onfocus and onblur events

4641357
for-loop	loops
the regex seems fine but i don t what seems to be the problem all of the regex go through a replacement loops using a for-loop so that s not the problem

4641364
int	double
and return the sum of the 2 numbers int double

4641364
int	double
however if i get 2 int i want to return an int type but for any other combinations of int and double i ll always return double

4641377
rss	feed
i m working on extracting data from an rss feed

4641453
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
but this currently works only with the newest safari google-chrome and firefox

4641486
setinterval	settimeout
you can use setinterval instead but for most animations settimeout is easier to control and more importantly.

4641496
prepare	execute
for example in struts 2 the system would call prepare setter methods validate and execute in that order

4641501
allocator	stl
if you intend to go for c++ stl is very useful for something dynamic allocator and is very easy

4641502
width	height
in the shortcut properties layout set the screen buffer size width 130 height maximum 9999 window size width 130 height 25 for example

4641513
lisp	scheme
i always hear about c or assembly being the language of choice for viruses and i wonder if any of the more arcane languages like lisp or scheme can be used for it too

4641531
width	height
if you want to see empty tags you can give them width height and a background color with css

4641532
calloc	malloc
the difference is in calling convention and effect - calloc initialises all the memory to 0 whereas malloc does not

4641538
ddms	adb
on the nexus s running android 2.3 the data folder is not visible in the ddms file explorer or the adb shell but it is visible in the emulator

4641541
lisp	scheme
as for lisp and scheme if there is access to the system then there s the possibility of writing a virus

4641554
post	get
you wont be able to pass post parameters this way but hopefully you can still learn something from it or add get parameters if they do something

4641566
portrait	landscape
i am doing some rejigging of various views from portrait to landscape in my iphone app

4641566
portrait	landscape
this works fine if the user does portrait - landscape - portrait - landscape as i do some math do relocate the views

4641566
portrait	landscape
however if a user goes from portrait - portrait upside down or landscape left - landscape right my code doesn t work

4641578
int	boolean
public void onprogresschanged seekbar seekbar int progress boolean fromuser

4641598
integer	fractions
to get all of them you also have to take the semi-convergents mediants â â fractions of the form for some integer nâ 1

4641669
instances	transient
if so it seems preferable to make this variable transient and re-fetch the cache instances each time the instances is restored

4641690
int	chars
luckily even with 5 chars that s only bits total so you can completely pack the entire string into a 32 bit int and won t even need to fiddle the sign bit so you ll have a very fast completely lossless zero collision hash code that uniquely identifies each string.

4641690
int	chars
below is your new function to pack 5 chars in the range 0-9 a-z + - into an int

4641697
mouseleave	mouseenter
you can also directly import image files as image objects and handle their events like mouseenter mouseleave mouseleftbuttondown and so on

4641708
mouseup	mousedown
solution application buttons cancel any current pending mouseup events when said button enters mousedown

4641709
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
raphaã l currently supports firefox 3.0+ safari 3.0+ google-chrome 5.0+ opera 9.5+ and internet explorer 6.0+ and is very easy to use and works well with jquery

4641714
usergroups	administration
i have a class employer which contains a collection of usergroups but it also has another usergroups called administration

4641781
onchange	onblur
i suspect the underlying problem is that when you hit tab for example the browser goes through a few steps call the code assosiated with the current control onchange onblur then set the focus to the new control

4641791
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
disadvantage only runs in modern browsers like firefox google-chrome safari

4641798
realloc	malloc
in your case the easiest thing would be to use a pointer to such an array and to use malloc realloc to resize them

4641810
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
also opera firefox and safari have no problem rendering in a html4 page

4641812

4642034
multicastdelegate	delegation
the actual base class instance can be either delegation or multicastdelegate depending on how many targets were subscribed

4642075
nscoder	nsdata
if the nsarray and all the objects it contains and all their sub-objects recursively etc. respond to nscoder you might be able to serialize the array into a temporary nsdata memory chunk and then get the memory size of that one flat temporary object

4642127
int	chars
with regards to your first question - about the type int chars float - this is a valid c++ type and is the type of a function that takes in a chars and a float and returns an int

4642199
post	get
because this post is occurring from flash this token is obviously missing and we get this error

4642238
rss	feed
the problem you will face is the different feed types atom rss 1.0 2.0 etc use different names for certain common fields

4642518
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
apple safari google-chrome and mozilla firefox all run fine on windows

4642551
actionscript	mxml
mxml is an xml vocabulary designed to generate actionscript which is the underlying language of flash

4642551
actionscript	mxml
since actionscript is based on ecmascript the same standard as javascript it s possible that mxml could be adapted to output javascript

4642578
ati	nvidia
but current-day nvidia vs ati cards for gpgpu not graphics performance but gpgpu that i do have a strong opinion about

4642606
content-length	content-type
try adding content-type and content-length headers

4642692
post	put
from my experience in handling multipart form-data in wsgi with post i have little doubt that you can handle a put by just reading the input stream

4642703
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
together malloc and free manage a list of memory blocks that are used when malloc calloc etc

4642703

uiview	subviews
in fact if you trace it through the execution of the loadview function the array never gets a view with subviews in it even though i called addsubview uiview view which the documentation says this about this method retains view and sets its next responder to the receiver which is its new superview

4647453
uiview	subviews
to be more clear why don t the uiview that are passed to the array have subviews when the local variables for them do

the error message is because you have set -u and you re starting your for-loop at index instead of index-1 will always be empty because of the way your while loops is written

4648124
for-loop	arrays
i would code the for-loop with a test for 0 because the -1 looks confusing since it can t be the index of an numerically indexed arrays

4650121
ssl	https
the exchange are done over https therefore encrypted with ssl

4650121
ssl	https
since the zend application is doing a lot and when i say a lot i mean it we are asked to use a pool of https connection in order to avoid the renegociation of the ssl encryption for each request

4650139

md5 doesn t really have a key as it s a hash not an encryption

hash	md5
i m not sure what are you thinking about but the correct way to validate a elf binary is to use a hash like sha-1 md5 etc

4650252
hash	md5
when you create the elf file then you also create the signature file using this hash algorithm md5 and validate the result

4650298
wordpress	joomla
if you want to copy and paste the chart manually to a cms joomla wordpress site than you could do it from the gvis object s html list

4650319
versioning	upgrade
use css3 or html5 i assume there s something within these to easily do what i want and hope everyone upgrade their browsers asap while the older browsers just get a slightly uglier versioning of the page

4650327
ubuntu	linux
assuming you re using linux and probably ubuntu if you re in that part of the instructions on the page you linked -- but that info in the question would help too.

settimeout and setinterval may be required but those always make my head hurt

while i would expect my ajax to submit three characters and filter in javascript from there i can t assume that the input will be three characters - non-javascript users will be submission a string of arbitrary length

you should not need to do malloc or free on it

4650428

when you create a new instance it inherited all the properties from the prototype in fact it has a reference to it

4650724
serializable	deserialization
with this at least the serializable works just fine note either specify xmlinclude attributes for the types that can be in the original list or hand over an array of types in the constructor of the serializable however if the object is deserialized the children collection ends up empty because the set block is never reached during deserialization i am quite clueless as to why this is

4650736
int	double
the standard float and double are 4 and 8 bytes so you can t directly pack two of them into one int 32 object as it is only 4 bytes

4650739

you can specify access to the properties as public or private or protected

4650769

hash	salt
btw there is already a pretty simple and powerful c# salt hash class library they ve also included a small demonstration of how to use the library out there - link

4651146
hash	md5
it also provides a verification mechanism so you can verify the user s input as a valid password and you can choose the hash algorithm yourself sha1 md5 etc.

4651193
mouse	keyboard
i figure that they might be binding to the mouse move events + keyboard events since i don t know any out of the box event that gives you that ability

4651198

i am assuming that your root visual item is stretching to horizontally and vertically to fill your window with auto height width

4651198

get rid of the auto height width

4651253
wordpress	joomla
the usual open source solutions -- these days joomla wordpress and drupal are popular -- are written by thousands of people and while you might loose a little flexibility by using on that s ready made this is by far offset by not needing to redo everything from scratch

4651259
getter	setter
in any case i expect that if you read the rest of the code you ll find that there are getter for -audiochannel and -sessionpreset that have been written as well as a setter for -setsessionpreset

4651286
accessor	properties
by overriding the session properties in an unnamed category before synthesizing it a set accessor will also be synthesized but the header file says it is readonly so other classes don t know about the set accessor

4651286
accessor	properties
retain means that the set accessor should retain the value of the properties and the assign keyword tells it to set the properties without retaining it

4651291
getter	setter
this means you want the compiler to generate the appropriate setter and getter for the session and orientation properties and that you want those properties to store their values in the _session and _orientation instance variables respectively

4651291
getter	setter
this means that the implementations for the setter and getter will be provided at runtime

children	parent
if you could have multiple entrystrategies for a single exitstrategy then you would have two tables with the exitstrategy being the parent and the entrystrategies being the children and the entrystrategy records would have a foreign key pointing to the exitstrategy parent record

4651326
serializable	deserialization
on deserialization the serializable uses your property getter to get the collection instance and then calls add on it for each item

4651329
swt	swing
if you re thinking of using a mix of swt and swing in the same application this eclipse corner article will be immensely useful

4651333

biztalk supports several standard edi formats such as edifact x12 and rosettanet and there are plenty of adapters available for facilitating connections to several platforms including sap and peoplesoft via various protocols such as http ftp and smtp

4651565
opensuse	debian
i can t say where the build environment is located in debian or its offsprings but in opensuse there would be a kernel-default-devel package for example to contain utsrelease.h and autoconf.h as well as - via dependencies - the static header files required

4651587
hash	salt
and even better approach is to not keep passwords in the database instead keeping the salt some unique value and hash of password+salt

4651815
maven	cargo
if you aren t using an application server there are probably some ways to get cargo and maven to deploy it for you but you may be better off just using some shell scripts to deploy and run the application

4651815
jboss	glassfish
however as your application grows you may find a need for an application server like jetty jboss glassfish tomcat etc

4651815
maven	cargo
when this happens take a look at the cargo plugin for maven because it will allow you to do something like

4651832
dlsym	dlopen
in linux you use dlopen open library dlsym look up a symbol function or value usually and friends

4651836
nexus	artifactory	maven	cargo
use maven cargo nexus or artifactory hudson and probably jira in conjunction of product release

4651841
dlsym	dlopen
you are looking for dlopen analogous to loadlibrary dlclose analogous to freelibrary and dlsym analogous to getprocaddress

4651850
dlsym	dlopen
the posix equivalents are dlopen and dlsym

4651860

google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox i have to refresh the entire page

4652052
filtering	grouping
see the working grouping s page although only filtering not masks are mentioned explicitly there

4652068
post	get
my get method has the setid parameter and because it is in the url of course this will also be in the post and therefore requirerequestvalueattribute was returning true for isvalidforrequest for both methods

4652100
folder	directory
you have to make sure that you added the folder and files to your test project and have set its copytooutput directory appropriately

4652233
google-chrome	safari
the type is good in google-chrome and safari mobile

4652264
width	margin
it is likely that your body element has some kind of default padding margin and therefore it s box is bigger than the max width

4652273
rss	feed
i ve got a couple rss feed i need to parse for my app and i followed the excellent tutorial here

4652273

so i went to integrate it into my app and consistently get a force quit every time i try to display the list of post

4652278
hash	md5
from there i can compute the md5 hash and set the header

4652279
many-to-many	one-to-many
i would make it a one-to-many relation for member purchaseorder and a many-to-many relation member project as the membership appears to be the primarykey for it all

4652305
draggable	droppable
using jquery and jquery ui i have a draggable and droppable area the draggable item has the following helper

4652348
int	chars

4652381
portrait	landscape
after the user has tapped through the welcome screen i d like to show another screen that can be used in both portrait mode and landscape

4652425
int	double
i just use int and double by default unless they are in a time critical part of the code then i am more careful in chosing

4652437
int	chars
start with gregsansom s idea upvoted but instead of int use the chars 1 datatype with values i j s and d

4652455
int	double
otherwise use int size_t double or larger types as-needed

4652458
cas	shibboleth
or you could go with cas openid or shibboleth

4652487
int	chars
but using a chars instead of an int as a function parameter just because you suppose that the range will be small is a bit silly imo

4652518
range	minimum
alternatively use the jquery form validation plugin which offers a broader range of possibilities like enforcing a minimum length

4652524
children	parent
i have a parent master table that is generic enough to hold the common information of the children

4652526
int	chars
if you are using a resource limited platform such as embedded system it may be valuable and sometimes even necessary to choose a short or a chars rather than an int to conserve memory

4652526
int	double
otherwise stick with the int and double data types

4652540
oncreate	onstart
register this receiver in oncreate or onstart method

4652550
nunit	mspec
specflow is emerging as one of the better .net bdd tools it s true and mspec is great at a unit level though i haven t found much benefit over nunit given the non-technical nature of the audience

4652557
post	get
if it s a form and it post instead of getting you will need to redirect to get around the usual browser back button + post data unpleasantness

4652557
post	get
since http get requests are supposed to be idempotent the right way to do it should be with post which means a form

4652584
post	get
i want to develop a login form in php using the post redirect get pattern

4652609
int	chars
on most machines int is faster than short chars so there s not much to think about there

4652656
hash	md5	maven	pom.xml
i also investigated the assembly plugin s repository mode but it includes too much information sha1 and md5 hash plus maven pom.xml files

4652677
ws-addressing	soap
you will have to remove the soap header to and action or set your messageversion to allow for ws-addressing

4652695
hide	show

table is 100 rows by 18 columns. now what i want to do is to make it sortable on column and also have it run in both google-chrome and firefox

4652835
google-chrome	firefox
the thing is that i m already using dojo for some query needs but since i want it to run in both firefox and google-chrome i just copy paste the whole dojo thing in my script

4652906
hash	md5
doing a md5 hash on a some semi random data timestamp + userid + key is a fast way to generate a key of a fixed length that is hard to guess

4652923
fadein	fadeout
what it should do is fadeout from its current location move appendto to its new location and then fadein

4652936
width	height
width and height

4652941
cout	cin
this means things like std streams std cin std cout may not be usable

4652958
onclick	onchange
this includes onenter onexit onchange onclick onmouseenter onmouseleave events

4652966
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
in the ide s debugger a thread is suspended with runtimeexception and the variables include another nullpointerexception which is seemingly unrelated to the logged securityexception

4652973
binutils	glibc
so if your system has a lower version of binutils your glibc was likely built without it too

4653014
int	chars
your question is a little unclear but it sounds like you want to be able to convert int 0-25 to their corresponding alphabetical chars

4653022
dijit.form	dojo
dojo seems to have a useful feature in that it can setup event handlers and default options etc for dijit.form elements as it is inserting it into the dom

4653084
accessor	properties
or you could make the read accessor of the properties just reference freturnobject directly.

4653092
installation	upgrade
upgrade an installation to the next

4653118
width	height
safari iphone ipad doesn t honor 0px for width and height on an iframe and puts a big one

4653121
imperative	declarative
one main problem with cmses is the range of technologies involved in driving dynamic web-sites imperative php for logic declarative sql for data queries markup html for interface imperative functional javascript for dynamic interface json for ajax calls etc

4653162
inherited	properties
the projects inherited the properties sheet by its output type say x64.debug.dynamic.library.vsprops

4653162
inherited	properties
this vsprops file simply inherited other properties sheets using the inheritedpropertysheets attribute

4653164
put	get
and the type of width is such that it produces a value of type n when given a value of type a n so if you put in a room integer you get back an integer

4653170
phong	shading
i ve taken a first semester computer graphics course where we implemented pretty much our own graphics pipeline including shading using phong without any graphics api

4653227
setinterval	settimeout
you can either use setinterval or settimeout

4653241
put	get

4653246
wav	aiff
comparable to wav or aiff in size raw

4653264
preferenceactivity	preferencescreen
i have a preferenceactivity with a 2 level tree of preferencescreen s something like

4653264
onresume	onpause
it looks like they are actually dialogs not full activities since onpause onresume is not called when moving between them

4653269
int	double
ordinary types like int or maybe double have kind . this is probably the best bet

4653269
int	double
a possible downside to this though is that you can declare instance hasarea foo int and instance hasarea foo double which may be problematic

4653301
entity-relationship	diagram	erd	entity-relationship	erd	diagram
i am a newbie in entity-relationship diagram erd and have some difficulty in trying to come up with the diagram model for the following problem - i don t even have a clue on where to start

4653327
skip-lists	tree
it doesn t specify what the implementation of the dictionary is - it could be backed by a hash table a balanced binary search tree a skip-lists or one of many other structures

4653335

4653361
rss	feed
i have a project where i use erlang to aggregate rss and i use python to process the rss feed

4653400
instances	transient
transient instances - simple registrations without lifetime management specification are sufficient 99 of the time

4653406

in others the tmp partition is mounted using the tmpfs filesystem which is similar to a ram disk therefore being cleaned when the computer shuts down

4653407
getter	setter
i have the need to perform some custom logic in my ef 4 ste public getter and setter

4653408
post	get
this should get you up and running if not please post more detail about your situation

4653415
post	get
i m leaning towards ajax for the get stuff and a post for the save but i wanted to make sure there wasn t a more elegant solution first

4653431
octal	decimal
therefore the octal number 012 is equal to the decimal number 10

4653441
post	get
if you reuse your key you can xor two ciphertexts to get the xor of the plaintext or if by chance someone gets you to post a message with a plaintext known to him he can extract the key they actually did that for enigma in ww2 so that s not unrealistic

4653442
pop-up	dialog
when the dialog box pop-up you enter the value 10

4653481
serializable	deserialization
other advantages you missed listed for completeness compliant serializable deserialization no need to use new keyword to create

4653503
put	get
if you put it in your web-inf classes you can use getresourceasstream from servlet context to get an inputstream

4653540
awt	swing
i m trying to understand more about the dispose function of awt swing s window class and what it does

4653545
post	get
i ve tried using link_to and button_to but i suspect since i m using resources photos in my routes all of the requests that come to photo#new are being interpreted as get instead of post

4653552
hide	show
one option is to mimic the hint by either extending the edittext class and attempting to fix the code that lays out the hint yourself or by overriding the ondraw method to create the hint or perhaps by simply overlapping a regular textview on top of the edittext which you then show hide manually

4653572
switching	screens
however when i start multiple windows in screens and attempt to switching between them via the function keys all i get is a beep

4653581
post	get
when i go to login the login form renders correctly but when i post the form w my credentials i get back a blank page not a 404

4653600
put	get
if you put a rule to match your first condition at the top and the other rewrite rule you said you had already created after it you should get your expected result

4653617
put	get	post	get	post	put
and remember use get for idempotent non state-changing actions get projects 4 photos post for creating a new thing post projects 4 photos and put for updating an existing thing put projects 4 photos 8

4653643
listadapter	listactivity
i have a simple listactivity that uses a listadapter that i d like to customize the listview for

4653671
onresume	onpause
onresume is when i start driving and onpause is when i come to a temporary stop

4653671
oncreate	onstart
i could put the code that s in onstart into both oncreate and onrestart and not bother to override onstart at all but the more that needs to be done between and the more i m duplicating things

4653693
int	double
i d suggest you check the elapsed time using .elapsed.totalmilliseconds as you get a double rather than .elapsed.milliseconds which gives you an int

4653754
mouse	keyboard
the original designer of this system decided to disable mouse and keyboard input to the user interface with the exception of the cancel button on the progress dialog

4653754
mouse	keyboard
they did this by using a glasspane that ignores all mouse and keyboard events

4653782
textarea	textbox
the form has two three fields two input textbox and one textarea from subject and message

4653789
post	get
if you place an anchor tag with get variables and then use jquery to attach a post onclick the javascript would trump the href

4653789
post	get
you could then check in your php script that is processing the data which one happened post or get and with get do some extra error checking or processing to make sure the data is exactly what you expect

4653789
post	get
edit reading this again i started to think quite honestly if you go with my suggestion and write extra error checking or processing code for the get it wouldn t hurt to run it on the post either

4653808
serializable	deserialization
if it is being stored without some form of serializable process then when deserialization is attempted the object may possibly be read back in a strange or inconsistent state

4653830
packets	pcap
perhaps you could try a pcap with a couple of out-of-order and duplicate packets and check if gstreamer at least reorders deletes them that would go someway to clarifying what is happening

4653840
sip	sdp
i haven t looked into open source stacks but i would suspect that most sip stacks would include an sdp parser

4654004
tiff	png	gif	png	mp3	wav
i have thousands of very important documents ranging from customer contracts to voice signatures recordings of customer authorisation for contracts with file types including but not limited to jpg gif png tiff doc docx xls wav mp3 pdf etc

4654023
width	height
i m trying to animate an image s width and height properties

4654023
post	get
i ve read a few other post on this subject which all refer to setting a marginleft or left property but i can t seem to get the desired effect

4654025
jtextpane	jeditorpane
instead consider use of a jtextpane or jeditorpane

4654079
width	text-align	width	height	text-align	height
or setting the width and height of the and setting text-align right

4654082
hash	md5
take the first x characters of the resulting md5 hash

4654123
put	get
i d like to put that partial view on any page but i d like to have it to call to the service and get a list of categories by itself without me having to do that in every controller action

4654124
migrate	upgrade
at some point in the future i d like to automatically migrate users who have been using a to b but i d hope that clickonce is well-designed enough to not upgrade a to b if i place b s install files in a s install directory because it should be checking those uids

4654133
int	chars
fgetc interprets the chars as an unsigned chars but casts it to an int but returns eof which is -1 on end of file

4654140
width	height
also you can get x y coordinate and check if it falls within a range based on height and width of cup image

4654150
strstr	strtok
i hate nothing more than programming with an api where every function name is short and cryptic php s string functions are that way even though i m used to it now -- strstr and strtok are hardly intuitive names for what they do

4654157
width	height
height and use that same scale for height and width

4654194
box2dweb	processing.js
for the particular project i m working on processing.js and box2dweb turned out to be the right answer

4654207
int	chars
if it is ascii as using a func that returns chars would imply you would check to see if the first chars is - and then convert each subsequent chars to int with atoi const chars one at a time and multiplying your result value by ten each iteration before adding the new value to it

4654207
fgets	atoi
a better way would be to read several chars using fgets or something and then convert the char with atoi const char

4654224
cos	sin
if so how do i incorporate the variable so i can test it using sin cos and tan

4654236
hash	md5
you can get a shorter string by treating the md5 hash as a number in base 16 that uses characters 0-9a-f and converting it to for example base 36

4654244
folder	directory
however after publishing the compiled war file to the .. webapps folder to the apache tomcat directory i realise that system.getproperty user.dir no longer returns my application context path

4654250
atoi	getline	strtol	atoi	strtol	getline
perhaps a better idea would be to input it as a string as you already know how to do with getline then validate that the string consists of all numeric characters before calling a conversion function like atoi or strtol

4654250
int	double
but if you want to use trigonometric functions you re probably better off working with double with atof rather than int

4654257
awt	swing	swt	swing
if you have a window that opens up create the window in swt but make it s contents the existing awt swing

4654257
awt	swing	swt	swing
if you work on your conversion and whatever you check in always runs and executes despite the visual differences between swt awt swing you will save yourself many headaches in the long run

4654327
postgresql	mysql
finally i would suggest that you consider using a full blown db like postgresql or mysql to do something like store binary data

4654349
uiview	subviews
similarly if you add any uiview instance as a subviews to superview then that superview will care its subviews memory management

4654391
hide	show
just hide and show a databound

4654393
bison	lemon	yacc	bison	yacc	lemon
then you can look fordward implementing a lexer and parser using tools for generating them like bison antlr lemon yacc etc.

4654415
daemons	systemd
apple s ux expects the user to use the integrated functionality of the systemd provided in systemd preferences if you have a daemons agent that s different

4654422
fgetc	fread
if the structures in the title implies binary then you likely want to use fread but if you really are chasing the question of what the layout of the integer stored in a binary file is you can use fgetc

4654432

4654471
tunnel	vpn
now after a while i walk away from my computer and sooner or later the vpn tunnel times out

4654505
gmail	hotmail
of course replace accountname_here with an arbitrary account name replace email_here with a valid email such as a gmail or hotmail and replace password_here with the password to your email

4654552
int	chars
i thought it is better to avoid chars and short because of arithmetic conversion most likely they will be converted to int or longs and this will cause compiler to generate extra instructions

4654569
cpython	pypy
here s the adapted code shared by cpython 2.5 pypy and shed skin

4654569
cpython	pypy
running with pypy is as simple as running with cpython you just type pypy instead of python

4654569
cpython	pypy
shed skin becomes fastest pypy surpasses cpython

4654599
dropbox	evernote
and its showing rest of options like bluetooth dropbox email evernote etc

4654776
ienumerable	ienumerator
first the return type should be ienumerator not ienumerable

4654778
jtable	jlabel
you could implement it entirely using java swing for example and by making clever use of jlabel jpanels and maybe a gridlayout or perhaps even a jtable you could almost almost

4654792
client-side	server-side
data can be validated server-side or client-side

4654825
spaces	delimiter
you need to give spaces after delimiter

4654832

4654905
google-chrome	safari
on the other side google-chrome and safari have a rather poor performance in case 1 compared against cases 2 and 3 especially as number or nodes increases

4654926
pop-up	dialog
although it will not produce a save dialog if the resulting pop-up is saved with extension .csv it will be treated correctly by excel

4654989
put	get
to get a proper csv you just have to take out all the unnecessary tags and put a between the data

4655140
ant	maven
using maven or ant am able to compile the custom code written by me and able to add produced class files to the war file

4655187
put	get
one thing to try is to put a dummy default.aspx file in the root folder this will not be used when mvc is working but can get rid of this problem

4655258
versioning	upgrade
the easiest for you is to upgrade to a delphi versioning that supports unicode delphi 2009 was the first versioning that supports unicode the current delphi vesion is delphi xe

4655296
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
honestly your best bet is to use ie opera firefox and google-chrome i m pretty sure safari and google-chrome both run off of webkit so they should be the same

4655296
google-chrome	firefox
i enjoy using google-chrome but others swear by firefox i find it too clunky

4655302
portrait	landscape
however i ve noticed that if a hidden view is released by the default implementation of didreceivememorywarning as described here when the view is re-loaded from the nib and i happen to be in landscape it loads it in portrait

4655339
width	height
you could try to pick a single cell to chew up all the space and set that to 100 height and width

4655344

i am writing a grid control that will display the contents of either a tdataset or a tobjectlist

4655409
post	put
edit as noted in comments this wouldn t be appropriate for a full http server as it wouldn t handle binary put post data well it may read the data into its buffer meaning you couldn t then read it as binary data from the stream

hide	show
because if hide of the element a button should also be hidden and if the element wil be show a button should also be displayed

4655910
hide	show
so i think i can write a function which toggle and do the things i want and i call the function if i want to show hide the element

4656356
versioning	upgrade
we upgrade to sql server workgroup on go-daddy but the have told us that although we can select the sql agent option the ability to edit this does not appear in the ssms as go daddy tell me they only supply the express versioning rather than the standard versioning with all of the sql packages and the express versioning of ssms does not support this auto scheduling

4656359
jar	war	cvs	svn
all those dependencies also called artifacts are in fact at their lowest level binary files jar war ear that your cvs svn git won t be able to store efficently

4656359
gradle	ivy
as a consequence what i would tend to recommand you is to use a dependency management build system like maven ivy or gradle

4656359
nexus	artifactory	gradle	ivy
both of these answers are solved at least in amven work but i believe both ivy and gradle are able to connect to such tools - and it seems some questions are been asked on this very subject using enterprises proxies like nexus artifactory and others

4656359
gradle	ivy	ant	maven
to sum up this long reply use ivy maven gradle instead of simple ant build

4656366

4656510
int	chars
as a further example take a look at this function that takes a pointer to a chars that is 8 bits in size and returns an int in this implementation that means 32 bits

4656514
rss	feed
an rss feed is basically just an xml document which you serve on the internet just like a regular web page

4656526
rss	feed
creating a custom rss feed with php

4656549
int	chars
typically the most-efficient use will be the native int size but it also depends on where the data comes from - it may be more efficient to load modify and store back chars short data than to load and convert to int modify and store back as chars short

4656549
int	chars
second in many many architectures chars and short are as fast as int especially if the calculation avoids implicit conversions to int

4656549
int	chars
note this is easy to mess up in c like x y + 1 - that forces conversion up to int assuming x y are chars or short but the good thing is that almost all compilers are smart enough to optimize-away the conversion for you

4656549
int	chars
this is helped by the fact that in typical processors the overflow wrap-around of a chars short is the same result as calculating it as an int and converting on store or by simply addressing that register as chars short in a later operation - getting the conversion for free

4656549
int	chars
third in some architectures chars short are faster than int

4656549
int	chars
on the other side if the compiler isn t smart enough to hide it from you local chars shorts passed as arguments to other functions especially not file-local static functions may entail up-conversions to int

4656587
google-chrome	safari
safari google-chrome works

4656591
rubygems	bundler
yet when i ssh into my server and check the gem list bundler 1.0.7 is shown to be installed also running ruby 1.8.7 rails 3.0.3 rubygems 1.3.6

4656635
vb6	vba
just paste into any vba access excel word etc or vb6 module and run no references etc required if it is true that a single space is equal to a zero-length string zls or an undetermined number of spaces then you will see a list of y s

4656657
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the error occurs only on firefox i have 3.6 google-chrome safari works fine.

4656692
modifiers	sealed
it s also worth noting the sealed modifiers

4656706
width	height
let s say width 2 and height 3

4656706
factors	matrix
to eliminate the memory factors i also tried it once with a 50x50 matrix and then kevin s took 5secs and nikita s 0secs well nearly 0

4656715
getter	setter
i noticed that the original getter and setter were asymetrical hysterical reasons

4656716
min	max
each time you encounter a number x higher than min a b and not equal to max a b your a and b get the values max a b and x

4656735
ant	pom.xml
i would not normally have a pom.xml in this project as it is an ant build

4656805
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this issue is present in firefox google-chrome safari current versions plus ie6 7 and 8

4656808
ant	maven
besides that i guess that you are somehow confusing the purpose of maven and ant tools in your project

4656808
ant	pom.xml
you can configure invokation of ant targets in your pom.xml file if you really need that

4656808
ant	maven
personally i think it is the best solution to have ant called by maven

4656813
google-chrome	firefox
it seems the following markup is rendered differently in firefox and google-chrome and i m not sure how to prevent it

4656932
post	put
and how can i put the person post object from the frontend to the validate method in the backend and to see which field fails name or email because telling only object has validation errors is not so good -

4656941
hide	show
i tried to just put jquery hide before the script but that makes the container-class impossible to close because when toggle hide is equal to show

4656952
client-side	server-side
i ve been thinking about this and in a way it is analogous to the situation we have with server-side and client-side validation

4656952
client-side	server-side
these days it s pretty well accepted that you should have a full set of server-side validation and adding client-side validation is an option you can choose in order to make your application more user-friendly

4656952
client-side	server-side
the client server case is a non-issue these days because so much work has been done to automate it generating the client-side code from the server-side code modelvalidatorprovider in asp.net mvc

4656984
children	parent
i need all child menus collapsed unless there is a current_page_item class on the parent or one of the children

4656986
width	height
what i would like to have it do is scale the width to fit neatly side-by-side at the bottom of the screen which it does now ok but have the height automatically scale to match the width as well

4656987
peer	p2p
i am developing an p2p application where a peer talk to the server to inform its private and public ip

4657004
pull	push
it has push pull over http capabilities

4657012
slider	jcarousel
this is my jquery for the jcarousel slider

4657017
inherited	properties
you could create your own panel which inherited from wrappanel and just adds the required properties and overrides the appropriate methods so that the margin padding is set for all child elements

4657019
google-chrome	firefox
i ll be looking at my contact form tonight which seems fine in in google-chrome firefox ie9 but not ie8 7 or 6

4657019
hide	show
when the customer clicks the basket or the button at the bottom right a hide show javascript function is called which hide show the basket id

4657049
put	get
however as soon as i put the orders relationship in the user.cfc it all breaks apart and i get an error message

4657099
int	chars
when i convert â and â from the extened region i get a load of 1 s padding the int that i m storing the chars in

4657121
modifiers	sealed	public	protected
in scala you can choose between public access public package-private access with inheritance package-private access without inheritance class-private access private object-private access inheritance access protected access whatever you may call it and additionally you have some kind of file-private access modifiers sealed

4657148
width	height
pertaining to html how do i make a div container grow with the content instead of manually defining a width and height

4657151
ceil	math.h
you can round it using the ceil function found in math.h

4657177
width	height
if you don t define width and or height the div element grows along with its content

4657205
union	distinct
the main difference between union and union all is that union does a distinct over all fields returned

4657233
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome and safari - i have to click the button twice to get the pdf to appear.

4657266
int	chars
second unsigned int casts do not extract the ascii encoding of a chars

4657266
int	chars
they merely convert the value of the underlying numeric chars type to an unsigned int

4657266
int	chars
you should convert to an unsigned chars first and then to an unsigned int

4657272
chown	chgrp
take a look at chown and chgrp

4657279
appkit	nsapplication
on the mac you have to use appkit a cocoa framework for mac os x which provides nsapplication

4657280
int	chars
when promoting signed chars to signed int a first bit sign bit is taken into account

4657280
int	chars	hex	binary
1 if you have 1x-xx-xx-xx chars in binary x - any binary digit then int will be starts with 24 ones 1...1-1x-xx-xx-xx binary - 0xffffffyy hex

4657280
hex	binary
2 if you have 0x-xx-xx-xx binary then you ll have starts with 24 zeroes 0...0-0x-xx-xx-xx binary - 0x000000yy hex

4657281
ienumerable	ilist
depending on the number of classes etc this is could not be the fastest approach but it will allow you to use the objects very similarly to the linq objects and depending on the type of collections used ilist ienumerable etc you will be able to use the extension methods on those types of collections

4657289
equals	gethashcode
you may also override the methods equals and gethashcode methods of the class of the instances you are trying to filter

4657304
jar	war
i can add the jar manually as an archive from the workspace but that would mean that whenever someone cleans all projects the jar for b would get deleted and not generated as the build only compiles the classes and the deploy packages them into the war

4657316
int	chars
in the code you posted alpha is treated as a value between 0 and 1 which of course doesn t work if you use you alpha channel as an unsigned chars use the following if you want to do it in int space

4657316
unsigned	short
note that while these are shorts the values should all be 0 - 255 the short is just needed as computational space for the char char products you could also use intermediate casts but i just used unsigned short types for all to make it more readable

4657324
post	get
jquery.get and jquery.post on the other hand can only issue get and post requests

4657324
post	get
internally these two functions use jquery.ajax but they use particular settings that you don t have to set yourself thus simplifying get or post request compared to using jquery.ajax

4657324
put	get	post	get	post	put
get and post being the most used http methods anyway compared to delete put head or even other seldom used exotics

4657330
post	get
they do pretty much the same thing but makes it quicker to write an ajax request - makes a http post request and makes a http get request

4657333
serializable	deserialization
as long as you re loading the data set in a memory at the beginning of the program and keeping it in memory and you don t have any complex queries some sort of serializable deserialization seems to be more feasible than a full blown database

4657357
getter	setter
iâ ve left off attributes and n2 style getter setter for clarity

4657371
post	get
post and get differ slightly in the manner in which the data is sent to the server good article about it can be found here

4657371
post	get
jquery.ajax and xmlhttprequest are page loads similar to post and get except that the page doesn t change

4657374
textview	imageview
i m a bit of a newbie so i m using nested linearlayouts with textview and imageview in each one

4657387
emacs	aquamacs
i am not sure about aquamacs but for me emacs 23 debian i just go in the compilation window and place my cursor at the end of the window which will attach and follow you can go to another window and it will still follow

4657390
versioning	upgrade
there is no upgrade to a commercial versioning

4657398
clang	llvm
for example there s clang llvm which already implements static code analysis of some form

4657410
cpu	processors
i have a quad core 2.4 ghz processors but i ve noticed that in task manager my application is only using 25 of my cpu

4657453
radiobuttonlist	checkboxlist
i am creating a survey page that has a list of questions and answers that can be radiobuttonlist checkboxlist or textboxes

4657458
hide	show
if you still get flashing elements you could also hide the links first create the container hide that show the links again and then add the jshowoff and show the container again like this

4657468
pow	sqrt
i ve got a fixed point class 10.22 and i have a need of a pow a sqrt an exp and a log function

4657468
pow	sqrt
i m assumign that once i have an exp function then it becomes relatively easy to implement pow and sqrt as they just become

4657468
pow	sqrt
sqrt x pow x 0.5

4657468
pow	sqrt
presumably btw there would also be a faster method for sqrt and pow so any pointers on that front would be appreciated even if its just to say use the methods i outline above

4657478
free	malloc
but you also need to free the allocated memory malloc line 40-ish

4657493
rss	feed
i must extract an image s url when reading rss feed

4657523
submit	submission
assuming that you re handling the form submission already in a submit event callback

4657545
google-chrome	firefox
any idea how to do that and make it work in ie firefox and google-chrome

4657551
lxml	beautifulsoup
use a library made for html xml like lxml or beautifulsoup

4657568
int	chars
i guess that depends on how you want to map the chars values to the int s bits

4657568
int	chars
this uses int in the input array for chars the result might be different depending on the chars used

4657584
min	max
you should use max instead of min and instead of if you will look for previous news item example above should work for next news item

4657655
pop-up	dialog
now i was planning to have an abstractproject _currentproject pointer as a member in the application s main class pop-up a dialog box on startup and based on the selection do

4657764
int	double
when assigning c typed variables as attributes like double int etc. to the python object no incref or decref is needed

4657849
int	double
this works because pow double int is trivial divide and conquer

4657849
pow	sqrt
pow x frac y is just and we have a decent 1 sqrt x

4657938
ssl	https
we currently have our webapp which is a standard sort of thing http main and info pages but redirects to https ie ssl for login and user actions etc

4657955
chess	tetris
such approach would be fine for game like chess but it not so great for tetris

4657957
width	margin
if so then since .threadauthor is a fixed width as well that 7.5em of negative margin you can put them into the same container div like this

4657997
integer	unsigned
the name of the type is uint8_t which stands for unsigned integer 8 bits wide

4658006
button	checkbox
best thing is to do it using jquery bcoz if u disable a button and enable only on checkbox click user may not know the button will get enabled only if the checkbox is checked.you can use the same coding which is mentioned above

4658038
strcpy	strcmp
strcpy and strcmp are for c strings which are 0 terminated

4658038
memcpy	memcmp
you should look at memcpy and memcmp instead which won t interpret your buffers as 0 terminated strings

4658055
post	get
your domain application core whatever name you call your domain rules must not depend of sessions requests post get and etc

4658058
memcpy	strcpy
you should use memcpy instead as strcpy will only copy until the first 0 -character

4658098
codeigniter	cakephp
what i recommend is you try to find out if they used a framework for the website something like cakephp or codeigniter

4658129

puts	gets
if you use just the machine name the optimization kenny refers to gets you a logon token via ntlm which is not in the network users group and is therefore not denied access by the acls which wcf puts both on the pipe and on the shared memory object where the server publishes the actual pipe name

4658383
width	height
a and span are not block elements therefore they shouldn t have width and height

viewwillappear will likely be called multiple times and viewdidload is not guaranteed to be called only once

4659105
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

4659131
viewdidload	viewwillappear
if for some reason you switch to creating a local array in the viewdidload or viewwillappear method make sure you release it as soon as your done with it

4659181
sorting	filtering
to utilize filtering sorting and pagination on my html table

4659190

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
site works in firefox google-chrome safari but not in ie 7 8

4659241
folder	directory
what i have right now is a separate folder on my root directory with permissions 755

4659270
viewdidload	dealloc
you need to release your objects in dealloc since viewdidload + viewdidunload is not necessarily called

4659284
mouse	keyboard
if you are looking for a keyboard mouse combo i would recommend the logitech products

4659291
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
use fileinputstream fileoutputstream and inputstreamreader inputstreamwriter to read write text with files

4659320
uilabel	uibutton
people who do not want to subclass the view uilabel uibutton etc.

4659322
typedef	struct
in your sample code you are attempting to dllexport a typedef of an anonymous struct - which is going to confuse the compiler on two levels first you re exporting an alias which it doesn t want to do and next the struct itself is anonymous so it can t even export that

4659322
typedef	struct
why dont you just skip the typedef and give the struct the name

4659333
typedef	struct
unlike c you don t need to typedef struct names to avoid typing struct everywhere and can just use pointcg instead of struct pointcg when referring to that type

4659339
uilabel	uibutton
people who do not want to subclass the view uilabel uibutton etc..

4659346
typedef	struct
you are employing an ancient c technique to define a structure the typedef struct

4659346
typedef	struct
in c++ there is literally never a reason to use the old typedef struct technique

4659385
mouse	keyboard
windows will really favor your process then and at the highest settings even keyboard and mouse stopped working - i found that out the hard way

4659396
width	margin
the result is that the margin of your inner div is the same on both sides and its overall width width + 2ã border + 2ã margin fills exactly your outer div

4659412
button	checkbox
the idea is when the code runs 5 checkbox appear and then once the user clicks on the submit button they get removed

4659417
width	height
so i check the height of text assuming width is fixed as

4659418
ienumerable	ienumerator
update it doesn t implement ienumerator but ienumerable

4659460
firefox	safari
if you are developing in firefox or safari you may use the console.error function to debug any error thrown in your code

4659512
pop-up	dialog
i am wondering if there s a way to use that pop-up dialog instead of my own where it is available

4659514
width	height
as i ve found recently setting width height properties on a sprite only forces the sprite to fit the given dimensions by scaling the actual size which is calculated by flash based on the rendered content

4659548
int	double
it indicates 3 is float not int in other case 0.50 is float not double

4659614
unsigned	short
if it is from a fixed palette then a short int or even an unsigned byte might be sufficient

4659614
integer	unsigned
transparency could fit into 32 bit so a 32 bit unsigned integer type would work

4659614
integer	unsigned
however you might want more - in which case a 64 bit unsigned integer might be required

4659647
smarthost	exim
for ubuntu on your pc that probably means using the smtp servers from your isp as a smarthost for exim or another mta

4659651
nhibernate	queryover
i ve tried creating a linq to nhibernate query but it doesn t seem to be supported so i ve decided to try and use queryover

4659771
inherited	properties
but i am facing the problem of the properties not being set correctly inherited set

4659787
pull	push
if you don t want a push but a pull model then you can of course use standard synchronization tools an object that has a critical section which is used in all accessors to protect data from concurrent access

4659801
int	chars
the only downside is the cost of the memory but odds are you won t be hanging on to that int for long as you will process it and turn it into a chars or byte

4659831
post	get
ok i saw many post s on how to serialize the value of dragged items to get hash and they tell how to save them

4659833
boost	stl
unfortunately there s no hash map standard in c++ - please see this so question for existing implementations couple of ideas there are sgi s stl hash_map and boost and or tr1 std tr1 unordered_map

4659877
getter	setter
will not care about the generated setter getter methods but instead assign the value directly

4659883
children	parent
you don t always need to select by an id or a class - you can select by tag by type by relation to another selection children parent siblings etc

4659888
folder	directory
i notice the c# dll builds to a folder in its own project directory while cli builds to the solution directory

4659890
pop-up	dialog
from pop-up menu choose table contents.. - this shows a customizer dialog

4659894
gridview	sqldatasource
i m using a gridview with an sqldatasource to extract the data out of the database and display it

4659909

if this is showed in firefox or opera the result is the picture you see below everything works fine under google-chrome and ie

4659924
subtract	add
now you can add and subtract changes that are for the release without interfering with the current project

4659937
width	height
what i have here is the which is my container div and the actual content that is 100 of the height of maincontent but only 50 of the width

4659940
x86	64bit
from my recall i can say that the code for the x86 version would be based on the code used on some 80x86 and later processors for the 16 to 32bit versions while the x64 would be different code for the 64bit implementation asssuming it is x64 and not ia-64 or intel64 code

4659984
prepare	execute
why not just use prepare once execute multiple method

4660004
inline	inlining
note that i am asking about inlining eligibility from the standpoint of contract not about when current implementations of the jitter decline to consider methods because of implementation difficulties or about when the jitter finally ends up choosing to inline an eligible method after assessing the trade-offs

4660007
next	except
from one full row to the next the distribution will simply be blurred except for the edges

4660051
x86	64bit	versioning	upgrade
one scenario i can think of where matching upgrade codes may be useful is if you have previously shipped only a x86 versioning that was able to install on both 32-bit and 64bit operating systems

4660051
x86	64bit	versioning	upgrade
in such a case having a x64 versioning with the same upgrade code would allow you to easily handle upgrade from the older x86 to the new x64 versioning on 64bit operating systems

4660052
getter	setter	width	height
use a mask as the other comment suggests then override the width and height getter and setter

4660079
post	get
i m having trouble though sending any data via the post or get for that matter method

4660079

rsa	dsa
the hash is then signed using the private key resulting in a signature using dsa or rsa algorithm

4660113
super	self
super self tableview

4660117
int	chars
on the arm an unsigned chars which is stored in memory should run the same speed as an int stored in memory but an unsigned chars stored in a register will frequently have to be normalized to the value 0-255 at the cost of an instruction

4660117
unsigned	short
an unsigned short would have to be normalized to 0-65535 at the cost of two instructions

4660117
integer	unsigned
btw it s worth noting that while the c standard requires that adding 1 to a 16-bit unsigned integer that holds 65 535 must yield zero not 65 536 there is no similar requirement for signed integers

4660117
int	chars
a compiler would be free to regard a signed short or signed chars as an int when it s held in a register and as its proper-sized type when stored in memory

4660122
ceil	floor
it may be worth noting that if you wanted an integer result from the rounding you don t need to pass it through either ceil or floor

4660163
textview	imageview
ok so i have a bunch of nested linear layouts each one contains a textview and an imageview

4660175
post	put

hash	salt
hash the salt + the new password many times and store the salt resulting hash in your database

4660481
hash	salt
verify password your script looks up salt for the user and hash the salt + entered password many times

4660481
hash	salt
the only thing that should be stored in your database is the salt and the hash digest

4660481
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
assuming you have a database of md5 hash that you need to support then the solution might be to add database columns for new sha-2 hash salt

4660481
hash	md5
when the user logs in you check against the md5 hash as you have been doing

4660481
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
if it works then follow the steps in user creates new password to convert it to sha-2 salt and then delete the old md5 hash

4660526
put	get
when i do put it in there i get a nonspecific instantiationexception

4660546
rss	feed
for some rss feed i had no problems but in some cases the xmldocument.firstchild attribute was always null

4660548
pull	push
data layers are often a simple matter of push in and pull out so lets say you can abtract your data layer into an interface like

4660661
for-loop	loops
in a situation like this you should just refactor this into a for-loop instead of a foreach loops

4660666
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

toupper	uppercase
you can use the toupper method to convert a string to uppercase

4660925
super	abstract
you do not have a super implementation tableview heightforheaderinsection since you are not subclassing any abstract base implementation for uitableviewdelegate

4660942
int	double
do note that this returns a double which i assume is what you really want the average of a bunch of int is logically not an int

ant	cruisecontrol
i ve placed this file and all the other ant 1.8.2 jars in the lib subdirectory of cruisecontrol

4661231
helpers	actioncontroller	inherited	subclassing
if your second action is not in the same module controller you could subclassing zend_controller_action into your own base application controller that all your other action controllers inherited from a good practice on zf projects i find and then create another one called _forwardfromurl or something like that which breaks your url apart and passes it to _forward or create an actioncontroller helpers if you just need this one extra thing

4661871
opera	firefox
firefox and or opera seem not to like using swfobject as i did

4661879
repr	human-readable
the main purpose of repr is that it is used in the interactive interpreter and in the debugger to format objects in human-readable form

4661881
repr	human-readable
str might print a human-readable form of the object whereas repr prints out information like the object s class usually for debugging purposes

i am using rails 3 devise cancan

4662081
post	get
use rest or at least get and post and json

4662102
jobs	cron
cron jobs shouldnâ t slow the server always

4662102
jobs	cron
if itâ s your jobs that are so expensive your admin will probably not be okay with working around the closed cron jobs and slowing the server again anyway and may take further action to prevent you from working around

4662113
maven	pom.xml
as suggested in other answer that it is a good practice to write down direct dependencies in pom.xml and let maven handle it

4662122
post	get
in older browsers get it does limit the url being requested to 255 characters though pre firefox 1 and ie 6 days though while post supports an unlimited size

given a cubic polynomial estimated using least-squares regression i am interested in a simple algorithm that rasterizes the curve to display in an image

4662194
getter	setter
if you are fine with an automatic getter setter implementation this will work

4662203
next	except
you d use a similar pattern for ignoring all lines after a given line match except you wouldn t have to process any more lines so instead of using next you d use last

4662250
innodb	myisam
if it stores them alongside other row data then you could use clustered index pk in innodb alter table order by in myisam to require particular order of data in table s datafile ordered by popularity to create hot area which might improve caching and reduce seeking a bit

4662250
disk	ram
or you might just throw hardware at the problem â use raid add a ton of ram for disk db caches or use ssd

4662253

take a look at dotcms an open source cms built on top of liferay

4662345
free	malloc
this goes for all libraries you link with but especially for the c runtime library -- microsoft added extra error-detection code to malloc and free

4662381
ws-addressing	soap
based on the error i would say the problem is related with ws-addressing http action header missing header missing in soap message

4662390
maven	pom.xml
as to the purpose of the pom.xml file it s mostly metadata so that maven can figure out dependencies properly

4662396
width	height
play with the width and height of it to suit your needs

4662446
maven	pom.xml
i disagree that this violates the dry principal as maven defines things within the confines of a single project and its pom.xml

4662455
getter	setter
they re basically pairs of getter setter methods although you can have just a getter or just a setter with appropriate metadata

4662455
getter	setter
here the getter is public but the setter is private

4662476
post	get
i will try to get them and update this post

4662490
public	protected
that is wherever you have the word protected change it for the word public

4662490
put	get
if you need access control put it inside in front of the word get or the word set

4662497
put	get
because instead of having a pool you could put your algorithminstances in threadlocal objects thus making sure each algorithminstance is only used by the same thread all the time so the problem should disappear and you won t need to synchronize on the algorithminstance either so you ll get better performance

4662508
post	get
now this works fine with a get or a post from another page because the previous page is stored in the referer header

4662523
accessor	properties
the chapter on declared properties in the objective-c programming language explains what copy does and about synthesizing accessor

4662568
free	malloc
i started by writing my own implementations of malloc and free and then linked this object file before linking in the c c++ libraries

4662568
free	malloc
using the verbose option i could find out that there were object files that used other functions that appeared in the same object file in which microsoft defined their malloc and free functions

4662596
google-chrome	firefox
i have developed a small firefox add-ons extension javascript+xul+i18n support published on mozilla add-ons repository and i would like to port it to google-chrome

4662610
getter	setter
that tells the compiler to automatically emit the getter setter methods

4662616
width	height
i have created a dylib that exposes a render function that takes a url width and height

4662625
charindex	substr
if you don t know how many characters that first word has you ll need to find out using charindex then substitute that value back into substr

4662634
multiplying	add
it stems from the fact that and and or follow a similar relationship to multiplying and add respectively

4662645
qgraphicsview	qgraphicspixmapitem
qgraphicsview was designed to host qgraphicsitems to display an image you should use qgraphicspixmapitem

4662645
qgraphicsview	qwidget
embedding qwidget into qgraphicsview has some overhead and was really designed for complex widgets that can t be easily reimplemented in terms of qgraphicitems

4662650
getter	setter
add a getter and setter for the board field in the view class and call it from the main method

4662696
getter	setter
but just in terms of what the compiler generates the property creates an auto-backing field and essentially two methods a getter and a setter to access it

4662711
getter	setter
the first is a property which means that another backing variable will be created for you along with a getter and setter method

4662711
getter	setter
you should use this method because then you can easily change the functionality of the getter and setter classes although in visual studio converting a field into a property is pretty trivial.

4662766
versioning	upgrade
there s not much you can do to debug this either all you can do is upgrade your jre to a later versioning the current is 1.6.0_23 as of now and hope for the best

therefore to execute a stored procedure you only need to pass it params - you dont need to prepare it

4662907
post	get
i m starting a mvc app with fluent nhibernate and trying to get it configured but all post seem to suggest using castle windsor as well

4662923
stdout	fflush
in that case you must not call fclose or fflush on stdout in the child or the output will happen twice

4662930
macports	homebrew
you can install it using homebrew preferred or macports

4662942
firefox	safari
no problems in firefox safari or chrome...but here s what happens in ie

4662960
button	checkbox
thanks to the suggestions of peter and rubin i was able to determine that some javascript that i had written ages ago to validate the form before it was sent to the server was erroneously blanking out the values of the checkbox and radio button when they got focus

4662971
vim	gedit	vim	emacs	emacs	gedit
creating a text file in unix can be done through a text editor vim emacs gedit etc

4662992
getter	setter
one practical consequence of this are classes with fields and then getter and setter for each field

4663008
division	subtraction
except the operator i need is division not subtraction

4663008
division	subtraction
edit what i m really looking for is a way to get the ratio of timea to timeb which requires division not subtraction

4663009
devise	cancan
i would suggest using devise or similar to authenticate users and cancan or similar to authorize their actions

4663009
devise	cancan
but definitely let devise and cancan do the heavy lifting

4663050
rss	feed
enter the youtuber s username click get feed and you ll be presented with options for itunes zune other rss

i am using jfeed to parse an rss feed and i would like to modify an outside variable or array from the function executed upon success

4663198
daemons	systemd
a daemons is generally defined as a long-running systemd service that has no user interaction

4663199
width	height
another option to force a size is to create new sprites inside the thing you want to have width height placing them at the four corners

4663290
boost	stl
if not does anyone know of a good simple c++ header-only or very simple abstraction that will complement what is in boost stl std

4663311
daemons	launchd
the first time you launchd the daemons it would respond to the hup signal but the one launchd with nohup would ignore the signal not restarting again - unless you explicitly overrode the ignore status which is a bad idea for various reasons

4663319
google-chrome	firefox
i tried to locate all exceptions in global.asax and tried all three major browsers firefox ie google-chrome

4663324
width	margin
generally margin auto only works with fixed width elements

4663328
button	checkbox
great 3 wpf-looking button and a wpf-looking checkbox coming up

4663359
opera	google-chrome
for example in opera browser there are simple possibilities to do that with widgets user-made buttons etc. but i didn t find any solutions to do that in google-chrome my first source was the official google-chrome extensions documentations

4663381
versioning	upgrade
netscape kind of comes to mind - you may want to read this ... you may want to come up with a strategy where you can gradually replace components and frameworks in your application in a way that leaves you free to release versioning upgrade so that each versioning has a little more c# and a little less c++ in it

4663399
slideup	slidedown
i have clone and remove functions on my page to which i want to apply slidedown slideup animations to respectively

4663516
viewmodel	caliburn.micro
you can use commands to invoke a method on your viewmodel to do this or look into a framework such as caliburn.micro which supports convention based binding of view controls such as buttons to verbs on your viewmodel

4663638
hide	show
for the part of your question about showing 10 25 elements...you could hide it with javascript and have a button to show them i guess i m not sure about why you are doing this

4663641
button	checkbox
you are looping through each checkbox in turn and setting the submit button to be enabled if that checkbox is ticked and disabled if it is not

4663641
button	checkbox
now you set the button to be disabled and then only set it to be enabled if any checkbox is ticked

4663645
put	get
these html-encode the string before outputting it so instead of you would get which is the proper way to put and in html

4663669
post	get
in symfony if i remember right there is post validator which you can get all the submitted form values and use those to validate

4663748
freebsd	linux
each of these instructions tend to be cpu-specific but examples should hopefully be available for your hardware elsewhere or failing that by looking at sources to other operating systems such as linux or freebsd

4663813
post	get
more generally you should follow the post redirect get pattern

4663821
unsigned	short
here 28 00 00 01 is actually hex for 0028 0100 tag bits allocated 55 53 02 00 says unsigned short us 2 bytes long and after that there is usually 10 00 for 16 bit or 08 00 for 8 bit images

4663861
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works in firefox but not in google-chrome or safari so far i ve just tested on a mac

4663861
google-chrome	safari
the alert works in all browsers so there seems to be something preventing the window.open from executing in safari google-chrome

4663861
google-chrome	safari
it s almost like if the window.open is nested too far away from the click event then it doesn t work in safari google-chrome

4663864
hide	show
i need to hide show table row but it appears i m not targeting it properly

4663881
profiler	visualvm
or you can use the integrated profiler from netbeans which is essentially the same thing as visualvm just with some additional features

4663892
implements	modifiers
so basically you can think of the implements keyword as providing a second means of access to this method or property in your example which is independent of the access modifiers of the main means of access

4663915
int	chars
so for example i can use a void pointer to point to an int or a float or an array of chars etc.

4663915
int	chars
here s a hypothetical memory map showing the values of each assume 32 bits for int and floats and ascii for chars data

4663915
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
this is part of the reason you still see people casting the result of malloc calloc realloc

4663946
macports	homebrew
this will probably involve using a package-manager like homebrew or macports

4663977
post	get
it s much more than post get etc

4663988
vim	emacs
for example replace the editor with terminal ã emacs ã vim ã terminator a multi-windows terminal ...etc

4664013
post	put
sending a put request to users id would be how you would update the attributes of a given post again identified by a unique id

4664014
children	parent
for example if you only need to find the direct children of a parent an adjacency list model is probably simplest

4664017
google-chrome	safari
safari google-chrome have built-in pop-up blockers that stop this from working

4664017
google-chrome	safari
the only javascript that is allowed to open a new window in safari google-chrome is javascript directly attached to click handlers and other direct user input handlers

4664033
apache	nginx
i think you d need to configure a reverse proxy nginx apache

4664048
firefox	safari
2.- some recommendations on how to optimize the number of machines so we can cover the basics browsers for the different os s safari firefox ie different versions etc...

4664053
google-chrome	firefox
it does not do that in firefox or google-chrome

4664054
put	get
and its also a good thing to put monday 0 in your enum so you know what int you ll get out of the values when you cast them

4664062
children	parent
if the parent don t get deallocated they never let go of their children images and whatever data was in those images sticks around

4664088
for-loop	loops
if a function is part of the loop-test in a for-loop is that function called on every iteration of loops or only the first iteration to setup loops

i used activerecord in ruby-on-rails 2 and datamapper in merb and ruby-on-rails 3â i now use dm ruby-on-rails 3 daily

4664206
mouseover	mouseout
if worse comes to worse you can skip hover entirely and just use mouseover and mouseout instead or if you want to get really manual about the whole thing you can use bind with the mouseover and mouseout events

4664215
preferenceactivity	listpreference
in my preferenceactivity s oncreate i spawn a background thread which makes the api call and then populates the entries of the listpreference after one or two seconds

4664240
post	get
another mechanism is to take your criteria post it to a filter resource and then take the resulting uri from that and then use that uri as the argument for the get

4664244
children	parent
my system does not allow me to store children without a parent

4664285
post	get
i have found a few helpful post already on here but i still cannot get it to work

4664323
filesystems	ntfs
i have a file on a windows 2003 ntfs filesystems

4664364
int	double
each of these methods takes in a string and converts them to an int or double as appropriate

4664365
stdout	stderr
personally i would print to stderr not stdout

4664371
int	double
just to clarify string is never castable to double or int

4664379
accessor	properties
if you don t want to expose the properties you can make it private or whatever and test it using accessor

4664392
printf	strlen
the rules for printf are for a more specific case and thus override the rules for the general case for another example of the specific overriding the general it s allowable in general to pass null to a function expecting a argument but it s undefined behaviour to pass null to strlen

4664403
folder	directory
if you think about a directory folder as not a file cabinet folder but rather a index card stuck to the front of the cabinet to say what is in the cabinet

4664405
postgresql	mysql
postgresql - yaml - mysql

4664425
post	get
but to get something that i can later post the server has to first serve up a particular representation

4664434
cobertura	checkstyle
while you are at it take a look at other development tools like cobertura for finding out how good your test coverage is and static analysis tools like findbugs and checkstyle

4664434
cobertura	checkstyle	ant	cruisecontrol
if you are interested in improving your coding standards and build systems then i highly recommend using ant junit cobertura checkstyle and findbugs together with a continuous integration server hudson or cruisecontrol and a version control system git

4664434
junit	mockito
mockito + junit is a good combination.

4664442
junit	testng
for java junit is the most popular but testng is also notable

4664443
accessor	properties
you should not call these accessor properties in initializers or dealloc

4664443
subclass	accessor
you may receive a copy a placeholder object or a subclass may have chosen to re-implement the accessor as some examples

4664445
opera	firefox
in ie8 firefox and opera the size is incorrect

4664482
put	get	post	get	post	put
you perform a get not a post to read the resource and post or put to write the resource

4664491
put	get	post	get	post	put
rest is an architectural pattern for web services emphasizing the usage of uris as resources with a small set of operations that may be performed on them usually put post get and delete

4664501
postgresql	mysql
given that i could deploy on mysql or postgresql on linux i would export the data from the old db and totally start fresh so write a data import script that shapes things the way rails likes

4664553
rss	feed
basically i m taking rss feed of domain auctions from various sources like godaddy pool etc. and updating a table with the auction info using this stored procedure let s call it sp_storesale

4664566
post	put
i wanted to know the correct behavior of post and put on

4664577
mp3	speex
at the very least you probably want to be familiar with h264 mpeg4 mpeg2 for video and for audio there s a bunch of possibilities aac mp3 g.7xx speex etc.

4664577
rtp	rtsp
for example if you re using rtsp rtp you could use something like live555

4664591
width	height
flash includes objects hidden with masks in the calculation of the width height of the parent

4664622
pthreads	fork
the only exception is the system framework and even there the pthreads standard places severe constraints on what you can do between a fork and an exec

4664641
pow	math.h
you can use pow from math.h

4664673
post	put
if you use a server-side rest framework like restlet for java it supports the notion of overloaded post where you can use post but tack on a query string argument like method put or method delete

4664673
hide	show
when the user presses the edit button your javascript hide the read-only part and show the input form

4664679
post	put
the client can than put post changes

4664741
shadowing	named
after the package loads mathematica helpfully checks that all short named are unique and finds in this case that the short named tocycles is now defined in two contexts on one thus shadowing the other

4664751
console.readline	gets
this will block like console.readline until manualresetevent.set gets called from a separate thread

4664794
int	chars
unicode codepoints what an html numeric chars reference identifies are a 32-bit unsigned int value

4664810
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i finally have it working successfully in firefox and ie8 but am experiencing some weird behavior in google-chrome and safari

4664810
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome safari when using the onchange property i get one line of correct data but then it proceeds to overwrite that data with zeros

4664810
google-chrome	safari
using the onselect property by itself produces all zeros google-chrome safari

4664834
rss	feed
i m trying to set up an sqlite database to better store items collected from an rss feed

4664852
multiplying	addition
3 the method used to perform the calculation eg multiplying by bit-shifting may give different results than multiplying by repeated addition

4664873

4664917
mp4	webm
btw for now i am just proofing this with an mp4 filetype before i add in the ogv and webm formats

4665006
pop-up	dialog
the problem with the built in asp.net mvc functions is that they don t work on extremely large file downloads and in some browsers they don t pop-up the save-as dialog

4665008
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
you ll notice in ie the main window is empty whereas in firefox safari and google-chrome no problem

4665016
alarmmanager	wakelock
an alternative to the wakelock would be using the alarmmanager to wake yourself up every n seconds

4665034
post	get
this is my first post and it covers something which i ve been trying to get working on and off for about a year now

4665034
libc	newlib
i have the newlib distribution from sources.redhat.com pub newlib newlib-1.18.0.tar.gz and after poking around i found syscalls.c in newlib-1.18.0 newlib libc sys arm which contains all of the stubs which i have to update but they re all filled in with rather finished looking code which does not seem to work without the crt0.s which itself does not work with my chip

4665034
binutils	newlib
i currently have a script which downloads binutils arm-elf-gcc newlib and gdb and compiles them

4665042
getter	setter
getter and setter defined on the

4665056
octree	quadtree
some pointers to you you might want to have a look at classic culling algorithms using things like octree or quadtree in your case .

4665100
put	get
when i put that into a file xx.sh and create a file xx sh and run it i get

4665179
uiview	subviews
i have a piece of code in an iphone app which removes all subviews from a uiview subclass

4665179
getter	setter
the doc is clear on the semantics of copy for setter but doesnâ t appear to say either way for getter or at least itâ s not apparent to me

4665179
uiview	subviews
nsview is clearly returning a pointer to the actual array of subviews and perhaps uiview isnâ t

4665181
google-chrome	firefox
both firefox and ie displays the image much smaller and google-chrome show nothing at all

4665191
oncreate	setcontentview
in oncreate after i call setcontentview

4665191
oncreate	findviewbyid
access the view after the call to findviewbyid still in oncreate

4665204
inherited	properties
usercontrol s automatically inherited the datacontext properties from their parents + have design time support + u don t have to hard code resource paths

4665225
width	height
the encoding would be vice-versa exactly the same - you could store with this code width height 3 bits in your image

4665260
chown	chmod	chown	sudo
use sudo when you try chown or chmod on files or directory you don t own

4665278
free	malloc
without having the code for your malloc it is not visible if your free would work

4665278
free	malloc
unless in your malloc function you re going through each and every memory address available to the process to check if it is not used by your dictionary merely the assignment would not free the memory and definitely not keep it for reuse

4665278
free	malloc
so with that malloc function no your free does not free the memory

4665278
free	malloc
first of all you re losing the address of the memory so every time you call this malloc you re actually pushing the process break a little further and never reuse free memory locations

4665278
free	malloc
one way to solve this is to somehow keep track of locations that you have free so that next time that malloc is called you can check if you have enough available memory already allocated to the process and then reuse those locations

4665301
xslt	xquery
problems of this kind are much more suited for xslt but it is also possible to solve them in xquery

4665306
min	max
time condition counter min avg max hourly trend

4665391
union	distinct
the optimizer may not select this mqt if you still issue select distinct against the union all view so you may need to query the mqt or a view defined on top of it directly

4665392
width	height
i tested on chrome it shows actual height width

4665393
getter	setter
setter releases the old value and retains or copies the new value. this first technique is stated to be more robust but suffers performance penalties on frequently called getter

4665393
getter	setter
the third technique is better for frequently called setter and getter

4665445
nsmutablestring	nsstring
the nsstring returned by md5hexdigest is autoreleased because nsmutablestring stringwithcapacity returns an autoreleased string

4665452
next	except
so i try next to compile and link libmagic.so with a linker script which hides all symbols except 3 which are defined in libmagic.so and are exported by it

4665467
memcached	apc
did i mis-configure apc or memcached

4665513
comparator	icomparer
just about all methods that take comparator types should also have an overload that allows you to specify an icomparer to use instead

4665520
getter	setter
the retain autorelease pair in the getter mean that the returned object will remain valid through the lifetime of the current function call technically until the autorelease pool is drained even if the setter is called

4665552
rss	feed
i am trying to import data from an rss feed

4665591
profiling	benchmarking
more importantly what is the difference between the time results that come from test benchmarking and test profiling

4665612

hi i am using wordpress v3.03 and i am wondering how do i get featured images for the post in my theme

4665618
ubuntu	linux
works fine on linux ubuntu 9.10 compiled with -lrt printing

4665632
post	get
so if want the first 5 post i would get something like

4665653
mouseup	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown
in windows forms look at the mousedown mousemove and mouseup events on the control class

4665653
mousemove	mouseup
if you do not capture the mouse then you will not receive the mousemove or mouseup events if the mouse is released outside of the bounds of the control

4665653
move	drag
finally to determine the minimum distance the mouse should be allowed to move before starting the drag operation look at the systeminformation.dragsize property

4665732
inherited	properties
controls is actually a properties exposed by the control class and therefore the form class since it inherited from control and it represents a collection of all the controls that have been added to that particular instance of the form class

4665750
width	margin
the trick is matching the remainder columnâ s margin to the floated sidebarâ s width

4665752
width	height
so you create a final image which has the same width but the height is that of all 4 images combined and the final image is that of all 4 graphs on top of one another i don t mean layered i mean the second graph appears below the 1st etc

4665753
gridview	sqldatasource
it will be better if you bind gridview using your custom code at .cs page rather than use sqldatasource

4665809
width	height
but height and width is 0px

4665931
int	boolean
method.invokenative object object class class class int boolean line not available native method

4665932
xdebug	xhprof
i would also recommend using a profiler - such as xhprof or xdebug or zend products - to see memory usage and find where the memory is wasted

4665956
children	parent
is there a way to make two children modeless and block only the parent form modal .in short i want to access both the new forms i have added to my project and i don t want to access my main form till i make all selections in these two forms.kindly help

i presumed that the browsers firefox 3.5 google-chrome 7.0 tested would automatically display the scrollbars but it appears not to be the case

4666011
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
another way would be to let apache lighttpd nginx serve the image log the access and the parse it offline

4666046
folder	directory
i m trying to code a program in python which will create a folder for each file in a directory local with the same name then move that file into the folder

4666053
google-chrome	firefox
this works on firefox google-chrome and ie9

4666064
int	boolean
you can use an int zero positive and negative would probably be the best way to represent the boolean

4666109
switching	screens
flag_show_when_locked works pretty consistently in that it will show on top of the lock screens even when security is enabled the security isn t bypassed you can t switching to another non-flag_show_when_locked window

4666265
free	malloc
i m running a 64-bit multi-threaded program on the windows server 2003 server x64 it run into a case that some of the threads seem to be blocked in the malloc or free function forever

4666265
free	malloc
this looks strange to me seems a lot of virtual space is reserved but not committed and malloc free is blocked by lock

4666309
width	height
i have an html div with fixed width and height containing nested divs arranged with float left

4666314
post	get
stolen from the asp.net forums sorry didn t know how to get a link directly to the specified thread post

4666561
autoresize	scrollbar
i intend to have the component and panel or whatever be alclient so that they autoresize when my component resizes but i woudl also like them to have auto scrollbar

4666573
button	checkbox
the thing you have to do is to just disable your meal plan registration button and only enable the button checking the conditions onclick of any checkbox

4666621
jpa	javax.persistence
jpa defines a package javax.persistence it contains annotations interfaces and so on

4666684
put	get
if you cannot contact the site owner to get permission make sure it is easy for them to contact you should the need arise put a url or email address in the robot s ua string

4666691

the best solution to solve the problem of showing status messages to the users after a post to get redirect is to use user sessions

4666709
rank	max
of overall rank and in those max

4666739
gmail	hotmail
my problem is i put a link in side the template and it is working fine for gmail and hotmail but when i check in yahoo the link color and font size is not proper

4666754
ubuntu	linux
i have been able to build rabbitmq server on ubuntu linux

4666757
put	get
then in the php file you put in home xyzcom website you can get the domain that was actually called in the variable

4666839
integer	unsigned
the idea behind this is that integer types that have so-called conversion rank smaller than int are automatically promoted to signed or unsigned int

4666845
kohana	yii
i d look at kohana or yii

4666864
width	height
bitmap.createbitmap bitmap source int x int y int width int height will do the creation

4666870
button	checkbox
the idea is when the code runs 5 checkbox appear and then once the user clicks on the submit button they get removed

4666870
button	checkbox
i dont know how to make each checkbox have its own identifier because after this issue i will need to identify them individually because i will need to add text to them from the database and then once the user has check a few button i will need to save this into a seperate table

4666877
submit	submission
i would like to prevent form submission if the text input field or the textarea before the submit button is empty

the add-in is written with visual studio 2008 and uses vsto 2005 with the 2003 pias because we need to support outlook 2003 as well

4668777
vsto	add-in
i ve also checked the usual suspects cas policy pias installed loadbehavior in the registry reinstalling vsto and the add-in

4668777
vsto	add-in
thus the reason for not loading is not an exception in my add-in but rather a failure of vsto to load the add-in or of outlook to load vsto

4668777
vsto	add-in
instead of more random debugging try this... try that... i d really like to force outlook and or vsto to tell me what s wrong to give me a useful error message instead of just doing nothing when trying to enable the add-in

since int has 3 bytes greater int is 4 bytes and chars is 1 byte it will have 4 memory blocks

4670455

4670846
prefuse	jung
but when i tried to display the same dataset using fruchtermanreingoldlayout in both jung and prefuse i get different displays

4670846
prefuse	jung
somehow the layout algorithms in prefuse seem to display a better layout than in jung rendering is also better i think though most of the layout algorithms in prefuse are based on jung implementation

4670846
prefuse	jung
outside of these requirements prefuse has good support for expressions and query language but looks like it is not actively developed unlike jung

4670862
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
take into your consideration that my object should be dynamically drawn on the page and it will be consisted of multiple controls labels textboxes checkbox dropdownlistfor .

there is a reason why people always make properties protected and defined getter setter so they can pre- or postprocess the values

4671132
put	get
you will still need to put a lock on the shared data to ensure that the ui thread doesn t get a stale update

4671137

they are often output directly to the tty instead of to stdout or stderr

4671142
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationitem	uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar	uinavigationbar	uinavigationitem	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
uinavigationbar s manage a stack of uinavigationitem s much like a uinavigationcontroller manager a stack of uiviewcontroller s

4671142
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
if you don t want to manage it yourself you can do as mplappert suggested and nest your view controller without a stand-alone uinavigationbar in a uinavigationcontroller and present the navigation controller modally instead of your view controller

4671144
emacs	aquamacs
and i ve returned to my editor of choice emacs actually most of the time i m in aquamacs on the mac but i do occasionally use emacs when i m on a linux box

4671169

how can i use delay with show and hide in jquery

4671275
folder	directory
i have some folder and files inside a directory

with instrumented profiling there can be a large overhead on small leaf functions that get called many times as the calls to the instrumentation library can be significant compared to the execution time of the function

4671299
paramiko	pexpect
you can also use any expect implementation you ll find alternatives in perl python pexpect paramiko etc..

4671305
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
but until widespread adoption is achieved and the spec is finalized you still need to include the vendor-specific prefixes for -moz- mozilla firefox and -webkit- google-chrome and apple safari browsers

4671335

4671364
portrait	landscape
when navigating to the next view that view still thinks it is in portrait but the containing views will all look in landscape

4671364
uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
by the way the view hierarchy of the app is the following uiwindow - main uiviewcontroller - 1 of the 8 cached uiviewcontroller

4671376
wav	riff
the wav is actually a riff format which means in theory you need to do more complex extraction of the sample values

4671406
put	get	post	get	post	put
a particular resource may have many representations determined by http content negotiation and will support some subset of http verbs applied to it particularly get head and options of course but also often put post and delete too

4671406
post	put
idempotency of operations is an important thing to consider and it should also be noted that the operations particularly the idempotent put and the non-idempotent post do not necessarily map to creating and updating directly

4671443
uiview	subviews
i was tinkering with the fact that you cannot have the navigationcontroller as a subviews of your uiview object

4671481
post	put
if you go with the link make sure you use a method of put or post ideally put because it s an update

4671487

i used this event but now i need check if backspace button was pressed inside of the textbox or some textarea

4671587
versioning	upgrade
i did some searching and it was suggested to upgrade to the latest versioning of ajaxtoolcontrol toolkit

4671612
getter	setter
i guess the correct tm answer is that when all your method would do is return the value it is ok to use getter setter but if there is any work to do use a method

4671672
width	height
pdf-1.3 ã ã ã ã 2 0 obj length 3 0 r filter ccittfaxdecode decodeparms k 0 columns 2480 rows 3508 type xobject subtype image width 2480 height 3508 bitspercomponent 1 colorspace devicegray stream so there must be a way to get the mime_tipe from it with a function

spaces	delimiter
building on mandaleeka s answer break the string up using a spaces delimiter then use filter_var to sanitize then validate to see if what remains is a legitimate email address

4671726
daemons	systemd	daemons	launchd
also the program could be launchd from a non-interactive shell like a cron job or from some other daemons running on your systemd

4671755
inherited	properties
i m not sure what is too big but to me the inherited problem with these type of tools is you end up with a mess of graphical pictures with embedded dialogs and properties making a nightmare in a hurry

4671835
put	get
postgres is the name of my shared db when i put in template0 or template1 i get the same number back

4671836
width	height
what i want is that the text in cells be wrapped and the cell height no cell width increased the amount needed to show all the text

4671860
inherited	properties
this checks whether a properties is inherited from the prototype it will return false then or is truly an own properties

4671872
int	chars
you can t return a local object that aren t a simply type int float chars but you can return a pointer to a new object

4671894
post	get
my idea is thet after successful post customer create the user would be redirected to get customer details 42 where 42 is id of the newly created customer record

4671905
folder	directory
if you have the image in your content folder then you can change the img src to something like .. .. content image.gif where the .. will send you back up a directory

4671907
onclick	onsubmit
most likely it s due to the ajax.beginform as that sets up an onclick and an onsubmit handler

4671934
put	get
it either has to be linked in via one of the methods presented or you need to put the classes into children swf s and update your logic to get the class name load the proper child swf then get the class definition from the applicationdomain of the swf you just loaded

4671962
ssl	https
i d like to understand what i need to do to keep a bunch of https connection open to avoid the negociation of the ssl

4672017
jobs	cron
some of the cron jobs that our application employs are as below

4672017
jobs	cron

4672069
writetofile	nsdata
for data security and if you re running on ios 4.0 or greater look at nsdata s writetofile options error

put	get
i understood that put and get are two commands i would use to download and upload files

4672121
portrait	landscape
i have layouts for portrait mode in folder layout and for landscape one in the folder layout-land

4672121
portrait	landscape
i would like to update view from layout-land when screen rotates to landscape mode and from layout when screen rotates to portrait one

4672135
google-chrome	safari
this issue was tested on google-chrome 8.0.552.224 and safari 5.0.2

4672144
getter	setter
i found the issue i had a property on my class that wasn t database backed and was marked as required in metadata so adding a getter and setter to return what the property represented caused the tryupdatemodel to pass but i am still curious as to why the explicit include of properties didn t ignore the field i hadn t included

4672150
folder	directory
then i copied the data folder to following directory

4672151
rss	feed
it might be more useful to extract the rss feed on that page and parse the data in the feed to get the main content

4672159
rss	feed
i wouldn t try to scrape it from the web page - too many things could mess it up - but instead see which web sites publish rss feed

4672159
rss	feed
for example the guardian s rss feed has most of the text from their leading articles

4672169
folder	directory
if you re starting psftp by double-clicking the .exe it will have a local working directory of whatever folder directory you d started it in

4672173

not only does it have a clean syntax for defining cron jobs but it integrates well with the capistrano recipes

4672180
rss	feed
i m in the progress of developing an android app for displaying a number of rss feed yes i know there are many apps like this already

4672180
rss	feed
i m using an expandablelistview to display the content of three different rss feed

4672204
x86	64bit
64bit sized integers aren t substantially slower at all on a 32bit x86 architecture

4672204
x86	64bit
it s not at all reckless to use a 64bit int for hashes regardless of x86 or x64

4672219
int	chars
that is ambiguous because a pointer is just an address so an int can also be treated as a pointer -- 0 an int can be converted to unsigned int or chars equally easily

4672219
unsigned	short	int	chars
the short answer is to call p.setval with something that s unambiguously one of the types it s implemented for unsigned int or chars

4672219
int	chars
p.setval 0u p.setval unsigned int 0 and p.setval chars 0 will all compile

4672228
mef	prism
i am developing an application currently using prism and mef

4672239
min	max
select min zonemin max zonemin from plant

4672255
superclass	subclassing
it allows you to add abstract methods to your superclass and implementations to the subclassing later without affecting any existing clients

4672257
switching	screens
of note if anyone else finds it useful the handler codes needs to have a switching in it so it s not spinning off cpu cycles to bounceview.draw when nothing is happening on the screens

4672284
spymemcached	xmemcached
i am willing to also give spymemcached a try if i can t get xmemcached to work but i prefer the later

4672294

4672343
inherited	properties
in wpf you can do docking by placing your items inside a dockpanel and using the dock inherited properties

4672358
ant	cruisecontrol

4672360
subclass	abstract-class
- it makes sure that the programmer who want to subclass an abstract-class must implement the abstract method s

4672375
outputstream	inputstream
if you want to measure your own app s usage build wrapper streams that track the information for both inputstream and outputstream

4672403
super	abstract
so the nice thing about making my super class abstract is that i can have an array of type abstractsuperclass that can hold all of my gui components

4672422
multiplying	division
as it happens dx is always positive so we can just multiplying both d1 and d2 by dx to remove the division operation without losing the information we were looking for

4672449
gif	png
a data image url will usually be base64 encoded and will then contain a jpg gif or png image which you can store

4672481

i don t want to use any of the visual component libraries like richfaces icefaces etc because in the past i ve had very bad experiences with them so i ll be cherry-picking jquery components to do exactly what i want them to do

4672490
multiplying	division
the one in the parentheses is always evaluated first but since the machine logic you are using integer in that case the result of the division is 7 wich you multiplying by 30 gives you 210

4672555
hide	show
hook into visiblechanged which will fire when your control has show or hide called or the visible property manually set

4672587
postgresql	mysql
you d need a .pgpass for postgresql password and mysql option file for mysql password

4672591
getter	setter
why getter and setter methods are evil javaworld

4672598
ssl	https
there are tons of ssl redirect middlewares on djangosnippets that will redirect a url to https

4672599
post	get
once you post those details we should be able to get to the underlying problem

4672615
feedback	review
step 4 - upon success of step 3 the build is considered stable and the uat box is updated with that code base and the application is run in production mode for the customer review and feedback

4672622
client-side	server-side
unfortunately it looks like i can t retrieve the contents from the form on the client-side only on the server-side

4672720
http.sys	httplistener
when you use the httplistener the listening task is handed off to the http.sys system component also used by iis etc

4672853
set	bag
the documentation says that you should use a set when you do not want duplicates and a list bag when you want to allow duplicates

4672872
google-chrome	firefox
this example works on firefox 3+ but in google-chrome the height of the body is set to automatically cover 100 of the height of the window

4672873
mxmlc	compc
if you have a really big package of classes you want to include but don t want to write out the class name for every class you can compile the package as a swc using the compc and the use the -include-libraries option of mxmlc to include the entire package

4673166
post	get
when i try to post the request i get the following traceback

4673191
post	get
afaik jsf supports only post so if you want a get somewhere you have

4673212
ostream	istream	std	ostream
the first problem is that your sha_output_filter does not meet the requirements for using the non-const overload of push because it is not derived from std istream std ostream or std streambuf so it is not classified as a standard stream or stream buffer type

4673252
width	height
in other words this function can calculate the height of your string based on its width

4673261
pull	push
once this is at a stage that it can be pushed to production i will push from the development clone to the central repository then pull from the central repo to the production server

.htaccess	httpd.conf
in case of .htaccess httpd.conf

4673530
hide	show
create partial views which contain the blocks of code that you want to show hide

it appears to display landscape when it should be portrait and viceversa

4673707
google-chrome	firefox
the features are only around 20 complete but already the application on its own starts off by taking up around 160 meg of memory whilst leaving the application running it consumes around 200kb per second in google-chrome 2meg in firefox

4673728
post	get
you may get better answers if you post complete code

4673738
int	boolean
however objects that belong to the primitive data types which includes boolean number int uint and string have special operators that make them behave as if they were passed by value

4673750
fflush	gets
when the buffer gets completely filled with data it has to be fflush

4673753
post	put
i created a simple sample app to demonstrate the issue doesn t add images though it just paints all sides green however since most of the code is largely irrelevant to the question i won t put it here rather i ll post a link to it

4673762
teamcity	dotcover
when using teamcity to manage .net projects we like to use dotcover to evaluate our code coverage

4673762
teamcity	ncover
i believe ncover had some output variable that teamcity made available

4673771
inherited	properties
take all the int properties from source which name ends with id transform the value and set each to a properties in the source object with same name without the id suffix and it s type is inherited from entity stuff like that

4673772
inherited	properties
my teammate propose to to do it using abstract class advertiser and publisher inherited from person abstract class in order to have all common properties

4673796
min	max
i do not see how to modify the previous answer for the 2+ items situation i m running into now as it uses min and max to solve the original problem

4673799

google-chrome	firefox
it loads in firefox and google-chrome

4673855
spaces	delimiter
note that spaces is a delimiter in the request line

4673856

4673871
gridview	sqldatasource
even if i load it in sqldatasource and dont show i did this by removing the cloumn in columns tag of gridview i am not able to update or delete row using the built-in updatecommand deletecommand

4673895
try-catch	exception-handling
edit to answer the question in the post not just the subject you could write a rule as follows do not code a try-catch statement that does not do anything or only rethrows the caught exception-handling

4674004
client-side	server-side
client-side validation gives instant feedback - server-side validation does not

4674038
client-side	server-side
while server-side validation is a must client-side validation using javascript is definitely recommended

4674038
client-side	server-side
server-side validation requires a query to the server while client-side does not

4674078
serializable	deserialization
you seem to be describing serializable which is the act of converting object state to a format that can be stored transmitted and deserialization which is the opposite

4674083
opera	firefox
the problem is that this refactored page will be displayed as we want it only in opera i checked it on all last builds of browsers except for firefox 4 but i m not sure firefox will change the way they take that style into account

4674102
pull	push
there are two types of streaming parsers pull and push

4674179
stdout	stderr
java threads running for nothing trying to read stdout stderr

stdout	stderr
i m pretty sure my un x would be non-compliant if my outter shell script the one redirecting everything to dev null would still generate anything on stdout or stderr

4674195
hlsl	glsl
in the cg lecture at my university they use hlsl for the algebra making the students implement optimise parts of the raytracer which got me thinking whether or not i could use glsl for this

4674199
listview	gridview
i am currently having a contextmenu on a listview with its view style set to gridview

4674246
acs	adfs
i don t believe it is possible to have adfs rp-sts include a different acs url or acsindex in the authnrequest

4674246
acs	adfs
it seems possible to have adfs as the ip-sts send an assertion to more than 1 acs url based upon the acs url or acs index in the authnrequest as long as they are listed in the relaying party trust endpoints list

4674246
acs	adfs
however per the spec if the acs url is not listed and the sp is not signing the authnrequest then adfs should reject the authnrequest as non-compliant

4674247
stdout	stderr
it may be worth it in the long run to spawn a single thread to pull stdout stderr just in case

4674251
subtraction	addition
basically all you need is a vector class that supports addition subtraction etc

4674257
notepad++	sublimetext
i haven t found an editor that i love for rails development on windows currently using sublimetext 2 or notepad++ with explorer plugin using git is not as nice on windows and i just really don t like the windows command prompt i know there are other options but still

so if you are trying to get a printable version of the md5 hash you should hexdigest it this is the standard way of printing any type of hash each byte is represented by 2 hexadecimal digits

4674514
ioexception	printwriter
this is true in java where system.out is a printwriter so any ioexception thrown by stdout are ignored

4674521
wan	lan
you still have just your regular outside-facing ip lan or wan and your loopback 127.0.0.1

4674544
post	get
which works by simply issuing a potentially long get or a post and then google generate and serve the graph themselves

4674571
hash	salt
salt are are usually stored in plain text alongside the password hash

4674575
folder	directory
your program would be checking the directory and creating folder if they are missing

4674584
hash	salt
even if the attacker knows the way you compute the hash they have to brute force each salt and hash password -- which takes a lot of time for in general little reward

4674595
hash	salt
the salt is just there to prevent easy reversing of password hash - there should be a unique salt for each user but it s fine to store the salt in the same place as the hash password

4674614

a salt should be a completely random string that s stored in a user record along with the password hash

4674841

rather than trying to use the password in the select query and see if you get any records you actually need to just select using the username user_id in order to get the password hash and salt so that you can then use those to determine if the user entered the correct password

4674887
punctuation	words
you may then need to loop over the words to pull out any punctuation

4676418
post	get
as i understand it struts2 action class instances can unlike struts1 be stateful because each get or post to an action creates a new instance of the backing action class

4676418
post	get
because the action is stateful and thus not shared across gets or post and each instance is instantiated just for that get or post the action has no way to know if a particular session has getted the same page multiple times

4676418
post	get
is there a less verbose way to do this to not validate input on the initial get but to validate on the post without having to have two actions for every form

4677527
min	max
so i set the max value to 250 and the min value to 0

it works just fine in portrait then when the ipad goes into landscape mode it works just fine as well

4677585
portrait	landscape
the problem is when i go back to portrait from landscape the page is over stretched meaning portions of the page go off the screen in portrait mode

4677604
int	chars
this is a real worry though this considers lpparam a chars then adds two bytes to it which probably positions it half way into the four bytes used by the int member of the struct assuming a 32 bit app then writes over the single chars at that address with a truncated value the least significant byte chars from the chars pointer to your new string incorporating correction thanks to chris s comment

4677614
nofollow	noindex
in addition no-cache seems to be senseless in a rotobs-metatag there should only be index follow noindex or nofollow or a combination of these like noindex follow

4677864
getter	setter
compiling property access requires knowing how to translate the property name into the correct getter setter name

4677864

4677977
post	get
that is your client will be able to upload files with the content they have gathered or they could just use http get post because you don t have to worry about ui issues you can handle everything probably through one action assuming an action based web framework

4677990
width	margin
span s are inline elements as such styling attributes such as width or margin don t work

4678024

min	max
the issue i have is when using two y-axes y1 and y2 wherein the y1 value is min max zero positive and the y2 value min max negative positive in such case the zero marking of y1 coincides with the max negative value of the y2 axis through the x-axis that is the problem since i want zero point of both y-axis to flush together

4678496
min	max	range	max	range	min
if i knew the value of min and max for both y-axes then this problem could be fixed easily but i only know whether the range starts from positive or negative value not the value itself

neither bufferedreader nor pipedreader actually throw an ioexception so i think you re mostly in the safe by not worrying about it

4679593
inherited	subclassing
further inspection reveals subclassing of ioexception like interruptedioexception syncfailedexception and objectstreamexception along with classes that inherited from it

i m trying to gain an understanding of what the differences are between creating a conceptual class diagram as i have described versus calling it a erd

4680232
post	get
i also tried both get and post no difference

4680248
ienumerable	iqueryable
you could either change your items parameter to be an ienumerable rather than iqueryable or if that doesn t work create a variable in your method near the top

4680248
ienumerable	iqueryable
you will also have to change your return type from iqueryable to ienumerable

4680311
width	height
using only width means that the image will be scaled proportionally whereas if you set height as well as width the image is likely to be distorted

4680325
post	get
httpsqs http simple queue service message queue based on http get post protocol is probably the tool you re looking for

4680344

width	height
i have an image view with some default height and width images are stored in db and i want to scale image according to imageview height width

4680499

as i don t want it give default values because when ever i change it s height and width i also have to change it in code

4680499
width	height
i am trying to get the height and width of imageview but 0 is returned to me in both cases

4680499
width	height
this returns me 0 even it has default height and width

4680506
erd	diagram
however those links don t necessarily correspond to physical relationships like in an erd diagram but instead they represent logical connections

4680506
erd	diagram
the erd diagram on the other side is a persistence-specific diagram which display the entities tables existing in a most often relational database

4680506
erd	diagram
the erd diagram can sometimes look similar to the class diagram but that doesn t mean is the same as a class diagram

4680515
button	checkbox
on the checkbox click event or on the next button click you can call an custom action to create shortcuts

4680522
width	height
my friend by this u are not getting height of image stored in db.but you are getting view height.for getting height of image u have to create bitmap from db s image.and than u can fetch height and width of imageview

4680556
width	height
i think you may have to get the height and width of the window at the start and according to the mobile s dimensions you have to set that

4680722
post	get
and in my request parser for post and get based on cgi

4680722
post	get
this as far as i can tell works just fine on my local ubuntu with perl 5.10.1 but on the webserver which runs 5.10 decoding post or get will mess up the text

4680722
post	get
process post and get

4680746
google-chrome	firefox
i have the following code working fine on google-chrome and firefox but not working on ie

4680746
google-chrome	firefox
so here is what happens on google-chrome and firefox the output of the span .text for the position variables is correct starting at 0 0 and always showing how much of the content was scrolled in coordinates but on ie it starts on -2 -2 and never gets out of it even if i manually scroll the window until the end of it and try using the right arrow key it will still return the initial value of -2 -2 and scroll back to the beggining

4680746
move	drag
on another note i did other two navigating options for the user in this section of the site one is to click and drag anywhere on the screen to move it

4680746
google-chrome	firefox
the only part of this code i didn t write was the preventing text selection lines these ones i found in a tutorial about clicking and draging objects anyway this code works fine on google-chrome firefox and ie though on firefox and ie it s more often to happen some moviment glitches while you drag sometimes it seems the scrolling is a litlle jagged it s only a visual thing and not that much significant but if there s a way to prevent it i would like to know

4680814
spaces	linefeed
s matches any whitespace which is either a spaces a tab or a carriage return linefeed

4680847
int	double
should it work on int double numeric data type should it have some crazy data structures but it should not take too much memory

4680856
children	parent
but ie ignore children s width to resize the parent s one

4680863
free	malloc
however keep in mind that you must not use malloc and free now - use new and delete instead

4680881
free	malloc
use new delete instead of malloc free

4680918
width	height
increasing height width of an image means one of two things

4680927
profiling	debugging
here i assume that you have built your project in debugging profiling with nszombieenabled to true

4680987
photoshop	paint.net
the best way to resolve this is to add some noise to your image asset in photoshop or paint.net

4680987

alternatively you can set your window to be 32bpp with the following line added to your activity s oncreate between super.oncreate and setcontentview

4680995
jlist	jtable
so does a jtable jlist .

4681041

4681137
ubuntu	debian
you can read how to do just that for debian and ubuntu in blog post run node.js as a service on ubuntu

4681180
width	height
because if not the easiest thing is to set the height and width in the #header #postanad style

4681194
width	height
the w3c specification says that the width and height are implied and not required

4681241
width	height
in my experience not supplying width and height tags will cause the browser to render the image at its original size

4681250
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately it is impossible to specify a customized google-chrome profile with selenium 1 but it is possible to do for firefox in selenium 1 or move to selenium 2 webdriver - see this thread for more information

4681275
width	height
for example if the image you are adding is a banner ad which needs to conform to predetermined height width then by all means hard code the height and width

4681275
width	height
but if the image is something that might change over time i would suggest not coding the height and width as more than likely this means that the new image if not the same exact height width as the old one will now be distorted

4681301
width	height
replace the normal xml with the following code be sure to adjust the width and height accordingly

4681304
postgresql	mysql
it s probably fine for a prototype but you probably want to consider persisting these settings in mysql postgresql mongo etc

4681306
post	get
ok i saw many post on how to serialize the value of dragged items to get hash and they tell how to save them

4681316
textview	imageview
i don t know what s special about the id summary but if you change your ids so that the textview is say +id s and the imageview is say +id s_btn and change the references in the imageview to id s of course then it seems to work

4681338
int	double
some of your literals are int use 100.0 100.0 + 20.0 + price to get double precision arithmetic

4681339

instantiationexception	classnotfoundexception
class.forname throws classnotfoundexception while class.newinstance throws instantiationexception illegalaccessexception hence why you need to throw throwable

4681485
vsto	add-in
given your familiarity with c# i would recommend you look at add-in express costs and excel dna free as well as vsto

4681495
width	height
if you didn t specify an image size the whole page s rendering would get paused or a full-page refresh would get pulled once the image was downloaded and parsed for height width

4681524
rss	feed
im building a news website and would like to pull in relevant rss feed from sites such as the bbc wsj and the washington post and rather than simply display the feed as a list i would like to split them up into individual headlines and restyle them a bit like flipboard

4681571
width	height
each of the telerik skins actually have a minimum height and width setting for the radcalendar in order to ensure that the visual styles of the control are not broken

4681571
width	height
as you can imagine modifying the width and height to arbitrary settings could skew the look and feel of the control quite a bit

innodb	myisam
dbmses usually use a concept of either table locks myisam or row locks innodb most other dbmses

4681755
getter	setter
i found out that using an entitycollection see list release.releasedescription is not a good idea so in the partial class release i made an extra property releasedescriptionlist which transforms this entitycollection into a through the getter it has no setter

4681820
folder	directory
when i create the project it says proguard.cfg no such file or directory and the gen folder is empty and the project has no default.properties

4681833

button	checkbox
in addition to basic push button radio button and checkbox inputs of type radio and checkbox can be converted to button their associated label is styled to appear as the button while the underlying input is updated on click

4682160

when you specify button on a checkbox or radio button it hides the input and styles the associated label

4682191
google-chrome	firefox
the following regular expression works in google-chrome and firefox but not ie7

4682207
public	protected
i think it should be done using an protected or public abstract static field.

4682228
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
problem has been verified in google-chrome and firefox probably also in safari

4682228
hide	show
the reason for using hide and show instead of hardcoded units in pixels is that i can t foresee the total width of the elements as there can be multiple menu list items with different text length

4682230
put	get
so you have to put all those inside another object which can get awkward

4682246
google-chrome	firefox
tested on a primary and secondary monitor in firefox google-chrome

4682347
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
on the desktop browsers most of them have either a profiler built-in ie8 safari and google-chrome have developer tools with a profiler or as a commonly-used plug-in firebug for firefox

4682360
width	height
the css way would be to declare a width and height

4682369
pull	push
github can act as a central location where your team can pull and push code to and is a lot less hassle than maintaining your own source control server

4682383
google-chrome	safari
i noticed that when i open my site with google-chrome my primary browser and safari as well the adds in my left side bar aren t aligned with the calender image i have heading the whole section

at third you need some kind of continious integration stuff such as teamcity or cruisecontrol

4682455
keydown	keyup
please notice that the keypresshandler doesn t work in firefox for special keys like enter you would need to use the keyup or keydown

4682505
cvs	svn
intellij idea 10 supports cvs svn git and other popular version control systems out of the box

4682524
submit	submission
i have a form that upon submission submit data to an api

4682525
post	get
this does not really have anything to do with the question but you should always escape data you get through get and post before putting it into query

4682573
instantiationexception	classnotfoundexception
in your example you were doing reflection and this can go wrong in many ways the api declares linkageerror exceptionininitializererror classnotfoundexception illegalaccessexception instantiationexception and securityexception

4682608
getter	setter
based on the comments from the question i d say that you should have a in your java class without a setter only a getter

4682609
feedback	review
most libraries are pretty well tested and designed they generally get a reasonably sound review by some excellent programmers compared to by people with home-brew solutions in the same problem space and widely used enough to gather extensive real-world feedback

4682656
gdal	ogr
if not then you need to reproject your data using an appropriate ellipsoid in which case you re going to want to use an actual projection library everything uses proj4 behind the scenes these days such as the python bindings to gdal ogr or the much more friendly pyproj

4682774
width	height
get the screen s height and width

4682804

i click on the checkbox for the application should check for updates and select the radio button for before the application starts

4682890
ubuntu	linux
i m working in linux ubuntu the project folder is located on a mounted shared network drive i have installed the eclipse cvs client plug-in for my version of eclipse helios

4682898
getter	setter
also i give here an example of a setter and getter for the name field

4682898
getter	setter
you can also dispense with the setter and getter by making the fields public but i wouldn t recommend it

4682901
width	height
i have a variable width and height div and i want to position next to it another element which is basically a bar made up of 3 components top-fixed middle-variable height bottom-fixed just like any scrollbar

4682901
google-chrome	firefox
check out the example in firefox and see for yourselves in google-chrome it works

4682901
width	height
just to be clear i want a variable width and height the scrollbar was given just as an example

4682946
folder	directory
my only recourse is to delete the root directory of x and re- svn up from a level down since all this was also happening in a sub folder that was also an external

4682979
post	get
use post not get in your request

4683005
post	get
for post it should be a simple path to your script and shouldn t contain all of your query terms like it would for a get

4683037
innodb	myisam
it created messages as innodb and affiliatelead as myisam

4683051
maven	m2e
we use eclipse helios the m2e plugin maven 3.0.3

4683052
submit	submission
now if you -really- need a form that works like they do on the internet - you d have to create an unbound form - then create a submit button with vba code that takes the text boxes you have on the form and inserts them into the table in your database clearing your fields after submission to allow for the entry of your next record

4683084
pop-up	dialog
some sort of dialog pop-up and the user type his id and password and the api autorize it without open the browser webview etc.

4683115
equals	gethashcode
this will work fine since the type overrides equals and gethashcode sensibly

4683121
fadein	fadeout
i am trying to implement a fadeout effect in jquery for a div block and then fadein effect on two other div blocks

4683121
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
however these effects are only working in the google-chrome browser they won t work in safari firefox opera which is rather perplexing to me

4683121
fadein	fadeout
so when a div tag with the id of videothumbnail_xyz is clicked it starts the fadeout and fadein calls on the other div tags

4683123
accessor	properties
it does not respond to contentscalefactor because contentscalefactor is a properties with the following accessor

4683124
versioning	upgrade
by request a restored link to the d6 to d7 upgrade flowchart -- the original versioning from the first post was redone by an actual designer for a d7 upgrade podcast and now looks less like a tangle of snakes

4683137
google-chrome	firefox
i have implemented swfaddress 2.4 it works perfectly in google-chrome and firefox on mac

4683142
folder	directory
i apologize for the confusion when i say target directory i mean the source folder containing all the files i want to process

4683142
folder	directory
a part of the function of my program is to copy the directory structure of the source directory to a destination directory and copy all valid files to that destination directory preserving the directory structure of the original source directory a user may copy folder containing files to the source directory

4683142
folder	directory
i want to prevent errors by ensuring that if a new set of folder containing more subfolders and files is copied to the source directory for processing my program will not start operating on the target directory until the copy process has completed

4683169
fadein	fadeout
also you might consider putting the fadein calls in the callback function of your fadeout so if you decide to change the duration later on you only have to change it in one place

4683181
int	double
this means that you if you stick with double values you get perfectly good int with a little more than 50 bits giving you about +- 4 500 000 000 000 000 or 4.5 quadrillion

4683337
circuit	nor
first i would like to test my circuit works or nor

4683350
crypt	salt
according to the crypt documentation the salt needs to be 22 base 64 digits from the alphabet . 0-9a-za-z

4683350
hash	salt
i would be able to read the salt back out of the generated hash

4683350
hash	salt
which seems redundant since the salt seems to be included in the hash

4683354
children	parent
if the parent doesn t have a default constructor neither can its immediate children

4683357
google-chrome	firefox
apologies on not actually looking at firefox google-chrome last time

4683374
ord	chr
you need to import data.char to get the ord and chr functions

4683392
int	chars
can anyone give me some insight into how these primary keys are being generate i believe it s a combination of iterating int date and static chars

4683434
onfocus	onblur
i think you want to get rid of the onblur and instead make it onfocus so the background changes when they enter the box

4683436
getter	setter
it does not seem correct to have setter and getter for last purchase date and last purchased by in product.java model

4683437
daemon	cron
i can t seem to find anywhere that the cron daemon was logging it s errors

4683471

for-loop	arrays
each number is the upper limit of a for-loop for example if the arrays is the following code should be executed

4683588
google-chrome	safari
tested and works in fx 3.6 safari 5 and google-chrome

4683600
range	infinity
since the user can zoom in to infinity and work within that range and since i couldn t get anyone to commit to some sort of range we just use to see if the points are the same

4683618
doc	rtf
i need a library to extract text from documents doc doxc pdf html rtf odt.....

4683625
google-chrome	safari
however in safari and google-chrome webkit browsers the validation message does not appear disappear until the dropdown loses focus

4683666
getter	setter
and then in the contacts backing bean you only need to make and a property of the contact with appropriate getter and setter

4683734
width	height
uimodalpresentationpagesheet the modal view occupies the full screen height but the width is set to the width of the screen in portrait mode

4683734
width	height
uimodalpresentationformsheet both the width and height of the modal view are set to be smaller than the screen size

4683767
hash	salt
regarding your third question yes you should read and check the hash using the embedded salt and cost parameters from the hash itself

4683787
x86	64bit
it looks like it s because you have a 64bit os and you re running a 32-bit x86 application which is handled by windows windows on windows wow feature

i expect your app will get caught by various spyware antivirus software as a keyboard logger though

4683862
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
but if outlook 2003 machine having add-in installed gets upgrade to outlook 2007 and then if i install add-in for 2007 that result in dual installation neither previous versioning gets uninstalled nor new installation fails and the new versioning also gets installed.i can varify that from add remove programs

4683905
dictionary	map
you have to map the name to a destination from the document catalog s dests entry which is a dictionary that contains a name tree

4683905
dictionary	map
a name tree is essentially a tree map that allows fast access to named values without requiring to read all the data at once as with a plain dictionary

4683936
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended
for simple touches i use touchesbegan touchesmoved and touchesended but the touchesmove don t work in uiscrollview and can t send these movement to other scrollview or tableview

4683937
getter	setter
so i know there are a lot of questions on getter and setter in general but i couldn t find something exactly like my question

4683937
getter	setter
i started learning with c++ and was taught to use getter and setter

4683937
getter	setter
because of this and possibly other reasons we use getter and setter

4683937
getter	setter
also in python it is considered pythonic to not use getter setter and to only put things into properties if needed

4683972
getter	setter
so if you don t need a setter getter because some language feature allows you to do exactly the same then i really cannot see why you wouldn t want to use the language feature

4683991
getter	setter
i don t generally use getter setter because the presence of them indicates that my class isn t doing enough to be alive

4683997
temp	tmp
you have to use xp_cmdshell or some clr not sure of permissions to read the environment variables temp or tmp

4684032
for-loop	arrays
i m using a for-loop to append an m on to a string arrays then passing each string to a dde connection to download a stock quote

4684036
getter	setter
getter and setter property is just getter + setter allow for better encapsulation checking validity only getter not setter

4684036
getter	setter
in modern efficient languages like c++ there is inlining so there is no performance cost for simple getter setter

4684036
getter	setter
point is use public fields for structural and simple small-scale programming use getter and setter for large-scale oop projects

4684047
coalesce	nvl
i agree with the other posters that the better way to do this is to use nvl or coalesce

4684048
viewmodel	caliburn
i m now porting the application over to mvvm caliburn micro and am now at the point where i have my objects in my viewmodel and need to draw them on the canvas in the view

4684063
getter	setter
so getter and setter are always important in every language

4684063
getter	setter
properties are getter and setter in a nice layout because it looks like a variable and does some extra checks if needed

4684066
octal	hex
this will also allow you to specify whether you want to allow octal and hex notation of integers

4684067
getter	setter
for example i recently needed a getter and setter in c++ when abstracting a text object

4684067
getter	setter
while i agree that getter and setter over certain kinds of class are pointless there are some cases in which they are necessary

4684067
getter	setter
defining a property over a variable is just a getter and setter with syntactic sugar and while i support syntactic sugar it doesn t change the encapsulation

4684122
width	height
you may also want to keep other info in the image table as well for instance which user the image belongs to and which is the main image width height etc

4684131
google-chrome	firefox
i have tried this in google-chrome and it works fine haven t tested firefox

4684167
opera	firefox
now this works fine in windows + ie firefox opera etc but for macos i get complains

4684172
mouseover	mouseenter
i think the question is how do you tell what the hover color would be without the users actually hovering - sending mouseenter and mouseover events to the element doesn t trigger the browser hover state

4684181
decimal	ieee
recognizing this the ieee 754-2008 standard for floating-point arithmetic specifies decimal floating-point encodings and arithmetic

4684181
decimal	ieee
this technical report specifies extensions to the international standard for the c++ programming language to permit the use of decimal arithmetic in a manner consistent with the ieee 754-2008 standard.

4684181
decimal	ieee
yes the three decimal encoding formats defined in ieee 754-2008 correspond to the three decimal floating types std decimal decimal32 64 and 128

4684199
hide	show
i have a showcontent function which show hide content

4684225
backgrounding	multitasking
backgrounding multitasking is enabled in this app

4684225
backgrounding	multitasking
however on 3.1.2 since backgrounding multitasking is not supported the app is always launched from scratch

4684251
int	boolean
int boolean and string

4684261
unix	solaris
i will be running this on a solaris 10 server but i believe any unix system should work similar

4684264
cells	tablecell
each tablecell has 1 image that is loaded through jsondeserizer that has a valid link http for the picture and the picture is downloaded and then displayed in that specific cells

4684271
superclass	subclassing
since it s a class cluster meaning nsnumber is an abstract superclass of a lot of subclassing you ll have to declare your own storage if you subclassing it

4684304
google-chrome	firefox
this works okay in firefox but it has problems in google-chrome the image does not always resize it somehow depends on the size of the window when the page was loaded

4684304
width	height
this also works okay in safari but sometimes the image is loaded with its minimum width height

4684309
getter	setter
actually getter and setter as well as public properties hiding these are very little improvement over public variables and a pretty good indicator for quasi classes

4684373
fast-forward	merge
ultimately fast-forward means that the commits can be applied directly on top of the working tree without requiring a merge

4684384
google-chrome	safari
this is the css solution i just add a style width 100 and works for me at least in google-chrome and safari

4684394
mouse	keyboard
it fires anytime the user selects another node either by keyboard or mouse

4684404
fast-forward	merge
git cannot make changes on the remote like a fast-forward merge which a visual git reference illustrates like

4684404
pull	push
see for instance this so question git pull says up-to-date but git push rejects non-fast forward

4684411
width	height
- normal xaml to set the external height and width of the webbrowser

4684411

4684452
integer	unsigned
it is a typedef for an unsigned integer

4684462
maven	pom.xml
what i could really use right now is a sequence diagram for how maven does a build relating how the pom.xml elements get executed during the build

4684475
hide	show
ok basically i made 2 functions show tooltip and hide tooltip and it can get ajax config or simple config i just show you

4684480
getter	setter
you re right - no need for simple getter and setter in modern matlab oop

4684480
getter	setter
in the new mcos matlab classes the syntax for accessing a class property is the same whether you define custom getter setter or not

4684480
getter	setter
the ubiquity of user-defined getter and setter in java is partially because the language lacks these features

4684480
getter	setter
in old-style matlab classes the inverse is true all fields are private so you must write your own getter setter

4684484
post	get
but it s more common to use the curl library to perform get and post call

4684489
hash	md5
another benefit is the use of md5 hash for the filenames of compiled javascript allowing you to set never expires cache headers for all of your code

4684501
hash	salt
takes the initial hash of the block with the block counter in binary appended to the salt

4684532
width	height
in ie onresize event gets fired on every pixel change width or height so there could be performance issue

4684536
getter	setter
through properties python provides consistency of access using the natural direct-access syntax as well as the ability to add functionality to data member access though hidden getter and setter

4684551
hide	show
with some css classes defined to hide the things you do not want to show just yet

4684559
unsigned	short
edit this follows the discussions for why don t short circuit when the operands are unsigned ints and x is zero

4684565
cvs	svn
with cvs the predecessor to svn there was a .cvsignore file

4684568
move	drag
i have some divs that i clone and can drag and drop in a area now i want to connect by lines the divs and if i move the divs this lines must move too

4684590
put	get
get the data into excel that s usually easy assuming you get column a with prdsize and column b with prdcode in column c put the formula

4684628
accessor	properties
properties accessor categoryname on object nhibernatewebtest.database.person threw the following exception could not initialize proxy - the owning session was closed.

4684636
getter	setter
what i want to do here is to build a generic getmethod that uses field attributes values to fetch the data from the database _underlyingobject and just fill out the getter and setter for me.e.g

4684643
uitableview	nsindexpath
i would strongly discourage you from using this format to create an nsindexpath that s intended for use in a uitableview

4684690
post	get
but in my commentcontroller when i get the posted comment object it comes with cero 0 as a postid so i can t bind it with it s corresponding post

4684717
gif	png
create a transparent gif or png that has a diagonal line running from one corner to another

4684723
nsscanner	nsmutablestring
if you re operating on an nsmutablestring you can then replace the entity with its replacement and continue searching after modifying your location in the case of nsscanner or range appropriately to account for the length difference between the entity and the replacement character

4684767
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome seems to be the strictest but maybe in the html5 features firefox is also as strict

4684771
hide	show
you can of course show it before making the request and hide it after it completes

4684782
folder	dir
with svn you can t add stuff under a folder that is not under version control without adding the root dir

4684782
folder	directory
would ignore any xml files not under version control under the folder directory

4684787
int	boolean
that is you cannot use primitives or basic object types like string int boolean etc

4684799
put	get
one simple way to optimize this is to put a cron script that will run once per day hour to prefill the caches so you will get fast sp

4684802
put	get	post	get	post	put
i will get the data to be uploaded instead with multiple requests and put in base64 data in one of the post parameters

4684821
min	max
maybe store a min max average of x runs if you want to consolidate it

4684833
komodo	notepad++
hi all i use many text editors but mainly notepad++ and i search for functionality similar to komodo edit

4684858
lisp	scheme
i wrote it in scheme which probably won t be immediately translatable to common lisp so i don t feel that it d be a complete giveaway

4684911
getter	setter
unless you re planning on instantiating your foo-object through some data repository retrieval method this would require dynamic compilation to inject the necessary into your getter and setter

4684925
width	height
am having one small bar width 50 height 10

4684950
google-chrome	firefox
works for me in google-chrome and firefox

4684975
width	height
the affect i am going for is that the image is always centered and cannot be zoomed out more than the width or height of the image

4684975
portrait	landscape
right now this works fine in portrait mode but when it is switched to landscape the zoom scales are incorrect

4685018
octal	binary
006 octal is 110 in binary so it basically takes the mode bit vector and leaves only bits in 2 3 positions

4685019
textview	imageview
in this instance the textview would be drawn on top of the imageview along the bottom center of the image

4685066
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
the following code in php shows how you can detect if a request is html or xhr request parameter is available in at least ie8 ff3 safari opera google-chrome

4685069
perl	tcl
like c perl tcl java.

4685084
hash	md5
md5 hash based names for the compiled javascript means for great caching

4685089
viewmodel	caliburn
commenting out my canvas object in the viewmodel prevents the error so i m guessing caliburn is trying to map it and raising the error

4685118
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
its working perfectly on google-chrome safari and firefox

4685121

code that runs fine on safari and opera shows unexpected but reproducible results in google-chrome latest production version 8.0.552.237

4685350
width	height
where width and height in this blurp are the new width and height to be applied

4685396
min	max
i like storing the average of ten runs but instead of storing just the average i d also store the max and min values so that i can get a feel for the spread of the data in addition to its center

4685396
min	max
the max and min information in particular will tell you how often corner cases arise

4685408
google-chrome	firefox
but it does so just in firefox if i try google-chrome it alters the url the slider works but the screen jumps up to the top of the slider container

4685430
post	put
it put up a post about it here

4685445
titlebar	window
as long as you re willing to redraw the entire title-bar contents then you can use the dwm api s dwmextendframeintoclientarea method which involves setting your window to have no titlebar allowing the dwm to draw its glass into your usable area to create a new space that looks like the titlebar but is in fact in your client area so that you can draw buttons onto it

4685456
qsignalmapper	qobject
qsignalmapper is meant for parameterless signals and to relate them with integer id s or pointers to qobject

4685503
width	height
resizes an image scaling down or up to the given width and height

4685503
width	height
if both the width and the height arguments are provided the transform uses the dimension that results in a smaller image

4685503
width	height
just specify the width and the height will be transformed into the appropriate value to maintain the aspect ratio of the original image

4685513
int	double
if you get the values from elsewhere you can use double to turn the int into a double

4685555
post	get
a web service is just an http call get or post so that will always work

4685555
post	get
also lv 6.1 does not have http get post built-in so i used to use winhttp via activex as in the above to perform those actions.

4685570
post	get
this old post shows a way you can wrap your calls to php scripts and get a pid for each process

4685585
perforce	svn
in my opinion reason#1 for selecting between svn and perforce is cost

4685590
memcached	apc
but you have as well the session storage and application caches like memcached or apc

4685605

decide whether or not to junk them or try to convert them in the case of words smart punctuation characters

4685763
lxml	beautifulsoup
you could use offline scripting with beautifulsoup or if your html s a bit nicer the faster lxml to pre-process your data set extract those implicit fields and save them into an implicit format

4685763
put	get
the migrate module is excellent but to get really good data fidelity and play more clever tricks you might need to learn about its hook system drupal s terminology for functions following a particular naming scheme and the basics of writing a module to put these hooks in a module is broadly just a php file where all the functions begin with the same text the name of the module file.

4685801
width	margin
the 1st option only seems to affect the width of the visible right margin in the editor the 2nd option affects the wrap width of the auto-formatter

4685846
getter	setter
you ll have to write out the getter and setter yourself old-school style

this will checkout your repository but without any folder in the working directory

4685922
folder	directory
if you don t mind a bunch of empty folder in your working directory you could use immediates instead of empty

width	height
i am trying to bind an event in javascript to either the orientationchange or resize events in android in order to change the width height of some elements for my web app

4686227
width	height
in the event i use window.innerheight and window.innerwidth to get the current height and width of the window

4686227
portrait	landscape
therefore when someone switches from portrait to landscape i still get the values for portrait and therefore cannot resize correctly

4686240
integer	unsigned
there is no format specifier for size_t in c++03 you have to cast to the largest unsigned integer type you can and print that

4686272
integer	unsigned
if the result of datalength-7 is negative if you interpret it as unsigned the result is a very large integer

4686282

since each link has only one property you probably want radio button not checkbox

4686693
clearinterval	settimeout	setinterval	clearinterval	setinterval	settimeout
the thing that makes setinterval different than settimeout is that setinterval runs repetitively until you tell it to stop using clearinterval

width	height
note that setting the width and height as xul attributes affects the outer width and height of the window

4686723
width	height
if you want to set the inner width and height then the easiest way is via the style attribute

4690804
getter	setter
but the abundance of great refactoring-enabled ides like eclipse and intellij will allow you to easily change field-accessed properties to getter setter access and plenty more

4690804
getter	setter
if you are writing a program that is going to be used by other developers say using version control like cvs then it would be best to stick to writing nicely encapsulated getter setter style classes to avoid unnecessary refactoring causing lots for silly merge conflicts in advance

4690874
hide	show
it will be better to show and hide the flash object rather than crating and destroying

4690885

google-chrome	firefox
the following example works in ie7 ie8 firefox google-chrome it will not work for ie6 and probably more browsers

pull	push
in the visit method for simpler objects like your tastbooleanconstant you would call the appropriate method in this case fbuilder.createconstant with values that you pull from the object and push the result of that method onto the visitor s stack

4691123
mouseup	mousedown	move	drag
an example would be a click on windows xp click is mousedown and mouseup event however if you use your finger instead of the mouse you might get a drag motion instead of the click as when you press mousedown you finger might slightly move to the side from the initial position and you will get a drag instead of click

4691166
treemap	linkedhashmap
why not hashmap treemap or linkedhashmap

4691184
int	chars
but when you use it as int with isalpha etc. and the ascii code is greater then 127 then the chars interpret as signed chars and isalpha return an exception

4691184
int	chars
when i need use the chars as int i cast the chars to unsigned

4691187
accessor	properties
you are assigning to the instance variable directly bypassing the properties accessor

4691191
trie	tree
the reason is that a trie is a specialized search tree for sub string search

4691200
accessor	properties
this means that the synthesized properties accessor messages will include an automatic retain when the message is called but only when the message is called see next

4691200
accessor	properties
this is because you are not using the properties accessor message you are just assigning to the member variable

4691200
accessor	properties
+1 for the init not using the properties accessor message so no extra retain

4691221
draggable	droppable
to be able to do this you can t use the built-in accept option because that will not trigger the drop event for the current droppable if the draggable is not accepter and will therefor propagate into the parent droppable

4691225
maven	cobertura
also we run the maven install with cobertura which means that the unit tests are run twice

4691227
uiview	subviews
this is because uiview claims ownership of its subviews

4691232
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
simply delete your uinavigationbar category and implement your own uinavigationcontroller

now i am aware that mercurial supports the concept of subrepositories but that doesn t seem like the correct solution as it doesn t actually pull in the lib directory like i wanted as you ll still have to pull and push changes manually

4691298
junit	testng
i know support exists for running junit or testng test suites in parallel but it requires specific configuration such as specifying thread counts for example and most importantly do not prevent race conditions in non-thread-safe code

4691328
pull	push
as for still have to pull and push manually when you pull your main clone it ll pull the subrepos as well but it won t update them to a newer revision which is a good thing you need to do that manually just as you should with subversion

4691405
public	protected
i have a public function which triggers 2 protected methods

4691432

the return value will be an array with data pertaining to dated folder which you don t need but you can get the base uploads dir name out of there and then use the info to create your own ticker_data folder to store your data in

4691490
getter	setter
assuming that your selectedemployees property has a getter and a setter then the binding will work two way by default

4691490
getter	setter
therefore all you should need to do is make sure you re implementing inotifypropertychanged on your business object or as a wrapper property on your view model and in your selectedemployees setter do your ordering of the input and set the backing field to this ordered value and invoke the propertychanged event to invalidate the binding and have the ui pick up the updated sorted value via the selectedemployees getter

4691495
hash	salt
that is if we assume that inverting one hash value is doable then the salt makes sure that at least the attacker will have to pay the full cpu cost of a dictionary attack each time and he won t be able to share his cost across several attacks or with other attackers

4691499
outputstream	inputstream
an important thing to know about i o in java is that streams inputstream and outputstream etc. are used for reading and writing binary data you read or write bytes exactly as they are in the file and readers and writers reader and writer etc. are for reading and writing characters

listview	gridview
in visual studio 2010 create a visual webpart and use the standard asp.net listview or gridview on it

4692074
width	height
since in the actual page error #2124 is centered over the loading symbol it looks to me like either that is the only text that actually ends up in error_txt or the dynamic text s width and height are being changed so that error #2124 is all that fits

4692079
accessor	properties
do i need to declare temp release in dealloc method even though i am not using the properties accessor method in my program at all

int	chars
use looping to check each chars in turn is chars int or dash

4692666
metaclass	isinstance
you could easily create a metaclass in python that lets you create nested classes that live inside of an instance you can even make it produce proper bound and unbound class proxies that support isinstance correctly through the use of __subclasscheck__ and __instancecheck__

4692671
free	malloc
if you want to use my suggestion above you ll need either to use malloc and free or else declare instead such that the space is allocated

4695167
children	parent
now i ve read the man pages and i know they say that gettextcontent returns the concatenated string of all the children with the parent

4695167
children	parent
another way i was thinking about doing it was to try and isolate the parent from the children and do the gettextcontent command on just the parent but i don t know how feasible that is

4695211
oledbcommand	sqlcommand
also the oledbcommand doesn t support those named parameters unlike the sqlcommand which does - you need to replace those with just simply question marks

4695223
nginx	lighttpd
since almost all the perl frameworks can run as .psgi now you could run whatever you want on starman + nginx or lighttpd

4695228
free	malloc
so far i always manually allocate new buffer and then free it using malloc and free where it s not needed any more

4695298

when i load the resource from the project all works fine but when i put it on a .jar and try to load i get an exception

4696045
put	get
you can accomplish close to the same behavior by splitting the data into separate tables and modifying your application to get put data into the appropriate table as you would today

4696055
uiview	subviews
one thing you could do is have the uiview s in your subviews be of the same type by having each conform to the same protocol

4696065
haskell	scheme
functional --- scheme haskell

4696161
children	parent
this has the advantage of not requiring that the entire xml be processed with etree.fromstring first and parent nodes are thrown away after the children have been visited

4696491
width	height
is there something like dimension width height

4696528

4696533
hide	show
i have a html5 videoplayer with custom controls that i show hide as needed

4696574

if you try to extends or implements two classes there are potential semantic issues

4696574
implements	extends
you can implements multiple interfaces as well as extends from one class

4696587

you could also compare that information in the fe to a matching versioning in the be to make sure everybody upgrade when required

4696631
primefaces	richfaces
i ve been using richfaces during the last 3 years and primefaces for a few months

4696647

to use it in maven it was a pain i m generating classes from a wsdl not using jaxb directly so i switched to an external ant task as specified in this blog

4696698
dictionary	map
to get out a specific one you want in viewdidload you could map all of the nsarray entries into a dictionary keyed by tag value then just use objectforkey to get them out

4696806
converter	multibinding
i think the easiest way to do this is with a multibinding converter that uses the parent s itemscontainergenerator to determine the zindex

4696808
width	height
their width and height are explicitly set to 0

4696808
google-chrome	firefox
it might not be the best test case but at least for me google-chrome 8 mac os x 10.6 using visible is 45 slower even worse in firefox 3.6.13 75 slower

4696822
inherited	properties
this allows me to keep all of my models from having to inherited from a base class that has a messages properties and gives me more flexibility

4696844
width	height
which will turn your into inline elements--but you lose the versatility of block level elements custom width height floats etc thus the more common alternative is to use

4696849
width	height
divs and other block level elements have a dynamic height and width by default the height is determined by the height of elements that are contained within the div and the width is determined by the width of the element that contains the div

4696875
hide	show
and add remove that class as needed to show or hide the elements

4696936
ddms	adt
this would happen if you were say running eclipse with the adt plugin and the stand-alone ddms at the same time

4697089
daemons	launchd
in order for rightscale to properly manage instances in ec2 they use a ruby based daemons called rightlink as a communication device between their core platform and each instance that is launchd

4697089

if you re not launching the ami using the rightscale platform this will never properly enroll because they aren t expecting it to as such rightscale will have no communication with the instance at all

4697108
post	get
there are two possible verbs get and post

4697129
mouseup	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown
but only the top layer canvas z-index 2 seems to be catching the mousedown mouseup mousemove events i ve set up

4697160
subtract	add
we subtract 1 due to the way nestwhile works the last element already violates the condition and add 3 because we applied log2 3 times already before entering nestwhilelist

4697178
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
i m using ubuntu but any debian like linux distribution will be similar and other distribution won t have a lot of differences either

4697198
google-chrome	safari
i m not concerned with compatibility in other browsers but it must work in rescent versions of webkit safari 5 google-chrome 9 etc.

4697264
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
do you have to write a version of the plugin compiled for each platform - win mac linux since a plugin is a binary i assume this is the case so you have one version for ie and then multiple versions for firefox google-chrome safari which share the same plugin setup iirc

4697309
post	put
i would bet it s because your route expects a put and your form is sending a post probably because

4697352
profiler	aqtime
it is an instrumenting profiler like aqtime so it may be better than a sampling profiler for certain optimizations

4697363
freebsd	linux
the trick depends on the gnu extensions to define symbol versions with the .symver assembler directive so it will probably only work on linux and freebsd

4697383
put	get
once you ve put these in the property sheet you can click the add tables toolbar icon to get a list of the files for the particular connect string in the designated folder

4697427
equals	gethashcode
that should work fine provided your point implementation implements gethashcode and equals properly

4697427
equals	gethashcode
make sure it implements equals and gethashcode correctly or better yet use a version of point included in the framework

4697506
opera	safari
mobile browsers have virtual screen resolution they use for zoom and it s 960px in opera mini mobile and mobile safari

4697541

my prod env is linux ubuntu apache 2.something_else php 5.something_or_other_else

4697590
int	chars
by the way the bstree template is instantiated with typenames int and const chars each with a different compare function that is correctly assigned i think

4697592
coalesce	isnull
in ms sql there s a shorthand function called isnull which is like coalesce but only takes two parameters

4697623
post	get
after several hours running the program starts to get urlopen error timed out all the time and this always happens right after a post request from a server not a certain one might be a or b or c and it s also not the first post request causing the problem normally after several hours running and it happens to make a post request at an unknown moment all you get from then on is urlopen error timed out

4697653
hash	md5
it probably doesn t matter much which hash you use for this purpose sha1 or even md5 is probably adequate and you might find that the cksum command is sufficient

4697659
min	max
if you will not know the bounds before hand and would like to determine them from the min max of ar since its sorted that becomes easy

4697752

in posix-compliant systems and applications errors will be sent to stderr not stdout

4697788
stdout	stderr
you have to redirect stderr to stdout if you want this to work

4697808
mouseleave	mouseenter
i think quirksmode has all the answers you need different browsers bubbling behaviour and the mouseenter mouseleave events but i think the most common conclusion to that event bubbling mess is the use of a framework like jquery or mootools which has the mouseenter and mouseleave events which are exactly what you intuited would happen

4697817
post	get
since you re using a seperate php file to process the post and using redirects to get back to the original page you ll need some way to pass the data

4697842
uiview	subviews
uisearchbar inherits from uiview you can access it s subviews using searchbar subviews

4697876
min	max
this will give you a list with numitems random numbers between min and max

4697889
stdout	fflush
or better yet stick fflush stdout

4697889
stdout	fflush	fflush	gets
after each printf so the buffer gets fflush regardless of the stdout buffering mode

4697895
stdout	stderr
there is no way through configuration of mod_wsgi to say that all stdout stderr from a mod_wsgi daemon process should go to an alternate log file than that setup for the virtualhost

4698222
g++	gcc
you should see the build log invoking gcc now instead of g++

4698235
inherited	properties
to solve this you can either create a base class that all your view models will inherited from defining things that the master and its partial views need and then you d pass the appropriate properties into one of the renderpartial overloads or you can use the untyped viewdata bag to do something similar

4698240
children	parent
note that this only checks the immediate parent if the parent div had nested children then you have to somehow traverse through the elements parent looking for the orginal element

4698252

in my controller i have an edit get method to display the view and an edit post method to save the changes

4698283

in this case you need to also declare the struct node type since the typedef is not in scope within the struct definition

4698618
typedef	struct
note that both names may be the same i m not sure where the underscore convention originated but i guess older c compilers couldn t handle typedef struct x x

4698619
typedef	struct
the first declaration is of an un- typedef struct and needs the struct keyword to use

4698619
typedef	struct
the second is of a typedef anonymous struct and so we use the typedef name

4698619
typedef	struct
the second case wouldn t be possible here unless you abandon sanity and use a instead because the struct is anonymous and the typedef doesn t happen until the struct is defined giving you no way to make a type-safe pointer to the struct type itself

4698619
typedef	struct
in c struct tags are placed in a separate namespace from other names but typedef names aren t

4698643
typedef	struct
observe that this easily allows to use the typedef already inside the declaration of the struct itself and that even for struct that reference each other mutually

4698667
slider	supersized
using supersized 3.0 jquery plug-in and want slideshow to stop on the last slider

4698676
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
for collections you need to implement inotifycollectionchanged and for properties you d use inotifypropertychanged if you then change the source your view will change as well

4698696
google-chrome	firefox
the button is aligned to the center of the browser window as desired in firefox google-chrome ie7 and ie8

4698696
google-chrome	firefox
the button is aligned to the center in ie7 - and is not aligned to the center in firefox google-chrome and ie8

4698699
inotifypropertychanged	ieditableobject
next to implementing inotifypropertychanged and using icollectionchanged observablecollection and binding to the views you might consider implementing ieditableobject when you want to support the editing of the data

4698713
min	max
i need to use vanilla gl10 so none of the min max equation stuff is available

4698729
wordpress	joomla
you could also learn about server-side content management systems like drupal wordpress or joomla to name a few

4698810
children	parent
absolutely-positioned children go out of the normal flow an cannot affect parent s height sorry

4698833
implements	extends
in your table model which extends abstracttablemodel you need to implements as such

4698852
std	ostream
graph.cpp in function std ostream

4698852
std	ostream
operator std ostream const

4698865
width	height
i have gotten the width but i can t get the height right

4698869
amazon-s3	amazon-web-services
i tried to use amazon-sdk java sample code s3transferprogresssample.java to upload large files to amazon-s3 storage also posted here on amazon-web-services docs

4698892
int	double
the second problem you ll have to address is that in c++ the complex template exists for float double and long double none of which have lossless conversions to int

4698905
getter	setter
you can use getter setter instead

4698945
put	get
you can get way more fancy do it on the keydown put it in the setup file so it s on the toolbar

4698969
nswindow	nsapplication
your main function should call nsapplicationmain then your initial entries for writing the bindings to the c++ code will likely be event handling nswindow nsview and maybe nsapplication

4698987
prepare	execute
then in my class i m just calling prepare on the sql and execute on the array parameter

4699014
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
java does have its own binary serialization - see objectoutputstream and objectinputstream

4699026
width	margin
i know i can add a right margin to h1 but the red block can be of variable width and i can t have a variable margin

4699064
postorder	inorder
try to write iterative versions of pre-order inorder and postorder binary traversal methods

4699072
for-loop	arrays
you can initialize the arrays using a for-loop

4699073
width	margin
you can fix this by setting margin 0 auto and fixing a width like steweb suggested or alternatively depending on your specific requirements

4699075
width	margin
to force a block input originally display inline element to be centered you have to set a fixed width and then the margin to 0 auto

4699089
free	malloc
the simple rule is this exactly one free is required for each malloc

4699089
free	malloc
since you have just one malloc you need just one free

4699098
cvs	svn
there has already been some discussion about the problems the gen folder causes together with version control systems svn cvs git etc

4699105
jobs	cron
i know i m going to need to use cron jobs but i m concerned that processing records of this size may cause the site to freeze up perform slowly or just piss off my hosting company every three hours

4699114
slideup	slidedown
jquery s slideup slidedown and slidetoggle don t work with position relative elements in ie7

4699130
cvs	svn
you shouldn t store gen folder in any version control system no matter svn cvs git or anything else

4699197
hide	show
the next and previous buttons will show hide the corresponding div

4699200
google-chrome	firefox
but maybe clever browsers such as firefox or google-chrome might support something on it

4699283
fast-forward	merge
without the + updates that aren t fast-forward merge will be rejected

4699283
fast-forward	merge
first you might want to check that updating the branch would have been a fast-forward merge and after that update the branch

4699283
fast-forward	merge
you can check that an equivalent merge would be a fast-forward that the history of origin master includes master by comparing git merge-base master origin master with git show-ref master - they should be the same

4699289
webclient	webrequest
as documented here webclient makes use of webrequest in its private implementation

4699303
min	max	range	max	range	min
i ve read about setscrollrange but still didn t get what the range min max is in scrollbar

4699303
range	max
now if i try getscrollpos to get the position i m getting the value over max range

4699313
vsto	add-in
i have a vsto add-in for word

4699352
submit	submission
double submission occurs when an impatient user submit a form multiple times causing issues

4699370
google-chrome	firefox
i now have code that works on ie google-chrome as above and used to work on firefox until now

4699399
getter	setter
a validate step i would do the long-running part in a separate method getter and setter should normally be relatively fast

4699400
filtering	grouping	sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping
attributes are used for sorting filtering and grouping your search results

4699400
int	boolean
their values do not get paid any attention by sphinx for search terms though and theyâ re limited to the following data types int floats datetimes as unix timestamps â and thus int anyway boolean and strings

4699414
filtering	grouping
if you re trying grouping by poststatusid i suggest you do that explicitly rather than by fetching with lots of different filtering

4699430
google-chrome	firefox
however when one of the partner sites put it in their page 1 it doesn t render at all in ie and 2 in other browsers firefox google-chrome the html of the widget renders incorrectly the closes prematurely before the financial aid glossary

4699461
ubuntu	debian
considering f# at least debian upstream and ubuntu need to upgrade 2.6.7 to one of the 2.8.x releases soon

4699504
ubuntu	linux
on ubuntu or indeed linux systems in general it seems that the choices are to use a widget framework like wx or qt or gtk+ to create a gui application but all these frameworks feel like they are wrapping something more fundamental

4699511
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
all of the uinavigationcontroller setup examples involve using multiple xib s for different views however all my views are uiviewcontroller in one xib

4699529
x86	64bit
the one used by the full install of vs2010 is the one in c program files microsoft f# v4.0 or c program files x86 microsoft f# v4.0 on 64bit machines

4699549
hide	show
i want to hide show a lot of contents by id

4699572
post	get
something like servercommunicationmanager class sending get post tec requests and requesting for response

4699583
post	get
use the redirect-after-post or sometimes called prg post redirect get

4699699
int	chars
for example if i set up a rule that an id needs to consist of 5 int only then when i insert a row with id which is made up of int and some chars then it won t accept it and return an error

4699712
hash	md5
if you don t want to rely on any aspect of the client side javascript or even cookies you can calculate an md5 hash of the data submitted possibly by adding information such as source ip and the browser used and reject posts that have the same hash

4699714
google-chrome	firefox
on google-chrome it loads this page and then redirects to example.com while on other browsers that i have tested ie and firefox it does not load this html page on which this particular code is but directly shows up example.com

4699739
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in gecko webkit-based browsers firefox google-chrome and safari and opera you can use btoa and atob

4699743
post	get
and so your get and post methods would have different signatures

4699752
jobs	cron
also you can look at insert delayed statement and your idea about nightly cron jobs seems reasonable to me

4699766
int	chars
you can always concatenate these columns pk and contacttype on reports c12345 s20000 casting the int to string if you want to eliminate the column in order to save space on the printed or displayed page and everyone in your organization understands the convention that the first chars of the entity id stands for the contacttype code

4699770
hide	show
basically i need to show the activity indicator when a button is clicked and hide it when the button click event is complete

4699804
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
my target browsers are firefox and the webkit based ones chromium safari but it wouldn t hurt to have a great fast experience under ie and opera as well.

4699816
xlib	xcb
traditionally xlib was as low as it went but now xlib has been reimplemented on top of a much cleaner low-level x protocol library xcb

4699829

browsers tested google-chrome 10 firefox 3.6 firefox beta 4.0b9 ie 9 preview 7 opera 11

4699906
gridbaglayout	miglayout
it sounds to me like gridbaglayout would be a better fit for you either that or miglayout though you ll have to download that first since it s not part of standard java

4699947
put	get	post	get	post	put
these methods are most commonly http get post put and delete

4699953
fiddler	charles
i recommend downloading fiddler or charles and using that to determine what the server response was

4699971
hash	salt
beware however because this one-to-one routing also leads to security problems people tend to keep all of their executable code within the webroot -- even secure code which may contain passwords hash salt and other privacy-important code

4699984
cassini	iis
works with cassini so it s not an iis express thing

4700005
rss	feed
two wordpress installs one in each site s root where one simply accepts the rss feed from the other

4700006
boost	allocator
you could either use a pool allocator boost pool_alloc is a good one if you don t want to implement your own or you could use an internal node cache in the queue class

4700038
rss	feed
its not wordpress rss i want they have an api consider it replaced with any other feed url

4700069
post	put
so i build a form method post put in some input fields and a friend selector

4700095
button	checkbox
if you want read unread you ll want to work on all the selected items so you ll want something like of course in a deployed app you d want to make sure that this doesn t grab radio button or other checkbox etc.

4700127
dateadd	datepart
if you d rather not go through that right now you can also use datepart and dateadd

4700128
mouseup	mousedown
it might be that the drag tracker of the editpart you select is only applying the viewer.setselectededitparts eps on mouseup event drag itself starts from mousedown event

4700145
ubuntu	linux
after you re downvote i repeated this experiment on ubuntu linux with the following result

4700173
disk	ram
though as others have mentioned it loses the ability to share resource demands disk space ram space cache space with other programs that use the same libraries because you d be using static copies or dynamically loading your own copy from the .app-like bundle

4700183
udp	tcp
i ve a class that expects to get either an udp or tcp socket

4700198
udp	tcp
use socket_get_option and check for sock_stream tcp vs sock_dgram udp

4700222
mbunit	cruisecontrol.net
some people get by just fine with open-source alternatives such as cruisecontrol.net bamboo mbunit etc

4700310
pull	push
you could use .ajax to push the information gathered in the form and then pull the next form

4700376
button	checkbox
when somebody clicks the radio button i would like to append or show a checkbox next to it however if somebody clicks one of the radio button on another row on this table the previously shown appended checkbox will be removed and moved to this row

4700376
hide	show
i did manage to get the checkboxes to show and hide but i lost my code

4700419
flot	highcharts
i know that alot of these features can probably be put into things such as flot or highcharts but these things were next to free for me to use in timeline so i m weighing the cost benefit of whether it is easier to fix a memory leak or roll out 3 - 4 features on some library that doesn t have it

4700429
rss	feed
you could make use of wordpress rss feed to show the blog posts of site a on site b

4700438
width	height
i was wondering if you could possibly help me out with one more thing when the check box is checked i would like to replace the width and height fields on that row with input boxes

4700438
width	height
with slightly amended html note the class -names of the height and width cells

4700588
web.py	pylons	django	web.py
i m looking to try something new i have already used django web.py and pylons

4700616
integer	unsigned
thus subtracting 1 from 0 on that unsigned integer is taking you to a very large number rather than -1

4700649
google-chrome	firefox
the table element and its valid child elements thead tbody tfoot tr th and td presumably due to the inherent nature of a table though i have no reference to support or explain that assumption refuse to accept or apply the border-radius property js fiddle demo tested in google-chrome 8.x and firefox 3.6.x on ubuntu 10.10

4700651
hide	show
the tl dr is i d like to run some behavior to conditionally show hide buttons via js on load and then hide show buttons on different button clicks

4700653
opera	safari
now when i removed the recursive call ie didnt crash but the thing is that when i use mozilla safari or opera everything works fine with the recursive call being used

4700688
width	height
i would like to use a technique called css sprites where you have a single image and you take advantage of width height and background-position in css to display only parts of the image which combines a lot of smaller images

4700740
prepare	execute
execute runs a prepare statement which allows you to bind parameters to avoid the need to escape or quote the parameters

4700740
prepare	execute
best practice is to stick with prepare statements and execute for increased security

4700752
google-chrome	firefox
this is all working fine in google-chrome and firefox but for some reason ie throws an error on the indexof function object doesn t support this property or method

4700752
google-chrome	firefox
remember that this code actually works in google-chrome and firefox

4700756
vim	emacs
about editors adding newlines and not being able to see whether there s a newline vs blank newline at the end of the file i just tested vim eclipse and emacs on my windows system with cygwin i opened a new file typed h e l l o and saved without hitting enter

4700763
client-side	server-side
aside from the escaping on the client-side that it provides a prepared statement is compiled on the server-side once and then can be passed different parameters at each execution

4700765
cos	sin
a bit over-engineered i wanted to avoid calling sin and cos more than necessary

4700779
post	get
as an additional requirement they want to capture peoples facebook user id and get permission to post back to a users wall at the same time.

4700877
hex	binary
of course sorting that much data would required a custom sort routine that you wrote since it is binary coverting to hex would double the size of your data but would allow you to use standard routines

4700990
google-chrome	firefox
i m using django 1.2.3 and i ve tested this in google-chrome 8.0.552.237 firefox 3.6.13 and ie 8

x86	mips
i don t know mips assembly but i m quite good at x86 if this can help.

4701171
int	boolean
if you want to execute something when it s done i think you need to give it some kind of value like and int or a boolean

4701184
udp	tcp
you can use udp as well but if you are dealing with firewalls it is probably going to be simpler with tcp

4701197
implements	extends
you can extends the fileinputformat class and implements the recordreader interface or if you re using the newer api extends the recordreader abstract class to define how you split your data

4701282
daemons	launchd
more background the server is a daemons when launchd it forks and the parent exits leaving the child running

html form with 4 columns the first 2 columns are the sizes inside input boxes with disabled disabled when they click radio button to select a size a checkbox appears when they click that checkbox i would like to change the class and disabled attr of the inputs on that table row to allow them to edit the input box

4701419
width	height
you need to set the height and width of your tv view either directly or by using layout params and then after you ve done this you need to call setcontentview again but since the layout your adding it to is a child of the root layout you may need to get a reference to the root layout then add the tv view to the appropriate child layout and then setcontentview root layout

4701421
innodb	myisam
also one table is myisam whereas another one is innodb

4701436

i need some tips in how can i disable shortcut keys in linux ubuntu while running an application

4701594
post	get
if you are telling your plugin to send session id via regular get post parameter it has to be enabled on the server

4701645
children	parent
the only hitch is you need to sequence the tables so that parent are created before children

4701668
a-star	dijkstra
dijkstra is a special case of a-star algorithm so a is also too much for this problem

4701672
button	checkbox
you can use two different tables - one with a single form for the checkbox radiobuttons and save button and the second one with the delete button and hidden field

4701703
integer	radix
a radix sort operates on the binary representation of a number and sorts objects as if they were a big binary integer

4701711

4701827
integer	unsigned
will set thelastcount to the maximum possible unsigned integer

4701836
post	put
otherwise use post to initially create the object and put to update the object

4701860
google-chrome	firefox
i want to be able to enter the hostname and port on firefox proxy settings or ie google-chrome whatever and then go to a site and have my webserver forward the request to another server and forward the response back to the client

4701922
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i had already played around with using iframes for embeddable widgets unrelated to facebook and i found out a few browsers google-chrome safari etc. have strict cookie policies and don t allow cross-domain cookies set in iframes firefox on the other hand allows iframes to set cross-domain cookies in iframes

4701922
google-chrome	firefox
and it works in both google-chrome and firefox

4701941
post	get
i am not familiar with this library but try creating context before calling the post and reuse the same context for the get

4701978
width	height
you will have to play with width height and or quality until you are below 10k

4701998
realloc	malloc
for resizable arrays you can use malloc and realloc

4701998
realloc	malloc
these allow you to reserve with malloc and resize with realloc a certain amount of space on the heap

subclass	abstract-class
conceptually opentheeyes should be an animal method but it would then return an instance of the abstract-class animal which doesn t know specific subclass methods like bark or duck or whatever

4702130
stdout	stderr
to avoid this problem sshd instead waits until it encounters end-of-file eof on the pipes connecting to the stdout and stderr of the user program

4702175
children	parent
the port figures display as expected and debugging shows that the editparts and models are created and added to the parent but the children are not selectable

4702175
children	parent
in the parent i tried overriding createchildeditpolicy to return nonresizableeditpolicy by reversing the recommendation for making children not selectable here but it appears to do nothing

4702213
jar	war
cargo deploys what the container understands and that is either war or ear files but not jar files

4702235

firefox	safari
i do not want to target only safari because safari pc is ok and firefox mac is not ok

4702400
put	get
it doesn t need to be the most hack-proof thing in the world but obviously can t just put the success status in the url and use get

4702406
spaces	delimiter
a correct version of myls should be able to handle being called with no arguments with one argument with named arguments from a line containing multiple semi-colon delimiter commands and with variables in the arguments including string variables containing spaces

4702422
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu - linux

4702427

4702437
put	get
i have a textarea on my webpage which will get its value parsed and put into a preview

4702484
getter	setter
i think your first try with an attached dependency property was right because your getter and setter are not consistent now

4702510
rss	feed
there are ready to use classes for building rss feed like this one found on phpclasses.org but it is just as easy to read up on the rss spec and generate the xml yourself with xmlwriter which is based on libxml and included in php5

google-chrome	safari
despite googling widely i cannot tell whether there s a way to make it work in safari and google-chrome or not

4702553
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
now my specific example of the href value above expecting the anchor only and getting the whole thing isn t it according to this quick test but the fundamental point holds look at the value you re getting and step through the code on both say firefox using firebug and on google-chrome or safari using dev tools

4702571
for-loop	loops
your first method is the only one being executed because the condition which must be false in order for your for-loop to stop is always true i will always be 0 if you add 1 to it each time you loops

it declares the same two structure types as before but now the typedef declares an alias for struct c which is name1 and the extern line states that another translation unit tu defines a variable called name2 of the type struct p

4703247
typedef	struct
it is also afaik syntactically valid in c++ - but it is even more pointless there than in c since with no typedef introduces the type c as well as struct c

4703247
typedef	struct
the correct fix might be to remove the storage class typedef or it might be to introduce a name as an alias for struct c

4703259
nsmutablestring	nsstring
if you are too specific then your code becomes inflexible accepting only specific implementations which are not strictly necessary ie demanding a nsmutablestring when you could really work with any nsstring

post	get
i think it s not very important here how get and post extractors are implemented

4703291

4703746
integer	unsigned
it isn t a problem as every unsigned 32 bit integer can be accurately represented as a 64 bit floating point number

4703810
free	malloc
the malloc library will also have a list or lists of free blocks so it can often meet a request without asking the os for more memory

4703810
free	malloc
determining how many different block sizes to handle deciding whether to attempt to combine adjacent free blocks and so forth are the choices the malloc library implementor has to make

4703810
free	malloc
another alternative is to use malloc for initial allocations but maintain your own cache of free objects

4703838
free	malloc
malloc spends most of its time managing the virtual memory space that has already been allocated and only occasionally requests more memory from the os obviously this depends on the size of the items you allocate and how often you free

4703838
free	malloc
while this sometimes occurs particularly for larger memory blocks it is generally the case that free d memory remains allocated to the process and can then be re-used by later malloc s

4703838
free	malloc
if you know more about your pattern of memory allocation and release you can optimise malloc and free for your usage patterns or provide a more extensive interface

4703855

4704118
calloc	malloc
calloc 3 and malloc 3 do interact with the kernel to get memory if necessary

4704118
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
but most implementations of free 3 do not return memory to the kernel 1 they just add it to a free list that calloc and malloc will consult later in order to reuse the released blocks

4704118
free	malloc
finally the few programs that do return large amounts of memory are likely to bypass malloc and simply allocate and free pages anyway

4704201
inherited	subclassing
some of the subclassing inherited the parent class s enum values but some of the subclassing need the enum values to be different

4704257

you still have a problem when you will inherited your class b and this will call a.__init__ and if you don t implement createdrivers in the subclassing this line callable self.createdrivers will throw an error as that createdrivers doesn t exist attributeerror i think if i were you i will do it like so

4704605
getter	setter
for me using c++ usually is more convenient because of the fact that i have objects which have getter and setter methods and such

inherited	properties
the only way to remedy the situation for .net 5.0 would be to allow a means of declaring that an interface which implements a read-write properties can be deemed to implicitly implement a read-only version so as to allow ilist to inherited a covariant ireadablebyindex without having to add an explicit get method

4706248

getter	setter
just to remind that don t use capitalized variable name it might affects the getter and setter not working properly

4706333
int	chars
using stringstream would be one viable solution converting the byte which i imagine is just an unsigned chars to an int stored as a string

4706336
int	chars
it s correct that casting it to int you get -1 because chars in your implementation is a signed type it s actually implementation-defined if chars is signed or unsigned and usually you can change it in the compiler options

4706336
int	chars
to get its unsigned value you should first cast it to unsigned chars and then to unsigned int i think you could also get away with just casting it to unsigned int but i m not sure

4706370
rspec	capybara
i really like the way rspec is able to separate controller and view tests but have some problems with getting capybara matchers to work in a view test

4706370
rspec	capybara
i ve seen some posts on the net showing how to configure capybara and rails3 to work smoothly with cucumber or rspec controller tests but this is not really what i want - that is testing the views at the lowest level possible

getter	setter
in oop you normally define getter and setter for member variables which should be available to the outside

4706876
getter	setter
in objective-c you are encouraged to define getter setter at any time if they should be private put their declarations into a private interface

4706876
getter	setter
additionally there are things like key-value-coding and -observing which are enabled by properties but basically they are just abbreviations for getter and setter

4706876
getter	setter
conclusion inside of interface you declare members outside methods including getter setter properties

i agree that hard-linking folder directory can cause problems if not careful but they have a very definite advantage - time machine is a perfect example

4707231
filesystems	hfs+
the filesystems must be journaled hfs+

4707231
folder	directory
one really important issue is that the folder you create the link to is really moved to a super-magical super-hidden folder called .hfs+ private directory data 000d dir_xxx where xxx is the inode number of the source_folder - remember the format of the command is

4707231
folder	directory
i noticed that you couldn t do a ls -la command any longer without getting funny errors for all the folder directory that were in the original source_folder but you could do a ls command and all looked well

4707231
filesystems	hfs+
it s a very interesting piece of software and will tell you lots of details about hfs+ filesystems

4707231
folder	directory
if you try to do a simple ls -lr command it will fail and give you ls xxx no such file or directory error messages for all lower level folder

4707231
folder	directory
if you use a finder window to traverse the directory tree of the remote volume the folder that are in the folder that had or has a hard link to it will simply disappear without any error when you first click on the folder name

4707231
filesystems	hfs+
these problems don t appear to occur except for the error message if you use nfs to mount the remote client and assuming you had a nfs server on the system that has the volume as a local hfs+ filesystems

thus the parent can figure out how much space is available for its children and it can pass that in when measuring

4707251
redeclaration	ivar
as a note the redeclaration of the ivar s type in the property statement can also be useful if you want to declare the property as the immutable type of the ivar s for instance

portrait	landscape
if i recall correctly certain images will look fine in portrait mode but terrible in landscape or vice versa

4707789
portrait	landscape
not all designs in fact i d wager none without targeted style sheets can cope with the vastly different sizes of screen out there today from portrait orientated screens at public libraries to ultra fine artworking macs with giant landscape screens and tiny little laptops - the latter two often used by executives that have no understanding of how the zoom features in a browser work and also often have terrible eye sight and little patience

4707789
switching	screens
if you re really looking to be super flexible the you could use javascript or browserhawk or equivalent to measure the screens sizes and switching out style sheets for those that are really not going to work with your layout

4708349
istream	getline
the istream returned from getline is converted to bool by implicit conversion to check success of operation

4708370
screens	mdpi
we define mdpi to be the base density so 10dp on an mdpi screens will result in exactly 10 pixels

4708370
screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi	mdpi	hdpi
on an hdpi screens it will result in 15 pixels because hdpi is 1.5 mdpi

stdout	stderr
if you say then you are redirecting stderr to wherever stdout is currently redirected to

4708817
stdout	stderr
if stdout is going to the console then stderr is too

4708817
stdout	stderr
if stdout is going to a file then stderr is as well

4708817
stdout	stderr
if you follow this up by then redirecting stdout stderr still points to what stdout used to point to

4708817
stdout	stderr
this redirects stdout to log and then redirects stderr to wherever stdout is now being redirected which is log

4708817
stdout	stderr
end result both stdout and stderr are redirected to log

4708817
stdout	stderr
this redirects stderr to wherever stdout is currently being redirected which is typically the console

4708817
stdout	stderr
remember that stderr does not follow stdout so it continues to redirect to the console

4708817
stdout	stderr
end result stdout is redirected to the log file and stderr is still sent to the console

our ecommerce web app only accepts jpg png and gif files as the images for products but we wanted every image to be dynamically created for every product

4709787
gif	png
so we remapped jpg png and gif files to become a handler

4709787
gif	png
however we didn t want all jpg png and gif files to be mapped since it would be hugely inefficient for static files so we only did certain ones

it works fine in firefox google-chrome safari

4714167

but if you just want to use your builder api as a fluent interface to generate the objects while leaving their getter and setter intact then there s of course no harm in that other than that it s a duplication of code

4714233
persistent	transient
managedbean could have simple fields like string integer etc or view models to encapsulate some related fields or even the entity models which should be a transient object in the beginning and becoming a detached object once having get in and persistent and get out of a transaction

4714233
int	boolean
output the return value could vary from void entity a list of entities to be displayed later in a datatable in jsf and could be plain variables like boolean string int etc

4714437
requestfactory	gwt-rpc

4714925
client-side	server-side
that said if you are doing a basic comparison of php a server-side language to jquery a client-side language the server-side one should be faster

4715551
for-loop	loops
i have a for-loop within loops there is while loops the problem is when the while loops executed the next for-loop never executed

4715557
int	chars
a bool is not an object it s a primitive like an int or chars

4715568
subtraction	addition
also note that all addition and subtraction logic works regardless of signs

4715571
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
nullpointerexception and runtimeexception s in general are mostly thrown when there s a coding error that s why catching them isn t considered to be a good idea

4715588
post	get
what you want to do is query for post based on date range define said range for spring summer fall winter code below should get you started

4715663
getter	setter
this is especially useful for setter getter since debugging into those usually just adds noise example from msdn

4715724
google-chrome	firefox
it works in my version of google-chrome but firefox html-escapes the title and i end up with

4715734
hide	show
of course you can simply right-click the call stack window and toggle show external code to hide show the missing stack information

4715748
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in google-chrome safari and ie but not in firefox

4715861
hide	show
depending on user-input i show hide using jquery s show hide functions bits of the gui

4715869
tunnel	vpn
the easiest solution to solve both issues is to open up a vpn tunnel with encryption and compression enabled

4715905
udp	tcp
if you re using acks and resends you should think hard about using tcp as building reliability and scalability on top of udp is fraught with peril 3x resends don t actually give you reliability either

4715910
ant	maven
you seem to be executing an ant build from your maven build

4715931
mp4	h.264
however we want to be able to move away from silverlight in the future and to the video tag in html5 so we need to encode our videos to h.264 in an mp4 container

4715976
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
so it depends on the scenario but in general terms a nullpointerexception and most runtimeexception indicate something that could be fixed with code that are a programmer mistake and you can always do something about it

4715999
put	get
edit to give an example of why i am confused i change this example around to put the dragged listbox item text into a textbox when the dragover event was fired and it worked fine but when i tried to do the same thing when they dropped the values over the textbox i could not get it to work

4716002
min	max
when the max number is very close to the min number it means that there s not much whitespace and not many comments in the code

4716040
inherited	subclassing
does subclassing inherited private

4716040
inherited	subclassing
subclassing does not inherited the private

4716042
range	max
figure out the max range say it s 10000

4716050
websphere	ibm
with maven with ibm websphere and tomcat

4716053
ant	maven
once you ve done that you can remove all the jars from your source repository since ant with ivy will download the required ones from the internet based maven repository system

4716062
width	height
but if you don t want the layout manager messing up with the size of the components i would suggest you use either the setmaximumsize int width int height or set the layout to null and use setbounds int x int y int width int height method to size your component

4716067
post	get
i think you should either do what daniel recommends or if you must do it this way post your model get the validation back show your fine print and then post the form again to a different action to save

4716075
swt	swing
if you have swing or swt experience you would be easily familiar with gwt

4716076
inherited	subclassing
even though the value is there it is not inherited by the subclassing

4716076
inherited	subclassing
the attribute count is hidden and not inherited by the subclassing at all

4716111
boost	stl
if you don t want to use c++0x you could use boost instead but that s not in the stl

4716113
entity-relationship	diagram
the example shows a reasonable entity-relationship diagram but generally speaking in a one-to-many relation one doesn t need an auxiliary table

4716115
google-chrome	firefox
i guess technically i could get the blur and focus of the window object but if there was something more closely tied to the browser ie firefox google-chrome etc. that would be even better

4716120
hide	show
i have a table with some css to hide show columns

4716120
google-chrome	firefox
this works great in firefox google-chrome and ie8

4716127
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
now when you come to functional programming the private field of superclass is not inherited in a meaningful way for the subclassing

4716127
superclass	subclassing
for the subclassing a private field of superclass is same as a private field of any other class

4716127
inherited	subclassing
a subclassing does not inherited the private members of its parent class

4716127
superclass	subclassing	public	protected
however if the superclass has public or protected methods for accessing its private fields these can also be used by the subclassing

4716140
inherited	subclassing
since the subclassing can t access or modify the private fields then in other words they are not inherited

4716140
inherited	subclassing
so the subclassing does not inherited private fields but an object that is an instance of the subclassing certainly does contain the private fields

4716198
uiview	subviews
however when i try and add someview a custom uiview which has uibuttons on it as a subviews of window the buttons don t receive any of the touches

4716250
put	get
if i put the pattern between # i get the empty string result

4716271
inherited	properties
there is no such thing as extension properties and you can t inherited the class and use the same class name unless you use a different namespace which is probably not what you re after

4716273
superclass	subclassing
early initializers are part of the constructor of a subclassing that is intended to run before its superclass

4716284
width	height
i ve set background-image on a couple of span elements but they aren t showing up i think because my height and width settings are being ignored

4716306
google-chrome	firefox
and adding an new var for scrollleft this way the code behave the same on google-chrome firefox and internet explorer

4716314
int	boolean
json only serializes simple data types such as int float numbers boolean strings lists tuples and dictionaries

4716335
superclass	subclassing
obviously as digitalross explains an object of a subclassing must contain its superclass s private fields

4716335
inherited	subclassing
or public are inherited by subclassing

4716335
superclass	subclassing
objects of subclassing contain private fields of their superclass

4716335
superclass	subclassing
the subclassing itself has no notion of private fields of its superclass

4716366
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome tested

4716369
sorting	grouping
it is sorting the results of the grouping instead of grouping the results of the ordering

4716409
for-loop	arrays
you can use a for-loop to iterate through the items in the arrays checking the value each time

4716420
doc	rtf
we are using textcontrol it supports rtf pdf doc docx an it s very easy to integrate

4716514
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie or safari

4716518
tabs	tabpanel
the problem is that the tabpanel which is used internally by the tabcontrol to lay out the tabs does not seem to support what you want

4716518
tabs	tabpanel
the simple dockpanel doesn t work as smooth as the tabpanel -- the tabs jump a bit when switching between them but this might get you started

4716566
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in all other browsers firefox opera safari google-chrome the gradient and the background-image is displayed

4716607
inherited	properties
tip define the graph label end of your dot file otherwise subgraphs will inherited those properties

4716623
stringbuilder	bufferedreader
my favorite way to read a small file is to use a bufferedreader and a stringbuilder

4716639
hide	show
then you can use something to show hide the full body of the news in a div in example

4716644
oncreate	findviewbyid
you could simply call findviewbyid in your onresume method to get a reference to it in that method or you could change ib to an instance variable so that it is accessible in methods other than oncreate

4716663
pop-up	dialog
when a user clicks on the browse button which is part of the control the control displays a file select pop-up dialog box

4716670
int	chars
there s another subtle problem there though you re casting an int to a chars value

4716670
int	chars
the max size of an int is much larger than a chars so your cast may truncate the value

4716677
google-chrome	firefox
i ve had it fail in ie 7 8 firefox 3.6.3 and google-chrome

4716677
google-chrome	firefox
i ve also had it succeed in ie6 7 8 firefox 3.6.3 3.4.2 3.1 and google-chrome

4716717
aggregate-functions	sum
group the results into subsets based on the group by clause collapsing the results to a single row for each such subset and computing the values of any aggregate-functions -- sum max avg etc

4716731
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome the page loads and then a couple seconds later the div for the results loads as well

4716810
macvim	textmate
i m switching from textmate to macvim

4716873
put	get	post	get	post	put
decorate your actions with get post put and delete attributes

4716884
inherited	properties
i thought that i can use my own class inherited from typeconverter and catch the moment of converting value somecontext to color the backcolor properties

4716895
google-chrome	safari
you should be able to use a webkit browser safari or google-chrome resized to the approximate dimensions of the iphone to test the layout of your application

4716907
persistent	transient	instances	transient
transient instances persistent

4716926
width	height
i think your span s need to have display inline-block an ordinary span will always have its natural width and height

4716936
width	height
solved it - you can t set height and width on span because it is an inline element

4717028
put	get	post	get	post	put
someone sends a rest request get put post delete in the form of var1 var2 var3.var4

4717052
int	boolean
on every other test i have done int 1 is converted to boolean true and 0 to false

4717090
int	double
depending on the type of your variable one of abs int labs long llabs long long imaxabs intmax_t fabsf float fabs double or fabsl long double

4717090
floating-point	integer
if you re using c++ or objective-c++ you can bring in the header and use std abs which is templated for all the standard integer and floating-point types

4717105
put	get
the client size changes when you set the formborderstyle but it does not seem to get put into the clientrectangle property right away

4717117
width	height
however if i switch to then it seems i get bigger problems because you can t set a height and width on a span reliably

4717118
children	parent
the storable files are then read in by the parent and the total data from each of the children are analyzed before proceeding onto a repeat of the previous fork or else the parent stops

4717118
children	parent
but the children or perhaps the parent program carry on

4717118
children	parent
after some more debugging based on the behavior of my program it appears that indeed sigint is being passed from the parent to all children and from all children to all of their children the external program

4717118
children	parent
although i had my children check the exit status of what was called in system i was assuming that a ctrl-c would kill everything from the parent down rather than lead to the creation of more rounds of processing which is what was happening

4717118
children	parent
the signal handler would then send sigterm to each of the children which i presume would also send a sigterm to the children s children and then cause the parent to exit gracefully

4717123
for-loop	loops
you are defining a for-loop which iterates over 450 values but you are returning in the first iteration of loops which leaves the function body and therefore stops the execution of the for-loop

4717135
google-chrome	safari
unnoticable difference on google-chrome and safari

4717174
children	parent
if you kill the parent process the children and external programs running will still run until they terminate one way or another

4717174
children	parent
that way once the parent gets the sigint it will kill all of it s children

4717174
children	parent
based on your update it seems that the parent indeed kills it s children and then instead of terminating itself it goes back to doing something else think of it as a reset instead of a complete shutdown start combination

4717189
width	height
if you give generally give a span the property display block it ll then behave like a div i.e you can set width and height

4717196
jboss	glassfish
you have to go with a javaee 6 server jboss 6 glassfish 3 etc

4717235
int	boolean
it looks like you are trying to return a boolean and a number int uint value at the same time

4717276
solaris	bsd
most of the bsd solaris os x family support dtrace

4717327
macvim	textmate
i moved from textmate to macvim

4717350

jobs	cron
then run a cron job that kills pending jobs that have been running for a certain amount of time or try to reprocess them

4717400
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it s working fine in webkit google-chrome safari but the -moz-background-size property is not working at all in firefox

4717408
children	parent
by default when you fork a child it will be in the same process group as the parent so by default the parent top level program invoked from the command line all its children children s children etc as well as any external programs invoked by any of these which are all just children will all be in that same process group so will all receive the sigint signal

4717427
post	get
see scottgu s post post to get you started

4717446
erd	diagram
basically i did the implementation first and then from that i used tools to reverse engineer class diagram erd etc.

4717467
ssl	https
i think that the https ssl handshake would have to be reestablished since the initial connection was made by browser

4717485
width	height
namely left top width and height

4717486
subtract	add
what it does is if its precisely on the edge subtract 1 so it doesn t add that tile

4717681
folder	directory
save the file under the folder underneath fms s applications directory

4717708
width	height
it has display inline property which makes the element ignore your width height values even if they are marked

4717734
put	get
the issue is of course that if you put the release after the return statement you get a potential leak of an object error associated with dateformatter var declaration

4717781
opera	firefox
update i m using opera firefox for testing now and the problem hasn t come up since

4717846
ant	maven
ant can be run from maven but the challenge here is seamless integration feeding all the classpath and sourcepath elements from maven to ant automatically which is why i did not use maven s facilities for this purpose

4717856
put	get
i put my alert box in the didfinishlaunchingwithoptions method it executes when a flag becomes true so i no longer get the error as all the elements are displayed by that point

4717878
width	height
note that this also requires explicitly setting the width and height of the anchor in your css to match your icon size

4717883
google-chrome	firefox
my new code is working in firefox and google-chrome

4717891
gesturedetector	motionevent
since you re using a gesturedetector the thing to do is implement simplegesturedetector.onlongpress motionevent e for handling long clicks

awt	swing
java strings are unicode but not all java components support full unicode strings especially awt components and lightweight swing components

4717930
bufferedreader	stringtokenizer
as your data is relatively simple bufferedreader and stringtokenizer should do the trick

4717985
versioning	upgrade
if this versioning is equals to the resource versioning from core_resources table upgrade script will not execute

4717985
versioning	upgrade
and the versioning should match the name of your upgrade script

4718004
int	boolean
given two events with int start and end times e1 s1 e1 e2 s2 e2 implement a quick boolean check to see if the events overlap

4718060
mousemove	mouseleave
i have considered using mousemove to capture the x and y position of the mouse but it would appear that once the mouseleave the iframe i m out of luck

4718086
installation	upgrade
another way to fix would be to upgrade the django installation

4718102
opera	firefox
so far it tested ok in firefox opera and ie 8

4718157
post	get
you ll need to know the form type post or get and what the parameter names are then you can fill them out feeding in data from the command line a file or a constant to your script

4718159
exif	jfif
prior to hardware decompression the software front-end must parse the jfif and or exif data to obtain the image dimensions and thumbnail

you could put breakpoints inside your not notdynamicclass methods and see how they get invoked

4718410
merb	ruby-on-rails
the url router is also very nice and borrows a lot of concepts from merb and ruby-on-rails

4718411
cvs	svn
here are some experience reports on using it in converting old svn and cvs repositories

4718412
int	boolean
in vb the int 1 is int 1 not boolean true

4718435
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i have a website which works well with any zoom on firefox google-chrome opera safari.

4718437
versioning	upgrade
we had some luck with indy sockets before but since mono upgrade to the .net 3.5 framework we ve had no luck finding or building a versioning of indy that works in that environment

4718475
post	get
you should use an external program like wget or curl which both can send either get or post requests

4718479
submit	submission
the ajax form submit binding is put on document.ready of the loaded content ergo the ajax form submission binding may be binding prior to and thus firing before the validation calls that the parse method may bind to the submit event.

get max and min available position using

4718796
subobject	instances
this is multiple inheritance - base class subobject are at different offsets withing the child instances thus different addresses

4718806
accessor	properties
because it conflicts with the -description method in nsobject recall that core data dynamically generates properties accessor and mutators â a properties named â descriptionâ would require creating an accessor method called -description

4718806
nsobject	nsmanagedobject
note that a property name cannot be the same as any no-parameter method name of nsobject or nsmanagedobject

4718850
put	get
you should also be aware that if your sites contains link to other external sites you dont control using get will put that data in the refeerer header on the external sites when they press the links on your site

4718876
post	put
there are three different types of post but similar enough that i could put them under one table

4718929
multiplying	addition
only using addition but cheating with multiplying by a negative.

4718931

typedef	typename
i am trying to understand what traits are for example expressions like typedef typename traits_type off_type off_type in the gnu implementation of fstream

4719409
width	height
i ve tried using the resize method with the contentssize argument this will resize the widget s height to fit the text contents however the width stays the same

4719411
division	multiplication
but still i m having a lot of troubles my guess it has something to do with multiplication division this time

4719425
glfw	sdl
there are alternative libraries for input handling which i would think the sdl has and possibly glfw but it may be a stretch to go adding those to a project for mouse handling

4719492
children	parent
if you are using perlâ s version of system or pipe open or backticks then the parent â the one calling system rather than the one called by it â will ignore any sigint and sigquit while the children are running

4719506
vbo	vao
a good starting tutorial that has been more straight-forward regarding a quick and simple vao vbo and render is located at swiftless.com

4719537

4724662
hide	show
but since a number of events are common to all of my statemachines init show hide finish and a few more i want to be able to either reference an event the way i used to or enter one of the above event names without having to declare the event in every file

4724667
textview	imageview
you can write a generic view in xml file that contains the imageview and the textview later in your loop method you can inflate the view with imageview and textview as childs and setting their contents

4724667
textview	imageview
then you can do something like this inflate the generic view from the xml file and set the textview and imageview context.

4724673
width	height
the behaviour of a listbox when its width or height is set to auto is to not produce any scrollbars as it will attempt to endlessly grow within its container

other newer browsers like firefox opera ie7+ google-chrome and safari will try to display the image using the alpha-channel

4724782
oncreate	onnewintent
the closest you will be able to come is to use a distinctive intent in the getactivity pendingintent a custom action string use setflags intent.flag_activity_clear_top|intent.flag_activity_single_top on the intent to try to bring an existing instance of your activity forward then check for your special intent in both oncreate and onnewintent of your activity and do whatever special thing you want done

any relational database you could access with jdbc mysql postgresql oracle sqlserver db2 informix interbase firebird ingress you name it

4724870
min	max
it s easy to define a procedure like that using the built-in scheme procedures square max and min but we haven t encountered these procedures at that point in the book yet so i d define them as well

4724870
minimum	max
the sum-of-highest-squares procedure works by adding the square of the maximum of x and y the max of those two is eliminated from being the lowest of the three and the square of the maximum of the remaining two the minimum of x and y which will be whichever value was left over from the first step and z

4724879
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome firefox etc

4724882
queue	fifo
you could implement a fifo queue in a database by attaching sequence numbers to each record and reading them in order

4724882
postgresql	mysql
pick one of the free ones like mysql or postgresql play with it and learn what they do

4724889
ilist	icollection
have a look at the members on offer to you by a class like list and you ll see what i mean in addition to not having to worry as much about array capacity and index out of bounds exceptions list and other icollection ilist classes give you methods like add remove clear insert find etc that are infinitely helpful

4724919
opera	firefox
none opera 9.26 + firefox 3.6 + ie9

it seems to work fine in firefox 3.6 but the div isn t showing up in google-chrome 10 and ie8

4724927
typedef	typename
if you want to declare a typedef with a dependent type then you do need to use the typename keyword

4724927
typedef	typename
btw typename is required even without the typedef

4724948
for-loop	arrays
if you have an arrays with numeric indexes use a for-loop instead of a foreach

4724991
width	height
my experience on mobile browsers is that setting both height and width will cause problems when the phone is rotated

4724998
google-chrome	safari
now this works in google-chrome maybe safari and you say now that it works in ie8 as far as getting the file chooser up

4725032
disk	ram
similarly if some memory page wasn t used for a long time the os may swap off the page from physical ram to disk

4725035
ubuntu	debian
php and mysql versions are identical with ubuntu 10.10 on my side and debian squeeze server-side

4725051

opera	firefox
which works on firefox and opera

4725068
google-chrome	safari
fails on google-chrome ie8 and safari

4725100
post	get
note that your browser doesn t give direct access to this list of access points to the client ie javascript or the dom so you can t post it to php to get the location using this method via the server

4725102
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

stdout	stderr
i need to launch a 3rd party program inside a thread wait to get the results both from stdout stderr with c++

4725146
for-loop	loops
secondly you d be as well using a for-loop rather than a for each loops here which will take away your manual count variable

4725179
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
previously this has been possible with the use of inotifypropertychanged inotifycollectionchanged and an open source library called clinq

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
you can see this using firefox s firebug extension or the developer tools feature in ie8 google-chrome or safari

4725291
bash	zsh
bash zsh scripting is designed to rot one s brane imho and i m rather hoping someone will have tackled this already

4725331
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in all the other browsers we ve tested on google-chrome firefox ie7

4725334
jboss	geronimo	jboss	glassfish	glassfish	geronimo

matlab	simulink
matlab simulink central blog a lot of examples and useful information regularly updated

4725465
maven	pom.xml
if you use maven make sure to use bundledir in your pom.xml so that the libs are place in the right place

4725490
client-side	server-side
jaxer also makes client server communication really convenient with its runat server-proxy where you can directly call server-side function from within your client-side script and jaxer takes care of all the xml http request stuff

4725500
nsoperation	nsinvocationoperation
i think itâ s safe to assume that nsinvocationoperation and probally all nsoperation subclasses in appleâ s frameworks create their own autorelease pools just like the concurrency programming guide suggests for custom nsoperation subclasses

4725517
int	chars
it means that in this case boxing unboxing occurs only when object is of type int byte chars etc

4725568
google-chrome	firefox
ie is often a bit more picky about javascript errors than firefox or google-chrome and at the same time it is less helpful with its error reporting

4725597
min	max
rember you cant apply max or min on custom priority coz it could appear in any form

4725627
sudo	passwd
when you run sudo it will ask for your os x passwd

4725634
keydown	keyup
one obvious way seemed to be to invoke the respective keydown keyup and keypress methods of the edit control like so

4725660
distance	polygons
how do i decide the distance of a polygons

4725665
spaces	linefeed
you might try putting the arguments in the same line rather than using the as a linefeed escape character and perhaps remove the quotes around the paths since no spaces exist in the paths

4725669
mouse	keyboard
these qwidget will not be rendered locally because there is no display but i need to access painting operations to create screenshot of them for example and i need to intercept mouse and keyboard operations

4725669
mouse	keyboard
so the image mouse and keyboard are meant to be redirected over the network

4725669
mouse	keyboard
what is the preferred method to intercept painting mouse and keyboard operations in that case

4725703
postgresql	mysql
in real life i do not run the ansi sql standard on my database server i run postgresql or oracle or mysql or some other actual product

4725727
sudo	passwd
it will ask you for your passwd to access remote shell and then your passwd again for sudo access

4725746
implements	extends
i decided to extends uiwebview and make it its own delegate where my extension implements the delegate methods

4725757
min	max
remember that sometimes you may need adjust some settings like service throttling max min buffer size maxitemsinobjectgraph quota etc

4725780
google-chrome	firefox
this all works fine in firefox google-chrome and ie with google-chrome frame

4725794
onresume	onpause	hide	show	oncreate	ondestroy
i think you want to look at the status bar notifications article then hide show your application appropriately on oncreate onpause onresume ondestroy i m not sure of what your rules are

4725795
post	get
you have no greater security provided because the variables are sent over http post than you have with variables sent over http get

4725795
post	get
many browsers do not support http methods other than post get

4725795
post	get
browsers tend to store history it s recommended by rfc2616 9.1.1 to not use get to perform an action but to think that post provides security is flatly wrong

4725815
post	get
when i get a call back that the post was successfully added i would like to open the facebook app if application is installed on the device on the users wall to show them their post is there

4725868
accurev	svn
quick mapping of svn to accurev concepts

4725870
textmate	aptana
in studio 3 much of this sort of functionality is still coming as aptana is going more of a textmate bundle route for a great deal of their features which i think is really cool

4725888
children	parent
i need to duplicate an object and all of its children what i m doing now is retrieve the object make a deep clone and put all ids to 0 parent and children and save it back to the db but the original object gets modified in the db

4725888
children	parent
i m serializing the object and i save it in a file then i deserialize the object and put ids to 0 then i make some operations for some values of the parent and children to change the original values i save everything fine but the problem is when i flush the session

4725919
width	height
another solution is saving the actual value of width and height in some vars and restoring on mouse out

4725936
google-chrome	firefox
after a while i understood that it was not possible to define a function with the name evaluate in the firefox and google-chrome

4725969
cvs	svn
- svn is a descendant of cvs and keep most of its structures and fault

4725969
pull	push
you push and pull to the remote server allowing you to do a local versioning without disturbing the central repository then allowing you to branch as much as you like

4726020
getter	setter
it seems django doesn t have any kind of getter setter functionality inside of models i d like to be able to use entry.status and not something like entry.full_status because it becomes awfully confusing having lots of differently named properties

4726027
put	get
note that if i put a breakpoint on the service s method it doesn t even get that far

4726067
google-chrome	firefox
i have some troubles with confirm dialog not working with firefox but working with google-chrome

4726067
google-chrome	firefox
it turn out that google-chrome can find element in document even without document.getelementbyid firefox can t won t

4726110
google-chrome	firefox
when i try your code it works successfully in both firefox and google-chrome if somelink is defined and fails to work as you describe in both if it is not defined

4726117
chgrp	chmod
to fix this you want to issue the command chgrp -r www-data log followed by chmod -r g+x log

4726154
distance	polygons
painter s algorithm is the simplest to implement but it works only in very simple cases because it assumes that there is only a single distance or z-value for each polygons which you could approximate to be the average of z-values of all points in the polygons

4726154
distance	polygons
in reality there isn t a single distance value for a polygons -- each point on the surface of a polygons can be at a different distance from the viewer so each point has its own distance or depth

4726171
free	malloc
if the map contains pointers that were allocated with new or new or malloc then each pointer needs a corresponding delete or delete or free

4726215
perforce	svn
the tortoise- svn git merge tools or that of perforce are way better here

4726221
inherited	properties
dependencyproperty is overkill if you don t need any of its other features value inherited binding from the properties etc. it is best used for control properties not model properties

4726237
getter	setter
getter setter are members and therefore accessed via an instance

4726252
punctuation	words
a lexical analyzer is still required you must have something that will break the text into individual tokens words numbers punctuation etc.

4726296
nsoperationqueue	nsblockoperation
give the block to an nsblockoperation and hand that off to an nsoperationqueue

4726327
width	height
i m trying to set the dialog to be 180px less than the height and width of the screen.

4726333
mouse	keyboard
i do suspect you re not on the right track though if you have a console-mode service that needs a keyboard mouse and a graphical ui

4726349
put	get
note that you don t need a hook to be notified when a menu window is shown you can put a handler for the wm_enteridle message test for wparam to see if a menu caused the message get the menu window from lparam and again send a mn_gethmenu to find out the specific menu

4726357
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
works with the current version of google-chrome safari opera and the upcoming firefox 4

4726407
button	checkbox
after the user checks a set of treeitems a separate button will be clicked that will need to send the deltas in the form of mvvmtreeitem json object array only changes that happened on the client to the checkbox statuses to server

4726485
x86	64bit
you d create say an x86 and an x64 sub-directory in the directory that contains your exe and put respectively the 32-bit and the 64bit builds of the dlls in those sub-directories

4726498
g++	gcc
it appears that gcc and g++ has similar functionality

4726540
super	self

4726550
folder	directory
just change the leading output directory folder from win32 to x64 with x64 as your target platform

4726551
inherited	properties
according to the msdn reference on menustrip its layoutstyle properties is inherited from toolstrip

4726613
int	chars
the code will fail and cause undefined behavior every time when the int value of the given chars c is not between 0 and 127 inclusive

4726648
rss	feed
a number of rss feed have extended past generic rss by including namespaces

4726648
rss	feed
take a look at techcrunch s feedburner feed rss node

4726649
listview	gridview
please consider using something else like a listview or gridview instead of a spinner

4726686
google-chrome	firefox
i just checked the script in ie8 google-chrome and firefox and in all of the three broweser i get the code like this

4726749
inject	interceptor
i m using castle core to create a custom attribute and interceptor to inject security checks into our code using attributes

4726795
getter	setter
probably better idea is avoid to using it at my experience deallocate class start leaks for getter and setter which was using before

4726821
post	get
the form should set post do the get in the url

4726846
put	get
this is basically the same thing as when you put a mutable type in a dictionary and you get what you deserve

4726890
phpword	phpexcel
yes trying to determine the mimetype is your best bet short of just try catching to load the files with phpword phpexcel and phpowerpoint directly to see if they throw an exception mark baker correct me please if they dont throw exceptions

4726921
superclass	subclassing
you can access the superclass methods from within the subclassing itself

4726923
google-chrome	firefox
it works great on firefox and google-chrome however i have an issue with ie

4726923
google-chrome	firefox
what i found during debugging is that in google-chrome and firefox all the dropdownlist populate the request.form request.form voltage actually displays what the user has picked on the dropdownlist however in ie this request.form doesn t get populated at all it s just an empty string.

4726973
versioning	upgrade
i ve found out after i upgrade maven to versioning 3

4726997
children	parent
if you have code in your parent class that is shared across multiple subclasses perhaps that code could be moved to a non-overridden method so that it is readily accessible by all children granchildren etc

4727007
getdate	dateadd
dateadd day -7 getdate can be optimised because it s constant

4727083
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox ie8 and safari 5 when i apply this property to a div that is used for containing ad banners like adsense leader boards or flash at the top of my content there is still some overlap happening in google-chrome when the window is resized to be small enough that they collide

4727115
google-chrome	safari
it looks perfect and exactly how i want in ffox google-chrome safari etc...but upon inspection in ie 6 7 8 is is not right

4727119
width	height	for-loop	loops
my idea so far is to loops through every pixel within the image for-loop based on img width height from this compare each pixel against a list of colours from this an algorithm is checked to see if the colors keep differentiating between the license plate white and the black of the text

4727129
flexunit	asmock
asmock dynamic mocking framework for as3 with integration support for flexunit 1 4.0 4.1 asunit and fluint

4727148
width	height
the problem is that this window must have size 80 width and 100 height of the screen of the user that is it should cover all the vertical space

4727280
allocator	stl
as with most stl containers it uses an external allocator to actually allocate the memory

4727284
super	abstract
so i d like to define an abstract super class where i can define this common code and behaviour

4727354
getter	setter
you should use setter and getter that s what they are for

4727354
getter	setter
attributes mark parts of your code such that reflection can be used on this code - it is a rather heavy weight approach just because you don t like the look of property setter and getter

4727361
post	get
and user had to accept it to get it post on their wall

4727370
uinavigationbar	uinavigationitem
you may want to set the prompt ivar of the uinavigationitem object of your uinavigationbar

4727421
cos	sin
it s perfectly common to have parts of a project be generated perhaps a perl script creating a fast sin cos lookup table expressed as an initialized c array for an embedded system

4727421
getter	setter
also various mechanisms to save the trouble of implementing a zillion getter and setter

4727424
outputstream	inputstream
i ask the same question for inputstream outputstream java.sql.connection java.sql.preparedstatement etc

4727430
passenger	webrick
phusion passenger is the de facto apache mod and yes it s better than webrick which is really only good for tiny sites or testing

4727442
csla	.net
my company generates the entire dal and bo layer without out custom functions from a data model using the csla .net templates and codesmith

4727532
hide	show
to hide the inner ul you can use the display none as initial state and show it using

4727597
setinterval	settimeout
javascript timers with settimeout and setinterval

4727637
jar	manifest.mf
as i ve suddenly discovered jar specification says that being included meta-inf and manifest.mf must be first and second entries of package and not just directory and file within archive

4727643
crypt	hash
it s also good practice to store the hash cost number of times the hash has been stretched even crypt does that

4727643
hash	salt
possibly the worst issue is that you first have to query the database to know the salt cost algorithm and then check against your generated hash this requires an extra trip to the db

4727677
swt	swing
you can use it with swing swt and once you learn it is a pretty powerful layout manager imho

4727704
viewdidappear	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear
also to learn about this lifecycle set a breakpoint or nslog statement in each of these methods viewdidload viewwillappear viewdidappear to see when they are called

4727715
post	get
since you are using sql server 2008 you could take advantage of sql server reporting services ssrs and create a report that can be called via web service or http get post by coldfusion

4727775
rss	feed
you sign up supply your rss feed s address then copy-paste the resulting code where-ever in your template you like

4727808
button	checkbox
i want to grab all checkbox values which are checked on asp.net button click event in c#

4727823
ubuntu	linux
i am on ubuntu so i have linux utilities

4727825
ienumerable	iqueryable
when i change the ienumerable to an iqueryable the databind fails because the data has already been disposed of

4727889
post	get
post better because codeigniter was written to favor post requests over get requests

4727907
postgresql	mysql
i m primarily a postgresql user and i frequently hear about mysql getting bad press much like php

4727941
postgresql	mysql
similarly when students would group by column_a and then select column_b where column_b had multiple values within each group instead of raising an error as oracle postgresql or sql server would mysql happily picks a column_b value at random and includes it

4728059
width	height
usually you have to call measure on the control so that it may size itself accordingly infinity lets the control expand to its width and height

4728076
google-chrome	firefox
i don t have to support ie6 but i do have to support ie7 firefox and google-chrome

4728140
google-chrome	firefox
they run fine in debug mode ie firefox google-chrome with all the swf s and swc s appearing in the bin-debug folder

4728145
versioning	upgrade
this also benefits from the fact that your versioning code must increase for the app to be seen as an upgrade by the market so you don t need to remember to change a separate value to detect the first-run

4728149
rss	feed
the service takes your batch of 10 000 links imported from sitemap backlink builders etc and chops them into rss feed of x per feed for aggregation

4728184
put	get
what this means is that if you get some libraries via nuget and put your project in source control another developer is then able to use your project without needing nuget at all

4728196
rss	feed
the ideal would be for everyone to have an rss feed for their products

4728236
filtering	grouping
i was able to filtering contacts by grouping by using the following query

4728236
simplecursoradapter	spinner
obviously you need to know the group id in order to complete this how i did this was used a simplecursoradapter to a spinner w the following cursor

4728237
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
now you can simply place those keys in a sorteddictionary or sortedlist and it will automatically sort the way you want

4728237
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
implement an icomparer object that compares those strings the way you want and specify the icomparer when constructing a sorteddictionary or sortedlist

4728266
allocator	stl
the stl containers also take an allocator as a defaulted parameter

4728266
stateless	stateful
edit - in some fora i found that the allocators though initially intended stateless can be stateful on most modern compilers

4728298
trac	mantis	trac	bugzilla	mantis	bugzilla
according to google searches see the comments the most popular open source issue trackers are trac bugzilla mantis rt and possibly launchpad s

4728309
mongoid	mongomapper
i would look at mongoid and mongomapper and see if this type of detail isn t appropriate for a plug-in

4728350
google-chrome	firefox
comet jetty tomcat having some browser issues with firefox and google-chrome

4728350
google-chrome	firefox
basically - .responsetext.length for firefox and iphone .responsebody.length for ie websockets for google-chrome

4728359
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
you can t logically add subtract multiplying or divide gold silver and bronze

4728359
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
you can t add subtract multiplying or divide them

then it depends on your server platform on any linux flavor ubuntu debian mac os you could use apache nginx in front of passenger mongrel thin unicorn .

4728547

jar	manifest.mf
note that there is no actual requirement in the jar specification for meta-inf manifest.mf to appear first

4729216
int	double
everything in the .net world is an object so an int is an object a double is an object etc

also note that object guarantees certain members that all types have as a consequence of this gettype tostring and gethashcode

4729224

what would be an efficient portable way to convert a unsigned short to a char convert 25 to 25

4729237
getter	setter
i figured it out i was using a regex d 1 10 but it was still not working i had the data type in the setter and getter as an int which wasn t working so i set it as string and then parsed cast it as an int when i needed to use it that way which worked

4729343

4729790
width	height
when you initialise the vector you have width and height the wrong way around

4729790
width	height
your fillmatrix function has width and height in a different order to that in which you call it later in showmatrix

4729790
width	height
you could also just get the width and height from the vector within showmatrix instead of having these as arguments

4729791
width	height
but all that does is increase the width not the height

you can see in the maven console within eclipse where m2e tells you it s skipping the update of a recently published snapshot because it s got a cached version

4730129
maven	m2e
but an update snapshots... selection should tell m2e to have maven expire this cache

4730129
maven	m2e
others have reported problems with maven 2.2.1 and 3 backing m2e and i ve seen the same

4730158
int	double
in java for primitive types int double etc. you cannot write .tostring because the types aren t objects

4730211
tostring	gethashcode
i will point out that while in java perhaps you had to write the unwieldy integer.tostring x for variables x of primitive types like int in c# and in .net in general all types including so-called primitive ones inherit from object and so have the method tostring along with gettype and gethashcode available to them

4730267
xslt	xquery
one strategy i use when i need to generate graphs from data in a db is to extract the data in some kind of xml way oracle sqlx or cocoon xsp esql or exist-db xquery and process it through an xslt to generate svg

4730287
dictionary	map
i don t think there s a way to map your indexer directly but you can expose the underlying dictionary type and map that instead

4730540
qdialog	qwidget	qmainwindow	qdialog	qmainwindow	qwidget
my problem was a little different in that i had a top-level qwidget instead of a qdialog or a qmainwindow that had children within a layout

4730540
qlayout	qwidget
this is normally set to qlayout setdefaultconstraint which simply affects the minimumsize of the qwidget that owns it

4730540
qlayout	qwidget
instead i chose qlayout setfixedsize which made the layout adjust the fixed size of the owning qwidget effectively making it smaller when it needed to be

4730646
post	get
flashvars are passed as a collection of name value pairs with the same format as get or post url-encoded parameters

4730676
margin	height
happens that because i have set the margins of the #childdiv to a negative value in order to center it when i change it to relative that negative margin is taken into account when calculating the height of #container resulting in a smaller #container

4730682
width	height
the targeted id takes on the parent s width and height and yet has overflow hidden so it cannot be resized beyond the parent s dimentsions

for example safari or google-chrome show it very different from firefox or ie

4730757

4731710
super	abstract
making an abstract super entity will make this a lot easier

4731710
super	abstract
to do it you get all the names of objects in the abstract super entity and test them against the value to be validated

4731710
super	abstract
edit if you use the abstract super entity then you should get the max id of the objects in the abstract super entity if you want them to be unique

4731711
draggable	droppable
one problem i had was having a draggable element that too wide to be dropped on to a droppable element if the tolerance option is at the default value of intersect

4731864
uilabel	uitextview
i have tried various methods of recalculating the height of my uitextview based on the content that is loaded in them at runtime and though very laborious and inane i have gotten that to work but they then bleed over the uilabel positioned in the xib below them

4732128
children	parent
i have semi-solutions that work situational for the former question children visible in overflow hidden parent

4732128
children	parent
if the parent div does not need to be position relative simply set the children styles to visibility visible

4732128
children	parent
if the parent div does need to be position relative the only way possible i found to show the children was position fixed

4732153
post	get
some real world examples would be things like if you allowed a user to delete an account over get instead of post someone could post the following comment on your site assuming the site has some way to post comments or other input etc.

4732153
post	get
if it was done over post instead of get someone could craft a form and trick users into submitting it and the same result would happen

4732168
put	get
an x86 board is of no use for that because you can just put the extra x86 on the motherboard instead. you d be quite lucky to get something like that under 1000 much less near 100

4732381
hash	salt
i recommend using a salt instead of a seed for messagedigest family hash functions

4732381
hash	salt
prepending a salt is also more powerful than directly setting the seed values because in addition to changing the internal state of the hash if the salt is not a multiple of the digest block size then it can also perturb the alignment with which the input is fed into the hash function

4732447
dlsym	dlopen
even if the library is dlopen ed and dlclose d exactly once and is not a dependency of something else the act of referencing symbols from it via dlsym will also increment the reference count and make the library not unloadable

ssl	https
my api a desktop application communicates with my web app using basic http authentication over ssl basically i m just using https instead of http in the requests

4733180
uiview	subviews
i found it useful to add this sort of behavior as a category on uiview so a view can resize one of its subviews to fit some arbitrary text and optionally resize the parent view to fit the newly enlarged subviews as needed

4733197
ready	each
in order to be ready to face this scenario i decided to implement a thread synchronization inside each methods exposed by the control

4733215

landscape portrait events myself and

4733406
portrait	landscape
i can use broadcast receivers but with sticky flag on that will cause the intent to wait for me i just have to check first if i got the intent once i ll gt it once more if it s sticky meaning in landscape portrait i may get it twice on screen rotation

4733416
versioning	upgrade
as part of the process we upgrade only one of them to see how it behaves compared to the older versioning

4733423
getter	setter
with the immutable items you would still possibly have a property on the consuming object but that property would only have a getter not a setter

4733492
explode	substr
need to check substr vs explode performance

4733532
keystore	jks
the short answer is use keytool from java sdk to export the certs from your jks keystore then import them to a new bks keystore using bouncycastle security provider

4733661
getter	setter
hence i want to make getter setter atomic operation

4733671
free	malloc
yes you have to free every block you obtained from malloc

4733709
chown	chmod
there s a race of sorts between the chown command and the chmod system call

4733721
btrieve	pervasive
i am working on pervasive sql 2000i sp4 and accessing my data via the btrieve api

4733744
int	double
i would actually opt for integral mantissa exponent representation of floats double - at the earliest opportunity convert the float double to a pair of int and then transmit that

4733772
accelerometer	gyroscope
would recommend to use gyroscope along with accelerometer if you want to measure tilts

4733787
mvp	presenter
in mvp the presenter assumes the functionality of the middle-man played by the application controller in mvc

4733787
keydown	mousedown
additionally the view is responsible for handling the ui events like mousedown keydown etc which used to be the controller s job

4733814
ubuntu	linux
vga compatible controller intel corporation 82g33 g31 express integrated graphics controller rev 10 on ubuntu 10.10 linux

4733823
int	chars
then in terms in invalid input-testing i doubt that the choices really need to be infinite and will fall into several cases that you can test reasonably well with just a few alternative inputs arguments eg for an int input test passing a zero negative int masssive overflowing int chars

4733823
getter	setter
getter and setter etc should then be implicitly tested by higher-level functions

4733828
free	malloc
basically there s a rule of thumb to allocating and freeing you need to call as many free as you called malloc

4733831
ienumerable	iqueryable
my question is that i want to pass iqueryable or ienumerable through ajax.

4733966
cashapelayer	cagradientlayer

don t do integer division instead do modulo and check whether the remainder is 0

4734061
spweb	spsite	spweb	splist	splist	spsite
spsite spweb splist splistitem is what you should be using

4734184
division	modulo
use either floating point division or better modulo

google-chrome	firefox
ui automation is actually supported by internet explorer and firefox but not by google-chrome to my knowledge

4734411
put	get
i tried to put them into a resource file but it doesn t make sense as i will not need to localize them and the code generated by the resource file looks for the culture every time i get a string from the file

4734412
put	get
if you would like to have full control over resource bits you d better put it either in res asset or res raw folders and then get access to them as

4734441
put	get
or when inserting in the code that you use you could put an algorithm in that but it could get messy

4734448
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
change a copy of fileinputstream and fileoutputstream

4734479
.nettiers	codesmith
db access code is generated using codesmith .nettiers

4734502
min	max
code using these operators should be modified to use std min and std max instead.

4734505
listview	gridview	gridview	repeater
to bind with gridview or similar controls such as repeater listview you typically need to know property names of object because that s what you will use to bind column to

4734517
min	max
think about it and let me know which record the columns should come from hint max or min

4734577
ant	maven
bigger projects typically use a build tool like maven or ant

4734578
portrait	landscape
in interface builder i can only add a portrait banner to the detailview which works more or less but when i turn the ipad and click the banner it opens in portrait mode instead of landscape mode

ubuntu	linux
then i ran same program on my ubuntu linux with same jdk 1.6 as it was in windows and here also blank screens but when i closed server i got

4734858
int	double
compare this with a double to int conversion changes form significantly and unboxing copies the value from inside the box to the variable

4734865
ienumerable	ienumerator
so interesting here is distinctiterator which implements ienumerable and ienumerator

4734904
hash	md5
for example md5 the score with a random string and send the score encoded the string and the hash in the request

4734914

lock the installed versioning prevent accidentally upgrade by apt-get upgrade

4735157
jquery	curvycorners
your jquery load is placed within a document-ready block and so won t execute until the whole page has loaded including i believe the javascript so curvycorners is running before your second page div is loaded

4735222
disk	ram
redis also saves to disk snapshots of the database so 80mb in ram and 80mb on the hard drive

4735253
128bit	64bit
looking at one could use doubleword or quadword for 64bit integers yet quadword can also be used for 128bit integers and doubleword for 32bit ones

4735253
int	double
double word means 32bit int

4735253
int	double
double quad word means 128bit int

4735642
implements	extends
you have to implements like this in your class which is extends sqliteopenhelper class

4735665
innodb	myisam
myisam tables cached number of rows in this table for innodb doesn t cache row count and may be slower without where clause

4735665
innodb	myisam
it is better to use not null column for both myisam and innodb than some other column where null is allowed

4735675
slideup	slidedown
my suggestion use slidedown slideup other functions or .animate on element properties to get the closest effect without using alpha blending

iis on windows apache lighttpd nginx on linux

4735945
disk	ram

4736001
post	put
as it turns out i believe the issue was with my choice of action verb - i should have been using put instead of post

4736002
for-loop	arrays
if you have an arrays of objects i would suggest a traditional for-loop

4736064
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have setup a uitabbarcontroller with two separate uiviewcontroller

when i zoom-in on my viewport window happens in firefox google-chrome and then scroll horizontally to the right my background images are clipped

4736096
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
usually you create a uiviewcontroller then create uinavigationcontroller with that view controller and then put these navigation controllers into uitabbarcontroller

4736153
int	double
you will need to use a nsnumber to store int float double etc inside of a dictionary

4736171
width	height
the first thing coming to mind when looking at your code here is that the width height properties should really be done in css rather than in the html

4736178
width	height
vans could be limited to certain roads low bridges width height and weight restrictions

4736180
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly in google-chrome safari firefox and ie8 but in ie7 it goes wrong - the new event row seems to be placed correctly but the rows that surround it aren t correctly moved out of the way leaving a mess of overlapping text

4736291
getter	setter
more recently usage of pojos plain old java objects has become very popular since many frameworks manipulate your objects using getter and setter including spring and hibernate

4736374
ibatis	mybatis
aside of jdbc you can connect using ibatis or mybatis and hibernate

4736386
getter	setter
as a rule of thumb create a private member field for local access to your property and a getter setter for external access

4736386
getter	setter
lots of 3rd party libs such as spring rely on public methods for dependency injection inversion of control and and aspect oriented programming so using getter setter facilitates that style of programming

4736386
put	get
or you might use aop to put some caching behaviour around a somewhat expensive get operation

4736390
int	boolean
i know that this is not gonna work because rows.count is an int not an boolean and especially because i always run in trouble because _mydatatable.getchanges returns null if no changes were made

4736400
min	max
i attempting to produce a large list of fields all with a min max and accuracy

4736441
memcpy	malloc	memcpy	memcmp	memcmp	malloc

4736497
put	get	int	chars
because right now i have a structure which has some int some chars array and id number unique and when i try to find that one with specific id i can find only that one which i putted as first to vector but when i put id of for example second element i get no found but i can still get needed information

4736512
unicode	ucs
if you support users entering doublewide and extended character sets into your fields you ll need to make sure to convert your inputs from those character sets ascii unicode or ucs to utf-8

4736579
put	get	post	get	post	put
just keep in mind that if you put this in an update panel and you post back your toggleclass is going to get blown away probably assuming that the button is inside the update panel and it gets re-rendered

4736637

it basically declares public properties or the class but you should use private public and protected instead

4736650
msg	eml
i am saving emails of a pst file as eml.then i am opening the file having the eml and then saving it in a string i.e msg.in the content of msg i am getting small boxes wherever there is a space.please help me resolve this problem.i am using the following code

cassini	iis
i have tested a web application i have built using mvc 2 on local servers both cassini and iis 7.5

4736739
accessor	properties
i don t use properties accessor here for the same reasons i don t use them in init or dealloc â they may trigger side effects that would be bad in the half-initialized copy. i also use in this context because i like the way that reads

4736757
int	chars
in c chars gets promoted to int in expressions

4736764
int	chars
d prints an int it will print the ascii representation of your chars

4736764
int	chars
prints 4 because a chars literal is an int in c and not a chars

4736782
getter	setter
if your getter setter uses synchronize using will bypass that the safe-guards

4736799
cvs	svn
in the ideal case you have your code stored in a version controlled repository svn cvs etc.

4736841
apache	lighttpd
looks like lighttpd forwards the original hostname different than apache does

4736864
centos	linux
my script please scroll to the bottom to see the rendered cards works ok on 64-bit centos 5.5 linux

4736886
int	chars
this is supposed to print the ascii value of the chars as d is the escape sequence for an int

4736886
int	chars
where the null chars is interpreted as the 0 int

4736886
int	chars
finally sizeof n is 4 because in c this notation for chars stands for the corresponding ascii int

min	max
if they are not then you must decide what kind of aggregate function you will apply on them for example max or min would work and would give you some indication of which values are associated with some of the attributes for the duplicates

4737017
width	height
in many cases height or width will return the same values as those methods

4737017
children	parent
you have a handful of different height values to look at but keep in mind it is always the responsibility of the parent to size it s children

4737017
width	height
adding children to a component will not necessarily change it s height or width

4737017
width	height
if you set height or width then these values are set

4737017
width	height
there is some magic under the hood so that explicitheight and explicitwidth are masked behind height and width

4737017
width	height
i don t usually deal with scaling but if you need the unscaled height and width of a component there is an unscaledwidth and unscaledheight protected properties of the component

4737024
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
the above example is tested and works on firefox google-chrome and opera for linux and ie6 mdash

4737348
free	malloc
otherwise imagine the case where your plugin creates some memory using malloc and passes it to the host application which uses it and then calls free

4737348
free	malloc
if your plugin and the host application are using different crts the host s call to free will fail or crash because it wasn t the host s crt that malloc ed that block of memory

4737417

the solution will be the minimum of the operations in the diagonal of the dp array going from bottom-left to top-right as well as each entry just above and just below the diagonal

4738023
minimum	diagonal
this works because the entries along the diagonal represent the minimum edits required to make the first i and last n-i characters of the string equal and the entries just above and just below represent the minimum for strings ending up with odd-length where the middle left-over character doesn t match against anything

4744491
width	height
if you want to change the width and height of your text field use textfield.width and textfield.height

4744491
width	height
you can combine those with textfield.autosize as well if you set width after autosize the textfield will resize only vertically while if you set height after autosize it will resize horizontally

4744510
maven-release-plugin	pom.xml
you then just need a script that updates the version numbers of all the child pom.xml files to the correct revision whenever you do a release or my much less preferred option use the maven-release-plugin

accessor	properties
note that i didn t use the generated properties accessor in either initializer method

4744598
accessor	properties
if you aren t required by circumstances you should generally avoid using properties accessor in -init methods and -dealloc primarily because of potential pain-in-the-ass issues with side effects of automatic key-value coding notifications

4744598
accessor	properties
a good rule of thumb is to leave the use of synthesized properties accessor for the callers of your class and the implementation of other methods in the class

4744598

the same would apply if you used post instead of get any intermediary would be able to see the content of the post and therefore replay it

4750425
actualheight	actualwidth
it inherits from contentelement so has no actualheight or actualwidth

4750443

4750510
stdout	fflush
if you have used stdout at all before forking you must call fflush stdout before fork and likewise for any other output file s you use

4751531
uiview	calayer
to be more specific a calayer associated with a uiview will never implicitly animate

4751531
uiview	calayer
in the case of a calayer associated with a uiview uiview implements the -actionforlayer forkey delegate method and when not in a uiview animation block it always returns to signify that the action lookup should stop here

accessor	properties
when you declare a properties as shown in the following example the compiler creates a private anonymous backing field that can only be accessed through the properties s get and set accessor

4751867
getter	setter
with the second example you must use the getter and setter and you can add any kind of validation and other logic around these actions

4751875
getc	gets
if the file is binary then you will need to look for getc function or gets but the idea is the same

4751885
int	double
obviously i understand that the primitive types like int double etc

4751944

4751963
textview	imageview
you can even see the method being overriden in the imageview and textview classes...this is why i am seriously confused as to why i cannot override it myself from view directly.

4752014
public	protected
if there is a public create method inherited then reintroducing a protected create method won t actually hide the public one at all

4752020
mp3	ogg
i would like to use taglib to read write coverart especially for mp3 and ogg files but i couldn t find any examples

4752069
cout	cin

4752272
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
here s a good rule of thumb based on tests done in google-chrome safari and firefox splicing a single value into the middle of an array is roughly half as fast as pushing shifting a value to one end of the array

4752288
int	chars
to detect which key combination was pressed check the lowest four bits of the low-order word for the modifiers shift alt control and compare the high-order word against the virtual key code - which for letters is equal to the chars value of the capital for example the virtual key code for a is int a but not int a

4752303
put	get
get put delete of the reflection layer objects still make perfect sense idempotency etc

4752317

if the connection was successful it sends over the information using an http get request traditionally get is used for getting information post is used for setting it

4752369
google-chrome	firefox
i have seen this problem in both firefox 3.6+ and google-chrome

4752384
spaces	delimiter
another option is to use explode using the delimiter spaces

4752408

pop-up	dialog
when you do joptionpane showmessge your thread thread.currentthread is going to do wait and the dialog will pop-up

vim	textmate
is there a possibility in vim to repeat execute and update # markers textmate feature for ruby code

4752596

uitableview	reloaddata
uitableview reloadsections withrowanimation or even reloaddata will work but if that isn t good for you for other reasons as it wasn t for me i didn t want the current text field to resign first responder you can keep references to all of the headerviews and then update them directly when necessary

i wanted to know if it is possible to find the width and height of a .bmp image in c

4752909
vb.net	vb6
i think it would be the easiest to migrate to vb.net asp.net web forms if you take into account the current vb6 developers

4752909
vb.net	vb6
vb.net is not completly the same as vb6 but it s closer than java

4752947
integer	fractions
when a finite value of real floating type is converted to an integer type other than _bool the fractions part is discarded the value is truncated toward zero

4752947

4752970
opera	google-chrome
opera and google-chrome use utf-8

4752976
tabcontrol	tabitem
your question is a bit unclear but you can t bind your class termino directly to the itemssource of the tabcontrol as it s not derived from tabitem

4752976
tabcontrol	tabitem
actually thinking about it you should be creating a list of tabitem to set to the itemssource of your tabcontrol and binding your class to the tabitem

4753005
int	boolean
int is commonly used as a boolean in c at least prior to c99

4753012

i then thought to achieve this with using a 3 column table in my header and style my td elements using background-image and repeat-x but that seems not work well in google-chrome and safari

4753287

i found out you can recreate absolute positioning by adding your child views to a relativelayout and set the relativelayout.layoutparams to have only default values except width height margintop and marginleft

4753299
boost	stl
i am not aware standard stl has a way to make this neater though i guess boost does - however we don t use boost right now and i am interested anyway

4753363
post	put
my understanding from reviewing is that clients should only send content-type headers on post and put requests

4753364
public	protected
a method should be public if it needs to be called from outside of the class that contains it private or protected otherwise

4753366
public	protected
if its an internal method only make it private or protected otherwise you can make it public

4753402
public	protected
if the method is only supposed to be accessed by sub classes and your class is public then make the method protected

4753405
public	protected
that means private is better than protected protected is better than public etc ..

4753544
factors	matrix	factors	mean
whenever you see some math showing a matrix inversion that should be read to mean solve a system of linear equations or factors the matrix and use the factorization to solve the system

4753564
min	max
one can use an openmp built-in functionality for reduction operations a reduction is an operation like calculating a sum of a list finding the min or max of a list etc which can be done one element at a time only by looking at the result so far and the next element as suggested by ejd

4753697
mvvm	delegatecommand

4753999
vb6	vba
this requires win32 api calls which can be made from vb6 or vba but i m not sure of the exact effect on your project once you do this..

4754011
int	chars
usually when i write anything in c++ and i need to convert a chars into an int i simply make a new int equal to the chars

then after the initial array is built move the children under their parent manually by parsing the initial array

one additional consideration - if your site is ssl and you need to support android 2.1 or earlier the ssl certificate on the https version of the microsoft cdn will crash those versions of the android browser per this issue

4754075
ttabsheet	tframe
now if you want to use a standard windows tabbed interface you could still use the page control as you have suggested you know that each ttabsheet has a single tframe on it and you can check it s type and work with it as required

4754075
hide	show
when you click a tab you hide everything and show the correct tframe

4754080

4754357
hide	show
so will hide or show all radio buttons based on their current state ie

4754372
hide	show
this has the advantage that you can call other js processing on a show or hide that might be specific to a show or specific to a hide such as changing the link s text

4754385

i would do it by adding a event listener for when the mouse move if the distance from the slider becomes too much stop the drag early i m not sure exactly how your slider works but this may help

uiview	uiwindow
all you will need to do is in your uiview or uiwindow better yet implement making sure the view becomes first responder

imho this is a non-sense casting to integer together with autoboxing would be fine but i know no single case when this compiles without warning and without error

this first fades your divs then attaches a hover event on them - where the first function is run when the mouseenter the area and the second function is run when your mouseleave the area

4754941
mouseleave	mouseenter
this binds two functions to your divs one for mouseenter and one for mouseleave and as you can see they do opposite fadetos to each other

4754995
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the following will work in ie as well as firefox and google-chrome safari

in practise my use of this is to do more complicated things than just wrapping property setter and getter the code in the componentmodel namespace is probably better for this - as in the way that mvc leverages it but properly woven these kinds of solutions provide excellent performance and accessibility to the end-user the application coder in my case

addition	multiplication	multiplying	addition	multiplying	add	multiplying	multiplication
in the remote case those operations are not simplified assuming that there is a jit that maps the multiplication and add opcodes in a 1 1 relationship to their cpu instruction counterparts in most modern architectures all integer arithmetic operations usually take the same number of cycles so it will be faster multiplying once than add four times just checked it addition is still slightly faster than multiplication 1 clock vs 3 clocks so it still pays using a multiplication here

4757909
addition	multiplication
but in many cases addition is faster than multiplication

4761598
google-chrome	firefox
the line does not appear in firefox or google-chrome

4761654
put	get
the biggest bang for the buck hashmap you get is that the get put operations searching for the key are done in constant time which is better than o n in array and even o log n if you do binary search on sorted array

4761654
dictionary	map
ps if you are building the map at a server and doing the filtering somewhere else at a client and need to transport the dictionary hashmap won t do - it cannot be serialized

4762115
mousemove	mousedown
although when you do this you will need to make your own mousedown and mousemove event handlers to move your form around as well as code custom minimize and maximize functionality

4762118
inline	inlining
among other problems inlining can lead to there is the compatibility problem if you change the body of a function that is not inline you only need to recompile the unit where it is defined and everyone starts using the new implementation right away

4762118
getter	setter
the only reasonable exception to this rule are trivial setter and getter and even with them it is better to be careful - one day they may become non-trivial and it will mean a lot of recompilation and compatibility breaking

4762131
uitapgesturerecognizer	uibutton
uibutton inside a view that has a uitapgesturerecognizer

width	height
on my script i do check to make sure only integer is allowed in width and height and fill can be either 1 or 2 and color can only be certain values which i check via array

note that portrait and landscape are uiviews in your uiviewcontroller that you define in your header and connect through interface builder

4763120

this will show you unambiguously whether the .lib or .dll is targeted for x86 which is 32-bit or x64 64bit

4763466
16-bit	64bit
edit one more thing - if you choose an awkward type like a 16-bit integer on a 32-bit or 64bit platform you may end up with worse performance because the cpu will have to surgically extract the 16-bit value and turn it into something it can work with

4763468
decoder	encoder
if you re looking to scramble the string as opposed to encrypting it then write your own rot13 encoder decoder

it might be better to store the password in hash format md5 or sha-1 hash the password the user enters using the same method and then compare the hash

4765971
cvs	rcs
the version control package will detect if you re in a cvs rcs or sccs repository and disable backups

4765982
button	checkbox
in that method you create the view for the given row so you know what the row is position and you can register event handlers for the checkbox button etc

4766109
public	protected
each instance of colorprintprovider and blackandwhiteprintprovider will have their own and distinct instance of the state value although none of them will be able to access it unless you make it public or protected or provide other properties or methods which expose it

4766139
inherited	properties
make state a public properties and use composition not inherited

4766153
button	checkbox
if so have activityforshow create a oncheckedchangelistener instance and onclicklistener instance as local anonymous inner classes and have activityforshow give them to singlerowadapter as constructor params to attach to the checkbox and button widgets as their callbacks

4766153
button	checkbox
alternatively define your own custom handler interface s to be called when the button is clicked or the checkbox is checked

4766153
button	checkbox
finally have singlerowadapter create event handlers to attach to the checkbox and button - these event handlers simply call your own custom handlers

4766196
for-loop	loops
every internal for-loop increases k by 250 so both increase it by 500 for every while loops while

integer	unsigned
streampos is a typedef for some typically unsigned integer type

4766204
integer	unsigned
on most recent compilers streampos is going to compile to a native 64 bit integer unsigned long long or unsigned __int64 on msvc++ or uint64_t on gcc which means you shouldn t have to worry so long as you leave things in terms of streampos values

4766216
readonly	temporary
fortunately temporary tables are accessible within sqlclr functions as readonly but they are not accessible at all in t-sql functions

4766220

on windows os checkboxes and associate labels are aligned to the bottom consistently across different browsers firefox safari google-chrome and internet explorer 8

4766392
disk	ram
even though databases go through great pains to give good performance when reading from disk their best performance comes from having enough memory or little enough data so that all or most of the working set will fit in ram

4766396
maven	pom.xml
maven 3 expects all the profile information to be stored as part of the pom.xml file itself

4766397

jboss	glassfish
works with glassfish 3.0.1 jboss and some other containers

4766468
next	except
this occurs because value - 1 is the same as value except that the lowest string of zero bits become one and the next one bit becomes zero due to carrying

4766468
int	double
it also makes assumptions about the size of int s and double - in particular it assumes 32-bit int and 64-bit ieee floats for double

4766468
int	double
the key here is that non-denormalized ieee floating point values and a 32-bit int in a double will always be non-denormalized end up with a representation looking a bit like where xxxxxxxx is the fractional component and e is the exponent

4766527
put	get
so i can get stripslashes to work if i put it first but html_entity_decode wont work and vice versa

4767063
implements	extends
it you want to extends a class rather than implements an interface or create a class out of the blue you need to use a library to create bytecode

4767114
textview	listactivity
given the above layout in your xml and that your corresponding java class extends the listactivity the textview will automatically be shown for you when your list doesn t have any items and it will also automatically be hidden when the list get its first item

the else clause in the for-loop is executed when loops terminates through exhaustion of the list but not when loops is terminated by a break statement

4767192
udp	rtp
you can forward rtp packets over a udp socket

4767223
ienumerable	ilist
i would recommend you to prevent possibility of changing viewmodel.lst lst s type should be ienumerable instead of list ilist of course if your further code doesn t require list functionality

4767303
put	get	post	get	post	put
script tags will always fetch content via get so you can t do a delete post put or suchlike with them

4767355
getter	setter
getter setter are generally used from outside class from inside directly access the fields

4767355
getter	setter
the main advantage purpose is encapsulation of getter setter

4767355
getter	setter
if your getter setter has some logical code then use it

4767355
getter	setter
more on getter and setter

4767356
put	get
subreports we show within the main crystal reports and also we can show it as on-demand report that means we put an hyper link in the row and when user click that hyper link then will get the subreport

4767359
chunked	transfer-encoding
the data arrives as a push response ie chunked transfer-encoding

4767379
getter	setter
yes getter and setter are useful

4767379
getter	setter
so it s a good idea to use getter and setter even if they do not contain much logic other than these checks

4767385
getter	setter
you re supposed to use the getter and setter almost everywhere including inside the class

4767385
getter	setter
the same applies to getter and setter

4767385
getter	setter
essentially you should always try to use the getter and setter whenever they provide the functionality they want

4767385
getter	setter
there s no point writing getter and setter if you aren t going to use them

4767420
nsstring	nsdata
i have a simple nsstring and i m converting it to nsdata

4767424

can get out of date if effort is not put in to keeping up to date

4767505
hash	md5
now this check is done on a few things i think probably the file size file name and of course the crc md5 hash or something...

4767514
width	height
in this case height width and job_id are all numbers and pix is an array of arrays of integers

4767527
for-loop	arrays
from there you can just create a for-loop over the different layers of your 3d arrays

4767529
next	except
i then push the next view controller which does need a prompt and the bar expands except behind the view hiding the title and back button

4767563
min	max	range	max	range	min
the range is set dynamically so when either the min max values on my usercontrol change the client validation function is updated

post	get
you could use post instead of get depending on your needs

4767623
post	get
i want to get the list of post through this query

that example works with the latest google-chrome firefox opera ... using the latest jquery

4767810
gif	png
external files jpeg gif png and

4767824
lapply	tapply
i am not sure if apply is actually faster than for-loops though tapply and lapply definatly are

4767827
ubuntu	linux
for ubuntu it s explained here but it will most likely apply to other linux distros too

4767830
folder	directory
unzip the download into a directory you have complete control of usually a directory under your username preserving folder

4767830
folder	directory
download eclipse package from eclipse.org and extract it to a folder in your home directory

4767840
mouseup	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown
you have to register for the mousedown mouseup and mousemove events and move the form according to the movement of the mouse

4767841
ubuntu	linux
that said it s a lot easier if you re on a linux system already - the package sources are divided into an original source tarball plus ubuntu patches so if you don t use apt-get source you ll need to manually apply the patch to the source code

4767845
move	drag
this should be what you are looking for enhanced drag and move winforms

4767910
matplotlib	scipy
the easiest solution i found was to get a make file which downloads numpy scipy and matplotlib and compile them for you

4767924
children	parent
unfortunately if i were to disable selecting text in the parent div all the children divs immediately adopted that behaviour and that is not what i meant

4767924
children	parent
i want that the parent div won t be selected but its children will

4767936
pop-up	dialog
one way is when we download something from microsoft s website a small pop-up window with no close maximise and minimise button and then the save dialog box appears

4767950
min	max
i m thinking min and max would be the amp of the wave and rateofchange would be a product of the sine function i just can t figure out how it all goes together

4767967
pull	push
from here you can git clone git push git pull the repo as you wish

4767998
children	parent
the parent thread process will assure the children aren t trying to do the same thing

4768085
boost	stl
with the large size of current c c++ libraries like stl win32 boost posix etc

4768135
put	get
that s why most communities and similar pages put a proxy between the page and the external ressource they strip the session-id if it is stored via get

4768138
submit	submission
for clarity i am using the following with the jq submit function in the click handler for this form submission

4768226
versioning	upgrade
the eclipse versioning available through the official ubuntu channels is 3.5 and should not be manually upgrade to 3.6

4768229
maven	pom.xml
to create two jars you need two maven modules pom.xml

4768233
free	malloc
for each malloc call you typically need a corresponding free call in order to avoid memory leaks

4768233
free	malloc
in your case you have two malloc calls in application.c 730 and application.c 731 for which there is no free call made by the time your program terminates

4768233
free	malloc
a common cause of this issue is storing the result of two malloc calls to the same pointer without an intermediate free call

4768260
jar	manifest.mf
you may also add classpath references in the executable jar file manifest.mf or for more experienced users use maven assembly plugin which will create artefact with all its dependencies packed within a single jar

4768318
for-loop	loops
you have a while loops inside your outer for-loop while read in.read b 0 10

4768409
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
for firefox safari google-chrome etc

4768428
rtp	sdp
such solution could take external stream description in sdp format and your actual rtp packets

4768428
rtp	rtsp
edit btw it s weird that you receive just rtp stream w o any description of its format usually its description is provided somehow by rtsp mpeg-ts or something else

4768459
gitolite	gitosis
while arrowmaster is correct in saying that gitosis has been depreciated in favour of gitolite there is nothing to say that you cant use git for web deployment there are loads of people doing it including me

4768459
pull	push
what you need to do is the following get gitolite setup and have a working installation whereby you can clone push and pull into the repositories that gitolite will create for you

4768459
gitolite	gitosis
after a long time messing around and having some success with gitosis i switched to gitolite and haven t looked back

4768459
pull	push
i have found it a lot less buggy and more stable in the push pull permissions department

it is however for centos but should be easily ported to ubuntu

4768467
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu

4768486
int	double
when this has been done the new matrix contains double instead of int according to matlab workspace

4768507
children	parent
save parent it saves all children

4768507
children	parent
update list on parent object remove some items and add some new items and save parent it updates children

4768507
children	parent
delete parent will delete all children

4768515
retaincount	dealloc
why does the second log nslog after image dealloc i self retaincount

4768548
public	protected
that aside what private and protected inheritance do is the same as public inheritance except that all the member variables are functions are inherited with at least private or protected accessibility

4768554
public	protected
private inheritance means that all public and protected members of state would be inherited by world and would become private

4768563
public	protected
the public protected private keyword before the name of the ancestor class indicates the desired visibility of members from the ancestor

4768565
dictionary	map
a dictionary allows us to map one type a key to another in this case a delegate

4768565
dictionary	map
now we need to create a dictionary to map the commands to these functions

in its absence an xslt or xquery solution using recursion is likely to perform better when the number of nodes to be selected is small compared with the number of following siblings

4768876
stdout	fflush
it might be too late then to print error anyway the stdout might have been abrupted too early and the file will never be fflush closed

4768885
innodb	myisam
the default order of a select is insert order for myisam and pk for innodb if i remember correctly

4769123
prepare	execute
this is one of the main advantage of prepare statements prepare once execute multiple times

4769162
getter	setter
beware also that you should not uses hashes for things that have fixed names properties you should define your own classes with its getter and setter

4769214
post	get
the name of the dropdownlist generated will be the following and if your controller action doesn t take a model having a property called post with a property called categoryid and this categoryid property is marked with required you will get the behavior you are describing

4769244
hash	salt
the hash is computed using the salt and the password

4769244

4769432
mouse	keyboard
update 25 01 after a few days of working on my application i ve noticed i don t really use pywinauto that much right now i m only using it for finding window and then i directly use sendkeysctypes.sendkeys to simulate keyboard input and win32api functions to simulate mouse input

4769482
antivirus	mcafee
it could be mcafee antivirus installed on my machine

4769496
pthreads	fork
note that while c++ does not specify _exit and c99 leaves it implementation-defined whether it flushes buffers pthreads requires that it not flush buffers since this would break the main usage of _exit _exit handling failure of execve after fork

4769506
luabind	luabridge
the thing which lua does best is the great interop with c c++ code using libraries like luabridge and luabind

4769509
accessor	properties
the issue sounds like the raisepropertychanged method isn t being raised by your mvvm light viewmodel - if you re binding get accessor of your isenabled properties on the viewmodel directly to a value in isolatedstorage then the viewmodel isn t going to know that that underlying value has necessarily changed

4769526
imagemagick	minimagick
it simply plugs into tools like imagemagick and minimagick

those were easy - simple 32-bit add and subtract

4769663
multiplying	add
with multiplying and divide i can also add many trigonometric and exponential log functions

4769663
multiplying	division
and i think i can deal with just multiplying as my library has a reciprocal function and i can use that to implement division

4769693

range	max
if your original time value range from 0 to some number max you can do the scaling like this

4770890
cos	sin
the cos and sin values represent the x and y components of the vector between the sun and the origin so you should multiply by the distance of the sun from the centre of your scene which is usually constant

4770928
webclient	webrequest
however it s worth bearing in mind that webclient does rather a lot of work on the ui thread despite the async part - if this is for a production app you probably want to use webrequest directly

hide	show
although it s worth noting that running the toggle method only when it s checked assuming that it starts off un-checked involves the user clicking the input once to show it and then again to remove the check and again to re-check it so that it hide as a result of the toggle

4771058

maven	m2e
the only other gotcha that i can think of is that when you check the project using a version control system in eclipse you need to remember to check the parent project out as maven project otherwise the m2e plugin tends to freak out and not resolve things properly

4771205
cpu	processors
the reason i m asking is i remember reading somewhere that if you have as many tasks as the number of virtual processors tasks on the same physical core can sometimes starve some cpu resources and prevent each other from getting as many resources as needed possibly decreasing performance

4771383
g++	gcc
i know for a fact that gcc and g++ support this and that it can make a pretty big difference in the net program performance

cpu	hyperthreading
jobs that appear to be entirely cpu bound usually aren t and hyperthreading can extract a few extra cycles out of the occasional interrupt or context switch

4771384
cpu	processors
on the other hand with a core ix processors that has turbo boost you might actually do better running 1 thread per core to encourage the cpu to overclock itself

4771385
accessor	properties

udp	rtp
3 rtp runs on top of udp of course it adds overhead

4771729
rtp	rtcp
in many ways rtp ignoring rtcp is pretty much the bare minimum already and if you implemented a half-way decent alternative it would save you a few bytes at best and you wouldn t be able to use any of the many rtp test tools

hide	show
also .delegate accepts only one function so for the hover event you need to test the event.type to determine show docs or hide docs

i don t think steak adds any complication for anyone familiar with rspec but if you think so and you don t really care about all previous things then you don t need to use rspec at all you will probably be happier using just test unit + capybara

4774508
getter	setter
setting aside the fact that i use getter setter where the more experienced c++-programmer won t make use of them i have a problem with the following code

as for performance i d suggest mysql 5 or postgresql

4774760
postgresql	mysql
if you don t want to pay the huge premium for oracle your choice is between mysql and postgresql sqlite is mostly meant for development not production

4774760
postgresql	mysql
postgresql seems to be the choice of most django core devs andrew godwin went as far as putting friends don t let friends use mysql into a djangocon talk

4774760
postgresql	mysql
imho postgresql has two clear advantages over mysql

4774763
postgresql	mysql
postgresql is arguably technically a better database then mysql so if you ve never used it before it might be worth investing some time to lean it

4775779
min	max
and if you are interested in peaks you could provide max avg and min values

4775779

the algorith would then run every 5 seconds and calculate the median min and max of the 5 seconds what passed 24 hours ago

4775857
facade	service-locator
as others mentioned you d want to look at common service-locator csl that is a simple service resolution facade around any container any of your choice

4776615
mp3	wav
i can handle programming pretty well but i m not exactly an expert on the mp3 wav formats

4776621

the struct is defined in a c fashion since in c it is a common idiom to typedef declare a struct so that it can be used as a type without having to write struct l2_cache_entry on every reference

4776670
width	height
in safari my first tests both by opening the html page locally file url and loading it from my server showed everything working the height and width is correct the canvas draw works and the onload also fires

4776670
width	height
in firefox v3.6 os x loading the page after launching the browser shows that the height width is not correct immediately after setting drawimage fails

4776670
width	height
the onload handler does fire however. loading the page again however shows the width height being correct immediately after setting and drawimage working

4776670
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome v8 os x i see the same results as in firefox the image is not available immediately but takes some time to asynchronously load from the data url

if you expect it to be post but the spider uses get then it should be 405 method not allowed

4777023
post	get
i m not aware of any way to open a new browser window with a post request with get being the default http method used to open pages which makes sense really

4777023
post	get
an alternative however would be to post the data using a simple http request in air and once you get a response to the post request in air you can open a new browser window using a get request

4777024
int	chars
dec2bin converts a number to a string representation so x 1 obtains a chars not an int

4777027
gridview	detailsview
you could add your gridview detailsview to an usercontrol and add this to the contenttemplate of the tabpanel

4777059
rss	feed
my problem is i have a php script that produces an rss feed

4777069
queue	fifo

other options would be using an http debugging proxy like charles or fiddler as ericlaw suggests

4777309
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
you could also use a tool like firebug firefox web inspector safari google-chrome and other webkit-based browsers or opera dragonfly all of which provide some ability to view the request and response headers and bodies though most of them don t allow you to see the exact byte stream but instead how the browsers parsed the requests

4777351
gif	png
the problem with your code might be that the nsdata doesn t contain valid png data but only raw image data gif data jpeg data or another kind of non-png data

4777421
post	get
that should be post change instead of get change

4777450
jlist	jtable
once you cross this threshold you will figure out how to use jtable set selectionmodels in jlist use the invokelater paradigm etc

4777458
textmate	jedit
jedit free java and textmate 50 native are good choices if you want a text editor that will syntax highlight indent etc

4777977
google-chrome	firefox
it worked flawlessly in all other browsers i tested with firefox google-chrome ie 6 7 8

4778004
mp3	wav
the big downside of this is of course that a huuge wav file has to be created and woe be unto thee if the mp3 happens to be 15 minutes or so.

4778024
google-chrome	firefox
the advantage that you have is that unlike upgrading an operating system upgrading from ie7 to google-chrome 8 or firefox 3.6 is a more reachable goal for the average user of your app especially if you provide a link and upgrade instructions

4778045
opera	firefox
opera webkit and firefox in their

4778109

4778127
hide	show
if you use hide you will need to call show before slidedown

4778145
hide	show
i m also up for suggestions maybe there is a better way to do this i thought creating hidden div tags for each item and then running javascript for when the image is clicked and showing it that way however that seems stupid in my opinion it seems to make more sense to make my div control once and then update the labels inside it on each image click and then show or hide it

4778204
post	get
you have the basic get and post requests and that s pretty much it

4778262
post	put
you can try multipart post or else you could try put http methods to transfer the file as binary

4778273
rss	feed
i am working on a schedule system that collects information from a rss feed

4778300
rank	max
if you want to show ties at the max value change row_number to rank

4778328

4778335
hide	show
this would have the div either show or hide before the page is ready

4778359
inherited	properties
then i have a couple classes that inherited from this class powersupplyvoltage and powersupplycurrent that each define read write methods and properties for holding the last read written values

4778370
width	height
generally if you want to set the width height as you expected you ll need to set the display to block

4778408
implements	extends
in a language implements classical inheritance like java c# or c++ you start by creating a class--a blueprint for your objects--and then you can create new objects from that class or you can extends the class defining a new class that augments the original class

4778421
post	get
if i have thousands of post and the content for each of those post is huge then it would be immensely wasteful for me to store all of that content in a php variable just to get the titles and permalinks to those post

4778430
redmine	trac
i used trac at my old job but i find that redmine has everything that trac has except it come s out-of-the-box with everything you need and it s easier to use

4778449
boost	stl
as for not reinventing the wheel like many have said already make sure to first explore the possibilities in the standard template library stl which is much richer than you might think and then look at boost www.boost.org which has libraries for a lot of diverse purposes and they are extremely high quality and some are just works of art like spirit proto lambda and mpl

4778457
rss	feed
i m trying to build a function that retrieves schedule information based on what day it is the rss feed has the next 10 days in advanced

4778457

4783362
folder	directory
to put it another way i want to export only the files i changed in the last commit into a folder on my harddrive that is not my working copy but i don t want them to be all lumped in the parent directory

4783381
submit	submission
right now for signups comment submission etc i use a second page that verifies data and then submit and routes back to home.php

4783415
hex	binary
better ways to accomplish the same thing are welcome i especially don t like the binary hex decimal conversions

4783429
post	get
but please remember that is is a good practice to show successfull form submission results on a different page served through get request any successfull form post should be answered with redirect to the success page

4783514
width	height
so the basic idea is that i have an array of 8 div rectangles with a width of 30 px and a random height through math

4783519
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it s working fine in webkit google-chrome safari but the -moz-background-size property is not working at all in firefox

4783522
google-chrome	firefox
perhaps it d be a good idea to open the html files in firefox instead of letting google-chrome extensions handle it

4783536
stdout	stderr
redirecting stderr to stdout will give you the output as return value instead of bloating it just out

4783562
int	double
is the int modulus operator but with floating point numbers you need to call the library method fmod which takes and returns double or fmodf which takes and returns single precision floats

4783607
hide	show
but the page is also open for user interaction via jquery and one of the things that the user can do is hide show elements

4783639
for-loop	loops
the div i m trying to attach them to are 4 different divs in the for-loop each loops needs to reference a different element

4783700
firefox	safari
this doesn t do it in firefox or even safari which is webkit based

4783705
integer	unsigned
well since src is declared as is never larger than 255 which is the highest possible value for a 8-bit unsigned integer

4783720
put	get
when you request the entire list you get the items ordered the way you put them in the list

4783747
min	max
if you want it to actually not go that far you could use the min and max options on the x-axis to set this

4783770
opera	firefox
it is ok firefox and ie but doesnt work in opera

4783809
hex	binary
xxd tool which comes with vim and thus is quite likely to be available allows to hex dump a binary file and construct a new binary file from a modified hex dump

4783896
textview	imageview
the positioning of imageview and textview in linearlayout2 and positiong of buttons in linearlayout3 is not working using layout gravity

4783927
folder	directory
in the hooks folder i have a file named post-receive that attempts to update a public site s working directory

4783929
gdal	ogr
a number of open source libraries such as gdal ogr can then be used to get the projections and data loading to work properly

4783941
google-chrome	firefox
this works great in firefox lastest version windows and os x however it appears that google-chrome again in both windows and os x versions does not observe the event properly and the callback function is invoked prematurely

4784043
jobs	cron
and i would like ideally to be able to run and cron jobs with these settings

4784142
m2e	pom.xml
i d start by using the m2e pom.xml editor in eclipse and click on dependency hierarchy and carefully review all of the transitive dependencies

4784144
hide	show
i would suggest using css display none to load it and hide and then show it when you need it

4784179
mvp	presenter
for winforms i would suggest learning about the mvp model view presenter and the mvc pattern

4784185
aggregate-functions	sum
for instance if you are using group by in a view for it to be indexable it should contain a count_big and all aggregate-functions in it should distribute over union all only sum and count_big actually are

4784201
width	height
pay attention that the result is expressed in radiant.if it is a circle and you have x y relative to the circle you can pass radius-y radius-x if it is an ellipse you can pass height 2-y width 2-x

4784209
width	height
if you run it in kaxaml or in a wpf window page your button will now keep on getting bigger and bigger both width and height

4784221
vb.net	vb6
now i want to write a little tool vb6 vb.net c# ... that uses a word 2007 com object to automatically add thumbnails

4784255
google-chrome	firefox
works fine on firefox and ie but in google-chrome the inner cells are not centered like the code seems to do

4784255
google-chrome	firefox
the firts image shows how google-chrome renders it and the second how firefox do it

4784310
vb.net	vb6	vb6	vba
that will give you the basic code to start with and vba will probably be easy for you as you already know vb6 and vb.net

4784310
vsto	add-in
vsto i don t know in what version the preview option was introduced but as far as i know the development of the com interface is somewhat behind of the .net add-in interface

4784310
vsto	add-in
so if you can t find the option at all in the interface you d probably need vsto visual studion tools for office to develop an add-in that can control word from the inside using the .net interface that word provides

4784373
vim	kate
i just started using the kate editor was using vim for c dev

4784393
post	get
i get error s in vs but from reading through the other post it appears to be an ide specific problem

4784462
width	height
compare the width docs and height docs of the container to the position docs properties of the element taking into consideration the scrolltop docs and scrollleft docs

4784502
width	height
by will now overflow the height keep getting bigger i assume that you mean the width as well as the height of your button

4784502
width	height
well that is because you have the width bound directly to the height

4784577
kde	gnome
this is why for example gnome and kde can get along on the same display and why really old x-windows programs that know nothing about panels or desktops still work just fine on modern systems

4784578
pdfsharp	itext
so you can use either itext or pdfsharp to read the pdf files but its the getting meaningful data out that s going to be the challenge

4784637
ant	pom.xml
as i don t have a cs-major in the background mathematics engineering instead i have had the pleasure of battling through and learning concepts such as project management pom.xml version control svn and build scripts ant

4784641
rss	feed
you are asking nokogiri to parse the xml rss feed as html

4784688
daemons	systemd
sbin â systemd binaries or server binaries daemons might need to be superuser to run

4784700
mouseover	mouseout
you may end up having to instantiate the mouseover and mouseout manually

4784750
profiling	debugging
i have a project with a parent pom.xml which define profiling and a debugging profiling

4784750
profiling	debugging
i want that one of my sub-modules adds the dependency jboss-seam-debug when the profiling debugging is activated

4784750
profiling	debugging
it s like the children pom.xml re-defines my debugging profiling .

4784750
children	parent	maven	pom.xml
which didn t work only by passing because i don t pass the system property it s the maven property which is activated by my parent pom.xml and that my children doesn t see .

4784778
google-chrome	firefox
42now.com uses favicon.ico in google-chrome and firefox

4784785
hash	salt
salt sha1 hash just won t cut it in a world where renting a few aws instances to compute fast rainbow tables.

4784793
min	max
i understand that there are limited min max etc. args to use but we want to make a generic statement and add some text

4784847
for-loop	loops
instead use a while read loops or a for-loop with globbing

4784866
equals	gethashcode
i know that the intersect extension uses the gethashcode instead of the equals to compare items which is why i really don t care what s in my equals as this class will never be called but for the intersect extension on entitycollections

4784892
width	height
the problem is that when i layout a view in the ui builder it s the correct width and height but when i actually load it in it fills the entire screen

4784902
equals	gethashcode
i know that the intersect extension uses the gethashcode instead of the equals to compare items which is why i really don t care what s in my equals as this class will never be called but for the intersect extension on entitycollections

4784902
equals	gethashcode
gethashcode is used as a first quick way of bucketing values but equals will still be called for any items with the same hash otherwise you can t know they re equals

4785011
setinterval	settimeout
an alternative if you only have 4 images would be to create a single huge image with all four in a texture atlas and then use settimeout or setinterval to call drawimage with different parameters to draw different subsets of the image to the canvas

4785018
autoresize	scrollbar
edit to clarify i want to autoresize the textarea when typing so there s never a scrollbar

4785045
bazaar	git
i personally happen to like git and github but others like mercurial and bazaar

4785054
listener	eventhandler
i ended up having to use an eventhandler and attaching an event listener to the linechart itself

4785093
width	height
the complete width and height are always used

4785148
width	margin
set the width of the ul element to something that would fit all li elements if each of the li element is 20px wide and there are 5 elements the ul element should be at least 100px. you should also consider the padding and margin of each of the ul element and add that to the total width of the ul element

4785153
memcached	apc
let s assume i have these variables saved in apc memcached and eaccelerator

4785233
filtering	grouping
you want to filtering on the two date values using a between grouping on user_id and then use having to filtering the grouping results

4785272
addclass	removeclass
simply wraps the native dom this element as a jquery object again so we can access the jquery functions like addclass and removeclass

4785275
hash	md5
i am trying to create a single md5 hash of multiple strings in java

4785280
width	height
you could also write some jquery to grab the window viewport height width like and size your entire page s container div accordingly

4785291
hash	salt
i don t have time to go through the whole blocks of code but basic salt hash validation is as follows

4785301
hash	salt
if you want to validate the entered password you would do the same as with the original password prepend the salt and hash that value

4785301
hash	salt
so lookup the salt that was used when hashing the original password and use it when hashing the entered password and then compare the stored hash with the new calculated hash

4785320
hash	salt
hash the password they entered when logging in with the salt from the database

4785360
google-chrome	firefox
i test it on google-chrome 8.0.552 and also it acts same on firefox 3.6.13 but 4 pixel less is fine

4785410
openssl	m2crypto
i am trying to build m2crypto 0.21.1 with openssl 1.0.0c or 0.9.7m for python 2.5.4 on windows but swig is conspiring against me

4785420
hash	salt
you would first need to grab the salt key from the database by searching on the entered username and then you would hash the entered password with the salt you grabbed from the database and check that it matches the password for the username in the database

4785438
width	height
i just set the width height to be a percentage of the container

4785451
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested in ie firefox and google-chrome and the page speed is the same

4785451
yslow	pagespeed
i have the yslow and pagespeed extensions installed in firebug

4785453
google-chrome	firefox
however i did some research and found that the following works in firefox ie google-chrome

4785506
openssl	m2crypto
the problem is that the m2crypto setup.py by default points to but if that openssl directory is the source tree include isn t the right place to look on windows at least - you need to be looking in inc32 otherwise opensslv.h is just a line pointing to a different file which is why swig bombs out on line 1

4785526
portrait	landscape
the image and the thumbnails should always displayed in portrait and not in landscape mode

4785557
hash	salt
i think you are storing the hash salt only basically enabling a login with any empty password

4785606
superclass	subclassing
now let s override it in a subclassing to double the superclass s answer

4785606
superclass	subclassing
that s because when the superclass s method makes a recursive call the recursive call goes through the subclassing

4785653
viewdidload	viewdidappear
i ve tried moving the code from viewdidload to viewdidappear animated and it still behaves this way

4785684
post	get
i ve got a simple form sitting in a master page for some reason i cannot get the submit button to post back it doesn t do anything at all

4785756
width	height
i managed to center the div but now .nivo-controlnav a loses its width and height because is not floating left

4785759
superclass	subclassing
recursive calls might be to a subclassing instead of to a superclass

4785781
margin	text-align
first off what s making this complicated is the text-align center and margin auto property in your body selector

4785781
margin	text-align
2 remove text-align center and margin auto from the body and set these only where you need them

4785808
union	distinct
by default union only grabs distinct values therefore your exact result

4785856
hide	show
be able to show hide a scrollbar in the text widget when the amount of text grows larger than the widget size

4785856
width	height
this seems to require a pack layout because the text widget can only be given a width and height in characters not pixels .

4785880
post	put
what you need to do is to put some checks to differentiate between an initial page load and a post back

4785893
width	height
or since you know the height and width of the img

4785976
google-chrome	safari
recently google-chrome and safari s inspection tools allowed users to edit full chunks structural code in a very buggy manner but you still can t edit full stylesheets

4785976
google-chrome	safari
usually when someone brings this up google-chrome and safari developers say but you can edit css and that s true to an extent

4785976
google-chrome	safari
otherwise maybe someone will step up to the plate and develop it for either google-chrome or safari

4786002
versioning	upgrade
i ve never had need of anything beyond the 1.x versioning so i never bothered to upgrade any hosting code

4786019
subscript	superscript
this allows you to specify text as superscript or subscript for example

4786107
lwjgl	jogl
i am currently developing an applet for some opengl es stuff but i am absolutely unsure how i can handle the natives that comes with jogl and or lwjgl

4786107
lwjgl	jogl
so i plan to use the applet loader from lwjgl but implementing the opengl es with jogl

4786114
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome do

4786149
hash	md5
md5 string calculates the md5 hash of string returning the result in hexadecimal

4786177
width	margin
i want the width of .nivo-controlnav to automatically fit the width + margin of .nivo-controlnav a

4786192
google-chrome	firefox
i have been a long time firefox user and have recently been experimenting with using google-chrome as my primary browser

4786192
google-chrome	firefox
there seems to be a way to configure google-chrome to use fiddler but it is not nearly as seamless as firefox in terms of enabling disabling

4786229
sudo	passwd
sudo normally has some kind of time-out value so that if you issue a second sudo command within the time-out period you will not be asked for your passwd again

4786250
folder	directory
you can put miscellaneous support files and libraries in the lib folder in the root directory and they will be available for use in your application the files in the app folder

4786270
serializable	deserialization
but i think a work-around for your specific case would be to specify type as java.lang.object since this should work ok for serializable string will be output as is and for deserialization it will be deserialized as a map

4786270
getter	setter
actually you might want to have separate getter setter if so

4786277
udp	tcp
they only allow you to do basic operations opening a connection tcp or udp writing or reading bytes and closing the connection

4786278
google-chrome	firefox
use google-chrome as much as possible and explore the same way you explored firefox

4786297
keyup	mouseup
is done using the keyup and mouseup

4786299
ddms	adb
window - preferences - android - ddms - adb connection timeout ms

4786337
serializable	deserialization
if i serializable about 11k of these in an array as an array deserialization takes about 1.3gb of max vm size to read about 170mb of disk image into a 250mb of final vm size

4786337
serializable	deserialization
if i serializable each of the above 11k objects individually to the same file along with a count indicator deserialization takes about 250mb of max vm size to read a slightly smaller 160mb of disk image into a 250mb of final vm size

4786347
hide	show
having said all that if you are using dynamic controls just to show and hide different views of the same screen then i suggest you donâ t use them

4786360
versioning	upgrade
i just ran into a tricky issue where an upgrade to versioning 5.5.8 of mysql resulted in a syntax change that broke an existing script due to the use of type where engine is now required in a create_table command

4786374
put	get
you get to put a shiny 2.0 label on your resume site

4786390
hide	show
i am toggling show hide using jquery on a div block via

4786390
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
safari firefox opera all work fine so i m thinking this is a google-chrome bug

4786391
implements	extends
i have implements a tab bar screen and all my screen classes extends it

4786393
x86	64bit
this might be overkill for your application but for me changing the platform target to x86 prevents 64bit ie from being used either in the controls or in popups

4786421
google-chrome	firefox
i ve switched from firefox to google-chrome around 6 months ago but i don t really use it very much for development purposes

4786423
nsurl	nsdata
you can get the objectid transform it to nsurl using the urirepresentation and then archive it in a nsdata using the nskeyedarchiver

4786457
put	get
to put it more succinctly if in your example ragstatuscid is an integer and you attempted to call string dr ragstatuscid you would get an exception because the type is not a string it s an int

4786471
min	max
then you could use the min x max x and the min y max y to draw your rectangles

4786480
width	height
groupbox text id x y width height style extended-style

4786518
post	get
the access token should be passed using the get method not post

4786539
udp	tcp
can one use sockets which as i understand it or network-layer constructs to send byte-wise messages compliant with higher protocols such as tcp or udp

4786539
sctp	tcp	sctp	udp	udp	tcp
sockets gives you access to transport protocols such as tcp or udp actually with java it s only tcp and udp in the future probably sctp as well

4786539
udp	tcp
you can build stuff that works on top of tcp udp not implement tcp udp yourself unless you want to implement an ip stack on top of tcp or udp - which is what several vpn or tunelling protocols does

4786539
udp	tcp
yes these commonly work on top of tcp you can implement http ftp and other protocols that that runs above tcp udp by using sockets in java - that s what sockets are for

4786540
awt	swing
i assume the other program is not a swing app in which case only awt robot works and by sending native windows messages you can reliable find the other programs textbox even if it doesn t has the focus or is hidden in the background

4786583
post	put
i would put names into a post array

4786589
centos	linux
i want to develop php application on linux centos 5.0

4786593
children	parent
this way the parent will still fit where you want it but the children will just float as they should with the space they need

4786605
post	get
in the original version i get the output that can be seen in the bottom of this post this is only one line which is the database

4786618
g++	gcc
it works fine for code that s generated by gcc g++ but if you depart much from what it can does produce you can run into all sorts of problems

4786621
csv	tsv
on the other hand filemaker can import other formats csv tsv excel and has its own xml format so you can use these formats

4786632
clang	llvm
for compiler tools there is llvm clang which are open-source under bsd license

4786650
firefox	safari
my js script navigation bar fails to render on an aspx custom navbar in safari but it works fine in ie and firefox

4786650
opera	safari
the bar won t expand upon bar clicking in safari opera

4786650
opera	safari
the html that is generated from the aspx page will operate fine in all browsers yet i lose my webresources pictures in safari opera

4786697
min	max
for min max for float and double here is what you want

4786703
tabcontrol	tabitem
within my tabcontrolviewmodel my view is basically a tabcontrol with 3 tabitem welcome tabitem1 tabitem2

4786745
int	double	jtextfield	jlabel
this would lead me to the analogy that jlabel and jtextfield are like the int and double primitives in java

4786757
min	max
then if you consider this type to be signed min and max values are -2 number_of_bits - 1 and 2 number_of_bits - 1 - 1 or if they re unsigned min will be 0 and max 2 number_of_bits - 1

4786757
int	double
this applies only to int types so not for floats and double and then only for two s complement int representations

4786775
children	parent
if a has nothing else but other children the parent s height will always be 0

4786802
spaces	delimiter
i wrote this function but i don t think it s effective enough i used the explode function with spaces as a delimiter but what if the user puts two spaces instead of one

4786846
superclass	subclassing
the variable is clearly declared in the superclass yet the subclassing can not see it

4786895
submit	submission
also how to submit the form such that the list of objects gets re-created on submission

4786899
uielement	adorner
i would like to be able to somehow outline or highlight any particular uielement or perhaps even visual in an adorner layer

4786943
versioning	upgrade
makes it much easier to upgrade cocos versioning mid-game development

4786967
getter	setter
or maybe i should synchronize the getter setter or perhaps declare the instance variable to be volatile

4786985
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works in every other browser i tested firefox opera google-chrome safari etc so i am a little frustrated

4787009
put	get
that is sufficient as the purpose of concurrenthashmap is to allow lockless get put operations but make sure you are using it with the correct concurrency level

4787009
getter	setter
the wrappered getter setter make no difference so long as it is still being read written to by multiple threads

4787016
put	get
retrieval operations including get generally do not block so may overlap with update operations including put and remove

4787031
put	get
therefore every time i get somethign that looks promising i have to put it onto my actual phone and try it out - time-consuming and a hassle

4787043
ienumerable	iqueryable
difference iqueryable and ienumerable

4787043
ienumerable	iqueryable
linq to sql works on iqueryable and linq to object work on ienumerable

4787081
gif	png
what you need to do is have all the images point to a pixel gif or png

4787134
peer	p2p
the flash player has p2p apis that allow direct connection with other peer typically other browsers over udp

4787150
mouse	keyboard
and by responsiveness here i mean the general feel of how the application responds to mouse clicks and keyboard events the little lags between the user clicking somewhere and the program actually redrawing all the needed things to represent the response to that click

4787190
put	get
for example get the max ids from transaction and put this in a table variable

4787260
button	checkbox
to modify the size looks of a view like a checkbox radio button use the background and button properties to specify your own drawables

4787275
qpushbutton	qvboxlayout
â qvboxlayout addwidget qpushbutton â

4787282
domxpath	domdocument
now in domdocument you could do this by using domxpath

4787296
ftpwebresponse	ftpwebrequest
2 - using ftpwebrequest and ftpwebresponse objects

4787350
int	chars
to concatenate a long int to a chars you need to use itoa which will take the int and return a chars later you just need to do some string process to concatenate them

4787369
rss	feed
instead of sending emails when an item is in a workflow state why don t you try using the rss feed that sitecore generates for each state

4787369
rss	feed
the majority of email clients have built in rss readers which typically will show the feed as a separate inbox

4787371
accessor	properties
also things like retain copy properties won t work if you don t go through the accessor

4787384
pop-up	dialog
if you want to disable your app while logging out you can pop-up a non-cancellable dialog

4787413
folder	directory
i would like to add prefix on all folder and directory

4787414
post	get
well _post is used exactly like _get just need to change the input form to use post rather than get

4787457
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox 3.9 ie9 beta google-chrome latest and opera 11 both alerts execute

4787515
width	height
btw since the height are all the same it might be easier to just put these in a container div to control the width and use float left

4787517
config	ini
maybe you need to improve your config parsing or declaration process so that you always have to declare some kind of associative array in an ini file

4787597
oncreate	setcontentview
one call to oncreate one call to setcontentview is all you should have

4787626
stateless	stateful
stateful bean computerbean dispatches work to stateless pooled processorbean s

4788266
versioning	upgrade
my users use my gwt app for an average of 40 minutes at a time so when i upgrade the versioning number of the gae backend there s a long period of time when the versioning they re running in their browser doesn t match the versioning supporting it on the server

4788269
portrait	landscape
also i would rotate the device between portrait to landscape modes to check the the specific orientation-mode css codes which gave strange results

4788269
portrait	landscape
rotating from landscape to portrait there was no problem the sizes and placement of everything kind of made sense

4788269
portrait	landscape
after that rotating from portrait back to landscape and

4788279
filtering	grouping
as you can see from the schema filtering cannot be applied to grouping bys

4788320
integer	unsigned
that and as others have pointed out you ll need to change your definition of i to a signed integer just int because when the counter is meant to be -1 it will be some other positive number because you declared it an unsigned int

4788321
hash	md5
with sha or md5 you won t get accidental collisions but if you are really paranoid use two hash with two different algorithms

4788332
cos	sin
i m using a microcontroller with a software ieee754 32-bit fpu which has sin and cos functions

4788332
cos	sine	cos	sin
sin and cos are relatively slow around 800 cycles each so it would make it faster if i could calculate the sine or cosine value and somehow derive the missing value

4788340
uuid	uniqueidentifier
the java uuid java.util.uuid and the sql server uniqueidentifier are two different things

4788345

i m using accepts_nested_attributes_for on the the parent model and its many children are being shown in the form using

realloc	malloc
i am using realloc and malloc heavily but the output is not what i am expecting for example the # character that represents a wall is being omitted

4788652
inherited	properties
at a guess the isselected properties was inherited and had this attribute set

google-chrome	safari
while safari doesn t have google-chrome s specific tab-related api it does have a perfect solution to this problem

4788694
free	realloc
additionally from a philosophical point of view you are trying to do too much in the function compare your function to realloc -- which may free memory or do nothing or allocate more memory and change the value of a pointer depending on the arguments passed in

4788697
post	get
when running i get a stack overflow which i ll post below

i deploy a web archive and that war references a jar file that conflicts with those in jboss_home server default lib

4788860
post	get
i need to get the information of all the videos available on a page so far i havent found a way to get these results on a html page no flash other than tricking the search page into returning the whole list back using 3 underscores as the search keywords the problem is that the search is doing a post to a page which i assume is then redirecting to the final page and it gives you something like this the problem there is that this url is only alive for 5 or 10 minutes so i cannot use this url everytime i need to run the stand alone file the search is in a form with a post to which i imagine takes all the data from that form there is some other hidden fields and then redirects to that results page is there a way i can do the post with all the data and then get the page that is being redirected

4788861
children	parent
when the project grows it has come to a point where inheritance doesn t make any sense anymore because i have situations where 80 of the children daos need that api but 20 don t yet they still inherit from the same parent dao because they share other similar apis

4788874
width	height
from this information you will know the width and the height of the object from the previous step

4788874
width	height
it may be easier just to use width vs height ratio

4788930

after_save didn t work because it apparently interrupts the form post and the file doesn t get uploaded and the extract_photos method can t find the file

4788975

it returns a valid pointer if i do free and then another malloc however i would like to use realloc

4789072
public	protected
the cls not clr specification insists that public and protected members not differ only by case

4789074
disk	ram
what you ll end up with is several completely different boot loaders that all load the kernel or maybe some sort of ram disk image if it s a micro-kernel and leave the computer in a certain state when starting the kernel a specific cpu mode the kernel at a specific address other file s at specific places etc such that the kernel itself needn t care which boot loader loaded it

4789074
uefi	acpi
for extra complexity it s possible to include a lot more in this predefined state address of acpi tables description of preconfigured video mode etc so that it s possible to write boot loaders for other types of systems and the kernel won t need to care if it booted from pc bios or uefi or openfirmware or whatever else

4789090
subclass	abstract-class
since wicket makes heavy use of serialization the wicket designers decided that simple object identity would not be reliable and so made metadatakey an abstract-class forcing you to create a subclass for each key and then check to see if the key is an instance of subclass from the wicket source code

implementation can be seen here where by the radio button and checkbox should load in the appropriate products

4789188
serializable	deserialization
if i had to guess i d say that as references are basically fancy pointers their value isn t necessarily guaranteed to be retained through serializable deserialization and a clever way to simulate a unique object id is with whatever the java compiler chooses to call a particular anonymous subclass

4789225
cdr	cons
and if you re bothered by the append showing there you could replace it with your own using cons cdr car

4789248

4789717
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	inherited	subclassing
the pushed view controller will automatically inherited super s the view controller that s pushing it navigation bar which means you can make calls on self.navigationcontroller in the child view controller since uinavigationcontroller is simply a subclassing of uiviewcontroller and so is uitableviewcontroller

4790053
inherited	properties
this is because the for-in statement enumerates object properties included the inherited ones

4790055
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
this is why you never use in javascript the for...in loops iterates over all the properties in the object and an arrays is just an object in js you added a new property to all instances of arrays so it appears as one of the indexes in the for-loop

temp	tmp
certain applications will allow you to specify where their temporary files are put such as with the tmp temp or tmpdir environment variables but a lot of stuff would break under unix if tmp didn t exist so it s safe just to use that

temp	tmp
which outputs in my cygwin environment i have both temp and tmp set to this value

4790575
uiview	subviews
some may suggest serializing the uiview and then deserializing a copy but it s unlikely that the subviews will implement nscoder the media player and uiimages certainly don t making this usually a non-starter

min and max until c++0x because the return type had to be declared by hand mixed min and max as inlined functions would have been nightmarish while a simple macro did it in the blink of an eye

4791083
subclass	abstract-class
if you have a class that depends directly on your abstract-class you cannot test it without writing a subclass that can be instantiated in your unit tests

post	get
i have a sinatra app setup where most of the logic is performed inside of various classes and the post get routes instantiate those classes and call their methods

put	get
my suggestion would be to keep your current myconfig class but load your xml from your database in the constructor then in each property of your myconfig you can put in logic to determine where you get the value from either database or .config file if you need to pull config from either location or have it fall back if the value is empty

4796948
children	parent
any children tables which need to point to a parent point to this pseudo index table

4796949
width	height
the way this works is...first you calculate the document width and height then you calculate the div width and height and then you subtract the div width from the document width and the div height from the document height and consider that the pixel range you re willing to put the div in so it doesn t overflow out of the document

4796960

but i m having trouble with this because mouseenter and mouseleave get messed up by having the info box as the top element

4797498
mouseleave	mouseenter
i then apply the mouseenter and mouseleave events to these divs instead

quicksand	galleriffic
however it seems as though quicksand screws up the data array which causes galleriffic to not see any elements aka the images on the second call

4797936
quicksand	galleriffic
now i looked into the code for removeimagebyindex and it seems that galleriffic keeps a cache of information about the images it uses which does not get updated when .remove gets called by quicksand

4797936
quicksand	galleriffic
quicksand removes the images incorrectly and galleriffic doesn t get updated to the changes

4797936
quicksand	galleriffic
well one option would be to try and rewrite the removal and addition parts of your quicksand script to be aware of galleriffic

4797961
int	chars
to order ascending by the last chars interpreted as an int you could do

4797961
int	chars
with the clarification in your comment - int following a space chars can be more than one digit

4798015
int	chars
assuming you want more than single digit int and that you have a separation chars between the filename and the rest we ll call it splitchar which can be any chars at all

4798015
int	chars
will get you a sequence of strings in order of the int value of the last grouping separated by the split chars

4798133
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
you need to use an nscalendar object to convert nsdatecomponents to an nsdate

4798147
put	get
the only real solution seems to be putting the get or put calls inside of a synchronized code block which in theory ensures that only one thread at a time is accessing your entities

4798429
width	height
the button height is higher than it s width go to step 2

4798429
width	height
if the button contents width is higher than it s height then the binding will force it s width lower

4798443
width	height
i read somewhere that offered no examples that i could resize original image while maintaining aspect ratio to correct height or width whichever allows the image to be largest then divide the other param h or w by 2 and then make add border based on that then crop to size

4798452
int	chars
in c or c++ a chars is simply a one-byte int though one byte may or may not be 8 bits

what is really freakin strange though is that on linux both firefox and google-chrome will post with r n and doing a document.getelementbyid text-area-id .value will always show only n

4798894
post	get
you are passing in the parameters with the url which is for get not the right way for post
