minitest loads faster than rspec it s about 4 files of code compared to rspec having many files spread across 3 gems --but note that rspec is by no means slow

12480737
rspec	minitest
rails and i think minitest and rspec are both fine choices depending on your needs

the applist needs to put a pseudo on its slider so you can get into trouble if youÃ¢ re reusing a component which didnÃ¢ t give psuedos to everything you needed to style css is powerful so it brings great power to mess things up so i donÃ¢ t think components will typically expose a lot of pseudo ids.

12487675
put	get
in the former case the word is put in the register but then the word can get shifted bit wise and the other bits can be zeroed out by using logic and operation

i assume you understand the primitives cons car and cdr as they are implemented in scheme already but just to remind you cons constructs a pair car selects the first component of the pair and returns it and cdr selects the second component and returns it

12496867
cdr	cons
the version of cons car and cdr that you ve pasted should behave exactly the same way

12496867
cdr	cons
first of all car and cdr are not defined within the scope of cons

12496867
cdr	cons
in your snippet of code all three cons car and cdr are defined at the top-level

12496867
cdr	cons
if you were to execute the same repl session i had above with these new cons car and cdr functions the argument z in car will be bound to the function-based pair which is what cons returns which is dispatch

12496867
cdr	cons
if you follow this same logic for cdr you ll see that it behaves almost the same way but returns the second argument to cons y which is the second component of the pair

12496907

in nhibernate how can i get a list of children with their parent name using only one call to db

cdr	cons
the code in the question shows how to redefine the primitive procedure cons that creates a cons-cell a pair of two elements the car and the cdr using only closures and message-dispatching

12496921
cdr	cons
likewise if 1 is received then the second argument of cons is returned the cdr of the cell

12497048
shadowing	named
it can be confusing since as you ve found local variables can have the same named as fields - when they do it s called shadowing and it s the local variable that s referenced by default for the remainder of that method rather than the field

12497048
getter	setter
if you do need other classes to change the state of the field then you can then do that in a more controlled manner by way of getter setter methods

maven	pom.xml	prepare	execute
the problem now is if i execute the maven goal release prepare the variable will be interpolated with the current user which is fine generally but when the execution is over i end up with a pom.xml file where not only the versionstring is updated which is fine too but also the variable stays replaced with the current user

12497257
maven	pom.xml
so my question is why the variable interpolation in maven doesn t work just on runtime but lets the pom.xml file variable declarations unchanged so that the only change would be the versionstring in this usecase

12515819
width	height
i am trying to place an svg text-element according to the width and height of the text by getting the bounding box using the getbbox method

12515819
firefox	safari
if the text is using a websafe font this works reasonably well across different browsers but if the text is styled using font-face and a custom webfont then the width of the text is returned incorrectly in firefox mac and safari ios

12515819
google-chrome	safari
it works perfectly in both safari mac and google-chrome mac

12515820
children	parent
i am trying to get all the children of a given parent entity efficiently

12515912

japplet	jdialog
if i close the jdialog then japplet is also starting to behave like this

12515913
google-chrome	firefox
this is an internal application so i can tell people to use firefox or google-chrome if i need to

12515936

so since i ve been unable to find a way to resolve our dependency issues by including everything from external sources i ve turned to eclipse ivyde for ant ivy integration

12515944

this leads to the next problem is greedy so it matches with regexoptions.singleline until the end of the string and then backtracking until the last it finds in order to allow a successful match

12515992
google-chrome	firefox
now the border of the fieldset crosses over the legend in ie8+ firefox google-chrome but looks fine in ie7

12516021
google-chrome	firefox
actually this works perfectly fine on firefox and google-chrome it behaves just like what it exactly behaves on the sample given here i just merely copied and modified it according to what i wanted

12516044
hash	md5
but the md5 hash value generated for both files are coming different

12516059
mktime	strtotime
i want to know because from my reading of the documentation mktime should create a timestamp just as valid as say strtotime or datetime

12516073
pop-up	dialog
i can turn off jquery mobile s link handling by setting but this prevents all ajax navigation - you lose the nice transitions and pop-up dialog don t just work anymore you have to do them manually

12516108
width	height
its a bool value so if the maximum of width or height is greater than real width then you get true

12516113
versioning	upgrade
i cannot upgrade to the latest versioning right now because there are some customizations we did on the versioning 3.1 plugin code

12516123
hide	show
the questions should hide show based on the selected value of the drop down

12516127
width	height
in other words if either maxwidth is greater than the width of or maxheight is greater than the height of it will return true

12516143
width	height
in that particular example the code is checking if the biggest child dimension exceeds the parent dimension the dimensions being width and height

12516153
children	parent
this keeps the current structure in place of 1 parent many children

12516153
inherited	properties
b i could change the exisiting parent master pom in to a grandparent and inherited the master pom into a new parent pom adding the properties reading jboss deploying facilities to this new parent

12516173
google-chrome	firefox
which works great on google-chrome but then firefox gives an error dta.data in undefined

12516182
getter	setter
getter and setter in my location.java

12516216
move	drag
now the problem i have is when i drag and move the window dom elements will shake

12516264
oncreate	onstart
also when you are in oncreate the activity is not yet created where as in onstart is it

12516292
width	height
the width and height that are given by wpf do not match the actual width and height of the control

12516292
actualheight	actualwidth
when snooping the incorrect values show for the actualwidth and actualheight of the control as well

12516292
actualheight	actualwidth
even further when i snoop the main window which is maximized i get an actualwidth of 1550 and and actualheight of 840 but my screen resolution is 1920x1080

12516292
actualheight	actualwidth
as you can see snoop is saying that the actualwidth and actualheight of the windowsformshost is 486x336

12516311
uiwebview	nsurlprotocol
the application stores encrypted images on disk which are then requested by the uiwebview decrypted on the fly via an nsurlprotocol and then displayed in the application

12516311
profiling	instrumentation
profiling the application using instrumentation we see our real memory is 55mb however our virtual memory is 800 mb which seems quite high

12516322
mouseover	mouseout
gives you the current element which in your case is the on that fired the specified event mouseover mouseout

12516322
hide	show
the rest is simply using the data- elements and show and hide which are pretty obvious

12516472
width	height
the components are added by the user and the user determines the width and height

12516497
put	get
im trying to get it into one array so i can then out put the data - its important that the data stays together but different id s are selerate from each other

12516501
width	height
i tried taking away the height and putting the width at 100 but then it wasn t remedied and it almost made it worst

12516503
int	chars
cakephp only natively supports using int or chars 36 primary keys

12516504
tunnel	vpn
i need to detect if the browser can access server b is in the office or tunnel via vpn so i can decide if i display download the local files on server b or the files on the web server a

12516531
width	margin
but i need to set both the width and margin as a percentage if possible the end result is a sort of timeline where dynamic elements need to be positioned and stretched based on their duration

12516623
int	chars
7.19.1.6.8 -- c if no l length modifier is present the int argument is converted to an unsigned chars and the resulting chars is written

12516645
prepare	execute
this is because prepare and execute with array argument thinks your datas are string by default

12516667
httpresponse	request
however it blows up at this point because the request to the server is asynchronous and apparently you can t put a binary in the httpresponse during an asynchronous request

12516670
width	height
to find the main windows inner stage height and width you can use the stage.nativewindow.stage references stageheight and stagewidth properties which gives inner width

12516731
folder	directory
you have -1 yourself so infact you have actually caused it to -2 from the folder directory

12516732
for-loop	arrays
i tried to add an arrays of textviews which i defined as a public variable but when i run the application it force closes as soon as it gets into for-loop

12516733
content-length	content-type
in the case the params is not in the query string the response is not sent i receive a huge html file indicating an error at the line 401 content-type text plain content-length body.length.to_s unauthorized but i cannot figure out what is wrong

12516772
jar	manifest.mf
osgi bundle is a jar file with some special meta-information in its manifest.mf file

12516775
post	put
when i put post xml to that uri it would show up correctly in request.xml but it would never show up in the params object

12516797
rss	feed
for example reading an rss feed would use below classes

12516803
printf	fgets
i assume you don t need me to give the example of getting a response code i m sure curl would give it to you but it s probably overkill to use curl being that you do not require it s threading capabilities i would fsockopen port 80 printf get http 1.0 n n fgets the first line and close the connection .

12516852
udp	tcp
you will either have to try firewall-traversal techniques which will usually be successful with udp but not with tcp or have a helper that isn t behind a firewall which could be the same as the registration server or something else carry all the data between the devices that wish to communicate

12516857
width	height
fires too often everytime i replace the element so i m not using that to recalculate the width and height

12516861
inherited	properties
the point is to make sure that key is a properties defined directly on myhash and not one that was inherited through a prototype chain

12516861
inherited	properties
using in doesn t automatically filter out inherited properties so you get to do it yourself

12516883
inherited	properties
it may be more to the point if myhash is a new instance of an object with enumerable properties so that methods and other inherited properties will not be listed

12516897
inherited	properties
in that particular case there s no difference but if myhash had inherited properties then those would be looped over too without the hasownproperty check

12516924
oncreate	setcontentview	oncreate	findviewbyid	setcontentview	findviewbyid
you typically initialize those in your oncreate some time after setcontentview by calling findviewbyid with the relevant control id

12516962
implements	extends
and that extends x and implements y

12517046
spaces	delimiter
split each line on the empty spaces delimiter

12517064
try-catch	exception-handling
you want to be careful because this will probably throw an exception-handling if there are 0 nodes in your treeview so it would be a good idea to place it in a try-catch block

12517076
google-chrome	firefox
however on firefox its all fine where as on google-chrome and ie there is a small white space between the bottom of the image and the top of the positioned background image

12517136
prepare	execute
i have tried using regular boiler plate jdbc also create connection prepare statement execute statement retrieve data from result_set etc and i found that the vast majority of time was spent looping over the result_set and extracting the data out of it and into some pojos

12517148
switching	accessory
i have a table with four rows each having a title and switching as an accessory

12517164
free	malloc
it would be easy to modify the code to use malloc and free instead

12517223
viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
whatever you do on viewdidload doing it in viewwillappear or viewdidappear will give you the result you want

12517237
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
since you are going back in the stack you would want to have the code that you want to trigger in viewwillappear or viewdidappear which is executed when popping from one viewcontroller to the one below it

12517297
post	get
now what should happen is when i click on delete link - it should post get whatever - as i use _request on listener script to php script that will get the id of publisher and delete it from db..

12517298
min	max
the tricky part is getting only one row for each client with the min max values and then the other columns that go along with those min max values

12517303
put	get
put the code you want to run when you get back to it

12517305
mouse	keyboard
i did not want to use moc and with a lot of fiddling i was able to get just enough callbacks such as keyboard mouse paint timer etc... to make a usable submission

12517336
innodb	myisam
if you use insert and update high performance uses innodb over myisam is better

12517336
consistency	acid
the innodb has support with acid atomicity consistency isolation and durability therefore the more select and join is slower but is faster for insert

12517338
openbsd	freebsd
libexecinfo freebsd and openbsd only. required by v8

12517375
children	parent
my code where #div is the parent and children are the elements with the id s i want to gather

12517377
min	max
in the case there are multiple rows for some min or max value for same client i have given you the earliest date that they appear

12517388
int	chars
if chars is used as an int type then it might make sense to specify signedness explicitly but not when it is used for textual chars

12517406
children	parent
your query will get all car entities which are children of given parent entity

12517414
post	get
in the page class i have a method to get the page s post for a specific date and author it looks like that

12517469
sorting	filtering
usually index pages have options for filtering page sorting

12517519
stdout	stderr
but then now both stdout stderr from cmd are coming on stdout

12517519
stdout	stderr
so combined_output contains the both with order preserved but the command-expecting-stdout only gets stdout and command-expecting-stderr only gets stderr

12517519
stdout	stderr
basically i want to log stdout+stderr while still allowing stdout and stderr to be separately redirected and piped

12517851
serializable	deserialization
you can also try hardcode some tracking into entity itself and record which properties were set during deserialization but it is dependent on serializable if it will work or not because if deserialization sets these values as well it will be useless

12517869
folder	directory
the build.scala file goes into your project directory which you should create in the project root folder

12517894

i have a div element that has no defined width or height

12518185

opera has the same behavior as firefox

12518297
getter	setter
all properties private use getter setter

12518307
automake	autotools
i m trying to build a library from autotools automake libtool

12518335
jobs	cron
if webfaction supports cron jobs you can create your own pseudo broker

12518343

you can use this way to read string without spaces delimiter

12518929
hide	show
edit additionally i could handle even setting a flag on the individual form submission marking it as approved rejected and just handling the show hide logic in my code

12518946
portrait	landscape
anytime orientation changed from landscape to portrait the whole body element would be shifted almost halfway to the left when it should be 100 width

12518968
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
make sure you set -webkit-keyframes -moz-keyframes -o-keyframes and -webkit-animation -moz-animation -o-animation the same to cover firefox safari and google-chrome

12518972
implements	extends
i know that you can implements as many interfaces you want to in java but can only extends one other class

12518975
junit	testng
go with junit params or testng which offer much more convenient solution

12518995
getter	setter
maybe it s good idea consider create some class property like parameters and then create setter and getter for this and use it in this way

12518996
getter	setter
if you really want it to be non-editable i do not recommend doing this you could use getter and setter

12519002
mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseleave	mouseenter
note that we use jquery s mouseenter and mouseleave events instead of mouseover and mouseout

a strange aside to this is the fact that the desktop version of safari handles the web app just fine as well as an install of google-chrome on the ipad had no troubles accessing the site on off line while the mobile versions of it do not

12519210
google-chrome	safari
updated thoughts v2 seems that this issue is safari specific as i have the web app running online offline with google-chrome for the apple products iphone ipad

12519352
hive	hdfs
i am trying to take advantage of map reduce to format and clean up the data in hdfs using my java formatter and then load the output in hive

12519353
vim	emacs
if you aren t familiar with vim or emacs i recommend nano since it s usable by mere mortals

12519408
x86	64bit
now the only solution i have found for profiling unit test is to attach the profiler to a process called vstest.executionengine.x86.exe x86 for me but this could be different for 64bit

12519416
client-side	server-side
hmm...you first need to distinguish between client-side execution javascript and server-side execution asp.net

12519451
multiplying	add
you are basically using seconds but its milliseconds so you want to multiplying by 1000 or just add three zeroes like this

12519482
libstdc++	libc++
from the looks of it you are not using llvm s libc++ but gcc s libstdc++

12519490
pull	push
on my local machine i can pull from the remote repository but not push

12519504
crypt	salt
the salt prefix read the docs is what instructs crypt to use blowfish

12519527
salt	md5
md5 sha1 + unique salt best way

12519586
webkit	gecko
it gives a good idea of how gecko webkit and other major rendering engines evolved and what led to the current state of messed up user-agent strings

12519586
google-chrome	safari
and then google built google-chrome and google-chrome used webkit and it was like safari and wanted pages built for safari and so pretended to be safari

12519586
google-chrome	safari	webkit	gecko
and thus google-chrome used webkit and pretended to be safari and webkit pretended to be khtml and khtml pretended to be gecko and all browsers pretended to be mozilla and google-chrome called itself mozilla 5.0 windows

12519586
google-chrome	safari
en-us applewebkit 525.13 khtml like gecko google-chrome 0.2.149.27 safari 525.13 and the user agent string was a complete mess and near useless and everyone pretended to be everyone else and confusion abounded

12519595
getter	setter
i have a form type which has a field that is not in the entity as a property but the entity has a getter and a setter with the same name as form field explaining

12519595
getter	setter
so i m expected that symfony2 call the getter and setter to bind and show the form field but i get this error

12519604
google-chrome	safari
while in google-chrome and safari if i try to login a few times with unexisting username and password i can access setup

12519618

ubuntu	debian
use system-wide installations of packages the debian ubuntu binary for r incl the cran ports will try to use usr local lib r site-library which users can install too if added to group owning the directory

ubuntu	debian
for the same reason the debian ubuntu package offers softlinks in etc r

12519706
jmenubar	jmenuitem
then i add a canvas3d object to its contentpane and right afterwards i add a jmenubar with a few jmenus and a couple jmenuitem each

12519741
hash	hmac
i think it would be very comfortable to use the user s password hash as the secret for generating a hmac

12519748
hash	md5
most hash algorithms like sha-1 and md5 or even sha-256 are designed to be fast but this makes it an easy target for brute force attacks

12519748
hash	md5
an off-the-shelf gpu is able to calculate about 8 giga md5 hash per second

12519748
hash	md5
it is not for high security sites only and using it can be as easy as using an md5 hash

12519810
eurekalog	madexcept
recommend that they invest in an exception handling package like madexcept or eurekalog that will give them a stack trace in a readable format that you can send them so they can use it to track down the problem

12519815
textarea	textbox
if user is owner of a profile textarea have to be replaced by a label and an other label with textbox have to be added

btw a word is an unsigned short int and a sage_lvl0_packet is a 3-tiered structure with a total of 106 words

12519917
portrait	landscape
normally the cocos2d apps will start up in landscape mode but now with the updates it starts up in portrait mode and causes all of the objects on the layer to be reversed but somehow this has fixed itself

12519917
portrait	landscape
so now my project starts up in landscape mode on both the simulator and the ios device but all of the content on the screen is still in portrait mode

12519947
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
this means you need to subclass uinavigationcontroller or uitabbarcontroller if either is your root controller this seems bizarre to me but apple says jump

12519951
pop-up	dialog
also there is a dialog or joptionpane that pop-up when you try to do illegale rename in jfilechooser.

12519959
std	ostream
since is a free function overloaded for all ostream types it doesn t return a std stringstream it returns a std ostream like you say

12519985

i want to know if it s possible to put the - results at the beggining rather than at the end because in my app i treat 0 and - as the same thing and i have to get ordering getting this two datas together

12520073
google-chrome	firefox
zclip appears to work in firefox and google-chrome

12520123

use keyup instead of keydown

12520170
int	chars
there is one arry of chars and multiple arrays of int and floats

12520225
accord.net	aforge
i d strongly suggest taking a look at accord.net which requires aforge both are excellent

12520225
post	get
to get you started you should take a look at this blog post showing how to create decision trees using accord.net

12520272
for-loop	arrays
i m trying to do it using a for-loop with multiple counters but i don t know that the arrays lengths will always be as long or as short as required

12520320
rss	feed
i am a noob to android development and i am trying to display rss feed in a webview

12520334
post	get
if you want to display images using tags you ll need to make your action accept get requests instead of or in addition to post

12520347
post	get
if i get some answers on my own i will post them here so they can serve others

12520394
folder	directory
vs typically sets the current directory to the project folder which is usually not the same as the folder where the built binaries are

12520434
inherited	properties
i ve created my own class that inherited from combobox and have added the following properties to bind my data to pardon the auto-conversion from vb.net

12520435
width	height
if #adslot1 is 300px wide let s show slot_300 or rather the id 3456789012 along with its width and height in the adsense javascript

12520453
strcat	fputs
if you have too many you can use a for-loop then use strcpy and strcat to make the final buf which you can use in fputs

12520468
rss	feed
i have parsed a rss feed before and what i did was load it into a webview like this after i have parsed it

12520482

for example some treeview node or children of it children has a child that point to the parent node

12520508
width	height
width height slot

12520521
button	checkbox
you will need checkbox not radio button

12520540
screens	tablet
what i m not clear on is whether this applies just to touch screens like phones tablet or whether it extends to apple style touch pads the way ubuntu unity and os x use multitouch gestures on the touchpad

12520541
google-chrome	firefox
between ie google-chrome and firefox

12520572
mouseover	mouseout
what you want to do is to use separate mouseover mouseout events like so

12520572
mouseout	mousedown
the only problem with this solution is that if you move the mousedown to the image it momentarily slides back up because the mouseout event gets called on .hover

12520586
chunked	transfer-encoding
but it seems to be strange to send a message with transfer-encoding chunked which does not terminate with the the chunk style 0 r n

12520603
google-chrome	firefox
when i start the node server and point my browser to my url i get this from google-chrome and firefox

12520620
width	height
sometimes one or more images is missing and the previous images still is in the cache so i can t check if the new image was loaded checking for the width height properties

12520665
glut	glew
it is my understanding that glew and glut have been dropped from the latest sdks

12520694
post	get
however the link is doing a get instead of a post

12520724
google-chrome	firefox
i changed the name tags of each event element to the format mm dd yyyy updated the linking function to reflect this and everything seems to be working perfectly now across all tested browsers google-chrome ie 9 ie 9 firefox

12520825
google-chrome	firefox
which is working for firefox and google-chrome but does not work on internet explorer 9

12520842
integer	radix
which is deprecated if you use parseint frame.css margin-left 10 that should parse your string into the correct integer value using a radix of 10 decimal

12520849
post	get
also the form says post method whereas your ajax is get

12520895
put	get
create an element use the innerhtml method to put the html code in it then get the first child node from it to get the p element as a dom element

12520903
width	height
with respect to width and height in a rule the order is irrelevant but the order the rules appear in can matter as does the specificity of the rule

12520917
width	margin
bumps the submenus over to the right of the main menus. however i don t know of a way offhand to easily make this work for dynamic-width submenus so you ll either have to set the width explicitly as in the rule below or detect it via javascript and set the negative margin that way or find someone who s better at css than i am

12520982
ubuntu	linux
copy the code to our new linux ubuntu server and go through the code to make the changes necessary to get it to run on the linux box

12520982
pull	push
when i performed a git push origin master i was thrown an error stating that i must perform a pull first

12520982

12521071
multiplying	multiplication
i have not needed it lately but back when coding pascal i used it to multiplying or divide whenever the divisor or multiplication was a power of 2

12521073

you could have the producers importers run in one or several threads and put their messages in a queue and have the exporters run in one or several other threads and get their messages from the queue

12521136
ubuntu	linux
but when i put it on my server ubuntu linux apache2 php 5 imagepng outputs a black box

gridview	linqdatasource
im trying to make my first linq connection to a gridview im not using linqdatasource and i get the records fine to my gridview

12521237
versioning	upgrade
you will either restrict armv6 users or armv7s users - the choice seems obvious to me but to be safe i would recommend branching your armv7 and up versioning as a new project v2 perhaps so users of the old library can continue using it safely until they are able to upgrade their projects

12521247
folder	directory
i finally remembered that the .sbt directory on windows is in the folder

12521289
width	height
it looks like your code prevents skewing the image by locking the height to width ratio

12521289
width	height
if you want the image to get skewed you can simplify the code a lot by simply making the height equal the window height and the width equal the window width

12521319
memcpy	strcpy
the easiest way to convert ascii to utf-8 is strcpy or memcpy .

12521378
int	chars	int	double
you cannot switch over a string instance only int and byte chars short but not long double unless you have java7+

12521389
int	chars
in java you can only do a switch on byte chars short or int and not a string

12521398
int	chars
prior to java 7 only int compatible types short byte int chars can be passed as switch arguments

12521455
post	get
post java 7 a great way to set up loggers which need or prefer static references to the enclosing class is to use the newly introduced methodhandles api to get the runtime class in a static context

12521464
post	get
it looks from your snippet like you are really just using the thread as a timer and you might get better performance out of using a handler to post your runnable on a timed interval which would also allow you to call your audio transition methods on the main thread instead

12521499
put	get	post	get	post	put
with the above cross-domain get and post requests work fine but put and delete requests both fail

12521521
margin	letter-spacing
manually tuning spacing by letter-spacing or margin properties is troublesome and risky

12521566
put	get
just like you can t put the meat back into one single piece once you ve grinded it through the meat mincer -- you can t get back the original pdf objects vector drawings fonts etc. once you ve rasterized its pages like imagemagick does..

uiview	subviews
apple docs say to use the layoutsubviews method of uiview to position a super view s subviews

nsmutablestring inherits from nsstring but

12529322
nsmutablestring	nsstring
but an nsmutablestring is not an nsstring

12529322
nsmutablestring	nsstring
but an nsmutablestring can change and nsstring cannot change at all - no nsstring whatsoever can change

12529322
nsmutablestring	nsstring
update some answer will say nsmutablestring can do all things that nsstring can therefore nsmutablestring inherits from nsstring

12529449
for-loop	loops
we have two loops the outer while loops and the inner for-loop

12529478
nsmutablestring	nsstring
but an nsmutablestring is not an nsstring

12529478
nsmutablestring	nsstring
nsmutablestring is an nsstring because it can do whatever nsstring can

12529478
nsmutablestring	nsstring
all-in all the reason is that nsmutablestring is able to do more things than nsstring and can do anything nsstring can hence the direction of inheritance

12529504
width	margin
by removing the float from the .inner div and by not specifying width the the width is dynamic it lets you use padding and margin freely

12529507
inherited	properties
regarding your example of stones and cats of the only characteristic of a stone is that it stands still and the only characteristics of a cat is that it stand still or it can move for suitable definitions of these properties it makes perfect sense to have a cat inherited from a stone

i try to retrieve some information x y width height and title for all opened window on windows with a simple c++ code see below

12529571

12529574
hash	salt
i m taking the sha1 hash of password as a salt parameter to rfc2898derivebytes

12529574
hash	salt
purpose of salt is to make generation of rainbow tables impossible - you can t pre-generate the hash of p w0rd because it will have a different hash for each possible salt value

12529629
width	height
like where you can set the display width and height and the other tabs they are all missing from the window now

12529630
config	ini

using the hash as salt is a bad idea because password x will always be salt with the same value y again defeating its purpose

12530083
put	get
keep in mind that if you want to get exact primary field you need to put table_name and table_schema into the condition

12530092
nsmutablestring	nsstring
an nsmutablestring object knows all this but additionally knows how to alter that stored string so it makes perfect sense to say nsmutablestring extends nsstring

12530092
nsmutablestring	nsstring
nsstring is more general as it leaves you the oppertunity to create another subclass of it that could add the altering functionality without using the nsmutablestring s implementation why ever you would want that to do

12530128
put	get
seem very sensitive if i put lossy false i get an indefinite hang.

12530140

12530147
hash	salt
a salt should be unique for each password that means create a random password for every password you want to hash

12530147
rainbowtable	salt
the idea of the salt is that an attacker cannot use a prebuilt rainbowtable to get the passwords

12530224
put	get
now you haw to get unselected user id form somewhere else which you can put into the else condition

12530269
post	get
second you would want to look in the request.form for post or request.querystring for get collections for your data since they would not be bound to controls

12530276
dynamic-languages	compiled-language
although it was said that ioc framework is not needed to dynamic-languages such as obj-c but people often missed one of the core feature - wiring of class at runtime . they are important for compiled-language such as obj-c

12530326
hide	show
in their methods i not only do the things that stand for that button but also hide show them

12530326

what is wrong with normal https ssl connection in internet banking

12530442
udp	tcp
websockets although they appear to be the new hammer for all programmers to abuse at the moment it makes total sense to use in multiplayer games there are many solution out there currently using the tcp protocol though it would be more beneficial to use udp

12530442
udp	tcp
udp is really faster than tcp and the simple reason is because it s non-existent acknowledge packet ack that permits a continuous packet stream instead of tcp that acknowledges a set of packets calculatd by using the tcp window size and round-trip time rtt .

12530455
client-side	server-side
your code does not work because you re trying to mix a server-side language php with a client-side language js

12530495
width	height
the problem i am having is that the intrinsic height of the label is alway calculated with the original width of the label the one set in interface builder and not the width of the label that is set from the constraints i have on it

if the width of the label in interface builder the literal size in interface builder is greater than the width of the view at runtime then the height of the container is too small and lines of text get cut off

12530495
width	height
what appears to be happening is that although there is no constraint on the labels width the label seems to calculate its height and thus the autolayout calculated height of the container based on the original width of the label when it was created

12530495
width	height
however whats so strange is that the text appears to be the correct width and height but the label itself has a frame thats just too big or small

children	parent
the problem is that while the parent sprite gives me all the information bounding box scale rotation etc. as it currently is the child sprites stay with their original numbers despite being transformed together with the parent and i cannot figure out the correct way to calculate the real dimensions for the children

12532955
children	parent
so to summarize in order to check whether a touch hit a child sprite i need to calculate the current bounding box of the children based on the parent s transformations

you re drawing a histogram that has a width and height in pixels

12536241
width	height
for example let s say your histogram is 500 pixels in width and 300 pixels in height

12536241
width	height
for each data point you calculate the width and height in pixels from the x and y value of the data point

i would post images of what the page looks like in ie firefox and google-chrome but as a spam prevention mechanism new users aren t allowed to post images.

12536544
subtract	add
perhaps add an extra second here or subtract one from the php side just in case but in all likelihood users will always be at least 20 seconds past the start time by the time the js timer ends due to the network time and page rendering

12536562
onfocus	onblur
one method would be to use onfocus onblur but that has limited effectiveness since most of the computers where this is deployed are dual-monitor machines and they often will keep the dashboard open on one screen while using the clinical information system on the other screen

12536570

google-chrome	firefox
but the weird fact is that the code runs slowly in google-chrome but works very well in firefox

12536747
client-side	server-side
to trigger php code from javascript you would have to make an ajax call to a server-side php script to invoke php since js is client-side and php is server-side

12537183
google-chrome	firefox
i m working on a small website but of course ie doesn t view it the same as google-chrome or firefox do

12537225
min	max
as given in the documentation the event object contains the new min and max values as event.min and event.max and this represents the axis inside the handler

12537298
onfocus	onblur
otherwise as you said you will need to use a hack with onfocus onblur

12537298
onfocus	onblur
it will use the onblur onfocus hack if the browser does not support the page visibility api

12537315
try-catch	exception-handling
jon hanna correctly explains why we have such a try-catch and why the exception-handling is being thrown

12537315

12537584
width	height
just use chooser.setpreferredsize new dimension int width int height

12537602
int	boolean
so this is my question i wanna make a function that takes a list and and int it then recursively moves through the list and if it finds an element in the list equal to the int then it should return the entire list with the element removed and a boolean indicating wether something was removed

12537623
equals	gethashcode
this is why a hash based structure dictionary can t rely entirely on gethashcode it also needs a sensible equals implementation to be effective

12537623
equals	gethashcode
of course it s also possible that the creator of the class overwrite either gethashcode or equals and in some way made a mistake that in some way violated the contract for generating hash codes

12537743
int	chars
the + operator of integral types int short chars and byte always returns an int as result

12537886
qgraphicsitem	qobject
if you have many qgraphicsitems that can share a single qobject then this will be lighterweight than having each qgraphicsitem inherit qobject

12537889
implements	extends
each bean must extends that class and implements abstract methods of course

12537891
children	parent
floated elements are removed from the normal flow of block level elements on the page so and adding the overflow attribute makes the height of the parent include the children as if they weren t floated

12537919

if you re going to be working with javascript be sure to use firebug in firefox or google-chrome s developer tools - they re brilliant for stepping through the javascript and monitoring requests to see what s happening

12538695
put	get
my guess is that when you get the additional checking put in to accept logins and display a logged in message when a user is logged in everything will work as expected

12538718

i have to write functions to perform binary subtraction multiplication and division without using any arithmetic operators except for-loop control

12538780
subtract	add
you already have if i 2 0 - which is the case where it s even - and you want to either add or subtract based on whether the current i is odd or even

12538780
subtract	add
so keep a running tally add or subtract in each loop iteration as appropriate and print the tally at the end

memory barriers are not required on a single processors i m not sure if hyperthreading counts as multiple processors but compiler barriers are - the compiler could re-order the code in different threads such that you fail

12538843
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
if everything works excellently in firefox run the same tests in google-chrome safari and ie on windows and mac.

12538885
min	max
and similarly for the min max part

12538905
subtraction	addition
you can do it by first setting up addition with bit-wise only then using that you can do subtraction

12538905
division	multiplication
afterwards multiplication and division get more complicated but can be done

12538905

12538917
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
now works in firefox google-chrome and safari

12538919
subtraction	addition
once you have the addition you ll be able to implement subtraction by 1 complementing and adding 1

12539088
hash	salt
the thread barnyr posted shows it simply hash the concatenated salt and password but with a few twists

12539088

width	height
when setting transition-property to all it looks bad when zooming inside the browser window because width and height properties are also being transitioned

12539571
org.json	jackson
this would be jackson s equivalent of your current org.json code

12539571
org.json	jackson
however where jackson really excels is in its capacity to do complex mappings between your java classes pojos and their json representation as well as its streaming api which allows you to do really fast serialization at least when compared with org.json s counterparts

12539622
getter	setter
rather than returning a jsonobject you can either return a map or a java bean with message property that has getter and setter for it

12540569
children	parent
then the parent div which although ignores the floated children doesn t ignore this pseudo element - acting as it should it expands to contain the pseudo element

12540569
children	parent
now since the pseudo-element is below all of the floated children the parent div happens or better yet seems to contain the floated children as well - which is really what you want

12540590
children	parent
when you use floats the parent doesn t adapt to the height of the children

the best way is to create a table that separates them the values into two columns width and height

12541291
width	height
also ordering by width and height separatelly is much more eficient and produces the desired result

12541303
daemons	systemd

you can learn the difference between acl and rbac here

12541891
int	chars
in c s expressions all chars are implicitly converted to int first

12541891
int	chars
when chars arguments are passed to variadic functions like printf they are also implicitly converted to int

12541891
int	chars
however what i m seeing is that explodestr is missing a return statement returning a chars which is coincidentally an int

12541895
int	chars
btw if you know that all lines start with a word without spaces then some spacing chars like space tab return newline ... then some int you could declare

but when i am changing the device orientation portrait to landscape then it is not looking perfect

12542233
width	height
check what is that height same is the concept with the width

12542252
public	protected
by convention classes that implement this interface should override object.clone which is protected with a public method

google-chrome	firefox
firefox handles this better than google-chrome does but neither exactly the way i want

12542339
free	malloc
only free an object that has been allocated by malloc

12542342
free	malloc
because you called free on a variable not allocated with malloc

12542343
free	malloc
it means it can literally can do anything including crashing running seemingly fine making daemons fly out of your nose etc. you can only free a pointer that you acquired using malloc

weka	liblinear
you might also want to take a look at lib svm or liblinear you may need to install them if they are not in weka natively

12542655
width	height
the previous approach is not really the good one where you can use only one image and use the advantage of the stretchableimagewithleftcapwidth topcapheight according with a setautoresizingmask uiviewautoresizingflexibleleftmargin of an uiimage allowing to stretch an image by its width and or height without stretching all angles.

12542826
cfstring	nsstring
your filters variable is an nsstring cfstring at the time you call objectatindex - not an array as you would assume

12542835
cos	sin
of course the concept of function is so immense my teacher limited it to basic functions which are composed of continuous basic subfunctions such as sin cos log exponent square root.

12542852
for-loop	loops
the while loops is arguably a bit more readable but people mileage may vary... so i would probably use it if the list was only iterated over once and use the more concise for-loop otherwise

12542893

views size is 1280x696 because of android tablet status bar at bottom with soft keys time etc.. screens resolution is 1280x800 but ontouchlistener is receiving touch events with coords 646.0 739.0 and thus my gluunproject method fails to return correct values

goto profile - api access - grant api permission - input the api caller example may6_1307031077_biz_api1.paypal.com in third party permission username textbos and click lookup button - enable checkbox for issue a refund for a specific transaction and click add button

12542987
width	height
i don t have a link for now unfortunately but the first issue is that occasionally images are stretched without keeping aspect ratio - the images have their height and width defined in the tag then in the css file their width is set to be a little smaller than that

for java ee 5 you have to install jax-rs separately but jax-ws is already there

12543091

portrait	landscape
since this problem also occurs on iphone with ios 6.0 so it might not be related to uisplitview portrait mode. although uisplitview landscape mode is fine

so i focus on the toolbar show hide of uinavigationcontroller and this thread toolbar in navigation controller solved my problem

children	parent
so if panel1a panel1b and panel1c will all appear inside panel1 then panel1 is a your best bet for parent as it is the closest to those children

12549354
free	malloc
i think this is often true with malloc d heap data because you can waste a lot on overhead by calling malloc and free within the loop

12550085
for-loop	loops
i have a for-loop statement that doesn t loops here s my code

12550105

you could also write the function once outside of the for-loop instead of re-declaring it every time loops runs

the explain plans are different a single min or max will produce a index full scan min max whereas when the two are present you will get an index full scan or a fast full index scan

12566879
min	max
when you see index full scan min max in an explain plan that is the result of an optimization that uses the fact that since the entries are sorted you can stop after having read the first one if you are only interested by the min

12566879
min	max
as of now a full index scan has only one direction either forward or backward and can not start from both ends simultaneously this is why when you ask for both the min and the max you get a less efficient access method

12566879
min	max
as suggested by other answers if the query needs critical efficiency you could run your own optimization by searching for the min and the max in two distinct queries

then game.player can use the getter setter methods on its instance of game.main to access those variables

12570044
post	get
i just send the json via post and get the contents

12570220
width	height
i already have the custom view making the background and borders but if i make width fill_parent and height wrap_content it will appear on the top of the screen and if i put height to fill_parent the entire screen will be filled with the background which i kinda knew it would happen

12570251
entities	entitymanager
i need to know if it s possible to add some attributes and behaviours to some pojo jpa entity using hibernate provider by extending it and then to make entitymanager to return extended objects instead of just pojo entities like the following examples

12570251
getter	setter
the other possible way i m assessing is extending funcionality with a composite entity and delegating all setter and getter but this could mean a lot of work with huge tables

12570260
pop-up	dialog
i actually hide the page when i pop-up the dialog

12570278

12570378
int	double
looking at your code snippet the problem might be that you read it directly as a float int double thus entering a whitespace stops the nextfloat rather read the input as a string using nextline delete the white spaces then attempt to convert it to the appropriate format

12570398
inherited	properties
this normally happens when the code behind file name and inherited properties on the page directive don t match.both should match

12570447
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
runtimeexception is unchecked-exception

12570490
getter	setter
thus you can use them as private and define functions working as getter setter for example

12570493
folder	directory
moving the downloads folder from inside applications to the root directory solved the issue

12570513
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
if you keep the upgrade code the same between versioning but change the product code then the previous versioning will be uninstalled automatically during the installation of the new versioning

12570523
width	height
this assumes your not using the autosize property of the textfield and are explicitly settings the width height

12570546

i have this method set up to accept a fractions only there is another method which accepts and returns the whole number and it will return the result converted from base r to base 10

12570647
inherited	properties
you could also use this to inherited from a datagridview and add the properties yourself to the control

12570662
kde	gnome
i d like to use the xdg-desktop-icon tool because it can be scripted and works cross desktop at least on linux with gnome and kde

12570662
ubuntu	debian
this failed on ubuntu precise 12.04 with kde and on debian wheezy with kde

12570664

this puts the child 100 of the parent s width away from the right edge of the parent and 100 of the parent s height away from the bottom

12570664
put	get
when you get those aligned you may want to put another box inside the .inner-box and make it position relative to make any position adjustments like sliding it a fixed distance over the button etc

12570687
width	height
there are two ways to change a chart width and height

12570687
width	height
a disadvantage of this method is that impossible to set width height in the page width height percentage

12570692
children	parent
if there is more than one node in the tree which meets your search criteria then visiting parent before children rather than children before parent could change which one is returned by the search

12570700
mouseover	mouseleave
i have a menu where i am trying to make the sub-menu fade in on mouseover and fade out on mouseleave

12570700
mouseout	mouseleave
i have tried several solutions most of them resulting in the menu fading out immediately on hover and not on mouseleave mouseout

12570729
onresume	onpause
register this in your onresume and unregister on onpause

12570783
children	parent
and the children creation should happen only when initializing the parent

12570795
versioning	upgrade
i suggest you upgrade to the latest monodevelop versioning 3.04

12570800
onbeforeunload	onload
i thought i set the code right in terms of the onload method only firing up after the confirm method for onbeforeunload was set a true

12570812
google-chrome	firefox
somehow firefox worked with that error but google-chrome ie didn t

12570851
children	parent
it seems to prefer to zoom into html elements that are children instead of their parent

12570880
ubuntu	linux
i have migrated from linux ubuntu to mac os

12570891
inherited	properties
all objects in javascript are similar in that they inherited from object.prototype but you can have different objects that have an extended prototype chain and you can also have native objects that have an internal properties that gives them distinction

12570910
exponent	addition
edit i am working in c++ and i need to be able to do any mathematical operation like addition square root exponent and so forth

where you would set the file width of the container height of the container and false as you want to resize not crop

12570944
.htaccess	httpd.conf
if you don t have access to httpd.conf like in many cases you can create a .htaccess and simply write addtype application json .json inside

12570958
uiview	subviews
i should point out that the uiview itself that is headerview in this case does reflect changes to its frame on the simulator but its subviews do not

12570973
put	get
there may be a cheaper way to get the running average that s cheaper than convolvend something like but i don t know what you d put in the .

12570978
folder	directory
i m trying to display an image from the folder which is created under the project directory by name images

12570979
lxml	beautifulsoup
you might also want to look into the lxml and beautifulsoup modules for parsing xml

12570993
equals	gethashcode
t is struct keyvaluepair does not implement so it uses equals and gethashcode method of struct keyvaluepair

12571020
put	get
i d probably try to adapt our implementation below by replacing the messagewithlength get put with something like

12571039
folder	directory
i put the makefiles and vs projects in the folder with the source code and modify the output directory to build into a binaries folder relative to the main trunk in a separate tree from the source projects

12571073

example for google-chrome and safari

12571088
hide	show
i want to show search bar on view controller s search button tap and hide search bar on resign first responder

12571158
ssl	https
3 if you are looking a default https endpoint after hosting it in iis make sure your iis has https binding configured with an ssl certificate

12571192
post	get
unless you explicitly set the form method to get forms will generally send the request as a post

12571194
instances	transient
object references an unsaved transient instances - save the transient

12571196
width	height
you are given the option to set the height of the widget and the width has always just expanded to the width of the parent div

12571215
postgresql	mysql
i m converting a rails app from using mysql mysql2 gem to postgresql postgresql gem

12571228
width	height
less significant differences are height width and the label font size

12571263
post	get
you can load with post method and use like in this case you can not use load because it is get request

12571276
width	height
for example i have an image with the dimensions 1200 height x 2300 width

12571276
width	height
i want to make an 100x100 pixels thumbnail of it and in this case because the height is less than the width the height should be 100 visible on the new image and the width should keep the aspect ratio of the image

12571329
hide	show
has a systray icon which when clicked show a window when clicked again hide it on rightclick show a menu with 1 exit item

12571329
hide	show
i already made the ui and put the app in the sys tray but i can t show hide it using normal actionlistener method but i got this error

12571368
google-chrome	firefox
anyway the pop-up works just fine in firefox google-chrome and ie9 but it does not work in ie8

12571408
children	parent
then a node s siblings can be viewed by viewing all its parent s children

12571418
for-loop	arrays
i then thought about listing eash directory file by calling recursively ls with os.system saving the whole string split them on an arrays and implement a for-loop to run os.system cp file1 + des and printing the filename but it looks like lot of work

12571419
nsstring	nsdata
i am converting nsdata to nsstring with following code

12571469
versioning	upgrade
the customization cannot be installed because another versioning is already installed and cannot be upgrade from this location.

12571491
implements	extends
a second approach talks about extends formattingconversionservicefactorybean and create my own converters a class that implements org.springframework.core.convert.converter.converter as described here

12571538
children	parent
in code we do an insert add into the parent table we then do an insert of that children s tables and then finally we do inserts on the children s children

12571538
children	parent
the code has been updated to reflect that the parent insert is happening after all the children inserts

12571545
switching	screens
the i have this code to switching rooms when i press the screens

12571556
uigesturerecognizer	uiswipegesturerecognizer
uigesturerecognizer is an abstract class so concrete implementations like uiswipegesturerecognizer do all the touch event handling for you

12571580
min	max
add some zero if necessary at the left of min so that the length of min and max would become equal

12571580
min	max
compare input a with the equivalent digits from min and max cut the corresponding digits of min and max from left and not right

12571620
many-to-many	one-to-many
this works with both one-to-many and many-to-many relationship

12571621
rvm	bundler
you could uninstall the newer version s of bundler though this is a crappy way to deal with the issue or since you re using rvm just create a gemset for rails 3.0.1

12571644
implements	extends
even if you needed to iterate across multiple results you d do better to take advantage of the iterable nature of mongocursor it implements iterator which extends traversable which means you can use it in a foreach loop

12571664
superclass	subclassing
you can subclassing a superclass using inhertance but this is done at designtime not runtime

12571682
uilabel	nsstring
you were setting the actual uilabel object to an nsstring literal which is probably not what you wanted to do

12571706
setinterval	settimeout
but i have no idea how will be able to combine a forach loop with settimeout setinterval

12571730
fast-forward	merge
the pull does a fast-forward merge with no problems but git svn rebase still fails

12571750
children	parent
you parent entity should have a property referencing children and children in turn should have properties referencing their children

12571750
children	parent
as long as you add child entities to parent s children collection ef can keep track of relationships

12571750
children	parent
now you can add parent to context and this will also add children

12571754
awt	swing
as discussed in painting in awt and swing the paint methods swing programs should override paintcomponent instead of overriding paint .

12571758
dumpsys	adb
you can use adb shell dumpsys activity

12571788
cmdlet	start-job
i m new to the start-job cmdlet and am having trouble calling a script block with cmdlets in it that take arguments

12571800
hive	hdfs
i would suggest looking into using flume to store the log file into hdfs and then have the hive table simply point to that location and use an appropriate serde to access it

12571816
getter	setter
if you do not do them as private and access them using getter setter then you are breaking encapsulation

12571840
portrait	landscape
it is always creates views in portrait orientation when perform rotation to landscape

12571895
french	polish
i also tried some other more supported languages such as german qt_de french qt_fr and polish but result was the same only caption was affected

12571905
pypdf	pdfminer
pypdf does not seem to have this functionality and pdfminer seems to be an overkill for such simple task

12571908
put	get
it also means if you accidentally put an image or script or style in the wrong place and try to access it you would normally get a 404 it wouldn t get routed through index.php eventhough and would yield the default 404 error page

12571942
udp	tcp
after searching in internet without any success i ended up creating my own implementation - with support of udp and tcp protocols

12571948
jobs	cron
and have it not fail if the file etc cron.d service_name does not exist since i may have many services running on a machine but only some of them have associated cron jobs

12571948
jobs	cron
i don t want to have a big list of services that take cron jobs like

12571948
jobs	cron
ideally i d like to have a directory that contains cron jobs for the services that need them and have the recipe not fail if these files are not present

12571963
gridview	sqldatasource
another way that would require less code from your part can be accomplished using sqldatasource and setting it as the datasource for the gridview - you wouldn t have to do the resorting paging in code

12571980
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
this function works perfectly in firefox but in google-chrome and safari i am getting this error syntaxerror unexpected eof ---i did some research but i am lost as to what might be causing this

12572152
nunit	mstest
you can run both mstest and nunit tests from the command line and in my opinion that would be far more preferable than writing your own test runner from scratch

12572193
post	get
anything coming from get or post will be a string so you re always hitting that first exception

12572231
vb6	vba
alternatively create a dll in vb6 that would only contain the declaration of the type and reference that dll from vba

12572268
des	aes	3des	aes
for encrypted keys the dnn side uses the standard algorithms ie des 3des or aes - depending on your machinekey settings

12572311
qsort	bsearch
in particular the standard qsort function sorts an array and the bsearch function searches over an array

12572311
qsort	bsearch
it s even legal for an implementation to provide a qsort that does a bubble sort and a bsearch that does a linear search -- though i m sure no implementation would actually do something that silly

12572311
qsort	bsearch
for example if you look at qsort and bsearch you ll see that they use pointers and deal with chunks of memory rather than typed objects

12572312
width	height
i have a cell with a fixed width and height let it be 100x100px

12572339
post	get
this error occurs when you access request.body or request.raw_post_data if you re still on django 1.3 a second time or i believe if you access it after having accessed the post get meta or cookies attributes

12572341
ggplot2	lattice
update i chose the answer that most directly answered my question which was in base graphics but i recommend looking at the other solutions as well as they show how to do the same thing in lattice and ggplot2 .

12572398
hex	binary
if you are saying you literally have hex digits in a text file that represent a binary -- you can convert it with this tool

12572468
ant	maven
like maven or ant

12572471
floating-point	integer
so in doing some of the project euler problems i want to be able to take the square root of integer values int long bigint etc but sqrt is only defined for floating-point values

12572511
width	height
in the screenshot both displayed images are less than 100px in width and different height

12572560
multicastdelegate	delegation
when we look at the implementation of multicastdelegate we can see that the implementation of multicastdelegate.getinvocationlist also creates a new array copies the delegation to be invoked into that array and then invokes them

12572572
imagemagick	mogrify
for example resizing images with imagemagick s mogrify command sometimes stalls and never returns control back to the original process

12572574
google-chrome	firefox
both require the user to install an activex in ie or an npapi plugin google-chrome firefox etc. to get access to the scanner via the twain api

12572577
uiview	subviews
uiimage is not a subviews of uiview so you cant add a subviews to it

12572577
uiview	subviews
also nsstring is not a subviews of uiview

12572577
uilabel	nsstring
create a uilabel - set its text property to your nsstring

12572682
onmousedown	onmouseup
onmousedown will trigger even when the mouse is clicked on the object then moved off of it while onmouseup will trigger if you click and hold the button elsewhere then release it above the object

12572682
onmousedown	onmouseup	onclick	onmouseup	onclick	onmousedown
in case you care about order if the same object has all 3 events set it s onmousedown onmouseup then onclick

12572736
integer	unsigned
an implementation that has no such unsigned type say because pointers are bigger than any integer type won t provide it

12572767
superclass	subclassing
in that case you probably don t want the superclass to know of the subclassing because that would violate the substitution principle

12572834
width	margin
you have a width of 33.3 on each column but you also have a left margin on .fleft and a right margin on .fright of 10px causing the width of all together to be more than the 100 that you want to fit everything in

12572863
happy	alex
if you are fairly happy with what alex k

12572878
octal	decimal	octal	binary
other numeral systems binary base 2 ternary base 3 octal base 8 decimal base 10 hexadecimal hexadecimal-notation base 16

12572878
ternary-operator	conditional-operator
see ternary-operator or conditional-operator for the most common ternary operator

12572878

in order to use a printwriter it must first call stringbuilder s tostring method to get the content as a string

12573056
java.util.date	simpledateformat
before you do the comparison as the timestamps are still in the string format you need to convert them to java.util.date and the simplest way is to assign an arbitrary date part to both time strings concatenate both time strings to 1 1 1970 then convert them into date using simpledateformat then get time in milliseconds and do the comparison

12573073
fileinputstream	objectinputstream
looking at the source code the constructors for both objectinputstream and bufferedinputstream can throw exceptions which would cause a fileinputstream object to be allocated on the following line but the in variable will still be null

12573083
getter	setter
this type calls either the appropriate getter or setter

12573092
stringbuilder	printwriter	stringbuilder	stringwriter
as an alternative you could drop the stringbuilder and use a stringwriter and a printwriter

12573104

12573631
uipangesturerecognizer	uipageviewcontroller
i found that the cause was replacing the delegate on the uipangesturerecognizer of the uipageviewcontroller a no-no really

12573645
width	height
this will set the content width to be as wide as the txtview plus the left-hand positioning offset and the height to be the same as the txtview s height plus its distance from the top of the scrollpanel

12573651
calloc	malloc
to make this dynamic you will need to dynamically allocate onto the heap malloc calloc

12573665

you can try the query with identical data in sql-server oracle postgresql even mysql and you will get the correct expected results

12573667
google-chrome	firefox
a plugin in a modern web browser like firefox or google-chrome allows execute files use webcamera and other and take more control of pc a plugin not a extension

12573667

12574104
gdi	direct2d	gdi	directwrite	directwrite	direct2d
i ve yet to learn gdi gdi+ or direct2d directwrite for outputting text and variable values to the client area so for now i need a simple method of outputting some basic statistics to the window and i figured the easiest way is to update the window title at this stage

12574189
int	chars
i have a simple class consisting of an int and 2 arrays of chars

12574349
min	max
it would be particularly useful if min and max were compile-time constants

12574349
min	max
the third one can be proven in a variety of ways but the simplest is to just observe the behaviour of ecatmur s loop when the loop ends input is min but 10 min so if 10 min max input must be less than max

12574349
division	multiplication
expressing the arithmetic in terms of division rather than multiplication ought to be a habit

12574349
division	multiplication
however division unlike multiplication will not overflow

12574351

i have a landscape only app and when i run the simulator the device is rotated to landscape mode but the screen is trying to display in portrait mode

12574388

post	get
you didn t said if you get any error message but from what you post i think it is a connection problem

12574479
clang	llvm	libstdc++	libc++
libstdc++ does this a lot more than libc++ and the former is the default library for llvm-g++ gcc llvm the latter for clang apple llvm which means a lot of errors will seem to go away when you switch to gcc llvm or just stick with apple llvm and switch your library but your code is still wrong

12574479
libstdc++	libc++
it might do so anywayÃ¢ and it might do so with llvm-g++ and or libstdc++ but not with clang and or libc++

12574489
tunnel	vpn
with windows azure virtual network once you configured the vpn connection the connection is available all the time and if by any reason the connection was down the tunnel should typically be automatically reestablished

better than using a random number is to salt then hash

12574661
hash	salt
salt and hash it here and then compare it when the user returns

12574681
fiddler	charles
but for now just handle via the error in the ajax and use charles mac os or fiddler windows or the network sniffers in the browsers for debugging

12574683

looking at yepnope.js it uses both onload and onreadystatechange but it also uses a timeout loop to check the readystate property of the script element see here

12574797
capitalize	uppercase
that isn t exactly what you originally had because the first letter is capitalize the data constructor names have to begin with an uppercase letter and the derived show instance will match the constructor names

12574815
folder	directory
i suggest you use links placed in the directory you desire pointing to the folder in the application folder

12574837
tunnel	vpn
adding onto avkash s response azure will attempt to establish a vpn tunnel with your on-premise device periodically so there is no need for manual steps on your device

12574837
tunnel	vpn
to create this tunnel the azure gateway and your vpn device needs to negotiate a series of security associations

12574844
min	max
i thought of restricting the min and max values in the set to achieve stable colors but that would distort the lables

12574856

port is any unsigned integer from 1 to 65535

12574983
iboutlet	ibaction
i was hoping if i created a uiviewcontroller subclass put an iboutlet for each imageview and button into it and the associated ibaction for the two buttons then subclassed it when making my vcs i would be able to link it all up allowing me to only have to duplicate the visual elements on each screen

12575001
cpython	pypy
now there are some implementations like pypy rpython which run a static-typing phase and should favor much better than cpython here

i have a jtextpane in a jscrollpane and i want to add an empty filler space at the top of the jtextpane so that the first actual text row in the jtextpane appears at the bottom of the jviewport

12575031
jtextpane	jviewport
i have a vague idea of having perhaps an empty paragraph in the beginning of the jtextpane and modify it s height everytime the jviewport is resized

12575034
spaces	delimiter
it s normally easiest to read into a std string variable - the default is to consider it delimiter by spaces anyway

12575039
irix	linux
you say socket so i m guessing that this is linux it could also be irix but that s a lot less likely and the answer is the same in either case

12575058
portrait	landscape
this is happening because the application wants landscape orientation only but some cocoa touch view controllers require strictly portrait orientation which is the error - not that they should be requiring more then portrait but their interpretation of the applications requirements

12575058
portrait	landscape
portrait orientation but the app is forcing landscape only

12575058
portrait	landscape
in my case i added this to my application s delegate i have a landscape only app this tells the image picker it can display because portrait is supported

12575071
calloc	malloc	realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc
i tried using realloc but that gave me invalid pointer errors so i am relying on calloc or malloc

vbscript	vba
it is particular to vbscript and hence vba

12575311
put	get
to put it another way i can t get the call to websecurity.initializedatabaseconnection to work when the connection string employs the system.data.entityclient provider as it does when using the model-first paradigm

12575335
google-chrome	firefox
works in firefox and google-chrome

12575344
free	malloc
the malloc and free functions can also be relatively expensive but don t worry about that unless you re sure that your program s performance isn t good enough

12575373
fileinputstream	objectoutputstream
then after connection you can use getinputstream and getoutputstream methods of socket to transfer data including strings objects and even files with suitable combination of fileinputstream objectoutputstream etc

12575383
for-loop	loops
while loops and for-loop everything written in for-loop can be done

12575391
google-chrome	safari
with google-chrome safari it s less so

12575393
for-loop	loops
a while loops only states the condition under which loops will terminate while the for-loop can stipulate a variable to measure by as well as a counter in addition to this

12575416
for-loop	loops
one occasionally relevant difference between the two is that a while loops can have a more complex condition imposed on it than a for-loop

12575416
for-loop	loops
this i guess would be considered syntactical but i consider it to refute the concept that the for-loop can do anything the while loops can though the reverse is indeed correct

12575499
preferenceactivity	listpreference

subtract	add
note that at this point we don t really care if our frame pointer is 5 or 55555 -- we just subtract to reference parameters add to reference our local variables

12575687
innodb	myisam
since innodb does row level locking as opposed to myisam which does table level locking by the looks of it innodb suits your requirements

12575694
innodb	myisam
with the default innodb in 5.1x all things equal you might eek ou a little performance boost from myisam if properly tweaked based on only your limited details

12575702

the script works fine in google-chrome and firefox but doesn t compile in internet explorer unless you use f12 to start the debugging of the script

12575713

setinterval	settimeout
if you set up a situation where your rendering spans multiple settimeout setinterval requestanimationframe calls where you clear the canvas in one call and draw elements on your canvas in the next several calls repeating the cycle for example every 5 calls i d be willing to bet you d see flicker since the canvas would be updated after each call

int	chars

12575933
min	max
secondly your min and max is not correctly initiated

12575939
min	max
even better than the arbitrary large initial value is to use conditional logic to detect the first time through the loop and set the min and max to the first real value in your input stream

12575939
min	max
that avoids the dilemma around how large to start min and how small to start max which i didn t mention but is basically the inverse problem

12575967
min	max
you are comparing it with max and min

12575967
min	max
hence max and min will store garbage vaues of num

the idea is that the bottom margin is the negative value of the footers height

12580338
getter	setter
getter and setter is a way of implementing object oriented principle of encapsulation

12580338
getter	setter
- encapsulation in its most basic form is like having private fields with public getter and setter

12580338
getter	setter
- the most important reason for using getter and setter is to implement validation of the data that is passed to the fields

12580338
getter	setter
in the below example there is no getter and setter so the weight of the dog can be set to an invalid value of -10

12580338
getter	setter
i am now using setter and getter to validate the field weight

12580344
getter	setter
in this case you don t need getter setter but still it is always good to use them

12580344
getter	setter
another simple example you just want to set a value during construction of the element so you just don t implement a setter but you implement a getter as well always set those member variables to private otherwise setter getter are pretty pointless

12580344
getter	setter
so in most cases you probably won t need them but it is still a good idea to always use setter getter imo

12580345
getter	setter
the role of getter and setter is to read and write values from and to these member variables

opera	firefox
edit i should add that i have tried inserting an alert statement into the if statement just to see whether firefox or opera actually register that a two-finger gesture is performed

12580624

to effectively select a parent based on it s children - what you are asking - is not possible with css at this particular frozen moment in time

12583116
children	parent
when generating your html either with a server side language or in js generate your parent with classes that describe the state of the children

12583116
children	parent
use javascript to target your parent and then calculate whether or not it has the right kind of children

12583129

since the pdf spec for these postscript function objects does not allow the use of arrays variables names or strings but only int reals and boolean as values the processing of these code segments doesn t require a fully fledged postscript interpreter and this statement in the spec

the reason google-chrome is slower than firefox is that the devmode plugin runs in a sandbox so calls and data have to cross the sandbox boundaries

12583615
std	ostream
i would like to be able to copy the contents of that file in a c++ ostream like a stringstream or maybe even std cout

12583660
super	self
the book somewhere said that- we can use super to invoke super class method which will find the base class method for us and also we don t need to pass self explicitly like we do without super

12583660
super	self
we could have used super self

12583836
width	height
but if you want to use this feature for so many pages you should define some arrays and a method that finds the center of icons by calculating its center with reference to their origin height width blah blah

12583836
width	height
so i again just hard coded the origin point height width of each bubble with reference to the self.view

12583836
width	height
the width of the bubble also may vary with height

12583837

this time before you start your jboss server delete tmp and work folder under the server profile directory

12583911
hide	show
so if you can fit everything into one page by doing show hide div s it would be better performance wise

12583963
width	height
since you are talking about incorrect height and width use outerwidth and outerheight to define the size of the label before you make it block

it doesn t make much sense to use the enhanced for-loop in your particular scenario since your arrays is initially empty

12584248
google-chrome	firefox
i believe browsers render each of these areas as a layer and where firefox would render the border layer on top of the content layer google-chrome would render the content layer on top of all the other layers

12584248
width	height
in your sample if you would remove the height and width attributes from your img tag you ll see the image does get rounded but is not affected by the border itself

i took a look at the appxrecipe file in the debug folder which i believe is being used to build the package and found that the reference to the file points to the file in the project directory not the one in the debug folder so i made my post build tool to modify this file to point the reference to the modified file in the debug folder the change is made and it s reflected in the deploy folder vs.appxrecipe file but the package still have the non modified file

subtraction	addition
for addition and subtraction your overflow is a single bit handled by the carry flag

12590007
multiplying	division
division is the opposite of multiplying divide 2 n bits you get n bits

12590007
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
at the same time any programmer that uses the add subtract multiplying or divide operations should also be aware of overflow and using those languages use variables that are twice the width of the operands so that they dont overflow.

12590054
for-loop	arrays
this task is currently done by performing a for-loop over the elements of an arrays and running various methods via an interface

this works perfectly fine when i want to dereference an int variable but whenever i try to dereference a chars pointer or variable i get non-ascii values.

12590313
hash	salt
but whatever salt you use to hash the value should be in a separate file that is not accessible over the web

12590313
client-side	server-side
client-side read javascript validation should never replace server-side read php validation for the reasons you already mentioned

12590313
client-side	server-side
one thing i would do is use the same method for validating server-side and client-side so that you don t have to write your validation code twice

12590319
onfocus	onblur
but you could also set the value onblur or onfocus of a certain field

12590433
setinterval	settimeout
you need to use settimeout or setinterval for drawing slow and to avoid browser freeze

12590439
stdout	stderr
as a workaround seeing the answer of anojirox you could catch stdout and stderr from the subprocess and then print it from the main process but you need to use popen and its communicate method due to the deadlock problem stated in the docs

another suggestion - toggle classes to show hide them

12590460
hide	show
i wonder how to show and hide fields p inputtext by choosing the option selectonemenu

ldd	otool
on a linux system you can see which dynamic libraries a program depends on with the ldd command on mac os use otool -l

12592282

i would read up on at least these three and if you really don t want to use std cin and std cout i would use qtextstream objects in the same way

12592330
division	modulo
modulo computes a remainder after division

12592330
division	modulo
where x and n are integers div means whole number division and mod means modulo

12592332
for-loop	arrays	multiplying	add
you would need to add an arrays of the category ids and possible use a for-loop to multiplying the code instead of the if statement

12592375
post	get
when you return to the upload index view from the post it is not re-populating the model since your code to populate the model is done on the get

12592384
innodb	myisam
i had the database at innodb but i changed it to myisam in hopes that it would resolve the issue

12592418
folder	directory
in the package explorer right-click on the java directory and select build path- use as source folder

12592418
folder	directory
it looks like you specified the root of your project as the directory that contains the folder sia3-code

12592432
integer	unsigned
numberofrunningactions returns an unsigned integer so to check if there are no actions you would have to check if it returns 0

12592449
int	chars
my first approach would be to split the received string into an array of single chars then make this an array of int by applying ord to every element

12592452
int	boolean
says that sqlite doesn t have a boolean datatype but false is stored as int 0 and true as int 1

12592463

12592616
maven	pom.xml
the reason for this is that the parent artifact in maven central only includes a pom.xml with no jar

12592616
maven	pom.xml
take a look at the maven docs and you ll notice that for dependency blocks in your pom.xml the default type is jar

12592617
strstr	substr
strstr does what it says it finds the beginning of the given substr

12592617
strstr	substr
so calling strstr with the needle begin takes you to the position of this substr

whenever	resque
i am running into a problem where whenever i enqueue this task locally resque seems to retry the task immediately without respecting the backoff strategy

12592684

12592720
textview	imageview
i see that one is a textview and that one is an imageview but i assume a dp is a dp regardless of the context

12592736

in reality i want to set that variable to be post data which will vary depending on the form input but as of now i can t even get it working with just this basic example

12592788
treemap	treeset
you say you are ...a treemap for its ability to sort on entry... - but maybe you could just use a treeset instead

12592803
decltype	auto
edit also backported for old compilers that don t know about auto decltype proper template parsing vs

12592854
getter	setter
if you used a class then you could implement a kind of bastardized fixed-string by way of your setter and getter

12592863
post	get
lastly .ajax defaults to a get request so you have to explicitly specify that you want to use a post request

12592868
puma	thin
you should use an evented server like thin or puma

12592894

12592902
google-chrome	firefox
i get a cross-domain error in google-chrome and it seems to fail silently in ie and firefox

12592923
int	double
you could export an function void foo int and a function void foo double

12592923
int	chars	int	double
adding extra chars that makes a foo int different from a foo double

12592938

12593041
sorting	filtering
all filtering and sorting is done in javascript using slickgrid s dataview model

12593049
inherited	properties
using the new keyword creates the new object sets up the inherited chain of it to widget.prototype and applies the constructor function on it where you can set up individual properties n methods or create private-scoped variables

12593059
post	get
it s not typical and introduces many problems when you attempt to post more complex objects and graphs through a querystring which is more appropriate as filter options on a get

12593059
post	put
if you are doing a creation of a resource then do a post and put the json object in the body of the request

12593059
post	put

12593108
range	min
after checking str min .startwith input you need to check numerically if any is within the range as ben voight s current answer says

12593255
nsurl	nsstring
so to my understanding i can only send nsstring nsurl

12593269
inherited	properties
you should not do that here unless you want all your weatherwidget instances to share among them the properties values they inherited from this widget instance and only through it from widget.prototype

12593269
inherited	properties
this way weatherwidget instances will inherited properties through the prototype chain but will not share properties values among them because they inherited from widget.prototype through dummy which has no own properties

12593294
min	max
for other uses of this conditional functions the logic test can be replaced numbers strings dates etc and the function can also sum average min max count etc.

as per the docs this method should therefore not be invoked if an encoding operation is already in progress which is what is happening in zenblender s code -- using static encoder decoder in a multi threaded environment

12593967
decoder	encoder
create a new encoder decoder object when needed for each operation not efficient as it could lead to a large number of objects

i think the best choice is use inversion for mutation and for crossover use ox ordered

12594977
crossover	mutation
in my case when apply inversion i choose two random points it could be the whole string but not the same points.the best results where with a rate of 0.2 0.3 for mutation and 0.8 for crossover but this will depend on your selection mechanism

int	double
for example this code compiles and outputs false because scala compiler implicitly converts int s to double s instead of creating and this looks strange to me because this can lead to data loss floating-point types are not precise for example

12595686
int	double
when you put a double and an int into a list scala decides that the type of the list should be since that is something that both item can be converted to

12595997
width	height
canvases have two sizes - the actual pixel grid size in the width and height attributes and the css size

12596033
width	height
this can be done by detecting the default orientation using window.orientation in combination with the ratio of screen width to height

12596033
width	height
the logic is that the default orientation for a device who s width is greater than it s height is most likely a tablet and not a mobile phone device

12596033
width	height
to make it even more accurate you should calculate the ration of screen width to height and ensure it surpasses a certain threshold to make the assumption more accurate and allow you to add a bit more logic to be even more so

12596047

12596375
nspredicate	nsmetadataquery

arp	udp
winsock drops udp packets if there s no arp entry for the destination address or the gateway for the destination

12598104

int	chars
by boatload i mean up to 2 2782 4000 128 chars to int conversions

12598485
int	chars

int	double
what s even more striking is that matlab is most likely doing this with double rather than int -- and it s still beating the pants off the c c++ code

12598485
int	chars	int	double
you should be able to beat matlab because it almost certainly is working with double but you can work with unsigned chars and int

12599357
width	height
i have a horizontal layout with width auto and height 100 but the body or container doesn t stretch to keep the aspect ration of my image

12599357

the string.compare method doesn t return a boolean it returns an int

12599572

calloc	malloc
then if you use malloc for the first time you will get an equivalent to calloc

12601312
memset	malloc	free	memset	free	malloc
if you write a number cruncher that reuses its memory you do not care what you get in there after malloc because most likely you should be overwriting it and you definitely do not want your flops to be negatively affected by unnecessary memset upon calling free

12601312
free	memset
if you want to be sure that nothing can read the memory after you call free you need to use memset a 0 size before calling free

12601638

as the uidatepicker or uipickerview don t have the ui_appearance_selector and even you can t change uidatepicker contents appearance as its uicontrol and not having any delegate so it has its native appearance whereas in case of uipickerview you can change its contents appearance similar as in uitableview

int	boolean
it was supposed to give me an int value but it is returning a boolean value

12602849
getter	setter
however if you try to do this with a java.util.list java.util.map or other collection holder you will encounter a concurrentmodificationexception if you modify the collection s value set while iterating through it in another thread in which case your best approach is to either modify your getter and setter methods with the synchronized keyword or use a synchronized block on the collection itself

12602853
screens	tablet	mvp	presenter
mvp can also be great when building multi-factor apps if the screens can be similar enough between mobile tablet and desktop then you can use the same presenter with 3 different views and that s where di shines

12602853
requestfactory	gwt-rpc
as for requestfactory rf well it s a different client-server protocol than gwt-rpc with its own set of features and limitations

12602853
int	double
to me the major feature of rf is that it s a protocol based on json more than an api the classes on the client and the server don t have to be exactly the same provided they are compatible enough that the client and server understand each others add a property change an int to a double etc.

12602975

12603814
multiplying	transpose
by transpose it into the normal order and then using a normal matrix multiplying your are absolutely killing performance

12603814

for 1 you need to decide if a file extension is an acceptable approach or whether you need to use some custom file attribute and whether this will be stored in the ntfs filesystems or embedded in the content of the file

12605613
jobs	cron
honestly don t use cron jobs for this

12605700
put	get
will put a bounty on it to get some good answers when available but feel free to answer before

12605740
post	get
if you are going to route only based on the content of the get and post bodies then i would say that you would be reinventing soap which is now considered heavyweight and legacy

12605750
roboguice	robolectric
if you extract the generaterandomkey method into a separate class you can then inject either manually or using something like roboguice a controlled version of that class into your test so that the random key generated when robolectric runs is actually a known value

12605986

now if i use an id for every component like button checkbox grids etc i m sure to get them always even if the layout of main containers change i can do it following the global way

12605986

12606057
profiling	debugging
so i thought i create one debugging scheme and one release scheme and set the build settings for project and targets accordingly ie using the distribution profiling for release scheme and the develop profiling for debugging

12606085
put	get
i am porting some really tough old html code to an extjs grid and unfortunately every once in a while some cells get their contents as pure html via ajax and put input elements inside the grid s cells

12606099
put	get	infobox	infowindow
if you want to get more out of infowindow and put html content in them i would recommend trying infobox

not specifically a problem for java since it doesn t allow non-boolean operands for nor does it allow mixed boolean int operands for .

12606141

12606154
nsstring	nsdata
or with nsstring nsdata

12606209
versioning	upgrade
the code-base has not changed between upgrade versioning so i m not sure why this is happening

12606218
getter	setter
create getter setter methods

12606232
getter	setter
it seems that many people think that unit testing setter and getter is just a waste of time and the accessors should be tested only when contain some sort of logic

12606233
int	chars
i notice there s a constructor decimal int int int bool unsigned chars but was hoping there s an easier way to deal with large specific numbers

12606264

my problem is that this solution doesn t work very well for all screens because width and height are not correct and is a bit coarse

12606271
fast-forward	merge
i suppose your merge was fast-forward master reference was reachable from local-branch svn-branch so it was just set to local-branch by git merge instead of merge commit creation

12606271
fast-forward	merge
as a recommendation always use --no-ff option with git merge because subversion has no such concept as fast-forward merge

12606271
fast-forward	merge
even in the case of subgit --no-ff option is strongly recommended because fast-forward merge and fast-forward rebase cannot be distinguished from branch removal and recreation from another commit this is true for any git - svn translation tool

12606283
versioning	upgrade
i have noticed that when performing an upgrade or downgrade from my sdk extension to a different versioning of my sdk extension without requiring a restart files in the data folder do not get updated until a restart is performed

12606310

to get both stdout and stderr as a single string

12606327

i was wondering how would i be able to compare a variable which is supposed to hold int values to times when it is passed a chars value

12606563
min	max
i m using a data structure that wants to use stl limits to determine the min max and infinity i think only these values of a struct i m giving it

12606563
min	max
and also getting this interesting warning on all uses of min and max this one being on the same line as the error

12606563
min	max
if i change the max to infinity it compiles fine and moves on to throwing an error on min

12606563
min	max
the names min and max are giving it some grief but i m not sure why

12606590
hide	show
the proper way to do this is just have the extra text in the html already and use a css hover property to hide and show the text

12606600

12606712
integer	unsigned
also x is used to print in hexadecimal an unsigned integer and you are feeding to it a signed integer - again undefined behavior

12606712
integer	unsigned
the x specifier makes printf interprets this stuff as an unsigned integer which in hexadecimal notation is 0xfffffff0

12606712
hex	binary
the 1111 groups in binary become f in hex the last 0000 in binary is that last 0 in hex

12606729
xslt	xquery
the easiest way to achieve this in practice is probably to do the validation using the validate expression in xquery or copy-of with validation in xslt

12606800
getter	setter
for me this throws of my methodology of development since i tend to create a function in a lot of my objects that returns all object attributes at once handy for the initialization of the object display all of the attributes for the object and creating a new record from an empty instance instead of manually calling all of my setter or getter individually

12606802

given the differences between browsers you need a function to get width and height

12608136

12608210

the first thing that really confuses me is that it expects me to specify a height width for the grouplayer even though it should just act as a container for other actual layers it s expecting this because it inherits from layer but that s another matter

12608281
children	parent
children are automatically reaped when the parent exits or if they exit after the parent exits

12608281
children	parent
if the parent exits before the children do there s no problem

12608281
children	parent
if the parent exits shortly after the children do there s no problem

cout	cin
notice that the requirement not to produce a data race applies only to the standard iostream objects cout cin cerr clog wcout wcin wcerr and wclog and only when they are synchronized which they are by default and which can be disabled using the sync_with_stdio member function

12608937
range	max	range	min	min	max
np.arange was used rather than python s range function just in case min x and max x are floats instead of ints.

12608953
int	chars
so your copy is simply assigning an unsigned int memory address into an element in an array that is designated as a chars

12608953
int	chars
it will truncate that unsigned int 32 bits into a chars 8 bits

12608953
free	malloc
furthermore if you want to actually copy the strings and not just create pointer aliases to each string in the array you will have to either allocate each element of your 2-dimensional array using malloc and then free the memory when you re done using free or choose a fixed maximum size and allocate it on the stack

12608964

accessor	properties
well you don t have to use the generated accessor cf creates for you you could roll your own and stick the properties values wherever you like

12609372
getter	setter	accessor	properties
you could save yourself for having to write individual accessor for each properties by leveraging onmissingmethod and looking for method calls to getpropertyname and setpropertyname and pass those to a generic getter setter

12609414
many-to-many	one-to-many
this difference matters only for one-to-many associations because one-to-one are always foreign key associations and many-to-many are always independent associations

12609451
outputstream	inputstream
by the way what will be the difference in memory consumption compared to using classic java inputstream outputstream

12609451
grizzly	netty
i actually am able to forward a 500mb file to s3 in a non-blocking way with a very low memory consumption without using iteratees using java + asynchttpclient + grizzly but i guess it would also work with netty

12609473

for some integer type how can i find the value that is closest to some value of a floating-point type even when the floating point value is far outside the representable range of the integer

12609539
floating-point	integer
this time i f will always have a well-defined result however since may be much smaller than it is possible that we will return for a floating-point value that is multiple integer values below

12609580
super	extends
sometimes you want to extends a super class in multiple different ways

12609646

12609829
post	get
if you were to submit a request in pyramid via get or post you would have to use a library like urllib2 requests or similar

12609829
post	get
redirect the user to a get page which has the form-data filled out via the get arguments and use javascript to resubmit the form via post onload

12609829

you should also know that most browsers will generally interpret any redirect request to be fetched via get -- even if the original was a post

12609829
post	get
there is also no http status code or command to purposefully switch from get to post

12609868
youtube	vimeo
see the print with vimeo above and youtube below

12609881
addition	modulo
this is not what you wanted since the number was negative you need all ones in the upper half in order for the addition to produce the desired effect after the result of the addition is reduced modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value that can be represented by u_int64

12609881
integer	unsigned
6.2.5 9 a computation involving unsigned operands can never overÃ¯ ow because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is reduced modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value that can be represented by the resulting type.

post	get
i have a more pragmatic question about this posted at sending a json string in a http url as i canÃ¢ t find any examples anywhere of sending json strings over http get or post

12610275
dlsym	dlopen
you can also use dlopen on dynamic executables to link the executable at runtime and use dlsym to get function pointers for the desired functionality though this is usually only used if you have no control over the first executable

12610281
width	height
if you are going to be dynamically resizing the height and width of images you should research the .bind resize event

12610312
ubuntu	linux
i have install all session and uploadprogress extensions in php.ini and i run apache with php 5.4 in linux environment ubuntu

12610314
postgresql	mysql

the edges are drawn using lineargradientbrush - color reflect the level of value f x y brown - max value aqua - min value green - middle

12610450
webclient	webrequest
my experience is that webclient is fine if it doesn t what you need - but it doesn t give you quite as much fine-grained control as webrequest

12610504
put	get
i figure i ll probably want to put this in a clustered stacked bar in the future but if i can get the simple cluster going i can figure it out

12610533
portrait	landscape
that kinda of worked but now when my app runs it always runs in portrait mode even though i ve set the project options to only run in landscape mode

12610865
hide	show
also on top of that i made so you can click to show and hide content inside the class to show the content

12610884
width	height
first use a fixed width height for the 83 items and float them all to the left so they naturally form rows of 4 items and will re-flow pop up when some get hidden

12610911
hide	show
this is how i understand it when the show method is called it loops through the contents of the vector checking with equals to find out if this is the name of the appropriate card and if it is it then loops through all the panels of the container to find out which one is currently visible it hide it and then it displays the appropriate card

12611017
serializable	deserialization
because of this as you note in your question your custom jsonserializersettings are used for serializable on the server but not for deserialization on the client

12611060
tcpdf	fpdf
i know that tcpdf has a way to set the auto-stretch but i have not found any for fpdf

12611127
integer	fractions
depending on your dbms you might need to cast the integer values to a decimal in order to see fractions values

12611142
for-loop	loops
if you insist on doing this with a while loops here s one that take advantage of python s iteration facilities you ll note that it s essentially a manual version of the above but hey that s always going to be the case because this is what a for-loop is for .

12611201
vb6	clarion
update 1 testocx is a vb6 ocx that passes a reference of a string to a dll written in clarion

12611255
int	chars
so i m supposed to write out the upper and lowercase greek alphabet for an assignment but i feel like there s a way in java that i can use a loop and casting int to chars or something along those lines in order to do this most efficiently

12611258
put	get
when i put the following query in both the fields i get different results

12611258
put	get
if i go to the developer center xpath builder and set the context node to any item underneath the main country site it returns me exactly what i need but when i put this in the source i get the entire content tree in both the cases

12611267

when the formview s linqdatasource only contains one record and i try to update it the update fails because the selected value of the dropdownlist is always empty no matter which value i pick for it

12611347
formview	linqdatasource
when the formview s linqdatasource contains 2 or more records it works as it should

12611366
put	get
assume that put get are the only operations on the map so i won t get cme s via something like iteration and try to ignore other obvious flaws here

mak sure browser is not buffering response firefox seems to output response directly while google-chrome waits for response to finish

12611761
getter	setter
i believe that if you implement the getter setter yourself then you don t need to worry about retain vs assign

12611761
getter	setter
these keywords only impact how the automatic getter setter work

12611761
post	get
i being this post with i believe that... because i m feeling a little rusty and trying to get back into xcode

12611782
subset-sum	np-complete
the np-complete subset-sum problem trivially reduces to your problem given a set s of integers and a target value s we construct set s having values n+1 x k for each x k in s and set the target equal to n+1 s

12611786
getter	setter
the main benefit of properties is the ability to automate the creation of tedious boilerplate code for getter and setter backed by a private ivar

12611786
getter	setter
in your case the property is not backed by an ivar and it sounds like you re writing a manual getter and setter anyways

12611787
apache	lighttpd
i ve found several solutions for finding out a user s home directory of the user running said script however i m writing a small script to make my life easier when creating vhost configurations for lighttpd or apache and would like to follow a scheme like so

12611801
jython	pypy
i m not sure that will actually matter time it and see but if it does other possibilities are to slice out and regex it or write a custom loop orÃ¢ on the other hand if that s your bottleneck you might get far more benefit by switching to an interpreter with a jit pypy jython or ironpython Ã¢

12611803
keydown	keyup
adding an event listener for keydown or keyup doesn t change anything

12611812
int	boolean
if your app has a database you can do this create a table that has some fields like id as int article name as string and isdismissed as boolean

12611827
cpu	processors
i strongly recommend aiming for a nehalem-class pc core-i5 7 based pc which has a processors that supports second level address translation slat this will prevent your cpu and gpu unnecessarily flushing the tlb and slowing down your pc

the error message which you got suggests that you haven t upgrade to 3.4 yet or that the upgrade itself wasn t done properly the older primefaces versioning wasn t been removed at all

12612144
int	boolean	serializable	deserialization
also the data types stuff may be important here - json represents datatypes correctly int boolean floats strings and xml is storing them as strings so you ll need some additional attributes to set datatype during serializable and determine it during deserialization

12612188
ubuntu	linux
my end goal is to have desktop linux run on it such as ubuntu

12612235

my data model objects are all implements as interfaces that extends the spring jparepository interface

12612305
children	parent
in the most trivial case where the parent doesn t need any info from its children this is just elem.clear . otherwise this won t work for you

12612347
mathml	mathjax
mathjax will recognize the presence of mathplayer automatically and hand over rendering of any mathml

12612347
mathml	mathjax	mathml	tex	tex	mathjax
mathjax will still convert tex or asciimath to mathml first.

12612375
int	chars
it will just convert the values of the chars to int and then add them together

12612375
int	chars
so the result of adding two chars is an int

innodb	myisam
if you need the database to enforce foreign key constraints or you need the database to support transactions changes made by two or more dml operations handled as single unit of work with all of the changes either applied or all the changes reverted then you would choose the innodb engine since these features are absent from the myisam engine

innodb	myisam
those two specific engines you asked about innodb and myisam have different design goals

int	chars
so with this usual interpretation after foo has placed an int there we can access it as chars objects so at least one chars object exists within the memory region named c

int	boolean
if you use a int type per boolean variable that only accounts for 40kb which is tiny

12617772
int	boolean
going from a int per boolean variable to a bit packed format will make you use less memory but everything will be slower since you have to pack and unpack the data from the compressed format

if it is not that often i would go for that update rss feed every time you add some new content

12618245
int	double
i have 2 classes one that implements a double lookup int i

c.drawbitmap ovl width height null

12618466
fadein	fadeout
also in your function you are calling fadein followed directly by fadeout

12618466

put	get
when i put in wrong credentials i get the exception saying invalid username or password which is all fine and peachy

12618538

12618679
websphere	ibm
web service runtime ibm websphere jax-ws

12618686
folder	directory
the obvious solution would be to merge the old pages directory with the forum directory but i can t because it would break the folder architecture of zend

12618694
hide	show
i believe the selector you are thinking of is the innerhtml of the span which you could change in javascript once you are finished showing the text so that show activities changes to hide activities and then just write up a little function that does the exact opposite of your show activities code

12618697
feedback	review
i have included a send feedback button in a few apps in the past that opened the email modal without any review issues to date

12618698
post	put
then you can put post action in your controller

12618709
hide	show
this means that in any case you are either trying to show or to hide the scrollbar even when it s already show or hidden

12618715
hide	show
as it is it will always call either the show or hide scrollbar methods

12618716

12618902
sorting	filtering
i want to build an complex datatable with filtering and sorting

12618912
put	get
if i were doing it i would use unix time multiplied by 1000 to put it into milliseconds which is straightforward to get out of php and in both php and javascript more intuitive when you re doing arithmetic on it

12618998
int	double
first the method signature it accepts a generic array of type t so it doesn t matter if it s int double bool or strings

12618998
int	double
zero is the default value for both int and double so you can use default t to get the default value for actual type and object.equals for comparison and operators aren t defined for generic types

12619040
submit	submission
to avoid second time page submission take one hidden field and check the value before call submit

12619052

12619258
move	drag
it s now possible to drag the draggable element around using two fingers without having the rest of the page move

12619258
opera	firefox
it s still possible to drag the map with one finger on firefox and opera but this is a minor thing as soon as you adopt a use only two fingers when you want to drag attitude

12619258
opera	firefox
the only small issue is that both firefox and opera seem to jump back and forth between which fingertip they choose to focus on making the draggable element jitter somewhat especially when the fingers are a bit apart

12619299
cos	sin
the problem is that sin cos and tan functions are computationally expensive and also there is quite a big loss of precision along the formula when calculated as 4 byte floats

12619317
pdfbox	ghost4j
not sure about ghost4j i did it using pdfbox imagetopdf

12619323
put	get
however if it is let them think they voted put it in the database and make it as voted but mark the vote as does not count so they will not try to get around your block

12619378
versioning	upgrade
i ve just upgrade upgrading to virtualbox 4.2.4 not sure whether the versioning matters and have looked at this again

many of the other standard distributions are strongly related to the gaussian binomial poisson chi-squared student t rayleigh logistic log-normal hypergeometric ...

12619437
width	height
ps in the img tag it says width 235 height 401

12619437
width	height
but the image pops to width 924 and height 1379

12619464
put	get
regarding style you could put the images into an array to get rid of the eval

12619507
firefox	safari
this works perfect in firefox and safari

12619513
restrict	shared
preferably you might implement an extension method which i would prefer because it does not restrict you to use this logic in a certain inheritance hierarchy but instead allows you to use it in all classes that shared the type or interface

12619528
multicastdelegate	delegation
a delegation multicastdelegate object is similar to a c++ function pointer that can store

12619536
width	height
i would like set a div s width height values to be the same as a table s cell automatically

12619536
width	height
table column will be dynamic width height

12619544
int	double
just an alternative thought as in java you could create an abstract class named number which int double etc

12619558
for-loop	loops
in the while loops you didn t increment i but in your for-loop you are using

12619563
width	height
anyway by default a div is already fitting the whole width so height 100 is enough

12619589
firepath	firebug
but before you gonna use it verify in firepath firebug addon in ffox that needed element is located properly

12619642
many-to-many	one-to-many
behind realtime you have a one-to-one one-to-many many-to-many messaging system that will transport your messages to and from your users

behind realtime you have a one-to-one one-to-many many-to-many messaging system that will transport your messages to and from your users

12619731
min	max
and for functions which vary in execution time like net i o for example you have to measure multiple times to find min max avg runtime

12619747
folder	directory
if the error message you get is the process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process. then your default directory is probably equal to path to my folder

12619752
width	height
basically in the javascript you first setup variables for the width and height of your container

12619752
width	height
you then set the overlay to have the width and height of your container

12619763
google-chrome	safari
it works fine in google-chrome but safari brings up an error saying

12619799
filewriter	bufferedwriter
also you should consider calling close of bufferedwriter as it is not just delegating the close to filewriter but it does some cleanup like flushbuffer

12619855
xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
to retrieve the headers you need access to the underlying instance of xmlhttprequest from jqxhr object

12619882
background-position	background-size
this choice does not matter the final shape of the triangle is determined by the values of the gradient s colour stop location background-position and background-size

12619890
primefaces	omnifaces
if you aren t on primefaces 3.4 yet and can t upgrade to it you can use omnifaces resetinputajaxactionlistener for this

12619912
google-chrome	safari
works at least in ie9 google-chrome and safari

12619955
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
many linux distributions debian ubuntu will have this

12619991
gson	jackson
looked through many libraries jackson gson but found none solving this particular problem

12620012

12620092
google-chrome	firefox
in fact i ve checked and google-chrome firefox and ie8 all gc the code above perfectly.

12620110
postgresql	mysql
if you are using a rdbms layer mysql postgresql as i think your proposal is the best choice in my opinion

12620113
hex	binary
but when i open this pdf file in a hex editor or in other tools that can show the internal pdf structure there is a lot of binary or compressed content inside this pdf

12620122
put	get
also if you are going to put these values into a database query or otherwise use them elsewhere promise the internet that you will sanitize these values so your site won t get hacked and turned into a malware distribution center

12620155
folder	directory
i have a folder in my root directory that is candyfive and it has my html website that is properly working and a domain is pointing to it i have a subfolder inside candyfive that is named portal

12620183
queue	fifo
what i expect is some system that takes the 1000 datasets as a queue and sends them to the 8 cores for processing so it starts by taking the first 8 from the 1000 as fifo

12620196
post	get
finally to add to all of this as you also mentioned in your post you get to use shiny items such as dateinterval easier timezoning easier manipulation and easier formatting etc when you use datetime and it s related object-oriented partners in crime

12620218
innodb	myisam
innodb works slightly different that myisam and they both are viable options

12620218
innodb	myisam
myisam does full text search innodb doesn t

12620218
innodb	myisam
i have been told innodb is faster on executing writes but slower than myisam doing reads i cannot back this up and could not find any article that analyses this i do however have the guy that told me this in high regard feel free to ignore this point or do your own research

12620218
innodb	myisam
in my opinion the second point is probably the one were innodb has a huge advantage over myisam

12620218
innodb	myisam
- i am reading this book high performance mysql the author says innodb loads data and creates indexes more slowly than myisam this could also be very important factor when deciding what to use

12620249
pbkdf2	salt
i ve learned that encryption key with symmetric algorithms aes should be derived from password via the pbkdf2 function using the random salt in each encryption

notepad++	sublimetext	vim	sublimetext	vim	notepad++
just editor vim or sublimetext or notepad++ i have used all of them and stopped on sublimetext

12620442

12620596
hash	md5
this article claims machines today can compute the md5 hash of 330 mb of data per second

12620596
hash	md5
sha-1 was developed as a safer alternative to md5 when it was discovered that you could craft inputs that would hash to the same value with md5 but i think for your purposes md5 will work fine

12620607
for-loop	loops
when a for-loop has a small body it might perform more slowly than the equivalent sequential loops

12620701
versioning	upgrade
however i couldn t use this when i upgrade the sbteclipse sbt plugin today - sbt stubbornly refused to even start because it didn t recognise the existence of a settings key that i was trying to set in my project s build.sbt that exists only in the newer versioning of the sbteclipse plugin and the only way i could find to work around the issue was to delete the old versioning of the plugin from the ivy cache and restart sbt

12620711
oncreate	recreate
when going back to that activity and if it had been destroyed android will recreate it by calling oncreate and onrestoreinstancestate which is why you should save volatile data that s supposed to outlive context changes in onretaininstancestate.

width	height
use the same images at both places and re-size them using height and width attributes of img tag

12620912
width	height
my first solution was to use a background .png with a width of 2500px for the body but that was before the content-based dynamic height of the columns was implemented after recognized to be essential

12620929
public	protected
appears in the private protected or public 9.2 portion of the class

12620943
mousemove	mousedown
the playingbar will need some functionality on click and mousedown mousemove for seeking and the update function to be set again including an event to trigger seek in the player aftern userinteraction

12620943
mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown
actually for the seek with mousedown the mousemove should be listening on stage so the mouseup otherwise the user has to stay on the loadingbar while seeking this is in most cases allmost impossible to handle

12620948
versioning	upgrade
for it to be a minor upgrade the versioning much change

12620962

12621037
portrait	landscape
i need the app on ipad to appear in landscape mode and on the iphone it should appear in portrait mode

12621065
allocator	stl
you can just use the well-known vector interface which comes with dynamic allocator by using push_back to add items to it while all stl implementations i know i m not sure if it is also required by definition use a template specialization for bool vectors and implement it as 1bit per value

12621128
keystore	jks
java has build-in support for work with pkcs#12 keystore work with this containers doesn t much differ than standart jks keystore

after i ve created a bunch of arrays i am using a for-loop to go through the arrays and a foreach to replace the variables in the email body with their respective values like this

12621248
gridview	rowdatabound
you can do it on the rowdatabound event of the gridview

12621302
width	height
you then need to loop through all the images and get variables for the image width and height and then find the top positioning of the image

12621302
width	height
the width and height if the image need to be in the image tag

12621373

12621448
gif	png
where the format name is a string like jpg png or gif and outputfile is the file to save the image to

your best bet is to use the antixss library from microsoft and specifically encode the parameters for get and post requests

12621560
int	double
or to take string cut off some parts and use cdbl or cint to convert towards a double or int datatype

12621594

the number of threads should be in the range of your number of cores 2..8 and or the max simultaneous connections sometimes only 4 over tcp your system supports

12621628
uiviewcontroller	uipopovercontroller
following the pointer from shawnwall s comment to the original question i have managed to get this fixed by doing the presentviewcontroller method call on the root uiviewcontroller and then dismissing and re-establishing the uipopovercontroller either side of taking the photo

12621629
for-loop	loops
the performance difference between for-loop and while loops is not a big issue because modern compilers can generate same machine code for both loops and secondly both loops require same operations

12621653
put	get
maybe thats why you get literaly all php code or the correct value when you only put execresult test as the content of the php file

12621676
super	extends
the problems gets worse when it comes to extends a class and use it as a super parent constructor

12621683
converter	multibinding
the thing you have to understand with a multibinding is that if the target property is not a string then you must provide a converter

12621701
radiobuttonlist	requiredfieldvalidator
since you re already using an asp radiobuttonlist to render your radio buttons i d suggest to stick to the asp framework and use an asp requiredfieldvalidator to make the radio buttons required

mouseleave	mouseenter
here is your updated fiddle fiddle with the mouseenter and mouseleave methods

12624143

this solution uses jquery s mouseenter and mouseleave methods because of a multitude of issues that ie has with the hover method

12624143

moq	nmock
nmock is also similar to rhinomocks and moq so i m grouping them in with nmock

12625646
moq	nmock
there are 3 major differences i see right off between nmock rhinomocks moq and the ms fakes framework

12625646
moq	moles	moq	nmock	nmock	moles
the ms fakes framework supplies stubs and moles shims whereas nmock rhinomocks and moq all provide stubs and mocks

12625646
moq	nmock
with nmock rhinomocks and moq you generate a mock object and then use that object to specify stubbed return values or to track interactions whether and how the methods were called

12625646
moq	nmock
to clarify the difference in what the frameworks provide nmock rhinomocks and moq all provide two types of test doubles stubs and mocks

12625646
moq	nmock
forgive me if i ve misunderstood how nmock is intended to be used. this approach really inhibits refactoring and i d highly recommend rhinomocks or moq over nmock for this reason

12625646
moq	nmock
this is another reason why i d prefer rhinomocks and moq over nmock nmock uses the older expectation style whereas rhinomocks and moq both support the arrange act assert approach where you specify you expected interactions as assertions at the end of the test like this

getter	setter
if classes like drawing.point had recommended and followed a rule that piecewise-mutable structures should expose their mutable elements as fields rather than properties and refrain from using property setter that modify this then an could efficiently expose a byindex property that returned an indexer struct which held a reference to the dictionary and had an indexed property whose getter and setter would call getbyindex and setbyindex upon it

128bit	64bit
you would want a few more bits to get higher precision for intermediate results but it would be overkill to use a 128bit type when you only want 64bit in the final result

12626285
16-bit	64bit
consider that the data bus at the time when those standards were established was 8 or 16-bit not 32 or 64bit like today

how you are doing it is acceptable but i recommend that you recase all package module named to lowercase as 1 that is the convention specified in pep 8 and 2 it will remove your shadowing issue

12626567
innodb	myisam
the problem is that when i export the table from the live raw database the table schema gets exported too and the table engine is set to innodb so when i run the script to import the data into the analytics database it drops the myisam table and recreates it as an innodb table

12626567

12627079
webkit	gecko
as most browsers follow a pattern of code reuse and the core chunks of webkit or gecko for example may not be aware whether they are on a laptop or a tablet as if those lines aren t beginning to blur anyway it simply loads each media query regardless of whether or not they choose to display it

12627087

int	double
from int to long float double or decimal

12627209
int	double
a double can hold any int value

12627215
int	double
there is an implicit conversion from int to double

12627215
int	double
the conversion is implicit because a double can hold the value of an int without losing accuracy

12627215
int	double
there is an explicit conversion from double to int but no implicit conversion

12627215
int	double
the reason being if you store a double in an int there is going to be a loss of value when it cuts off the decimal places

12627217
int	double
an int can be implicitly cast to a double

12627387
typedef	struct
i ve seen different posts on using typedef to declare the struct

remove the get hard code and in the constructor put a this.foo step 2 in the first line this will validate that the constructor is called

12627407
typedef	struct
you must typedef the struct to some name

12627407

12627811
getter	setter
making a private field does not always make sense if setter and getter contains poor no logics

12627811
getter	setter
indeed a lot of developers think that creating getter and setter and write private fields is encapsulation wrong

12627811
public	protected
so according to me about 99 of cases fields must be private or package or protected but never public unless a framework imposes it...rare and only manipulated by wrapping class methods

12627811
getter	setter
and in most cases it s amazing to notice that 95 of getter setter can be removed since useless

personally i prefer to put the constants at the top followed by variables constructors public protected default and private methods in this order - then any inner class if there is any

12628783
qtimer	qobject
qtimer is actually just a signal-slot wrapper around the qobject starttimer functionality so it will undoubtedly have more overhead associated with it on all platforms it internally implements qobject timerevent -- its implementation of this function is just to emit the timeout signal

12628783
qtimer	qobject
as such a qbasictimer combines some of the ease-of-use of a qtimer with the efficiency of using the qobject starttimer mechanism

12630359
portrait	landscape
when returning from the fourth view to the third and the fourth view was in landscape orientation i want everything to rotate back to portrait

12630359
portrait	landscape
everything worked as described above including the return to portrait even if the device was being held in landscape orientation when returning from view controller #4 to #3

12630359
portrait	landscape
here comes the question if i now navigate to my fourth view in portrait mode and turn the phone over it rotates to landscape

pop-up	dialog
i want to open a pop-up window when user leaves tab or closes browser the available option with me was window.open but with that it asks for pop-up blocker if it is not enabled i tried every possible ways to ignore popup-blocker but in vain i tried onunload onbeforeunload but it does not works i also tried to use modal dialog before the tab browser i used it in onbeforeunload event but it shows a browsers alert message which i dont want my simple requirement is i need a pop-up window if possible or modal dialog on the close of tab browser but should ignore popup-blocker i guess with modal dialog i dont need to worry about popup-blocker because that wont be the new window but how i would be handling it while user closes tab browser

12630418

12630425
hide	show
but i want if i hide 2 icon the rest what not hidden or not removed show center of the view

12630486
google-chrome	safari
you could build something within your own app where if you have some browser you intercept the url and redirect it but of course this will be local within your app and not when the user uses mobile safari or google-chrome etc

12630493
width	height
just a thought but i suggest you set width and height for that logo image in your css and also try using opacity 0.001 instead of display none in it s style you might find it works better because the image gets a download request the moment the browser hits the img tag not when jquery starts switching opacity

12630514
jar	war
the application is using jboss and has an ear file which contains an war file and a jar file

12630535
int	chars	int	boolean
loads of literal values of types boolean and chars are encoded using instructions that zero-extend the literal to a value of type int at compile-time or runtime

12630535
int	chars	int	boolean
likewise loads from arrays of values of type boolean byte short and chars are encoded using java virtual machine instructions that sign-extend or zero-extend the values to values of type int

12630535
int	chars	int	boolean
thus most operations on values of actual types boolean byte chars and short are correctly performed by instructions operating on values of computational type int

12630564
free	malloc
the best place for the free temp_path is just before the end of the else just check that temp_path is allocated memory if you try to free memory that it wasn t obtained with malloc your e gonna have a bad time

12630611
viewdidload	dealloc
i understand that viewdidunload is called when ios experiences low memory conditions with a goal of freeing up memory by releasing objects that can be recreated by calling viewdidload and that dealloc is called when the retain count of an object hits zero

12630614
int	chars
unsinged chars unsigned int 32 u_int64 ...

12630634
for-loop	loops
delete the row from data and labels note this will physically remove a row from the matrices which is why we have to use a while loops and check for length 0 rather than a for-loop and simple indices

12630641
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade the ubuntu server to versioning 12.04.1

12630645
monkeyrunner	adb
considering monkeyrunner being very unstable you can directly trigger events using adb shell

12630645
monkeyrunner	adb
adb is more reliable since you get the feedback immediately unlike monkeyrunner which does not provide reliable exceptions in case of any failure in triggering the event

12630675
int	chars
for example notice that each chars is parsed as a hex digit and then is shifted into a 32-bit int without checking for overflow

12630675
int	chars
only eight hex digits fit into a 32-bit int which is why only the last 8 chars are considered

12630690
width	height
i was thinking about a seperated class which handels the drawing certain width height depending of the width of the screen

12630718
google-chrome	firefox
other browsers google-chrome firefox print whole doc ok

12630792
for-loop	loops
but if you must do it this way don t do a for-loop or loops charcount number of times since charcount is the size of the string and you certainly don t want to loops this many times

12630792
for-loop	loops
use a while loops not a for-loop and loops until -1 is returned by the indexof ... method

12630819
width	height
when you try to click the like button the pop up comes up at the right height but the width is restricted to the width of the button

12630826
laravel	codeigniter
the answer given above explains how templating is done in laravel however to gain additional benefits like managing themes organised into a theme directory with ability to switch between themes and having partials and theme resources all together sounds like almost something similar to phil sturgeon template library for codeigniter

12630842
google-chrome	firefox
tested firefox and google-chrome if you want you can find some other way to express opacity for antique ie versions.

12630890
folder	directory
in your pom.xml you set the source directory to src but you say that your sources are in src main java folder and you tests in src test java

12630892
int	double
of the methods implemented there is an insert int i double value where value is inserted into array i

12630934
public	protected
what s not clear from your example is which of the methods are public and which are private or protected or package-private

12630937
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
works as expected on windows 7 using ie9 google-chrome firefox safari and opera

12630941
getter	setter
declaring an internal method as getter or setter public you are allowing the user only just through that method to access indirectly that variable.

12631005
google-chrome	firefox
in a win8 vm firefox loads the normal zoom bar but google-chrome does not

12631016
addition	multiplication
i need to look at the types of a b c and d and the declarations of the functions to be sure but even without that i can safely assume it s doing a vector addition and a vector multiplication

12631040
portrait	landscape
currently my uicollectionviewcontroller has two instance variables of uicollectionviewflowlayout each with the appropriate insets for portrait or landscape

12631113
width	height
and that s because using ib automatically disables translatesautoresizingmaskintoconstraints for views that it adds constraints to it will automatically add a width and height constraint in their place

12631141

as you can read in this blog post from martin doms you should be able to get a session token using an httpwebrequest object with an url like

12631176
robocopy	icacls
i thought updating it to use both robocopy with the mt switch and then perhaps icacls would be the best place to start

12631183
int	double
sometimes highly optimized engines can tell the difference between an int and a double

12631219
versioning	upgrade
i have this message commented out in my wxlua code 2.8.12.1 but you may want to check your versioning and upgrade as needed

12631262

to get your fiddle working i got the json data from your source directly and just put that into a variable to avoid the cross-domain request

12631437
versioning	upgrade
i assume that i must be using the wrong versioning of gl2 but i have no idea how to find my versioning number or where to go for an upgrade and yes i tried to search for an answer. attached is a copy of my shader code just for reference and my opengl information

12631442

it show div 2 hide div 1 and sets listener for back button to show_div1 and everything works ok

12631447
atan2	sqrt
i d recommend something like sqrt xÃ¢Â²+yÃ¢Â² 2.5+sin atan2 y x 3 5 - polar Ã¯ Ã® 2.5+sin 3Ã® 5

12631467
put	get
...because you re so determined i put together a very simple example of how to write an echo server to get you on your way

12631478
opera	firefox
my script works almost perfectly in firefox opera and ie

12631478
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari shows a slightly different behaviour

12631478
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari behaves a bit differently to this additional div

12631478
google-chrome	safari
when i hover on selected li in google-chrome and safari they remove the div from the selected li and add it before the first

12631523
robotlegs	puremvc
the game rules of tictactoe however should always remain the same regardless whether they re used with robotlegs puremvc or whatever other choice of technology you make

12631544
integer	fractions
note that you ll need python3 to have fractions like 1 3 work correctly because in python2 is integer division not float division

12631565
uitapgesturerecognizer	uitextview
the uitapgesturerecognizer works well before the uitextview is not first responder but after it gets focused the tap is not recognized any more

12631572
post	get
contains the data of both methods post and get so depending on whatever method you used it should work

12631583
post	get
your html select should be wrapped in a form with the action to results page if method is specified on the form it is one of get or post if no method property is specified the default is get depeding on that you should use in your query or respectively instead of

12631602
filtering	grouping
you can use group_concat to grouping all the tag names and then filtering on them with like or regexp as follows

12631648
cos	sin
i m pretty green at c++ and i have to make an infix to postfix calculator that supports sin and cos and it has to be a 2 variable function something like i already got the parser from infix to postfix but i don t know how to implement sin and cos i ve been told that i could set them as operator like + - etc

12631648
cos	sin
and to set a specific token for them like s for sin and c for cos but i don t exactly know how and i don t know either how to implement the variables x y i know that this is not something i should be asking but i m just tired and desperate

12631682
mouseover	mouseout
the hover function1 function2 jquery function take 2 parameters which are 2 callbacks functions called respectively when the mouseover event is fired and when the mouseout is fired

12631687
realloc	malloc
do i initially malloc space for the array itself and then have to realloc space every time i add an element to it

12631696
dictionary	map
then your base could hold a map dictionary key classname|value instance of its derived types

12631710
put	get
this means that you add the value at index 0 which happens to be 0 to the value at index 1 which happens to be 1 to get the value that you put at the end of the array 1

12631732
accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
since xcode 4.4 when you declare a properties the compiler will automatically create an ivar for you and synthesize the accessor methods

12631738
realloc	malloc
using malloc for the first item and realloc for additional items would work

12631769
stateless	stateful
my web application contains a few 2.x stateful and stateless session ejbs

12631820
inherited	properties
custom css properties aren t inherited so must be applied directly to each element even if you use js to dynamically add properties you should do it by adding a class so.

12631822
serializable	deserialization
boost property_tree also supports serializable deserialization to and from json

12631851
portrait	landscape
orientation portrait or landscape

folder	directory
add the directory containing lua.exe to your system path then do steps 2a and 2b on the folder containing your script

12631918
for-loop	arrays
that being said what you can do is simply create an arrays using a for-loop

12631932
google-chrome	firefox
i just compile a test plugin on vs2010 and it s compatible with ie9 firefox and google-chrome

12631936
children	parent
furthermore for each parent i have added validates_associations to force the children to be validated on update

12632007
srp	principles
of course that violated srp but ci users don t care and are even unaware of such principles

12632029
gruntjs	minimatch
gruntjs uses minimatch similar to bsdglob under the hood to match files but i can t seem to figure out how to do a .gitignore style exclude of a folder

12632067
implements	extends
if you want to extends this to more general dependency injection for your action controllers then i would implements your controllers as factories rather than invokables

12632118
post	get
you could setup a javascript timer on the page load with settimeout and that would get reset with each post-back and optionally by a button click that does not post back and when that timer counts down to zero it would redirect to a logout.aspx ex window.location logout.aspx that handles clearing the session and then redirects back to the login page

12632122
innodb	myisam
i m building a table that will be used for read only which is why i decided to go with myisam instead of innodb but i m open to suggestions

12632131
installation	upgrade
i ve just upgrade my system from os 10.7 to 10.8 running xcode 4.5 and the documentation from this source regarding fake code signing doesn t appear to mention a modifiable iphonecodesign.xcspec file for a xcode 4.5 installation

12632137
mutators	getter
you should also define getter or mutators functions or at the very least a constructor that takes the values you want for those data members

12632206
hide	show
i have a page where i need to show hide divs based on what button the user clicks

12632206

12632206
put	get
the page has both lists visible although if i put a breakpoint at the following line in firebug s script panel it does get hit

12632218
portrait	landscape
it seems that the device assumes portrait unless you specify landscape only in settings

12632248
integer	fractions
if you know that the floating point value is really an integer or you don t care about dropping the fractions part you can just convert it to an int before you print it

12632356
google-chrome	firefox
the script works perfectly in firefox and google-chrome but in ie 9 and below i get the following error

12632356
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried setting the datatype from jsonp to text json but then it wont work in google-chrome or firefox and while the call is successful in ie i get a null response

12632369
accessor	properties
most instance variables are synthesized and retrieved set through accessor using properties because it makes memory management nice and simple as well as gives you easy-to-understand dot notation

12632369
inherited	subclassing
it s a good place to put private ivars since you want to only expose what s needed in the public header but subclassing don t inherited them afaik

12632385
cstring	bstr
a cstring is more like a visual basic string or a bstr

12632385
cstring	bstr
so a cstring is a lot like a bstr type of variable

12632419
packets	pcap	udp	tcp
if you mean watch what packets to or from specific tcp or udp ports are sent or what packets are sent or received on particular network interfaces you would use the pcap library just as on other un xes

12632419
winpcap	libpcap	winpcap	wireshark	libpcap	wireshark
libpcap winpcap is the library that wireshark - and tcpdump - use

12632419
bsd	xnu
on os x the underlying kernel mechanism it uses is bpf the berkeley packet filter which is built into xnu it is open-source - see the bsd net bpf.c and bsd net bpf_filter.c files and the header files they include in the xnu source and doesn t require a kext

12632419
winpcap	libpcap	irix	linux	solaris	irix	solaris	bsd	solaris	aix	unix	solaris	unix	aix	unix	bsd	bsd	aix
it uses libpcap winpcap so that it can work on linux and os x and bsd and solaris and hp-ux and aix and tru64 unix and irix and so on as well as on windows if winpcap is installed so on os x and bsd it ultimately uses bpf.

12632419
winpcap	libpcap
libpcap winpcap doesn t except on linux allow you to capture on all interfaces with one handle

12632419
winpcap	libpcap	udp	tcp
if by ports you mean tcp or udp ports and you only want to watch traffic to or from particular ports you d have to specify a filter expression translate it to bpf code with pcap_compile and then make it the filter for a particular libpcap winpcap handle with pcap_setfilter

running the programs this is on opensuse 12.2 32-bit using gcc 4.7.1 but also fails with ubuntu 32-bit

12632463
getter	setter
the getter and setter provide a consistent standardised and

12632467
accessor	properties
because manually declaring and implementing every accessor method was quite annoying properties and synthesize were introduced to automatically generate the accessor methods

12632467
accessor	ivar
if you don t declare an ivar the compiler will add it for you and it will also generate the accessor methods without you having to use synthesize

12632488
post	get
my question with that is on the server side ideally i would like to use php to handle the get post calls from the android app but i don t know how to return using php information that my app can handle and not just an html file

12632519
pop-up	dialog
the resulting macro pop-up an open file dialog as expected

i am writing a program which monitors through select on the keyboard and mouse device files

12632656
subtract	add
if you want the total for each person just subtract the sums or add them instead if you just want a total number of votes

12632661
superclass	subclassing
get rid of getinstance in the superclass and just define it in the subclassing

12632680
subtract	add
that is you effectively subtract or add n from a until you bring r into the range above

12632701
superclass	subclassing	accessor	superclass
it should create a abstract accessor in the superclass then override it in the subclassing

12632708
children	parent
just import everything once in the parent then fork to create all the children

12632767
stdout	fflush
my goal is to run a c program as the subprocess so i won t be able to control whether or not it fflush stdout

i can t find where i should put the copyright information in order to get it to show up when i click the copyright item in the list on the left of this dialog

12632905
int	double
i am trying to say if it is not an int or a double

12632917
int	double
parse it as double it would work both with int and decimals

12632917
int	double
so if you need to separate int ans double do smth like this

12632919
int	double
since all int are double you could just parse it as a double only

12632920
inherited	properties
then to fully understand how a object works and discover all of its methods and properties you ll need to follow its inherited tree

folder	directory
instead consider downloading a copy of tomcat or jetty and copying the war folder into their webapps directory and serving from there

12633047
kerberos	ntlm
due to this flag the kerberos ticket is not forwarded delegated to the next hop causing the authentication to fall back to ntlm and fail

12633047
google-chrome	firefox
comparing this to the tgs request requested by ie firefox and google-chrome they all have a forwardable flag set

12633053
hash	md5
also i m not using the hash class because moodle currently uses md5 so i call auth attempt like this

12633072
hash	md5
you re suppose to use hash make not md5 to hash your passwords

i realize that i need to somehow multiplying hashval by 37 and then add key.charat i to this value

12633249
for-loop	loops
i m using a for-loop and it needs a return a string every time through loops but using return breaks loops and eclipse throws up an unreachable code error

12633251
width	height
note that you could also force your images to have a uniform width and height by adding the width and height css properties to the trainerimg class

12633251
width	height
max-height and max-width don t work on ie 6 or 7 so if you re supporting that you should go with specific height and width

12633253
maven	pom.xml

min	max
the limits of the colorbar can be the min and max values of z from 0 to 76387

12633647
public	protected
if you want to at least keep some method separation you can create a category and have all your protected methods and attributes there but in the end everything will still be public

12633676
opera	google-chrome
everything works fine in ie8+ ff15+ google-chrome 21+ and opera 12+

12633695
folder	directory
labels will label all files folder in the directory at the revision they were for that specific changeset

12633735
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
here is a very basic page that does what i need without knockout.js it works fine in google-chrome firefox opera

12633735

google-chrome	firefox
i also added some css for grab and grabbing cursors so to get a cursor effect similar to when you drag a pdf around unfortunately the support for this cursors is somewhat broken in some browsers ie and google-chrome in my tests but firefox is showing them right

12642194
post	get
i have always held the notion that drivers should only modify the data they are provided through their method calls but many of these drivers will pull information directly from get and post and while they will not directly append to the view they are often accessing view files and passing the processed view to the ci instance for output

12642206
google-chrome	firefox
this is working on firefox but have issue in google-chrome

12642237
portrait	landscape
it outputs this when you start in portrait and rotate to landscape

12642250
accessor	properties
in my example you get private and public variables private variable flanguage has a properties for synthesize accessor methods

12642258
prop	each
obviously prop value will be bound to relevant property on each item

12642261
min	max
i would also suggest to set min an max memory to the same value because in this case as soon as the vm runs out of memory the frist time 1gb is allocated from the start the vm then allocates a new block assuming it increases with 500mb blocks of 1 5gb after that is allocated it would copy all the stuff from block one to the new one and free memory after that

12642689
google-chrome	firefox

12642706
bnd	maven-bundle-plugin

12642708
post	get
this would make testing easier since you don t have to simulate a get or a post request

by implementing a comparator of list or a comparable as it works on the same purpose here what you are telling the jvm is that you want to compare different list s

12642808
implements	extends
you could also achieve your objective by implements a comparable in the class to sort but you can t as long as string is final so you cannot extends

12642858
children	parent
since these are a child parent relationship you can create the parent entity and then attached the children in the foreach loop before you call save changes on the parent entity

lisp	prolog
the iso iec standard of prolog provides only a very rudimentary exception and error handling mechanism which is - more or less - comparable to what java offers and far away from common lisp s rich mechanism but there are still some points worth noting

12643052
lisp	prolog
the additional effort to make a prolog processor handle each and every error locally is quite considerable and is much larger than in common lisp or other programming languages

12643212
int	chars
again this really depends on your definition of int but it s probably defined as a parser that succeeds on any string of at least one digit that is not followed by an alphabetic chars

12643212
int	chars
usual definitions of int will succeed on strings of digits followed by non alphanumber chars such as - even without any intervening space chars because that makes the spaces between two int literals and an infix operator optional

equals	compareto
okay upon further research you will want equals or compareto

12646302
equals	compareto
unlike compareto this method considers two bigdecimal objects equals only if they are equals in value and scale thus 2.0 is not equals to 2.00 when compared by this method

12646317
nexus	artifactory
if you don t have a local maven repository such as nexus or artifactory i think the second best solution might be to write a script that runs the mvn install install-file as as part of your build process you need to run that script and then run any of the maven comands

your jquery versioning is quite old you need to upgrade it might be 1.7.2

12646424
filtering	grouping
sharepoint doesn t know how to grouping filtering or sort on multi-select columns. another caveat could be that if you re displaying the list items in such a way that their headings don t appear such as in a list view web part or maybe in some of the styles... you obviously won t be able to filtering

12646424
pop-up	dialog
a caveat with the sharepoint list filter web part is that it s not actually a drop-down per se but instead shows a little filter icon that pop-up a dialog in which users then have to select a value

12646714
jar	war
alternatively you could tell the maven-jar-plugin or maven-war-plugin to exclude specific classes from being packaged in the final artifact but this has the downside of not being able to catch a case where you accidentally import one of the test only classes in a real class and thus you ship something in your jar war that will cause a noclassdeffounderror

12647419
mouseleave	mouseenter
using hover with live basically just binds the one function to both mouseenter and mouseleave

12647456
int	chars
in your case apparently it treats the most significant bit as a sign bit in other words in your implementation chars is a signed int type with two s complement representation incidentally

12647460
innodb	myisam
even though the above excerpt refers to myisam one could only guess what hoops mysql jumps through with innodb given the default value of lower_case_table_names in osx

12647482
rubygems	rvm
just update rubygems and rvm

12647525
implements	extends

the flush is needed because std ostringstream is a temporary

12647743
children	parent
generally when you use parent children relationships in sql you should make two separate database tables for each

12647768
width	text-align
i think in your case an explicit width isn t an option so text-align will be the best option

12647780
int	chars
then we compose those two functions to get a function that converts chars s to int s

12647800
ostream	ostringstream	ostringstream	std	std	ostream
i d not create an std ostringstream but rather have a function called from the destructor of a class derived from std ostream

12647800

apache	nginx
once the reverse proxy server nginx is stopped youÃ¢ ll notice that apache takes over all the web requests

12647922
children	parent
css cannot modify parent based on children

12647931
instances	transient
given the transient nature of an azure instances all local storage must be considered temporary at best

12647931

although this obviously gives similar issues with transient data if the azure instances is recycled the window for this to happen should be much smaller

12647943
addition	multiplication
if you try blindly to use it in any mathematical operation addition multiplication etc. the xslt processor will try to convert your value to a number which is nan because of the character and from this point the result of any mathematical operation will be nan which as we now know is not equal to anything

then upgrade to 1.9.3 where that bug got fixed so it started to throwing the argument error - pretty surprising for a minor versioning change imho

12648159
disk	ram
this adds a significant amount of complexity to the build process -- cpu demands go way up ram usage goes way up disk io goes way upÃ¢ and again this becomes a bigger problem as your codebases projects increase in complexity

it s easy to use for the app developer but pretty sub-optimal for performance as the server still has to execute every statement individually - though not parse and plan them individually so long as you use prepare statements

12648526
move	drag
i ve already completed this part but the next part of the assignment requires us to have one part of that object to be independently drag-able such that when you drag it the whole composite object does not move

12648526
move	drag
although when you drag the composite object the independent object should move the same amount maintain position relative to the composite object

12648668
mouseleave	mouseenter
where the first function is your handler for the mouseenter event and the second call is for the mouseleave event

12648694
getter	setter
hibernate wants getter and setter for set and sets them to be instances of persistentset

12648694
getter	setter
as in this question from 2010 i initially tried adding logic to the getter and setter to wrap whatever set was passed in with an observableset but this results in the exception

12648712
width	height
i m putting a border on this hover but it messes up the width and height of the cells the new border will push the next row slightly further down etc.

12648714
post	get
this is visible to the end user via view source or developer tools in some way either a hidden html field or the url post or get parameter

12648725
width	height
you can work around by having a border on all td elements with the same color as the td background and only changing the color instead of the width of the border to get a very similar effect to the one you originally designed without messing width and height

12648728
google-chrome	firefox
i recommend you get firebug for firefox or in google-chrome just right click and choose inspect element

12648738

you might also consider looking at google chart tools if your looking for things like defining the exact range of the axis as opposed to just the min and max of the input

12648877
implements	extends
according to the documentation mimebodypart implements only mimepart and part mimepart extends part

12648914
int	double
i d suggest you implement you numset class with int values rather than double values while you debug because comparing two double values tends to add some unneeded complexity to your code at this debug stage

12648987
for-loop	arrays
i am trying to use a for-loop to examine every character in a single dimensional string arrays and print character a is uppercase or character b is lowercase or character c is a space. i also have to print the index number and the character in that index

if you are in my situation where versioning upgrade is not an option you need create a libjnotify.so and remove the dependency on gclib_2.12

12649019
hide	show
if odd then show else hide the icon

12649031
children	parent
so the reason why is because you defined position absolute in both the parent and the children

12649081
hide	show
i did this to make it easier to show hide full control layouts all at once using the existing ib uikit architecture

12649081
uiswitch	uibutton
converting all these buttons to opengl drawing is possible since i m not using ios s native controls like uibutton and uiswitch just uiviews with images and labels but i d like to avoid it if i can

12649148
pull	push
if you think about it there can really only be two possible systems polling pull and event-driven push

12649148
pull	push
since there are two parties and each party can be doing one of two things that means that we can only have two types of systems push interrupt and pull polling plus a hybrid both interrupt-driven and polling based at different times or in different contexts

12649182
client-side	server-side
the following sample demonstrates the complete scenario myvar and also demonstrates another basic technique myvar2 for passing a javascript variable into the client-side from the server-side

12649192
equals	gethashcode
if you are going to generate your own unique id then you should override gethashcode and equals

12649192
equals	gethashcode
if the gethashcode are not equals then two objects are not equals

12649192
equals	gethashcode
if gethashcode is equals then two objects may or may not be equals

12649192
equals	gethashcode
there is only 1 int32 chance the more expensive equals will be required and the gethashcode is used for hash buckets

12649327
cdr	cons
we are setting the last cdr to the first cons

12649387
freebsd	netbsd
other bsd unixes freebsd netbsd etc tend to follow other rules so you don t usually see bsd systems with an opt unless they re administered by someone who is more comfortable in other environments

12649407
unix	bsd
i don t recall seeing opt on berkeley bsd unix

12649443

i encountered the same problem as yours my current solution is replacing the remote validation with separate ajax.call to execute my validation logic a little bit inconvenient since i should implement the show hide method when appropriate

12649559
calloc	malloc
i am trying to compile some code for which i have to compile meschach library and some other library which has codes for malloc calloc etc

12649581
getter	setter
easy way is storing it s coordinates in every moment for example in two fields and use them when user tapped.or you can create a class for example ball which it has fields that store coordinates of current instance ball and getter and setter for coordinates

12649606
int	double
basically says this will contain objects that inherit from number include int long double float .

12649620

12649734
google-chrome	firefox
i ve got a stylized input i m working on in html css that achieves the look i m going for in firefox but the elements input and span seem to be rendering differently in google-chrome

12649757
int	chars
instead use a pair of chars int where int specifies the size that is to be written and you will be golden

12649776
ssl	https
it s also very important that to if you are communicating with an https service from code that has an ssl warning you must setup the certificate validator on the service point manager to bypass it for testing purposes

12649940
textview	imageview
i have a custom listview that load a textview an imageview and a checkbox for each row

12650000
google-chrome	safari
specifically when using google-chrome or safari notice the arrows in the lower right corner

12650000
google-chrome	safari
only in google-chrome and safari the left arrow is not sized appropriately with relation to the other arrows

12650000
opera	firefox
yet in opera and firefox all of the arrows are sized the same

12650034
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
while in other browsers opera safari firefox the redirection will be done and return the address of corresponding mp4 file

12650035
jruby	mri
i came to jruby from mri mainly for swt and java libraries for the use in desktop development

12650042
libstdc++	libc++
if you use libc++ in the library and libstdc++ in the program or vice versa then most incompatibilities will be caught at link time

12650042
libstdc++	libc++
libc++ uses an inline namespace within namespace std containing most of its symbols causing link-time incompatibilities if you try to pass libstdc++ s types across the boundary

12650042
libstdc++	libc++
for the types which libc++ does not version it aims to be binary-compatible with libstdc++ in both c++98 and c++11 modes

12650056

12650149
put	get
while mitul s response did work for me as well i was able to get put and delete requests working by doing the following

i d avoid sorted since sorting requires a lot more processing than simply finding the max or min although it probably doesn t make much difference in this case

12650192
postgresql	mysql
in mysql postgresql oracle etc. it s limit 5

12650199

mouse	keyboard
i want to develop a app which monitors the mouse events like click movements and keyboard inputs

12650281
rss	feed
i want to parse rss feed of sites and want to fetch the content e.g article and want to put them into the database

12650421
google-chrome	firefox
i tried setting the .preview class in the css this works in google-chrome firefox but not in ie

12650423
portrait	landscape
so i create actually 2 duplicate views 1 portrait and 1 landscape and since the tags are the same during willrotateto... or didrotateto.. i copy the .frame property of each control from the duplicate view that i visually adjusted in xib and that puts the control where i wanted

12650428
put	get
put your portlet in the deploy folder and it will get registered as a portlet

width	height
you could also adjust just the height or width of the div with the onclick event

12650630
apache	nginx
yes you can host client files in any web-server since they are static stuff actually what you need is to pick your index.html the .nocache.js and all the .cache. js|html files and put them in any web server apache nginx iis jetty etc

12650631
matlab	simulink
it looks like the meat of the work done in this simulink model is actually being performed by your matlab function

12650631
matlab	simulink
basically your simulink model and matlab function disagree.

12650631
matlab	simulink
i actually feel that the best advice that i can give to you is to just scrap the matlab function and implement everything in simulink

12650631

equals	tostring	equals	gethashcode	tostring	gethashcode
of course like tostring every object has equals and gethashcode methods.

12655497

12655723
width	height
but it just copies the same image twice with the same height and width as the first one

12655778
multiplying	add
my original thought was to simply multiplying each set add them all up and divide by the total units aka finding the total average

12655832
division	addition
this is basic arithmetic division before addition

12655839
division	addition
division has precedence over addition so you should use parentheses

12655889
onsubmit	onbeforeunload
on your form s onsubmit set a flag to tell onbeforeunload that it can ignore this unload attempt

12655928
mediarecorder	audiotrack
the documentation for mediarecorder states if setaudioencoder is not called the output file will not contain an audiotrack so amr_nb is not the default encoder for mediarecorder

12655962
children	parent
it would be simpler to implement the drawing alignment using code similar to awt s layout approach where the parent object probably a group in your case is given a single layout object that is responsible for managing the arrangement of the parent s children

12655981
uploadify	plupload
great plugins that make it easy like plupload and uploadify the later

12655983
jquery	anythingslider
i m using a jquery carousel plugin called anythingslider

12655987
for-loop	loops
the adapter should be called first-thing inside the for-loop so that we have the option of catching it within loops and cleaning up to continue or breaking out of loops to catch it and and abandon the process

12655987
put	get
and we should put some kind of lame wrapper around the setup to indicate that tricks are afoot and to force the adapter to get called if the function is adapting

12656038
post	get
i m looking for a way to get the response from an http post without using a library

12656375
express	node.js
i am making a single connection to mongodb via mongoose in node.js express app

12656408
getter	setter
it seems there will be a fair amount of duplication in the handlers now as they have to go and get various players from the look up up until this point i had no getter setter on my domain objects i think this is worth trading away to remove the primitive obsession but i d like a solution that didn t require me to

12656417
accessor	properties
the parent class declares a string field fssn and matching properties ssn with accessor that read and write the field directly

12656477
fgets	strtod
use fgets and strtod

12656483
put	get
however functions is mapped diferently add get delete yay and put which has overwrite flag

12656608
spaces	delimiter
parse keywords delimiter by spaces

12656655
for-loop	if-statement
this is little strange to me why if-statement is in this aspect treated worse than for-loop

12656662
hide	show
you d probably be better off using show and hide but otherwise you should be using in the js also

12656686
for-loop	loops
there are about a dozen ways to code this with a for-loop do-while loops etc but that should get you running

12656740
outputstream	inputstream
get the inputstream and outputstream from the socket

12656838
put	get
if you re instead trying to get values returned from different rows like showing the title and content once but then a list of aut values you need to use 2 different queries or put some additional logic in your while loop

12656859
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it uses resizable scalable vector graphics svg for modern browsers like firefox safari google-chrome opera and internet explorer 9

12656894
for-loop	loops
because it returns one after the other you need to loops over to get all most recent first this can be done with a common for-loop

12656912
activemq	rabbitmq
note amqp is a protocol not an implementation - popular implementations include activemq and rabbitmq

12656947
width	height
i was doing some unit test to find the width and height of a nxn array when i ran into this problem

12657058
for-loop	loops
once is detected i would set result to the first value in vararray then i would start with the second operand in the for-loop start your index i at 1 and only increment i by 1 each time through loops

12657065
google-chrome	firefox
dude the plugin is showing the image of dropdown menu on my pc on all browsers latest version incl firefox google-chrome ie

12657075

see this question on comparable vs comparator

12657120
fadein	fadeout
try upgrading jquery otherwise you ll just need to just regular ol fadein fadeout

12657128
width	height
property on the full page background so the background image will fit 100 of the width and height of the given area

12657143
comparator	comparable
i also have a second question i have to sort the list three different ways depending in my gui what option i select i assume that i implement comparable but in my comparator interface it is comparator object o int key

12657164
comparator	comparable
see this question and this question on the differences between using the comparable interface vs using the comparator interface

12657170
free	malloc
you could try to provide your own malloc and free calls functions contained in object files are preferred over functions from libraries to see if this can work but these would probably have to deal with the operating system for the memory management since you loose the library functions

12657194
int	chars
i need the string to be the exact length of the line and to return a value that is either the newline or eof int which i believe can still be used in a chars value

12657225
swing	windowbuilder
windowbuilder has bi directional code generation ie it can parse swing code and then generate it from what you do in the gui and its all drag and drop

12657259
int	chars
however the eof constant cannot be represented using chars you need to use int - both as the type of charread and return value of getline so that you can actually distringuish between a newline and end of file

12657260
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	client-side	server-side
less runs on both the client-side google-chrome safari firefox and server-side with node.js and rhino

12657282
cublas	arrayfire
arrayfire and some other gpu libraries like cublas have many man-years of optimizations poured into them and are typically going to give better results than most normal people will have time to achieve on their own

12657282
cublas	arrayfire
third arrayfire uses cublas in the functions that rely on blas so you re not likely to see much difference using cublas directly

12657300
children	parent	inherited	properties
what i usually do to avoid having children inherited properties is have one parent with two children

12657300
inherited	properties
that way the undesirable properties become sibling properties and not inherited

12657302
boost	stl	boost	allocator	allocator	stl
if you use boost interprocess vector you will need to create a wrapper class for it because unlike an stl container its constructor requires an allocator object

12657327
int	chars
one idea would be c c c c to at least print the data as chars instead of hex values but that will not work either as the smallest size of a parameter in c is an int and even the c specifier works with int -sized parameter memory region

12657339
udp	tcp
i port forwarded 1234 in my router settings for both tcp udp

12657346

12657412
free	malloc
unless nvidia has recently lifted this limitation you must free memory by in-kernel malloc by calling in-kernel free

12657412
free	malloc
you cannot call cudafree to free memory that was allocated within a kernel with malloc

12657413
uiview	subviews
i m using a uiview subclass that has a uiwebview subviews to play the media

12657413
width	height
i ve tried setting to container view as a large square with length and placing the web view in the middle but it moves about inconsistantly - it seems as if the width height values are getting set from the dimensons before the rotation

12657413
width	height
i ve also tried setting autoresizingmask flexible height width but as the container view is off the screen this stretches the web view offscreen also

12657420
rvm	bundler
you can ask bundler to install gems in the vendor subdirectory of your app instead of in the main rvm ruby location with the --path option

12657422
children	parent
attach the event to the parent container of these controls which listen to the events for its children and provide events to their children on which these are delegated

12657430
children	parent
parent process creates n children each one replaces itself with exec

12657443
disk	ram
perhaps you could make a ram disk and specify that drive as the storage destination for your cache using r.cache

ssid	wlan
netsh wlan set hostednetwork mode allow ssid haxxy key txectxec keyusage persistent

12657506
client-side	server-side
it can be achieved on the server-side through several methods such as scraping the site via curl and pulling the relevant data out with some basic string parsing or by using a higher-level tool such as www mechanize for relatively static on the client-side content or phantomjs for more-dynamic content such as elements which are created via javascript

12657520
google-chrome	safari
in webkit safari google-chrome it looks as intended

12657527
free	malloc
for both cuda 4.2 and cuda 5.0 rc the cuda c programmer s guide mentions in section b.17 that memory allocated via malloc cannot be free using the runtime by calling any

12657536
put	get
here ive put together this very simple ajax chat example it will poll your server and get the latest 25 messages it also utilizes the ajax.post to send the messages

12657548
int	chars	int	double
double float long int chars short and byte but are free to

12657553
junit	testng
using webdriver directly you can also use the full features of a unit testing framework usually nunit with c# or junit testng for java

12657553
google-chrome	firefox
this allows things like repeating tests for each browser i.e repeating tests in google-chrome firefox and ie or defining certain logic before and after tests i.e adding user memberships creating users setting up other test data

12657564
keydown	keyup
basically you just put handler on keydown and keyup events and trigger whatever you want

12657584

12657684
udp	tcp
i use the pnet tcp udp toolbox along with psychtoolbox to communicate between two instances of matlab in different machines

12657685
children	parent
will cause the element to be completely removed from the regular flow of the other elements and make the div and its children then relative to the document window itself instead of its parent

12657705
apache	nginx
i think now distro support for both of these technologies is mature enough that people with significant site traffic should genuinely consider switching out apache with nginx

12657706
uilabel	uitapgesturerecognizer
for example if it s a label here s a relevant so post showing handling a tap on a label ios using uitapgesturerecognizer with uilabel to swipe to the next page

12657720
post	get
for some reason even though i have tried a number of ways to specify this request as a post rails is making a get request

12657730
cos	sin
if you use acos cos t you ll get the result between 0 and pi but if you also check asin sin t you will be able to figure out whether the rotation was clockwise or counterclockwise

12657738
cos	sin	cos	atan2	atan2	sin
atan2 sin t cos t returns approximately t in the range -pi +pi

12657739
median	max	min	median	min	max
for things like sum mean median max min first last std you can call the method directly and not have to worry about the apply-to-dataframe-but-failover-to-each-column mechanism in the groupby engine

12657773
getter	setter
note that you are allowed to override the getter and not the setter

12657787
unix	bsd
i understand that winsock is used for networking on windows os s and bsd is for mac os and unix

12657805
stdout	stderr
the parameters are err stdout stderr

12657859
int	double
it would be easier to make the method double operator int row int col const

12657863
udp	tcp
winsock and bsd sockets are the names of two similar apis that both implement the same thing tcp ip sockets which in turn are endpoints of tcp connections or udp datagram flows

12657863
unix	bsd
there is accordingly no necessity for a winsock implementation on unix or a bsd sockets implementation on windows

12657898
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
when i test this in google-chrome and opera everything is okay but when i test it in firefox it ignores the box-sizing

12657904
public	protected
previously this method is protected and i have changed it to be public

12657937
put	get
for this you ll want to put the results in some form of store probably a database and then query them to get the most useful representations

12657949
post	get
if you want to analyze the response status you have to use the normal http request verbs get post etc but those won t work for the case you describe since your test involves multiple pages

12657949
rspec	capybara
if you want to test aspects of your application which are exclusively api-like then i d recommend using rspec request specs for that which are essentially integration tests but focused on one-step request response. you can use get requests and analyze the response using capybara matchers

12657960
children	parent
it gets the parent of the frames then the children frames as per the array

12657962
min	max
i m having a problem generating a random number between two variables that store the min and max based on previous guesses

12657962

highestnumber is what the max should be and lowestnumber is what the min should be

12657969
post	get
use a get request instead of a post

12657984
min	max
to generate a random number between min and max use

12657984
min	max
includes max and min

12657991
polymorphism	specialization
the basic idea of specialization is to remove polymorphism and overloading by identifying places where the function is called and creating versions of the function that aren t polymorphism - they are specific to the types they are called with

12657995
post	get
since it seems that nobody is going to post an answer to this i ll offer my two cents as just one point of view i ve written elsewhere about the issue of how to get rails and backbone.js to work well together rails and backbone working together

12657995
post	put
we won t support post or put requests unless the user has javascript enabled or unless they want to go through the json api

12657995
stateless	stateful
this is not simply swapping haml for erb you are migrating from a stateless front-end to a stateful one and that is a potentially huge change depending on the complexity of the app

12658023
width	height
you can call self.frame.setminsize w h to force the window to have a reasonable minimum height and width but you will want to add scrollbars so that you can see all of the image.

12658026
swt	swing
eclipse even includes a native code widget library swt that is used instead of swing

12658030
inline	inlining
whether or not that call is inline depends upon ghc s usual inlining rules and whether or not an inline pragma applies to the class method definition

12658048
hash	md5
if you are using md5 or sha1 hash an attacker could easily find a hash collision and make you slip on a banana skin

12658054

here is my code for parsing along with two nslogs the first log from what is just simply in the pubdate element of the rss feed and the second log when i try to convert that to an nsdate

12658112
folder	dir	folder	directory
if i execute dir command from any other directory it has the effect of a simple ls but if i copy this file into any folder and then run dir i get the correct output

12658179
google-chrome	firefox
it looks the same in google-chrome as it does in firefox

12658193
int	chars
i also know that these 40 bytes enclose int chars and other pointers

12658228

toupper	uppercase
why i cannot convert char type to uppercase with toupper when i gave the char an array.

12658269
super	self
well this question is super old now and according to my old self

12658280
for-loop	loops
i ve tried the sleep function if i put it in the for-loop it misses keypresses and if i put it in the while loops it doesn t lower cpu at all afaik

12658294
fgets	getline
the proper way to write this program would use fgets or better getline to read entire lines and then munch them by hand not with sscanf

12658314
gridbaglayout	miglayout
i m quite happy using miglayout right now but i m also seeing what the gridbaglayout has to offer as well

12658326
gridbaglayout	miglayout
edit for clarification miglayout is probably easier to use than gridbaglayout but if you get familiar with gridbaglayout it s not that hard to use and it doesn t require a download since it s part of the core java library

12658326
jtextfield	jlabel
myself i d likely use nested jpanels that use a combination of layouts perhaps borderlayout for the overall gui and gridbaglayout for the data acquisition panel the one with rows of jlabel jtextfield combinations

12658348
mongodb	bson
note that both these examples are using the mongodb bson representation which will vary from the size required to represent the same data in other databases

12658422
rss	feed
i have designed the java class which reads the rss feed xml url and get the contents and store it in java class

12658422
rss	feed
whenever there is an update in rss feel url i need to parse the rss feed xml url using java class only then i could get the updated contents

12658449

12658450
int	double
as for your bonus question gets cast to an int when you use the double equals sign

12658501
rss	feed
you could use a cron job that runs the java application to parse the rss feed

12658501
rss	feed
it depends on the frequency the rss feed is going to get updated

12658501
rss	feed
you could implement a polling solution here if the information in the rss feed is updated frequently

12658508
pthreads	fork
c++11 has adopted the threading concept from pthreads and windows but the heavy-weight multiprocessing stuff such as fork and exec pipes etc. that s c-based

12658513
width	height
make an img inside each link for the image and simply change the width and height to your desired values in the css

12658533
pop-up	dialog
create an activity whit dialog theme so it looks like a pop-up and display it when user click your appwidget

12658538
width	height
now you can tweak the width and height individually and the image will always look good

12658557
maven	pom.xml
since we use maven to build your project you need to make sure those dependencies are referenced properly in your maven pom.xml

12658581
versioning	upgrade
if you have recently upgrade tortoise svn it may be because versioning 1.7 seems to need a new format for storing the status of files - in which case you can right click the root folder of your repository in question and use the tortoise menu option of svn upgrade working copy

12658607
hide	show
the problem is that after the error text show i want to click the username field and hide the error text div so that i can be able to reshow the error if the field is still blank using jquery

12658619
folder	directory
should i put it all in a folder within the website directory use google docs jquery plugin

12658619
put	get
when the reviewer finishes reading the paper they can just select one of the checkboxes and that information will get put into the database

12658640
hide	show
and .css display block to hide show should work fine

12658646

12658809
put	get
i tried to debug the w3wp.exe service to get any hidden exception i put a break point at the web service methods but the debugger didn t even reach there and the exception happened before reaching to the web service class

12658818
put	get
i can even put a breakpoint on line 4 of test_func and type alpha and i get the correct result but as soon as i do a step forward with the debugger it fails again the function alpha is masking the local variable and i don t see why

the major problem is that the function fgetc returns an int not a chars

12658850
hide	show
you could definitely make some serious progress in a couple of hours adding in fields to specifically show or hide you could even deal with the validation on a simple basis required fields would be simple for now just to get it rolling

12658917
for-loop	arrays
creating a new arrays with a different size and putting all the elements from the original arrays into the new one with a for-loop plus or minus the one he was adding removing

12658917
for-loop	arrays
friend b simply created an arrays of length m removing elements by setting their value to null and adding elements by scrubbing forward from index 0 until an empty spot was found this was a for-loop

12658917
for-loop	arrays
friend c me also created an arrays of length m but shifted every following value forward reduced their index by 1 with a for-loop when a string was removed so that n -1 was always the index of the last value when n 0 and n was also the index to add new values at eliminating the for-loop for adding strings

12658942
width	height
i set it to half the screen size s height width

and then show or hide the text box client side if isalien is selected

12659559
width	margin	inherited	properties
the margin and width properties are not inherited except via the use of the inherited value

12659559
inherited	properties
however an inner element appears by default within the outer element visually so it may look like it inherited those properties

12659559
inherited	properties
there is no inherited problem for these properties

12659559
inherited	properties
for many other properties such as color an element inherited the properties from its parent if the properties is not set on the element itself

12659559
inherited	properties
if inherited is not desirable set the properties on the inner element

of course you can resize the image there are many different ways like image#getscaledinstance int width int height int hints but this has its perils

12660152
groupbox	panel
edit for window application using panel groupbox would be best option since there is a property that you can utilize to retrieve all buttons in panel or any container control to minimize code and write clean logic

12660168

jar	.war
there is no standard way to describe an executable jar in a pom file moreover you could make an executable .war extension doesn t make difference

12661212
mp3	wav
if you have a sound file of it such as an mp3 or wav use the mediaelement control

12661213

12661380
rsa	dsa
rsa keys are symmetrical you can use any of them as a private key or public key it is just a matter of your choice but dsa keys are not symmetrical

12661381
for-loop	loops
perhaps there is a performance improvement using a while loops than a for-loop

12661383
profiling	instrumentation
another way might be to use the instrumentation time profiling

12661397
post	get
conversely instead of mixing post and get values you could set a hidden field in the form

12661397
post	get
will pull the value from either the get values or the post values so it need only be present in one of them

12661466
inherited	properties
the only flaw i see with single table inherited is the number of columns which can be huge if you have a lot of properties and it is harder to add a new properties column in your model if you have to apply a db evolution

12661490
inherited	properties
every javascript object has an internal prototype properties often called prototype which points to the object from which it directly inherited

12661490

basically you need to define an inargument and map the external data to the arguments using a dictionary

12661673
google-chrome	firefox
my code performs exactly as expected but it seems i have a memory leak somewhere and over time abut 10 minutes the browser - ie google-chrome and firefox will accrue about 500mb ram usage

12661673
google-chrome	firefox
one more thing firefox s online crash reports are flipping awful there s been no dump after submitting and the issue is less pronounced on google-chrome ie - so no crash reports available

12661678
post	get
what exact error did you get by the way this would be much simpler if you could post the exact error code

12661680
ostream	istream	std	ostream
since talking about functions reading or writing data unless you really need to make use of specific details of std ofstream or std ifstream use open you should probably pass std ostream or std istream references

12661680
ostringstream	std
this way the functions can also be used with different stream stream types std ostringstream and std istringstream

12661706
min	max
also when n 1 it is more efficient to use the built-in min and max functions

12661710
int	chars
in c it is perfectly valid to or an int with a chars as you do in a| a

12661738
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari

i am able to invoke the ejb s deployed on glassfish with a standalone client and i am able to invoke the same ejb s deployed on jboss both from a standalone client and from glassfish

12661834
int	chars
therefore we need to convert to first two chars to int

12661890
nsstring	nsdata
convert the nsdata to nsstring then restore it into nsdata for write to file not work

12661937
inline	inlining
functions are only inline if they are small enough or if you add a pragma specifically asking for inlining

12661958
disk	ram
another possibility is to never have your code on disk only keep it in ram

12661970
free	malloc
this copies the data into a malloc region which is nice because it is safe and the c code doesn t need to do anything special to free it other than free

12662060
for-loop	loops
since c++11 with its range based for-loop the easiest and simplest is a range class template that in addition to supporting loops supports set membership checking as a method contains

12662106
qpainter	qwidget	qtextedit	qwidget
i m eluded as the documentation says specifically that qpainter can draw on any qwidget which a qtextedit is.

12662113

it works fine when the elements in the array are of type int chars etc

12662476
post	get
there is only post to that address with post parameters not get redirect

12662476
post	get
for me if you make a redirect with that data and not post the paypal is not found anything about the account because there are no post data and thats why you get that error

it expects a nsurl instance but you obviously are providing an nsstring instance

12662966
jar	war
war ear and rar files and more besides are all jar files used for particular purposes

12662966
ant	maven	ant	pom.xml	gradle	ivy	maven	pom.xml
secondly you join the 21st century and use a build tool and distribution mechanism which handles dependencies automatically in practice that means using gradle or maven or some other tool such as ant in concert with ivy to obtain dependencies from maven central and then then releasing your code along with a pom.xml file which lists those dependencies

12663136

12665258
daemons	launchd
again i would use your launchd daemons to listen for this condition

12665258
daemons	launchd
so i would have your launchd daemons register for darwin notifications for com.apple.springboard.lockstate

12665258
daemons	launchd
i see this same notification when the screen is locked or unlocked so you may need to have the launchd daemons keep track of the locked unlocked state or inspect the userinfo object to see if that tells you whether this is a lock or unlock event

12665271
fflush	gets
we re still flushing in the implicit finally block now with repeated close - this gets worse as you add more decorators but the construction is safe and we have to implicit finally blocks so even a failed fflush doesn t prevent resource release

you are adding the gps listeners and bluetooth on onstart and removing them on ondestroy

12665593

as soon as i press on submit i get a blank page no matter what string i put in

what it does here force the image to scale up or down to a specified percentage of the width height of the div container the width and height of the div is dictated by the viewport

12666146

certainly it must be typedef d 7.18.1.1p2 and it cannot be any standard unsigned int type other than unsigned chars or chars if it happens to be unsigned

12666147
inherited	subclassing
it s not possible to mark a field inherited from class a as unique only for the subclassing b

12666188
free	malloc
4 you are using free on memory that you have not allocated with malloc and that would not even be suggested in c++ since we have new and delete

12666199
flip	slide
a trick too is that many mobile devices are optomised for 3d css transitions because 3d is used to perform flip and slide functions used by the phone s own ui

12666208
unsigned	short
similarly short and unsigned short are both 16 bits wide

12666259

12666391
integer	unsigned
if the integer promotions convert it to int or unsigned int the operation is performed at that type otherwise at the type of the left operand

12666391
integer	unsigned
in your example code the integer constant 1 has type int hence the shift would be performed at type int and the result of that converted to unsigned long long for the comparison

12666391
integer	unsigned
otherwise if both operands have signed integer types or both have unsigned integer types the operand with the type of lesser integer conversion rank is converted to the type of the operand with greater rank

12666391
integer	unsigned
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand then the operand with signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type

12666391
integer	unsigned
otherwise if the type of the operand with signed integer type can represent all of the values of the type of the operand with unsigned integer type then the operand with unsigned integer type is converted to the type of the operand with signed integer type

12666391
integer	unsigned
otherwise both operands are converted to the unsigned integer type corresponding to the type of the operand with signed integer type

12666446
width	height
as you can see the blog post has a picture with variable height but fixed width 320px which may or may not overlap with the view element below it which is a label

12666495
hide	show
if they must all be in the original hmtl page then just put each block of content in it s own div each with it s own id value and each with a common class name and hide them all by default via css with display none and then use javascript to show just the desired set of content based on a click

12666586
setinterval	settimeout
you might want settimeout instead or move the setinterval outside of runthisloop

12666593
setinterval	clearinterval
this is the best way to fix it there are almost no scenarios where setinterval can be used without clearinterval

12666620

12666933
ubuntu	linux
i tried with linux ubuntu too

12666945
s-function	simulink
i think the s-function is the way to go because the existing simulink arduino library blocks are actually s-functions that are masked

12666986
int	double
there is no such thing as a double s string and int s string

12666986
int	double
its an array of double and an array of int

12666987
int	double
there are no such things as strings of int s or double s in c#

12666988
google-chrome	firefox
that s easy enough because an onclick event registers with the window object- get the targetd object by using window.event.target might vary from browser to browser so look up how to do it thoroughly if your assignment depends on it- this works in google-chrome and firefox for sure

12667006

it appears from reading around trying to resolve this issue that at some point flexslider added a style attribute to images containing the height and width of the image resulting in any css aimed at altering the size rendered useless

12667199
inherited	properties
all the child properties class is able to inherited with the parent properties class and the child and child2 also can inherited the properties class with each other

12667217
hide	show
it is most definitely possible a very simple solution would be to have 4 divs and hide show the div corresponding to the the link the user clicks eg fruits link will show the fruits div this sort of plumbing is already with most javascript libraries a good one is the jquery ui framework the tab control would achieve what you want to do

12667249
google-chrome	firefox
the code seems to work fine in google-chrome and firefox but wont render in ie

12667250
width	height
obviously i substitute in the dynamic values for the height width and videoid params

12667265
pcm	music
according to some knowledge from web i found that when an audio music sound is played the audiotrack will write pcm data to the sharedbuffer and then audioflinger will read the pcm data form this sharedbuffer

12667278
rsa	dsa
public key type could be something other than rsa such as dsa

12667287

12667390
uilabel	uibutton
i want to add a uilabel within a uibutton

12667432

i dont know much about audioflinger but to read the pcm data you can make use of audiorecord and to write the pcm data you can use audiotrack to play the sound

12667440
getter	setter
finally this is personal preference but when you implement modeldriven it helps to supply the type ie then the ide hopefully knows to create the correct getter setter

12667573
snmp	mib
if it is a non standard mib not part of core snmp mibs you should find it s complete oid something like 1.3.4.1.2... and first check in the gui mib browser if it exists or otherwise debug get request against the specific oid

12667577
width	height
the only pure-css way to center something both horizontally and vertically i know of requires the thing to be of a fixed width and height but given that

12667577
width	height
set left margins to negative half of the width and height respectively

12667577
width	height
if you use borders or padding you must account for that by adding them to the width height before halving

12667578
uilabel	uibutton
uibutton now give you a lot of control but before some things like custom fonts were possible i just made a simple control that had a uibutton and uilabel

uilabel	uibutton
i would just put the uilabel on top of the uibutton with a small 2px or so padding

12667583
stdout	stderr
you have to redirect the stdout and stderr to a file.

division	modulo
...this inexact math can lead to some extra space at the bottom of the grid when the division has a remainder modulo such as when there are six rows the height of each row is 26 and leaves 4 pixels over on the bottom of the grid -- but again this unnerving behavior even occurs when the default 5 rows are ensconced in the 160 pixel-high dgv 32 pixels per row

12682560
width	height
i have a a problem where i need to adjust the height of a parent div to the length of the longest text in a child div but i need to test all div s in a row and find the longest text and use that width as the value for all parent divs height in that row

12683225
mouse	keyboard
i would like a way to either read both keyboard and mouse events even when mission control is active or a way of detecting that mission control is active

12683225
mouse	keyboard
use addglobalmonitorforeventsmatchingmask to register a global monitor for keyboard and mouse events

12683225

width	height
negative margins works only for cutting top and bottom part -- when the height of the image has to be cut and the width is left unchanged to put portrait image into the square

12694919
width	height
i have found that this technique for specifying aspect ratio to cut the width leaving the height unchanged putting landscape image into the square works well with bootstrap s scaling

12694919
google-chrome	safari
so far i checked it in current google-chrome and safari

12694919
width	height
question how can i do it in one way for both cutting the width and the height

12694944

and of course what you have malloc ed don t forget to free

12694950
cos	sin
i recently wanted to use lookup tables with interpolation to get an angle and then compute the sin and cos of that angle

12694950
cos	sin	cos	sqrt	sin	sqrt
instead i put sin x in the table instead of x and then used the taylor series for y sqrt 1-x x to compute the cos x from that

12694961
for-loop	loops
you need to loops over the items in your list for example using the enhanced for-loop syntax

12694968
width	height
here s a more generic form for if height and width must be less than 115

12694968
width	height
this guarantees that the largest dimension of the image be it height or width will be no greater than 115

12694989
post	get
i used this post and sample code to get a paging grid up and running using odata

12695195
google-chrome	firefox
i test it by ie9 firefox 15 and google-chrome 22

12695200
implements	extends
the reason is that although we can use pseudo classical inheritance in javascript we actually have to implements our own extends or inherit

12695200
inherited	properties
what about the prototypal inherited -- i think it does have the feature that if foo.bar is used if bar is not a properties of foo the interpreter or the compiled code such as if using google v8 will go up the prototype chain but there is no built in method to make object b s hidden prototype properties point to a as a prototypal chain

12695207

there are applications available that can open files on or from a remote machine but they tend to use a tcp or udp connection to transfer the data instead of an http connection

12695415
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
this works nicely in all the usual suspects google-chrome firefox safari but on ie for some odd reason even if you inspect the element with firebug lite and it shows the clone having when you change it the changeaccesssystem function gets called with the first argument being system_row_0

12695426
dictionary	map
i renamed your dictionary variable to map to avoid masking the built-in dictionary type

12695468
google-chrome	firefox
you can see the same effect with letter-spacing where firefox will allow non-integer values in pixels while google-chrome will round the closest pixel

i have a game with a udp tcp server and client

12695497

12695632
google-chrome	safari
as you can see in this jsfiddle the check-mark looks ok in your average windows browser but safari on mac and ipad perhaps even google-chrome on mac shows the check-mark outside the menu and there s nothing i can do to make it move even a pixel

12695890
getter	setter
note that the function takes a this pointer to an object a getter and a setter public member functions

12695890
getter	setter
the function will then interface with a gui allowing the getter and setter to be called back later

12695908
int	double
you should check if the result is actually an int or a double and if int you do

12695908
int	double
in short you have to explicitly rewrite operations that are done on int instead of double

12695908
int	double
but you can do like int i when an operation requires an int and i is double

12695919
int	double
in c++ you emulate this behavior by casting a double data type to an int and shifting

12695944
spaces	delimiter
assuming topictitle and the criteria are spaces delimiter strings i would intersect the two collections and check if there were any matches

12695984
integer	unsigned
the current c and c++ standards both limit unsigned integer representations to a pure binary representation so what you have above is entirely safe and guaranteed to work

12695989
integer	unsigned
cast your unsigned integer to a signed one when saving to sql

12695998
getter	setter
requires that setter s argument is a const reference to whatever getter returns

12695998
getter	setter
allows the setter argument and the getter return type to be different

post	put
the form is post to an api that uses activerecord to put the params into the database

12696398
free	malloc
actually your main problem is you have corrupted your memory and now when program want to exit it want to free its internal allocated memory memory that used to store per thread data and since you are using debug version it will check its memory and understand the failure and start to show an assertion window now when it want to show its assertion window it need to allocate some memory and use memory allocation routines malloc witch will be converted to malloc_dbg in this case to allocate its required memory and malloc_dbg check memory status and understand your memory corruption and try to show an assertion window again and this procedure will be repeated

12696430
int	boolean
in his explanation odersky argues that the type is anyval because it is the most specific supertype of int and boolean the types of the two conditional branches

google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome it looks good but in firefox the left and right side are too short you can see this at

12696677
post	get
see if the form itself is submitting the turn camera on variable as get or post

12696677
submit	submission
if you don t want to open a browser to do this you could write yourself a custom application that submit it for you but either way you have to open something to make the submission as a script has to wait x amount of time before making the request

12696677
submit	submission	post	get
what i would do on the scripting side since merely accessing this script means you want to activate the timer most likely would be to create a timer object in javascript and then make a single function that either accesses the url of the camera form submission with the get string parameters that s easiest if it s doable via get because you wont have to build a form or if it s post have the function build a form and submit the form via post to the same url

12696702
stdout	stderr
finally i m not sure what editor you re using but it sounds like it s masking the real problem if you re getting dialog boxes instead of messages and tracebacks straight from the interpreter s stderr stdout

12696744
pull	push
no - you can change gravity but it will pull push only in the direction you have it set to never to any point

12696765
qstring	qbytearray
use qstring toutf8 which converts a qstring to a qbytearray

12696778
setinterval	settimeout
to do this i thought using settimeout instead of setinterval but that didnt work

12696796
getter	setter
i was wondering whether there is a way to define super models with getter and setter methods that allow me to edit the necessary data in one place

12696798
verilog	vhdl	verilog	hdl
this site has open source hdl verilog and vhdl implementations of working hardware.

12696804
width	height
if you are going to use this component in a layout it may need to be able to have its height and width set meaning it needs to be of type box in order to be an ext.boxcomponent

12696830
children	parent
i have a embeds_many association and when i save the parent document the children are not being saved

12696881

i want the element to first fadeout then change it s image and then fadein

12696897
pop-up	dialog
1 when specifying without print dialog a sheet pop-up in the window that should display progress in processing the print job but instead of doing so it just hangs with a nondescriptive barberpole

12696934
postgresql	mysql
i discovered that much like mysql postgresql requires that i use semi colons at the end of a command

12696968
integer	fractions
if you know the maximum of fractions digits you are going to process you can multiply your original values by a suitable power of 10 and use integer arithmetic for your computations

12697024
getter	setter
you could use virtual attributes on the person model and put custom assignment logic within the getter setter for each of the editable address attributes

12697058
nsmanagedobject	mogenerator
i know there are some recommendations to have an interface that sits in front of the nsmanagedobject for testing purposes but this seems to be adding complexity on top of the mogenerator machine human files

12697070
explode	substr
i also feel substr isn t quite as easy to read in current explode you can see the delimiter immediately with no extra function calls and there is only one incident of the variable which makes it less prone to human errors

12697070
explode	substr
basically i read current explode as i am taking the first incident of anything prior to this string as opposed to substr which is i am getting a substr starting at the 0 position and continuing until this string.

12697135
capitalize	substr
that way you could loop through all the links and substr to get the path capitalize the first letter prepend a #show to the front and pop it into the href attribute like you are doing

12697180
capitalize	substr
it capitalize each substr delimited by except for specified strings such as a or the

12697184
stdout	stderr
dmcs puts some messages on stdout and some on stderr

12697184
stdout	stderr
coderunner expects stdout to only contain the output file name nothing else so to make that happen can be used to redirect everything else to stderr

12697208
children	parent
so let s for a moment consider making parent div s position absolute and setting it at 100 height so that your relatively positioned children sidebar will get the same height if its height is set to 100

12697266
hide	show
in my routine to show hide the sidebar i see traces of say the enter_frame event but it holds the last mousex position it was aware of before the mouse left the window not the current mouse position within the desktop rect

post	put
and testing json api in rails 3.2 using rspec using exact put post bodies as backbone would send and they did not work for me

12697492
put	get
also how can i get value of one text field and put it into another text field and what if the value of the first text field is some type of html or javascript code

12697498
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
this works in google-chrome safari firefox ie 8 9

12697526
deselect	multi-select
what i d like is for the default to get deselect when another choice is made but from that point on allow multi-select to work as ios expects it to

12697557
client-side	server-side
regardless we migrated the page access token acquisition code from the client-side to the server-side which seems to have resolved the problem

12697579
google-chrome	safari
if you go to this page with a non-webkit browser you will notice how the three articles at the bottom have a black border and a white background but if you do the same with google-chrome or safari those css proprieties disappears

12697675
innodb	myisam
as mysql 5.6 is rc i tried to convert my myisam tables to innodb because i read that the fts engine is quite faster and stronger and fts was the only thing holding me back on myisam

12697675
innodb	myisam
i have deleted the indexes after converting myisam to innodb and making it again and optimising table afterwords

12697682
google-chrome	safari

12697715
width	height
the uiscreen.screens 1 width and height give me the correct values 1920 1080

12697723
move	drag
the purpose of this is because as you will see later is when i spin though my objects if i change the childindex value it seems to occur right away and if i drag items 2 3 4 it will skip item 3 and only move item 2 4

12697729
int	boolean
the index value can be boolean or int

12697737
free	malloc
when you dynamically allocate the string remember to free string when you have finished working with the memory block allocated with malloc it is a good practice and will prevent memory leak in larger programs

12697756
children	parent
it s too hard to scroll pages to match children to parent even wrapped with tags

12697756
post	get
maybe an online generator where i can post the contents of the and get a collapsible table of fields

12697761
fread	calloc
in both cases we allocate enough memory for 101 characters to account for the 0 terminator and since fread won t write a 0 terminator to the end of the input we initialize the memory to all-bits-zero in both cases the first by using an initializer the second with the call to calloc

12697817

12698011
google-chrome	firefox
one idea is embedding firefox or google-chrome into my java application and removing the controls

12698056
button	checkbox
basically what you are saying there is that if the event came from the button and the event came from the checkbox show a message

12698056
button	checkbox
this is not possible because one event cannot be triggered by a button and a checkbox in the same time

12698058
gridview	radgrid
i have a radgrid gridview that has the option to edit and insert new items

12698060
button	checkbox
it sounds like you should be handling the button click and within that event handler check the state checked or not of the checkbox

12698089
folder	directory
the dll is missing from your system s environment and has nothing to do with compiling and linking your executable adding the dll folder to your library directory folder is meaningless

12698090

i ve tried inspecting in firefox google-chrome and safari and can t seem to find anything that is adding this margin

12698109

if you do that hide everything by default and then show selectively based on permissions

12698448

listview	gridview
my problem is that i use a gridview which has to become a listview when the window is snapped because of the small horizontal space left

12698838

my first approach was to create a listview and show hide it based on the visual state

12698884
hash	md5
i gave a look to possible ways to create this hash and since i would like to avoid collisions i need to insert several millions of entries it seems that the ripemd-160 algorithm is the best one even if a quick search gave me several similar solutions that use sha256 or even sha1 and md5

i feel you would have an easier time using a cms such as wordpress drupal joomla etc

if this is the same bug i noticed just last week friday in fact what i think you ll find is that the same httpwebrequest object or backing connection object - i never checked is being reused but the connection has stayed open to the old server in your case and that new get post invocations re-use that connection instead of forcing it to connect to data.domain.com like it should

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
this is sort of just the bare-necessities of getting json data from php into js google-chrome firefox safari newer ie and a very simple strategy for putting that data in html and putting it into the page

12698955
jsf	seam
my project already works in a glassfish 3.1.2 environment based on seam 3 jsf and mysql

12698969
getter	setter
after investigations it seems that the compilation issue was related to tag getter setter type mismatch on a certain tag from the tiles library

12698984
folder	directory
however regardless you could put that file inside of a separate folder then make it a virtual directory and that should block dnn s processing of the request

12698997
strtr	multibyte
multibyte strtr - mb_strtr

12699049
fink	macports
these locations have been created by macports and fink - be warned that it is quite possible that freetype2 might not be found by pil after this move - if you need it then just rename libjpeg parts in those locations

12699055
memcached	apc
both webserver has memcached apc nginx php-fpm installed

12699065
getter	setter
this works well especially if you just want to add a docstring using always the same kind of getter setter

12699095
int	double
given an int value above this threshold the next possible double will be more than 1 greater than the previous number

12699103

12699140
screens	tablet
the game is a top-down car game which won t have huge tracks or anything but they ll have to be at least as big as the device s screens or better yet its resolution and since we re aiming for tablet as well having trouble with something like 1.0f 400.0f means fixed-point is out of the question

12699156
int	chars
you can transform them back in int first level is 1 by default and chars

12699160
serializable	deserialization
and i m merely guessing here but intuitively i d say serializable deserialization of floating point types are costlier operations than the same operations on integral data types but even if there are differences they will be quite small on modern systems

12699161
urllib	cookielib
i have been doing a lot of searching and reading about using the libraries urllib urllib2 and cookielib but i haven t been able to figure out how to get it working properly

12699185
mouseover	mouseout
as you can see above i m trying to make a setinterval work when mouseout and stop when mouseover

12699185
mouseover	mouseout
so now you have to mouseover the div mouseout and after that animation will start

12699234
post	get
since i m allowing people to register their emails for future newsletters i figured that get would be the preferred method but i hear alot of people just say use post for everything

12699234
post	get
get or post

12699261

both are ok however mails will be hold in history by get if you dont want this you should use post

width	height
in my program there is a rectangle class which has methods to set it s width height and it s origin from a class called xypoint

12699277
width	height
the intersects method takes a rectangle as an argument arect and uses the containspoint method in an if statement to check if it intersects with the reciever and if it does return a rectangle with an origin at the intersect and the correct width and height

12699295
post	get
post is generally used to modify data on the server get should generally return data and be idempotent

rss	feed
in order to change the default rss feed you will modify the feed-myposttype.php template you made and redefine the action do_feed_rss2 like this

12699362
post	get
while post amd get would both work the actual preferred way is post

12699362

and yes you are right the user can read the get but they also can read modify your post so no point in taking that in consideration

12699394
multiplying	multiplication
i won t go into the details of fractional multiplication because i don t remember them but the important part is when multiplying to get a result c d then c is

cvs	svn
my foo bar.java migrated at cvs version 1.2.33.5 to svn as svn-rev.5678 would receive the following property

last change to my foo bar.java cvs version 1.2.33.4 was mapped to svn-rev.5145 which has the svn property set for our file to

12699405
cvs	svn
svn status log for that file can be easily browsed so can be both changes made to that file and the history of svn cvs property values

12699405

one major concern we have is how not to loose the svn cvs properties introduced during our first migration

12699409
put	get
to modify data use put to get metadata about data use head to remove data use delete you get the idea

12699454
put	get
i am trying to get a function to split a string containing several words which are separated by 1 or more spaces and put each word without any spaces into an index of an array of strings

12699482
free	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	calloc	malloc	realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc
on linux the man pages on free says it is illegal to call free on a pointer that was not returned by malloc calloc or realloc

12699482
free	malloc	int	chars
i ask this because i read that the c standard does not require different pointer types int and chars to have the same size and i fail to understand how this is possible since they both need to be convertible to a void in order to call the malloc free functions

12699507
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
safari and firefox display this perfectly but google-chrome has a 100px space at the top of the #content div

see site in google-chrome and then in firefox and safari

12699509
x86	64bit
i have used fixed point libs successfully in the past on x86 in the 386 486 era and they all used a 64bit intermediate for multiplies before the correcting shift in fact i seem to remember intel provided a very nice 32x32-to-64 bit multiply instruction which was just perfect for this

12699520
calloc	malloc	realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc
as long as the pointer passed to was returned by malloc realloc calloc it s valid

12699528
awt	swing
i m having some big trouble getting java s swing and awt libraries first time working with them to work correctly for me

12699536
int	chars
since int is bigger than chars an pointer could require less information to indicate what it points to

12699598
put	get
and my final option is you can put conditional logic into the template to get different html

12699617
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the solution so far works with google-chrome safari and firefox

gdk	cairo	pygtk	gdk
i am trying to draw into a gdk actually pygtk pixbuf with cairo

12699648
viewdidload	viewwillappear
to solve the problem instead i know that setting the images in viewwillappear instead of viewdidload and setting the images to nil in viewdiddisappear is releasing the memory and the app doesn t crash

12699663
google-chrome	firefox
and it work on google-chrome firefox etc.

for-loop	arrays
so i ran a for-loop to print what is inside the infix arrays at the beginning of my next function just to see.

multiplying	add
take your data 1 multiplying all amounts by -1 and add data 2 to it gives you

12699900
intersect	contains
your two rectangles intersect but the intersection does not contains either origin

12699919
accessor	properties
core data dynamically intercepts properties accessor at runtime

12699953
accessor	properties
properties can be used as though they are public data members but they are actually special methods called accessor

12699954
getter	setter
properties have a getter and a setter - their purpose is obvious to get and set the value of the property

12699969
width	height
if you set the height and width of your button to wrap_content instead you will find that it perfectly wraps text on multiple devices

12699975
getter	setter
of course you can also define the getter and setter methods yourself like this

12699981
lxml	elementtree
if you are not restricted to just using the standard library i suggest you install and use the lxml package which provides the elementtree and it has a number of advantages including easily allowing you to have multiple namespaces in the same document

12700024
namenode	hdfs
q5 they are stored in hdfs you cannot find the files directly on the local file system but they are stored in the location configured in hdfs-site.xml property dfs.data.dir but the files are stored as blocks and the namenode maintains a mapping between files names and block names

portrait	landscape
i m pulling images from the camera roll to display in my app and portrait taken pictures work just fine but landscape images get all funky smushed together

12700108
superclass	subclassing
so apparently if in the subclassing nslow i synthesize the array property then the getter from the superclass does not get called and the assertion fails

12700121
put	get
i am sorry that i don t have so much time go into textual details but here are my files might help to get an additional point of view on how to put all of this together

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it was broken in safari 6.0.1 and google-chrome 22.0.1229.79 and worked in firefox 15.0.1

12700126
margin	border-box	box-sizing	border-box	box-sizing	margin	width	border-box	width	margin
margin plays nice until i put width 100 on the element then it breaks out of the box even in box-sizing border-box

12700159
ivar	subclassing
if you want direct access to your ivar in the subclassing you can explicitly declare it in the header like this

12700572
subtraction	addition
in the code that follows i implement addition and subtraction using the same idea as in the question

12700572
subtraction	addition
the carry-in bit is used to implement subtraction via addition and this bit helps to get correct values of the carry-out and borrow-out bits

12700572
subtraction	addition
basically i implement typical cpu-like addition and subtraction with the carry flag in the status register

12700572
division	modulo
so it does both division and modulo and does them in a typical cpu-like way like the x86 div instruction

12700582

12701404
portrait	landscape
for coming to images with the size 480x800 have different look in portrait and landscape

12701454
int	chars
that means sprintf will never receive a chars -- a chars will always be promoted to int before sprintf receives it and a short will as well

12701454
int	chars
yes since what sprintf is receiving will be an int you can use x to convert it to hex format and it ll work the same whether that value started as a chars short or int

12701454
16-bit	64bit	int	chars
beware one point though if your chars is signed and you start with a negative value the promotion to int will produce the same numerical value which normally won t be the same bit pattern as the original chars so for example a chars with the value -1 will normally print out as ffff if int is 16-bit ffffffff if int is 32 bits or ffffffffffffffff if int is 64bit assuming the typical 2 s complement representation for signed int

12701471
ubuntu	linux
on ubuntu linux i executed the following commands

mouseover events such as image changeing and show hide divs on mouseover aren t working anymore..

12718600
qmainwindow	qwidget
you don t need to subclass qwidget qmainwindow but the qtcreator assistant for creating new projects and new ui files does so

12718600
qmainwindow	qwidget
if you would simply instantiate a qwidget qmainwindow and add behavior from outside by connecting to signals of the widgets you need to create from outside those instances could have different behaviors which is clearly not what we understand by object oriented design

12719015
getter	setter
it seems the .contents only works as getter not setter as you imply with .contents postcount see the api reference

width	height
for example if one button was only 20-pixels square and another was 50 the height and width properties would be different

12719484
google-chrome	firefox
the reason why this works for google-chrome is that it triggers the click event down to the input radio level while firefox doesn t have this kind of behavior

cassini	iis
cassini and iis not express from vs2012 work fine including localhost and the same projects that fail in iis express

this works fine in firefox but in google-chrome and ie the page gives an error for the code in the else block even if the condition is met and the else is unneeded

12719617
unification	inference
the reason this can happen with types without seeming as obviously absurd as the example with a lambda is because there are two notions of type variables floating around during unification you have variables representing undetermined types which are then identified with other such variables via type inference

12719649
width	height
i need some images only need to be fixed width and height

12719650
mvp	presenter
however the second solution doesn t feel like a good mvp in my belief since it seems to know what the presenter is doing and is just not letting the presenter do what it should do in the onresume method of the first solution

12719660

12719860
google-chrome	firefox
i m probably not the best person to discuss the specs in this regard but it seems to me that u+200b should be considered white space according to that when in fact the implementations at least google-chrome and firefox appear to treat them as an unexpected token or part of one causing the syntax error

12719902
post	get
use ajax and send required data using post get method and then set it to the session

12719905
getter	setter
the same could be said about the proposed getproperty function which among other things gives an observer access to the functions that implement a getter setter property

so to correct superm s example suppose you have a linearlayout with horizontal orientation that contains two imageview and a textview with

textview	imageview
you define the textview to have a fixed size and you d like the two imageview to take up the remaining space equally

12719917
textview	imageview
to accomplish this you would apply layout_weight 1 to each imageview none on the textview and a weightsum of 2.0 on the linearlayout

getter	setter
if the getter or setter method already exists it won t replace yours though

folder	directory
these all exist in a single www folder which happens to be the top level directory for all three projects

12721055
folder	directory
as you can see even without the whole .htaccess and favicon.ico being in multiple repositories mess i would just gitignore or --assume-unchanged them in the magento and boilerplate repos and use my private one for them the top level directory is www due to the way that magento splits code and themes into separate folder with a common parent of www

12721055
folder	directory

note since the internal for-loop positions after an int and the outside for-loop will increase the i variable when searching for the next int the algorithm will require at least one chars to separate the int but i think this is desirable

12721389
oncreate	setcontentview
or do something like this before your setcontentview in oncreate

12721431

to calculate the aspect ratio what you need to do is calculate the actual width and height of the image and calculate the ratio of uploaded image

12721636
int	double
oddly enough it was not the function that was the problem it was scan and printing as a double instead of an int

portrait	landscape
in case that i turn the camera while taking pictures on android 2.2. during on resume i can see my app in landscape mode for a tiny second then it figures out that it should not be in landscape it rotates back to portrait mode but doubles my action bar i get two icons two menus and then if i continue to use my app it crashes

12721741
int	boolean
python used to lack boolean we just used int 0 for false and any other int for true

12721741
int	boolean
so when boolean were added to the language the values false and true can be seen as the int values 0 and 1 still by the interpreter to help backwards compatibility

12721751
fgets	ftell
now php should be able to do everything with fopen ftell and fgets without requiring additional notification systems

while we could add these sorts of capabilities to the below code it is probably better to adopt an established proven solution that utilizes the nsoperationqueue and nscache technologies discussed below but also addresses the above issues

12721899
afnetworking	sdwebimage
the afnetworking and sdwebimage libraries both have uiimageview categories that gracefully handle all of these issues

12721899

12722557
for-loop	loops
unlike other for-loop constructs however foreach loops usually

12722662
margin	height	width	margin	width	height
this is impossible to achieve in a clean robust kind of way because anything you position as fixed is done so within the context of the main browser and within any scrollbar it has but because you removed the main body scrollbar and you must because you cannot z-index position on top of it it doesn t think anything is there yet you have this div below it so the only options you have are to use fixed margin and height for the two elements or use some javascript method to determine the correct width of your top div

12724119
superclass	subclassing
using this technique will allow you to easily make modifications to what is currently your superclass without having ripple effects on your current subclassing

it isn t authorization mechanism as there are better things for it it s just allow you to make sure that you won t delete record accidentally by writing the url manually so it can be for an example md5 hash of the records id

12724972
hash	salt
since a fixed hash is of absolutely no benefit it also seems that you are counting on the salt not being known by the attacker

12724972
hash	md5
move from md5 which is considered broken to another hash function better suited to this application

12724973
put	get
where i need to put the operations that get data from database on oncreate function onresume

12725009
hash	salt
the number of hash should also be persisted per user meaning you will need to store the triple of hash password salt and number of iterations

12725022
hash	salt
definately salt the password if someone did gain entry to your database they would not be able to reverse the passwords for common hash or using techniques such as rainbow attacks

12725023
hash	salt
salt are meant to be completely random and unrelated to the actual password you are storing a hash of

12725023
hash	salt
and store the user s username salt and hash password

to do that you need to use apache nginx in combination with some kind of add-on described later

12725137
apache	nginx
apache and nginx can also act as reverse proxies meaning that they can take an incoming http request and forward it to another server which also speaks http

12725137
apache	nginx
when that server responds with an http response apache nginx will forward the response back to the client

12725143
16-bit	64bit

the carry bit would permit add subtract and shift rotate of any multi-word length with the single accumulator

12725143

if your site is completely in javascript then ajax would be your friend since it enables you to raise get post xmlhttprequests

now you can raise a request using javascript c# php etc but you will always have to use the same uri provided by the rest api to make the call and get post the resource

uilabel	uitextview
now the uigesturerecognizer singletap is added to the uilabel and not to the uitextview

by the way if you insist on using nsoperationqueue and nsurlconnection you still need an iboutlet for your webview

if you grep out the lines that start with a tab and uniq that you will have a list of all paths you can filter-branch to remove or you can do something more complicated

12737514

nix command generally have two forms of output standard output stdout and standard error stderr

12738522
stdout	stderr

if you want the contents of stderr with this syntax you need to postfix your command with so that stderr is merged into stdout

matlab converts double indices to uint32 indices explicitly before the indexing call much like we do in the int test

12744520
int	double
matlab passes double and performs the double- int cast on the fly during the indexing call

then the add step is cubic-time since it s o n n being its argument which is o n 3 n being the argument of multiplying

12748667
getter	setter
for the record i do think that the text on the apple docs re blocks variables here is a bit misleading...the only variables that it mentions as being mutable are the __block function-level variables whereas it says all others can be accessed which i took as meaning read-only i know that both getter and setter are accessors but the context was confusing

12749193
rar	zip
i am not aware of truezip in particular but at least in terms of zip rar and tar you can access single files and retrieve details about them and even extract them without touching the rest of the package

you should use uchar instead of int or double since you are dealing with grayscale images

if i declare a new tcpclient and networkstream each time i call the send method about 60times per minute the data is sent seperately but thats not a very nice solution

12750214
folder	directory

12750229
ssl	https
they do not provide any web services to consume so instead they have a simple post over https with ssl

12750259
getter	setter
one solution i have seen is to rename roundedvalue to _roundedvalue and make it private and then add public methods to simulate getter and setter with rounding logic overriding setter on var

12750260
post	get
also there s a Ã¢ Ã¢ i take it it would be post when you submit your form or get otherwise if i understand your intention right

12750277
for-loop	arrays
of course if you initialized the arrays meaning that you filled the arrays with initial values explicitly using something like memset or a for-loop or a function call or whatever other means you ll get exactly what you expect the value with which you initialized it

12750520
width	height
if you do not specific a height or width it will expand to the proper size automatically i would recommend though you set a max-height or max-width and overflow hidden this is just for scenerios to control where the content came in way too big and over flow hidden will prevent scrollbars

12750596
put	get
you can call a ajax get to retrieve the html and get put it in your div

12750772

listboxitem	textbox
you can test this by forcing the listboxitem to be selected by clicking directly on it side-note you should always give it a background even if just transparent so it can receive mouse clicks which it won t if it s null or even just hitting shift-tab to set the focus there back from the textbox

versioning	upgrade
fork them make sure they re unit tested within themselves and depend on your fork or a versioning or commit or tag until you re ready to upgrade to the next versioning

12755143
ant	maven
unlike ant property values my.property maven properties are resolved at the start of the build which is ok if you know what the value will be at the start but if the property s value is determined somewhere in the middle of your build it is too late to access it its already been interpreted before it s been assigned so the value will be null or the empty string

12755143
dsl	dynamic-languages
there are much clearer and more expressive ways of writing a build - such as an internal dsl in a dynamic-languages that supports meta-programming ie gradle buildr

getter	setter
what you want are setter and getter functions inside your class

12755196
implements	extends
this seems impossible - just like javac changing classes that don t explicitly extends a base class to extends java.lang.object groovyc changes all groovy classes to implements groovy.lang.groovyobject

12755219
put	get
currently my service is able to handle get requests without issues but i m stuck trying to get it the update put request to work

i already have node.js express and socket.io running

12755258
post	get
in those options you can set the data parameter which is passed in as query parameters or as form parameters depending on if it s a post or get

12755263
post	get
for a pixmap use the getpixels method to get the pixel data convert that to a and then follow the example at this libgdx forum post

12755263
post	get
the post talks about using screenutils to scrape the screen and get an array of pixels

12755277

12755424
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
depending on your browser you can use tools like firebug for firefox or the build in developer tools in google-chrome safari right click anywhere on the page and click inspect element or use shortcuts to inspect the popup and find additional css selectors that you may want to modify

12755433
superclass	subclassing
then i have a subclassing that extends the superclass and i wish to access a and b but i dont know how

12755456
superclass	subclassing
protected members of a superclass are available to subclassing you need only reference them in any class that extends the superclass abstract superclass or otherwise

12755472
super	extends
the class should have access to a b just like that but if you declare an a or b that hides the class extends class if you want the a b from the super class you just use them like that

12755473
superclass	subclassing
if you have a subclassing that extends a superclass with protected methods such as

12755477
hide	show
i have a div id called message and a javascript function which show the message and after so many seconds calls another function to hide it

12755491
mouse	keyboard
i would like to perform a specific action when a user control clicks a cell and as far as i can tell the action handlers for these events are two unique independent functions and the parameters passed to cellclickedhandler don t allow me to get the state of the keyboard and any key presses that may be firing in conjunction with the mouse click

12755497
setinterval	settimeout
but understand than your function can not do this your function only can call settimeout or setinterval and hope this function work as expected

12755574
try-catch	exception-handling
i did it without try-catch and was getting format exception-handling

12755578

12755646
pop-up	dialog
i click on row 2 again it pop-up the edit dialog for row 2 this time

12755646
pop-up	dialog
it pop-up the edit dialog for row 2 thrice before it shows the dialog for row 3

12755708
for-loop	loops
when using a for-loop you don t need to define loops counter variables and keep track of them yourself in order to iterate over things

12755708
for-loop	loops
but instead of using a while loops use a for-loop and range len lst to iterate over a list of the range from zero to len lst - 1

12755727
portrait	landscape
it pushes another view controller modally that is a simple image viewer but i want this view controller to be able to rotate to any portrait or landscape orientation for obvious reasons

12755761
int	chars
c for chars d for int etc.

12755807
mouseover	mouseout
my first inclination is that you are missing the at the beginning of your mouseover mouseout functions

12755832
post	get
in the click event you make a post or a get and then you render what you whant in a div container.

12755836
post	get
you could load the entity like you do for the get request and do normal model binding to get the form data remember you can accept a different model for post backs than you spit out in your view then make the changes in the action

12755845
printf	getchar
since you re only allowed to use putchar and getchar i assume that you re not allowed to use printf in order to present the result

12755845
addition	multiplication
even if the operators would be evaluated in the right order multiplication before addition the result wouldn t be 6.333333 but 6

12755970
glut	sdl
in my experience glut can be very slightly faster than pygame for windowing by comparing glut and sdl

12755970
pyopengl	pyglet
pyglet isn t pyopengl although it is a python opengl implementation

12755975
firefox	safari
css3-mediaqueries.js by wouter van der graaf is a javascript library to make ie 5+ firefox 1+ and safari 2 transparently parse test and apply css3 media queries

12755975
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
firefox 3.5+ opera 7+ safari 3+ and google-chrome already offer native support

12755976
post	get
you could use post instead of get

12756056
apache	nginx
we use to do following in apache but don t know how to do it in nginx

12756062
superclass	subclassing
you can refer to a subclassing by its superclass

12756083
google-chrome	firefox
this works for ie firefox google-chrome properly

12756094
puts	gets	puts	putchar	putchar	gets
the function getchar and gets a character from the console and putchar puts a character to the console

12756125
min	max
i want it to stop at certain limits or boundaries min and max in the x axis

12756131
int	chars
a chars value 0 does not equal the int value 0 on in ascii it has the int value 48

12756142
superclass	subclassing
it also allows you to pass in your superclass to a method instead of the subclassing for example

12756158
keydown	keyup
this all is assuming of course that it is alright if you fire your function in the keydown event rather than in the keyup

12756166
ienumerable	ilist
this is returning an ilist which again is polymorphed into the more general ienumerable because that s all the calling code is going to use

12756166
ilist	iqueryable	ienumerable	iqueryable	ienumerable	ilist
in the case of returning an ienumerable above the types moved from more specific iqueryable and ilist to more generic ienumerable

12756231
integer	unsigned
with 32 bit code your unsigned integer size will be too small after about 47 numbers in the sequence

12756238
int	chars
short byte or chars values may also be used as index values because they are subjected to unary numeric promotion Ã¢ 5.6.1 and become int values

12756292
width	height
width height seem to always ahve to be set together

12756297
google-chrome	safari
wow64 applewebkit 537.4 khtml like gecko google-chrome 22.0.1229.91 safari 537.4 browser.version

12756313
google-chrome	firefox
but problem is that it opens in a pop up and google-chrome and firefox do block the pop up

12756362
pdfsharp	itextsharp
i m using itextsharp and pdfsharp they seem to not work well without one another

12756400
width	height
a 9th of the size of course means that both width and height is divided by 3

12756426
width	height
width height seem to always have to be set together

12756452
google-chrome	firefox
open the firefox content dialog or google-chrome developer tools and review all your links

12756458
int	boolean
this following set of code is my user defined class and the methods i will be testing are boolean add e e e remove int n void print_from_beginning and void print_from_end

12756477
width	height
i think it s referring to setting the width and height on the element that your targeting rather than in the .ir css class itself

12756542
google-chrome	firefox
also works differently for all main browsers ie firefox and google-chrome

12756561
put	get
you can put any attribute to any tag that you need and access them using selector .attr attr_name to get the value html5 defines some data- attributes to store thing like that

12756563
portrait	landscape
specifically looking at your storyboard i m inferring that your goal is to have one view controller for portrait and another for landscape

12756575
getter	setter
should it handle getter and setter methods or talk directly to fields

12756588
width	height
my generated textures only need to be 64x64 but because i m using my main renderer window width by window height for both it s unnecessarily rendering the webglrendertargets at a much larger resolution

12756612
width	height
i want to able to detect the position as in x y width and height of face s in a given 2d photo

12756630
post	get
the p commandbutton does a post and not a get so it can t use f param

12756645
fieldset	formpanel	formpanel	gridpanel
when i replace the gridpanel with fieldset or other type the formpanel does appear regardless of the bad format

12756664
ubuntu	linux
this is ubuntu linux for what it s worth

12756712
put	get
i know that the enumeration is working because if i put in i get ten for the devcount

12756745
post	get
then you just need to make simple get post calls to the server and parse the returned json in android using classes in package from android library itself

12756791
move	drag
yet another reason this might happen tonight i met the dreaded error and eventually discovered an errant mouse drag apparently move one of my own packages classes into the hierarchy of another

12756804
getter	setter
i am trying to create a property i with the following getter and setter

12756812
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i tested it and work for me in google-chrome ie8 firefox and safari

12756817
getter	setter
you need a backing field if you have any kind of logic in your property otherwise automatic properties are the way to go - currently you are assigning to the property itself which again calls your setter code likewise for the getter - that causes the stackoverflow exception

12756828
typedef	struct
then i went to use some typedef d struct from the library

12756832
post	get
most jsf requests are post s anyway so if you use the path to the jsf page you re intending to handle the post request you can then get the parameter within a managed bean that is backed by that page or get the parameter within the page itself

12756845
getter	setter
the problem in your code is that you specified i in the property which was referring to itself inside the body of getter setter turning to be cyclic effect and eventually stackoverflow error

12756847
for-loop	loops
but just an fyi - since you are learning - you can also do the exact same thing with a for-loop instead of the while loops

12756850
apache	nginx
it is solved via two complementary mechanisms 1 putting rails node behind a dedicated webserver written in c and tested to hell and back like nginx or apache lighttd

12756859
post	get
the response.redirect will make the browser do a get request for the page so if the user hits f5 they ll just redo the get and not post the form again

12756859
post	get
this approach is sometimes called the post redirect get pattern

12756867
subtract	add
if your goal is to convert an arbitrary datetime from utc to local time then it s more complicated because the offset that you need to add subtract depends on the original datetime

12756922
firefox	safari
safari firefox preview

12756926
mouseout	mouseleave
the mouseleave event differs from mouseout in the way it handles event bubbling

12756937
min	max
you can do away with sentinel with a different setting of min and max

12756952
post	get
this way you can still post on their behalf and your app can get certain information from their profile to relay on to them without you ever needing to know their password

12756977
post	get
however when i try to do a get or post to the rest resource i get a - 404 not found error

12756994
typedef	struct
you have a declaration for a typedef to struct sp_session but struct sp_session is an incomplete type

12756995
prepare	execute
you need to execute the prepare statement before calling

12757017
min	max
min length of fishes was 34.5 and max length of fishes was 49.5

12757019
width	height
override methods which control width and height of your custom field

12757117
google-chrome	firefox
broken firefox 14.0a1 2012-04-12 -win7 broken google-chrome 20.0.1096.1

12757147
width	height
also one more problem is when you are in full-screen mode by pressing f11 the popup window is of full width and height as that of screen specifically on mozzila whereas i need that popup of size 600 600 overlapping the main window

12757185
namenode	checkpoint
there s a secondary checkpoint namenode that can you startup and configure

12757185
namenode	hdfs
this will help keep hdfs up and running in the event that your primary namenode goes down

12757187
put	get
and this is the code that i get access and put a string-grid..

12757231
post	get
fyi while asking questions post error log too then only you can get quick and proper answers

12757274
int	double
in this particular case the code won t compile if you try and take a double variable x and assign it s value to an int variable y

12757274
int	double
so you have to explicitly tell the compiler to cast convert the type from a double to an int

12757332
int	boolean
but this only seems to works for functions of type int boolean and not int boolean

12757382
folder	directory
so if your website is in the folder home ec2-user public_html you would then need to give access to that directory

12757403
snmp	mib
here it is defined as an adapted subset of asn.1 structure of management information smi is specified in snmp to define sets of related mib objects

12757406
ubuntu	linux
i am using swipl in ubuntu linux which is in virtualbox on winxp

12757421
width	height
you can also specify some fixed size height and width to windows if you want like

12757422
migrate	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
note moreover we have a plan to migrate our website from asp.net 1.1 to 4.0 versioning in future.so it should be that much supportive for future upgrade

12757468
implements	extends
i know that probably get_fields method could become a method of metaclass but this would make inheritance much harder to implements you would have to define both new metaclass and class itself not nice to developers wanting to extends this classes

12757483
superclass	subclassing
however it is subclassing of uilabel and tried to change the color by using condition that it s superclass is uilabel and text is cancel

12757493
disk	ram
this buffer is not ram memory with file s contents copied but it s a virtual memory whose access directly maps to a file on disk

12757563
hide	show
decrease the height of the uitableview works when you want to hide the extra rows and only want to show the specific rows

12757604
memcached	apc
i have also heard about apc and memcached

12757610
post	put
i put an extremely basic together as a proof of concept before noticing prashanth s post

cos	sin	cos	atan2	atan2	sin
westmost lon_r + atan2 sin due_west sin distance_in_miles radius cos lat_r cos distance_in_miles radius -sin lat_r sin lat_r

12757667
ubuntu	linux
i m trying to port an app built with code blocks in linux ubuntu to windows

12757669
post	put
it looks straightforward enough to extract the comments from the dotclear export file and using the post id associate them with the url of the original post and then put that in a skeleton wxr file

12757676
post	get
i dont know how this error comes when i try this lots of times so i saw differnt post in stackoverflow but i doent get solution

12757767
websphere	ibm
websphere does not support custom namespace extension other than the one provided by ibm

12757779
put	get
i have to put arabic in nsurlconnection but the problem is that when i am not able to see arabic string properly using nslog i get following string

12757814
pull	push
you will then be able to clone push pull your remote repo with the uri yourserver yourrepo which will refer to the yourserver entry of your config file

12757818
strcpy	calloc
the strcpy will put its nul byte at a place that does not belong to the calloc ed object

12757867
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine on firefox and google-chrome

12757867
mouse	keyboard
the problem is that when a page loads up some of dropdownlists open up by clicking on them they also accept keyboard inputs but some of them don t accept inputs mouse and keyboard at all

12757887
getter	setter
do same whatever you have done foe username make it string instead of boolean in setter method like setter and getter methods

12757892
translation	localization
so if to add german localization my translation would go under de.lproj localizable.strings italian under it.lproj and so on

12757980
joomla	phpbb
you can use this to install joomla drupal phpbb or even you custom script

12757988
portrait	landscape
while i am able to embed an image in my html file and get the image up on screen i can t seem to preserve the correct orientation - essentially it reproduces my jpg in landscape when it should be portrait

12757989
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
i ve deployed an application to amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk

12757994
int	boolean
in php you can use followed constructions string for string data int and float for numeric data bool for boolean data

12757996
post	put
anyway you should not put unrelated questions in the same post

12758014
width	margin
for some unknown reason the container div which has a fixed width and a margin of 0px auto is aligning to the left and not the center of the page

12758035
post	get
so on the post back the grid up to the point you try to get the id from the cell is empty

12758035
post	get
two ways ether give again the data on post back and make databind right after the update or get the index of the grid view to make the update and not take the cell

12758060
piston	tastypie
i recommend to take a look on tastypie which turned out to work even nicer than piston it helps you also with things like versioning your api and mamange multiple endpoints nicly

12758062
cos	sin
c c cos angle c sin angle

12758065
width	height
if you just specify the width the height will be scaled automatically according to the aspect ratio of the original image vice versa if you just specify the height

12758072
width	height
it is only when my website is viewed through a mobile device that i want the categories page to be displayed in conformance with iphone width and height display

12758080
children	parent
when changing data ensure that it is valid at all times insert a parent before its child and delete all children before their parent

12758103
getter	setter
i don t really understand your idea but basing what i understood from your description i d recommend you to look into inline getter and setter on components which would also modify container

12758120
firepath	firebug
also do not forget to verify found locators in firepath firebug addon in ffox

12758161
postgresql	mysql
i am myself trying to find the answer for postgresql but here is what you can do for mysql

12758169
piston	tastypie
update use tastypie instead of piston

12758193
spaces	delimiter
i have the following spaces delimiter input

12758212
post	get
you can directly use wordpress in-build feature to get all post titles

12758213
width	height
when you set height only and not width or vice versa browsers scale the image so that the width height ratio is preserved

12758215
carrierwave	paperclip
i would recommend looking at using something such as dragonfly paperclip or carrierwave to handle file uploads in your application rather than hand-coding this

12758219
children	parent
now say i have a a parent-child relationship and each parent can have like 50 children and the ui requires partial data for all the children also to be shown when the parent is clicked

12758219
children	parent
the other approach is to have a separate api which will give out the parent as well as partial info about the children instead of just the uris

12758277
hash	salt
now if you re using only local cookies and store like a hash portion of the the clients password + combined with a salt that only your server knows a hacker can still gain access to his account by stealing his cookie from his pc

12758286
post	get
if a user does multiple post at once they may get them through since more than one process could read the count both increase their daily_post_count and both store the old value + 1 if they ran after each other they d store old value + 2 in the end not very likely to be a problem

12758295
versioning	upgrade
please upgrade or change your memcached versioning

12758305
junit	testng
which you can use in combination with junit 4+ testng and so on for

12758313
put	get
the problem is solved as i said before my program executed but with an error the problem was the picture directory i ve put it in the source file beside main.cpp the problem is that if u want to get a real result using debug or release mode u should actually put the picture in those two directories and then run make another time

12758323
webclient	httpwebrequest
i suggest using httpwebrequest or webclient

12758329
rss	feed
you simply configure wp to render you an rss feed and then either import those entries into tt_news

12758329
rss	feed
alternatively you can simply display the rss feed on your site right away using an extension such as rss_display

12758336
textview	listadapter
and listadapter in method getview i m setting textview in asynctask using method settextview of asynctask

12758352
multiplying	multiplication
from the above explanation you can also understand that even in the first assignment if the result of your multiplication of integers before multiplying it with 365l goes out of range then again it will be truncated to fit in integer range or converted to 2 s complement representation if required and then only it will be multiplied with the long value - 365l

12758357
hash	salt
if you only rely on cookies for sessions it doesn t really matter if you use a session id or a hash of the user s credentials plus a salt unique to that user

12758363
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
all those try-catch statements for runtimeexception s like nullpointerexception and arrayoutofboundsexception are normally not needed

12758380
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i try to make a div over applet and works fine in firefox google-chrome and safari on mac

12758414
versioning	upgrade
i would like to upgrade mysql to versioning 5.5

12758414
innodb	myisam
as i understand it mysql has changed the default engine from myisam to innodb which is now a requirement for joomla 3.0

12758447
innodb	myisam
converted all tables to myisam some including the content table were innodb

12758450
floating-point	integer
while integer multiplication is associative when the operands are all of the same type floating-point multiplication is not associative

12758469
profiler	nvvp
i have been testing the results with the nvvp nvidia profiler

12758498
jar	manifest.mf
the manifest.mf file in the meta-inf folder in the root of the jar file contains the following

12758498
jar	manifest.mf
the manifest.mf in the inner jar file the actual program is empty

12758503
folder	directory
my raw algorithm not yet implemented in c++ takes a lot of time and sometime might fail to search a file so i came up with the decision to search for files in the os file table directory because the location and names of all the files and folder are already present in it

12758516
guava	lambdaj
see for examples of how these closures will be used in the collection apis and how they compare with pre-java 8 solutions like guava and lambdaj

self.aspect width float height

12758618
ubuntu	linux
i don t get your question because ubuntu does not introduce new filesystems or other user-space-related things so you can code for ubuntu like you can code for any gnu linux os out there but there are really good utilities already in place like locate and find

12758634
ubuntu	linux
you should be aware that ubuntu is just a distribution of linux and that linux in turn has a standard unix system api often termed posix

12758634
ubuntu	linux
therefore you should better ask search using the term linux or unix or even posix instead of ubuntu

12758637
width	height
i ve tried setting width and height on the canvas attr and css scaling to devicepixelratio backingstoreratio and anything else i can google up -

12758782
viewdidload	viewdidappear
setting its size in viewdidload or viewdidappear doesn t work because later on the size will be overwritten by _applyisenginelayoutvalue

12758840
explode	implode
you can use explode + array_chunk + array_map + implode

12758885
int	chars
this is deliberate - it makes parsing simple get chars get int add them both to an array or linked list

12758905
filesystems	hfs

if the data is ordered so that children of a parent always follow after it s parent you can solve this with one database-query over all data by skipping hidden nodes in the output

12759048
int	boolean
jsf and jstl both access boxed objects boolean int etc directly

12759093
put	get
put it in your index.php to save cookie when page loads - if i get your purpose correctly

12759135

if container and objects have common properties then you could make a base table item which contains the common properties and your container and object tables which contain only the extra data inherited

12759148
width	margin
playing with css border margin padding and width i came across an extra pixel.

12759148

12759166
post	get
i do not have a current solution but looking at other post i can see several examples of how to get the subdomain

12759219
stdout	stderr
in 10.8 they stopped automatically forwarding stderr to the console so might be an idea to pipe the applications stdout and stderr to a file to see if you have a stack trace

12759234
children	parent
so far with the help of other answers here i can get a plist of all the objects but all on the same level or a plist of the ultimate parent object but the children relationship is faulted

12759239
primefaces	richfaces
we are using richfaces but the solution that we used in this case may apply to primefaces as well

12759289
width	height
you also need to set the width and height fields

12759296

jstl	taglib
you need to import the jstl core taglib

12759430

i realized that the number helper only works for int but i thought using might allow me to bind a double

12759449

superclass	subclassing
you cannot decrease the visibility of any instance variable or method of the superclass in your subclassing

12759533
public	protected
if the overridden or hidden method is protected then the overriding or hiding method must be protected or public

12759548
superclass	subclassing	accessor	superclass
make the variable private in the superclass and let all subclassing use accessor methods

12759554
public	protected
you cannot add restrictions to an instance variable in a subclass of health is protected in enitity it cannot be private in zombie you can make it public

12759554
getter	setter
however you can make health private in entity and define a protected getter and setter there

12759559
box-sizing	margin	width	margin
you problem occurs because when you fixed the width for instance at 100px the box with its border will have a width of 100px due to the box-sizing property so your increase of margin is not compensated by a shrinking of the box which occurs when you do not set its width

12759559
margin	border-box	box-sizing	border-box	box-sizing	margin	width	border-box	width	margin
with a fixed width and box-sizing set as border-box you should not modify the margin property at all to avoid the other box moving

google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried it in firefox and google-chrome

12759595

12759836
jython	pypy
if you run your code with jython or ironpython and maybe pypy in the future it will run in parallel

12759845
peer	p2p
also to be noted that p2p networks get stronger the more they grow you could aswell implement that peer already connected to the network and reachable from the outside help those others to connect to the other peers.you should look up p2p relaying and hole punching

12760154
google-chrome	firefox
i am stuck up here.below code works fine in firefox but not on google-chrome ie

12760177
google-maps-api-3	infowindow
if you are using the google maps api v3 and not just google maps as is implied by your tags though you really should add the google-maps-api-3 tag to the post nothing prevents you from having multiple infowindow open at the same time

12760189
primefaces	richfaces
i think you should use primefaces datable they have a really nice out of box datatable with a lot of freatures including lazy loading or you can use richfaces or anyother component suite

12760206
portrait	landscape
one is for portrait mode and the other one for landscape mode

12760230
opera	firefox
i have this code which works fine in chromium and firefox but opera does not fire the load event because it cannot deal with the image data

12760457

viewcontroller2 must support landscape + portrait orientation

12760457

you don t appear to actually be assigning the width or height to the canvas itself just the canvaselement object you have wrapping it

12760787
quicksort	mergesort
i have managed to implement insertionsort and quicksort in a couple of lines but selectionsort and mergesort still give me headaches

12760793
mouse	keyboard
this will allow excel to respond to mouse and keyboard input whenever the code hits the doevents command which should be rather often

12760795
children	parent
every invocation of a naive check will succeed since every parent is between its children

12760812

google-chrome	firefox
but in google-chrome 22 firefox 13 every time a new song begins the player stops playback

12760812
mp3	ogg	google-chrome	firefox
i m thinking this might have something to do with the fact that google-chrome and firefox use the ogg source while ie uses mp3

12760823

getter	setter
i only doubt because i have another model class which simply has getter setter for all the columns and now creating another class singleton to represent columns as index seems like an added effort

12760929

12760983
implements	extends
if 2 interfaces extends each other a implementation could implements both interfaces just fine

12761022
inline-functions	inlining
for the purposes of run-time performance the compiler probably does the right choice in most cases if it can see that a function is too big to benefit from inlining it is likely to generate a non-inlined version of any inline-functions independently of the function being a template or not

12761053
getter	setter
when we are defining getter and setter methods for name in the following code

12761068

int	chars
if that happens to be the system codepage you might not even be able to ever get these chars into a string literal but if the wchar_t version works you can also construct the filename using the int codes for the chars

12761504

another way would be with an attached properties like groupname where you can group selectors listbox inherited from selector to ensure only one selector in the group has a selected item at any one time

12761515

now on post back i d like to get each individual lbattributetags selected value

12761532
equals	compareto

width	height
the thumbnails must have 160px width and 240px height regardless what the actual size of the pictures are.some photos fit exactly after resizing them

12761582
width	height
others because the width is larger than the height doesn t fit properly.that s why i crop them they must be centered in order to make sence

12761627
comparator	comparable
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a treeset instance performs all element comparisons using its comparator or compare method so two elements that are deemed equals by this method are from the standpoint of the set equals

12761695
post	get
you could use a combination of get and post parameters do achieve what you want

i can pull data down no problem but i am trying to post to the server and just can seem to get this to even fire

12762047
int	chars
this is why the chars in your third struct is being padded with three more bytes so that the following unsigned int starts at an address that is a multiple of the word size

12762058
super	self
although if you override a member of a self type you lose access to the original member which can still be accessed through super using inheritance

12762060
versioning	upgrade
try to upgrade to a more recent versioning of autotest to see if this warning disappears and if not maybe open a ticket for the autotest project

12762062

12762079
gson	jackson
but consider object mapper s like gson or jackson

12762105
integer	unsigned
but the problem here is that it s unsigned int so it s treated as a very big positive integer which is 4294967184 because it doesn t treat the first 1 as a sign bit

12762118
namenode	hdfs
now we want to configure hadoop in a way that the namenode also as a datanode in this case has a copy of the entire data on hdfs such that the cluster can always recover data from it

12762166
cstdio	iostream
if we re not mixing cstdio and iostream we can turn it off and then iostream is fastest

12762181
width	height
i would declare a fixed height amount but it is going to be a mobile site and each of the images need to have a percentage width which means that the height will change depending on the mobile device

bluetooth	usb
you can probably find keypads that connect to a computer over a serial usb or bluetooth connection

12762440
ethernet	wireless
you can probably also find keypads that connect over wired or wireless ethernet

12762478
rss	feed
the app i m writing loads an rss feed using the horrorrss library

12762478
rss	feed
i realize that there is an issue with the simpledateformat class as described in this question and it looks like the rssparser.getdate function uses it to extract the date from the rss feed

12762478
rss	feed
but every single time i load an rss feed i get dozens of these logs

12762478
public	protected
update i have submitted an issue to the horrorrss project to make their rssparser.getdate method protected or public

12762482
rel	src
what i am doing is that on a certain trigger let s say when a button is clicked somewhere else on the page to change the span s to img s with the src set to the rel in each span

12762595
int	chars
what i want to do is to send bytes with winsock which might represents int chars arrays or something else

12762618
debian	centos
the right question should be how to install the tools you need in debian or centos or whichever distribution you wish to use

12762647
uilabel	textkit
as of ios7 this is no longer true since uilabel uses textkit for its rendering which is based on coretext as well

12762662
width	height
the part that needs scrolling are the 100 width height panels which are inside the container which is a scrolling div

12762669
put	get
you need to put 0x2000004 in rax to get this program to work on mac os x

12762728
carrierwave	minimagick
using carrierwave with minimagick on rails 3.1.3

12762751
google-chrome	safari
this should fix the position when document scrolled in google-chrome and safari

12762789
post	get
when the form is submitted it forwards to the correct page on the www subdomain but the post parameters are lost - the page on the www subdomain is requested with an http get request regardless of the request type of the original request

12762865
int	chars
i have an input stream containing int and special meaning chars #

12762893
getter	setter
on top of that my understanding of getter and setter is such that you would do the query in your getter

12762986
getter	setter
to update the text to a currently existing jtextfield i would establish the jtextfield as a class variable and create a setter getter method to adjust it which i m assuming you re doing

12763021
width	height
therefore your solution is to either use javascript to dynamically modify the height and width of the inner table or move away from tables and use divs css

12763054
min	max
i might be wrong but you are testing min and max coordinates sampled from the x y pool which means they will all be on the contour of the triangle

12763056
post	get
i got a problem on nginx 0.9.6 centos about gzip when i use post method the gzip works but but when i use get method it doesnt work

12763070
inherited	properties
as long as it has the same method properties names the program will use them regardless of sub super static inherited

12763103
width	height
you need to define exact width and height to the li to resolve this kind of issue

12763120
uiview	subviews
probably you can just add its view as as a subviews of detailviewcontroller and use uiview animation to make it look like modal

12763165
width	height
to expand on eng.fouad s answer you ll want to use the drawimage ... method that takes 6 parameters image x and y location image width and height and image observer and draw it like so from within a jpanel

12763173
wtl	atl
mfc atl wtl use map concept to define message-to-member mapping in developer friendly way

12763192
packets	pcap
i have application how open tshark process and start capturing packets this process create pcap file on the disk and from my main form i am checking this class properties and update my gui

12763194
pop-up	dialog
when i run the program and select libatestplugin.so from the build directory of my library project in the file dialog that pop-up i see no message box which means plugin is null

12763290
stdout	stderr
strangely sox provides its output to stderr and not stdout hence the need for

12763311
udp	tcp
binding is not only used for tcp sockets but for udp sockets as well and other protocols too

12763335
tcplistener	tcpclient
in any event using either tcplistener tcpclient or socket you will need to loop on reading on the stream into a buffer

12763338
postgresql	mysql
several databases on different dbsm postgresql mysql oracle firebird etc

12763348
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
tested in ie6 7 8 9 firefox google-chrome safari

12763349
createelement	each
the simplest way to do this would be to make use of createelement and appendchild while looping over an array to create a form element containing a hidden input for each element of the array with a name such as to satisfy the algorithm php uses to populate and friends and then submit the form

12763379
powerpc	i386
the behavior appears to be a legacy of when arch was used to distinguish between powerpc and i386 platforms when intel support was first introduced in os x

12763395
alarmmanager	wakelock
the only effective way to execute something at a specific time is to use alarmmanager with a rtc_wakeup alarm type and a broadcast pendingintent where you do your work completely inside onreceive of the broadcastreceiver if it is short or use a wakelock and a service to do the work or possibly my wakefulintentservice

12763422
comparator	comparable
std map requires that the key be comparable either with or a provided comparator

12763446
post	put
and its friends post put delete head patch are only shortcuts and will fire a request immediately

12763473
hide	show
you hide this widget when collapsing and show it when expanding

12763498
hide	show
when using this in a form i want to advice you to take a look at this page show hide fields depending on select value

12763509
children	parent
in this system every node references at most two other nodes its first child if it has any children and its next sibling unless it is the last sibling of its parent

12763517
calloc	malloc
so you have to define the struct dynamically with malloc or calloc

12763580
domxpath	domdocument
you can use domdocument to parse that xml and get all items using domxpath then loop in all items and get the attributes based on position id 0 name 2 then create an new array that will hold all you item id s with their names

12763598
for-loop	arrays
i ve tried arrays and for-loop but can t get it to work

12763611
int	double
i am trying to split a string up into the farm name then a double acres and finally a int jars

12763631
submit	submission
at the moment it s local to your form submission so it cannot be accesses outside that form submit action

12763631
post	get
also please be aware that mixing get and post data is a very bad habit

12763631
post	get
there should only be get or post data present in a single request not both

12763632
pop-up	dialog
i m also using timeout dialog to set a timer that has a pop-up which will warn people before they are automatically logged off

12763657
google-chrome	safari
doesnt work on android ios native browsers and on google-chrome or on safari

12763706
mouse	keyboard
i prefer to use the keyboard instead of the mouse

12763715
int	chars
well the reason it s there is because windows is forcing it to a size other than it s normal size plus an int number of chars sizes

12763797
folder	directory
the implementation is very slow on a folder containing 50 000 files and 12 000 sub directory

12763800
decoder	encoder
the encoder is just a simple onetooneencoder that encodes an envelope type to a channelbuffer and the decoder is a simple replaydecoder that does the opposite

12763830
textview	imageview
inside the getview i assign relevant information for the textview s and use imageloader class to download image and assign it to the imageview

12763832
rank	percentile
so the equation would be something like 1 3 percentile column1sum + 1 3 percentile column2sum + 1 3 percentile column3sum where percentile is the percentile rank of the column vs the rest of the column

12763832
rank	percentile
in my case percentile is the percentage rank from highest to lowest of a given column adjusted for repeats

12763849
profiling	debugging
i was able to get symbolication back in the device profiling by going to edit scheme in xcode and changing the profiling build to debugging instead of release

12763853
onresume	onpause
put in some code in your onpause method to save your data to a db a file or sharedpreferences and then put code in the onresume method to retrieve that data

12763855
width	height
floated elements are taken out of the document flow and as a result their containers don t know anything about their width or height unless they are floated

12763857
equals	gethashcode
finally the whole method can be made rather simpler without even needing the hasduplicate flag or any overriding of equals gethashcode

12763874
getter	setter
i know i can create empty setter and getter for this parameters but i better not Ã¢ for the sake of code cleanliness

12763938
put	get
however when i do a put i get the following error

12763955
uitableview	nsindexpath

12763961
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
yes this is possible with just css3 but will only work in safari google-chrome and recent versions of opera mozilla firefox and ie10 as you need css3 animation keyframes to preserve the end-state of the transition

12764062
children	parent
any node a that has children is the first node listed in a new graph and this graph is listed in its parent graph in a particular order to be determined later

12764062
children	parent
any node a that has no children is listed in its parent graph in a particular order to be determined later

12764062
children	parent
h is the first child of o but it has no children so it s listed in its parent as-is not as the start of a subgraph oh

12764062
children	parent
h is the second child of o but is has no children so it s listed in its parent as-is not as the start of a subgraph ohh

12764062
children	parent
h is the first child of h but is has no children so it s listed in its parent as-is not as the start of a subgraph o hh

12764062
children	parent
any node a that has children is the first node listed in a new graph and this graph is listed in its parent graph in a particular order see step 4

12764062
children	parent
any node a that has no children is listed in its parent graph in a particular order see step 4

12764067
realloc	malloc
i believe that since the gist of what i want to do is reallocate memory to the same variable i should have looked into realloc instead of malloc

12764083
division	multiplication
the bit cost of multiplication and division of two numbers with n bits is with arbitrary arithmetics o n 2

12764083
subtraction	addition
addition subtraction comparisons and assigning variables are all o n n being the number of bits for arbitrary precision arithmetic

12764085
ubuntu	linux
the issue here is that ubuntu linux has a default blocksize of 1024 not 512

12764137
subnet	packets
you can t sniff packets sent from someone unless you are part of the same subnet - you would have to be connected to the same switch and be on the same virtual lan as that user

12764160
hide	show
hey you can do one thing onload call an action of server side through ajax call into by returning javascript it will never show in your view source but it can be visible by firebug but its a way to sequre your javascript protuct from others to use it in a easy way i have done it one of my project even by this method you can hide your html too

12764174
folder	directory
itscurrently in my wedding directory i assume this is correct as the domain start folder is here

12764176
google-chrome	firefox
it works in google-chrome and firefox but not in ie 9 and below

12764184
box-sizing	border-box	width	border-box
box-sizing border-box on all element ensures that width 25 includes padding and borders inside

12764184
children	parent
using font-size 0 on the parent and font-size 16px on the children eliminates the white space caused by line-breaks between inline-block elements

12764195
queue	fifo
i would like to implement a queue capable of operating both in the fifo mode and in the priority mode

12764236
background-color	transparency
background-color transparency

12764263
client-side	server-side
you have to distinguish between something you store server-side seen by all users and something stored client-side for every user separately

12764277
subtract	add
basically use dateadd day 0 datediff day 0 date1 to get the date by itself then get the number of milliseconds into that day by subtract the total date by the result of the above computation and add them to the new date

12764315
multiplying	multiplication
the cost of multiplying two int is o 32 2 using a naive multiplication algorithm for better algos look here

12764315
subtraction	addition
as far as addition and subtraction goes i would say that they both have a bit cost of o n where n is the number of bits of the smaller operand

12764341
hash	md5
md5 is considered broken and it is ways too fast to hash passwords

12764349
folder	directory
then you might also use file copy for moving things intot the temporary folder and even file chdir for managing the working directory

12764379
jquery	anythingslider
at start of code is anythingslider that i use on my newest theme at the end of code is jquery code to add css style to my table in themes

google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in ie and firefox but when i try to open it in google-chrome i get a blank white page

12764420
fink	homebrew	fink	macports	macports	homebrew
i would suggest using a 3rd party package system to install the read readline such as macports fink or homebrew

12764463
arcpy	pysal
i only have access to open source modules pysal shapely etc not arcpy

12764473
ubuntu	linux
in a repository that was created in ubuntu linux and compiled under openjdk 6 when implementing locationlistener and sensorlistener adding the override tag above the inherited methods compiles fine

12764480
requestfactory	gwt
- requestfactory gwt 2.5rc2 before 2.5rc1 and 2.4 - makes no difference regarding the question

12764499
for-loop	loops
i do not understand why iterating through a container with a for-loop produces different results than iterating through it with a while loops

12764515
for-loop	loops
your while loops is not equivalent to the for-loop

12764544
pop-up	dialog
my application currently consists of an xna application embedded within a form and i have a button to open the preview panel which in theory should pop-up as a form dialog containing the xna renderer to allow me to draw the preview

12764596
google-chrome	firefox
trace.html does not open in firefox try using google-chrome

12764629
int	chars
im currently implementing a rc4 decryption and as this algorithm only operates on numbers between 0-255 i want to write as safe code as possible and properly use unsigned chars variables instead of plain int ones

12764649
integer	unsigned
the standard guarantees arithmetic on unsigned integer types to be arithmetic modulo 2 n where n is the number of value bits in the type so the arithmetic will be correct

12764649
integer	unsigned
unsigned integers declared unsigned shall obey the laws of arithmetic modulo 2 n where n is the number of bits in the value representation of that particular size of integer

12764649
integer	unsigned
46 this implies that unsigned arithmetic does not overflow because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is reduced modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value that can be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type

12764655
versioning	upgrade
according to the nice folks at bryntum once i upgrade from the free-trial versioning of the bryntum scheduler i will be able to get rid of the shim and simply rely on the sencha.cfg classpath pointing at the bryntum src

12764686
post	get
it seems to me that model.fetch fires a get request and model.save fires a post request instead

12764693
maven	pom.xml
if your using maven put this in your pom.xml

12764701
for-loop	loops
in your second for-loop you are calling next cloc but loops is initialized as for each cdeptname

12764718
daemons	systemd
i also use a lot and have lots of systemd listening to a common spread daemons

12764723
for-loop	loops
you need to declare your variable outside the for-loop and keep on adding input numbers to it in loops

12764734
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
here s jsfiddle that works in google-chrome safari firefox and ie9

12764758
gentoo	debian	gentoo	linux	debian	linux
i m installing openmpi-1.4.5 from source code into gentoo with backward compatibility of glibc_2.11 for running under nfs cluster hpc with one debian gnu linux squeeze compute node

12764758
gentoo	debian
if i manually change the linker for this executable run into gentoo debian via nfs and finally running

12764775
restrict	shared
i don t see any reason to restrict it to images or video or something like that but for the life of me i can t figure out how to make it work for any random file some other app wants to shared

12764782
implements	extends
if you then give an instance of a class that extends urlstreamhandler with type urlstreamhandler and call the openconnection method it will call the one you have overriden in the instance of the class that extends urlstreamhandler if any if none it will try to call the one in urlstreamhandler if implements and else it will probably throw an exception or something

12764790
jobs	cron
i ve tought about using cron jobs but it seems messy either by using one cron job every 15 minutes and checking which task needs to be executed or having separated cron entries for each task

12764811
google-chrome	firefox
since i m doing all my work in a linux environment and therefore firefox and google-chrome right now i don t care that it is slower in ie

12764842
cassini	iis
this runs fine on mod_mono+apache and on mono s implementation of xsp however on microsoft s cassini dev server this produces a platformnotsupportedexception with the text this operation requires iis integrated pipeline mode

12764858
put	get
when i adde these folders in xcode and i run the program xcode can n t get the address it can load the html page but with out any picture javascript and css since they are in the other folders i know when i put all file together not in separate folder everything works but i want to have real folder structure in my xcode i don t want to use group would you please help me

12764899
int	double
i have a parametric variable in a type class which i would like to represent any of the number types float int double etc

12764919
hide	show
i hide the actionbar why the actionbar still show for a while

12764957
post	put
i want to add a widget which requires to put a in the post

12764975
post	get
instead of that you may use a jquery post call and get the data

12764975
post	get
you can determine whether the call is a get call or post call by inspecting the request.requesttype property value

12764986
radiobuttonlist	requiredfieldvalidator
however you can use the radiobuttonlist control instead validated by requiredfieldvalidator

12764987
width	margin
then you first need to give it a known width and then you can center it relative to its parent block element using css margin 0 auto

12764996
post	put
by contrast methods such as post put and delete are intended for actions that may cause side effect

12764996
post	get
if your get request changes the state of the server which it most likely does based on your post you are doing something wrong

12765006
hide	show
after both sides are connected to other widgets android will recalculate size of textview and scroller properly even if you change orientation or show hide soft keyboard

12765040
folder	directory
my tree is representing a directory structure starting from the root folder exercises so i want each node to store the path on the server where the directory structure is stored

12765085
super	self
the super background self .__init__ a b will invoke

12765092
superclass	subclassing
the second issue is that if a method defined in the superclass calls buildfield the subclassing version will be called

12765137
maven	pom.xml
removing the project and re-importing it into eclipse via the maven pom.xml file was not enough to fix the problem

12765144
ffmpeg	libavformat
what you need for this is a media processing framework like ffmpeg libavformat libavcodec libswscale or gstreamer

12765152
fragmentpageradapter	fragmenttransaction
in other words when i know that the viewgroup is no longer in used i would perform fragmenttransaction s somewhere perhaps in the fragmentpageradapter to remove those fragment s

12765192
portrait	landscape
refresh of the home screen from portrait to landscape or vice-versa

12765215
int	boolean
the boolean type is a subtype of plain int and boolean values

12765264
punctuation	words
i can t rely on splitting by stop words and or and punctuation

12765312
post	get
i too was running into this issue where post would return absolutely no data but get flowed without error

12765337
memcmp	strcmp
since your data is not null terminated you probably want to use memcmp instead of strcmp

12765347
jax-ws	jax-rs
if you want to continue with the standard java ee stack look at jax-ws soap or jax-rs restful instead

12765348
google-chrome	safari
i encountered same issue on safari and worked on google-chrome and found out two solutions you could take apart indicator into two element parent for position and child for transforming or you could add translatez 0 in transform -webkit-transform rotate 169deg translatez 0

12765406
post	get
in some cases the .htaccess is set to either redirect or block a post which wouldn t catch and block or route a get

12765406
post	get
you mentioned earlier that you were using a hosting provider so ask them specifically what rules they have set up on post requests you ll probably have to wait a bit on hold to get somebody who can actually answer the question or you can test this a bit from the command line with wget

12765417
explode	implode
but don t worry you can use explode and implode functions

12765431
express	node.js
i have a form for editing an object and i want to handle it properly using express 3.x with node.js

12765440
public	protected
one could use public inheritance is-a and demote those public interfaces to protected or private but this would violate the liskov substitution principle

12765440
public	protected
those public methods become protected or private with protected or private inheritance

12765464
for-loop	arrays
if the arrays are small then a solution with a nested for-loop scaryrawr s is going to perform best

12765488
int	chars
so i want to cast 4 chars i am reading from a buffer to 1 int

12765521
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
it has to if you want to be able to read write it using objectinputstream objectoutputstream

12765536
int	chars
note i honestly can t remember if the implicit up-cast extends the sign from a chars to an int or not but if it does and any of the single bytes being or d together here are top-bit-lit you may be in for a surprise if p was not

12765564
range	infinity
but will still cover the whole range extending up to positive negative infinity

12765614
lz77	lz4
lz4 is lz77 family which is a few lines of code but i never did it myself but i guess you are right run length or delta code is the fastest and also good for images

12765624
wordpress	joomla
alternatively you could move your site to a cms like drupal wordpress or joomla and have it automatically create an alias for you

12765708
lxml	beautifulsoup
two popular good ones are beautifulsoup and lxml

12765713
typedef	struct
so i did an array of the typedef struct of the elements and was hoping i could start with the first element of the array and point the next to the second element of the array

12765717
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
try temporarily tweaking the sudoers file to allow the arpspoof command to be sudo -ed without a passwd

12765725
uitableview	uipickerview
i ve implemented both the uitableview uipickerview delegates in this view

12765727
int	chars
there are probably more interesting algorithms but this just converts the chars to int and multiplies it by the position in order to weight them so that abc is different than cba

12765734
int	chars
i need to convert an array of number chars to int values in order to perform math operations in c

12765772
int	double
you want int and not in your data structure and the temperature should be a float or double rather than an int which greatly simplifies the input

12765783
int	double
the reason it may loop forever is that the double calculation of account is effectively truncated by casting to int so it may never change if rate is too small and the new value of account isn t made larger by at least 0.005

12765802
post	get
ps i ve been using jquery s .load method to perform get s and post s

12765846
strtol	atoi
also prefer to use strtol over atoi

12765861
istream	getline
i am wondering wtf my while loop which calls istream getline istream is string str

12765904
ready	each
each warp can contain at max 32 threads.the scheduler will try to execute the warps in parallel fashion inside the sm s.if the data for a particular warp is not ready it is held by the scheduler until it is available.now as far as your questions is concerned i believe it is possible to do what you are trying to achieve using cudaevent_t for measuring the execution time of a kernel

12765924
multiplying	subtract
your example appears to have done both - subtract 0x40 from each value and multiplying by 1.33

12765943
addclass	removeclass
i m using addclass and removeclass to indicate which link has been selected and that s working fine

12765986
google-chrome	firefox
use google-chrome or firefox to inspect element s that you like

12766038
width	height
change golbaloffsetx and globaloffsety according to your textbox height and width

12766098
post	get
to be more detailed we first call hunchentoot raw-post-data force-text t to get the post data as a string and then feed it to jsown parse

12766103
draggable	droppable
i m working on a small jquery plugin that mimics the jquery ui draggable droppable behavior with native html5 drag and drop events

12766105
concave	convex
after that you d probably be interested in tessellating those polygons so as to convert them into collections of triangles making the later shadow lighting intersection math a lot simpler the only problem in this case is if you end up with a concave polygon but a decent tessellator should allow you to break it up into convex polygons

12766121
super	abstract	super	extends	super	implements	implements	extends
i m working on an assignment where i m trying to implements a class that extends an abstract super class but by using

onresume	onpause
these are the overrides for onpause and onresume

12769996
onresume	onpause
instead of backgroundmusic.pause in the onpause method however upon resuming the application the sound doesn t play even if backgroundmusic.play is present in the onresume method

12769996
onresume	onpause
i ve also noticed that the error is still there regardless of what i place in the onpause and onresume and i try to quit the application

12769996
onresume	onpause
i place system.out lines in the onpause and onresume overrides so that i can see when it is executed

12769996
onresume	onpause
upon starting the application onresume executes and upon closing the application onpause executes

12770021
width	height
i know how to do it by either resizing the image before or calculating the width and height and setting the values in pixels

12770041
width	height
the icon is a .png and the size is width 40 height 51

12770044
public	protected
i ve read through the controlling access to members of a class to get an idea of which modifiers should be infront of the getgameenginelog to make it only visible in the game engine project yet none of the modifiers public protected default or private suit my needs

12770116
tiff	bmp
clearly there are exceptions to this such as bmp and tiff images but you can probably build a whitelist of well-compressed filetypes pngs mpegs and venturing away from visual media - gzip bzip2 etc to skip and then assume the rest of the files you encounter will compress well

12770153
inherited	properties
it has array-like characteristics like numeric properties and a .length properties but it does not inherited from array.prototype

12770186
width	height
the first part where the frame height is set to be equal to the frame width is working as expected and the user is given a view that is square

12770206
post	get
i tried to read into many tutorials out there and many post here but didnt get around to found the right answer

12770225
gridview	rowdatabound
you can put chis code in your gridview s rowdatabound event.

12770236
lxml	beautifulsoup
for extracting data use beautifulsoup or lxml

12770313
profiling	instrumentation
using the time profiling in instrumentation will highlight the most expensive areas of your code but those are the most likely candidates

12770337
ember.js	backbone.js
use ember.js or backbone.js or some other framework to extract this for you

12770395
express	node.js
i m new to mustache.js and using it in express 3.0 in node.js and i want to use a helper function for formatting time in templates

12770421
lodash	underscore.js
lodash is inspired by underscore.js but nowadays is superior solution

12770443
docx	xlsx
i m working on a document ppt pptx xls xlsx doc docx and pdf splitter and overall i made it work

12770443
pop-up	dialog
also if i remove the property it gets stuck with the dialog save as if i try to finish the process manually by selecting a destination folder the save as pop-up comes up over and over again

12770510
width	height
i have been exploring the dom and the only attributes i can find relating to width and height give the height of the iframe itself which is smaller than the document inside it

12770511
uiview	subviews
uiview which using an xib file can also add in this class as a subviews you know what a mean

12770553
button	checkbox
also a toggle button makes the current state much more visible than just a checkbox so if a toggle choice is more important than the rest around it then it might make sense to use it

12770557
stdout	stderr
the exception may be getting written to stderr instead of stdout which the windows command line does not show by default

12770563
onresume	onpause
if you really need to save the state then you can save the current position of the track using getcurrentposition method in your onpause and in your onresume you can use seekto int msec method and pass in the value you obtained from getcurrentposition so that you can resume playback where you left off

12770586
for-loop	loops
i am unfamiliar with raise exception and the like but my instinct would be to add a raise exception or raise stopiteration to the for-loop after it is made into a while loops

12770609
short	base
in short set your base max_level properly and you won t have to worry

12770669
children	parent
now if the parent consists on on element and has 2 children like

12770669
children	parent
if the parent consists of 2 elements a b and the children are q w e then qb and a

12770680
matplotlib	scipy
reinstalling numpy scipy and matplotlib with pip solved the problem

12770724
width	height
from what i can tell i am getting all the correct values for the height width of the photo and the height width of the photo but i am not sure where or how i can adjust the stretch factor

12770785
button	checkbox
however when posting the generatepdf button all i see in the model is if the checkbox is checked which is great

12770785
post	get	button	checkbox
when the form post using the generate pdf button i get the checked value of each checkbox but not the name of the template in the model

12770796
post	get
the clients use post data to present their actions and get to retrieve serialized game board data

12770800
for-loop	loops
i use the else clause of the for-loop that will be executed when loops is not exited by a break

12770810
portrait	landscape
you would have to develop your app in landscape mode and then rotate all your views content to make it seem it is in vertical portrait mode

12770816
stdout	stderr
will control whether your monitoring stderr or stdout so if you call

12770822
hide	show
also use show and hide function

12770838
width	height
cgrectmake x position y position required height required width

12770851
hex	binary
while it s useful for hex-editors and other programs to display binary data as hex there s no reason to convert data into hexadecimal strings during programming

12770896
int	chars
as mortalus answered the reason for the difference was because in one case you passed an int to println in another case you passed a chars

12770896
int	chars
i just wanted to add that i can see that in the first case you were attempting to create a chars rather than an int however the syntax was incorrect

12770896
int	chars
finally you assign the chars to an int variable hex

12770896
int	chars
since 10 is valid for both int and chars an implicit conversion is performed the chars is converted back to an int and you end up with an int variable not a chars variable

12770908
nodevalue	innerhtml
nodevalue will return the innerhtml for your tag

12770922
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome media_err_decode is thrown when the playback stops while in firefox it just stops without any error

12770952
getter	setter
and have getter to read the values and setter or constructor parameters to set the values

12770983
int	boolean
i m already applying that and it works as if the int value from the database is 0 the java boolean variable becomes false and vice versa

12771071
int	boolean
if you want to keep simple structure for the configuration my suggestion is that you should not think about boolean as some different structure than int

12771074
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
i suppose that graph vertexes etc i should draw on qgraphicsview so i added it too also i add qgraphicsscene and bind them together ui- setscene scene

12771095
folder	directory
extract it copy and paste include folder from development package to opt lampp directory

12771117
int	chars
as the return type of fetgetc is an int and not chars

12771119
int	chars
by the way the reason why you need fgetc to return an int is because fgetc must return 257 unique values all the possible values of chars that is 0x00 thru 0xff as well as something unique to signify eof usually -1

12771120
put	get
i want to get a list of databases stored in mysql and put in java table using command show databases via a resultset

12771171
cpu	hyperthreading
actually the main purpose of arch_align_stack is to improve cache performance on cpu with hyperthreading or similar technologies

12771171
x86	64bit
arch x86 kernel process.c contains code common for both 32-bit and 64bit

12771174
put	get
this works fine on ios safari but if you try to get the last div and put into an ext.panel.html fields it doesn t work

12771260
fgets	getline
1 uses std getline std cin str to read your raw input analogous to fgets

12771276
memmove	malloc
ok i was trying to implement memmove just as a programming exercise and i get a memory access violation in the memmove function when i try to use malloc

12771302
int	chars
you should be using chars instead of int

12771340
width	height
i think the idea here is to get the width height of an

12771353
int	chars
a chars is 1 byte so chars pointer will really get moved by x bytes but an int is 4 bytes and an int pointer will get moved by 4 x bytes

12771354
int	chars
also an int is typically 4 bytes and chars is typically 1 byte

12771356
google-chrome	firefox
but while google-chrome doesn t have array.join defined firefox actually does and it can be invoked by array.join array string

12771377
portrait	landscape
if i load the application while the device is in landscape mode this still executes as if the device was in portrait mode

12771377
portrait	landscape
the second is that after load when i rotate the device from portrait to landscape i get a thread break as notated below

12771421
fontconfig	freetype
i noticed that fontconfig depends on freetype so i successfully installed that via brew

12771433
dbcontext	objectcontext
apparently i m now using dbcontext instead of objectcontext

12771436
rspec	capybara
would like to test this with capybara rspec using the poltergeist driver but since the select2 element actually starts out as a hidden field and then populates a once results are processed none of the normal select fill_in or choose helpers will work

12771438
post	get
read eli s post to get more details

12771504
istream	getline
this is incorrect use of std istream getline

12771525
goto	break
the same goes for other flow-control statements such as break continue and goto

12771542
portrait	landscape
beginning with android 3.2 api level 13 the screen size also changes when the device switches between portrait and landscape orientation.

12771571
comparator	comparable
either the element type t should implement the comparable interface or you should use the overloaded sort method that takes a generic comparator instance

12771571
comparator	comparable
neither your person class implements comparable nor you are passing any comparator instance

12771601
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
you should take a look at sqlconnection and sqlcommand and sqldatareader

12771633
box-sizing	border-box
you can use box-sizing border-box

12771636
unsigned	short
this is type safer that the acient va_list functions since it converts all the expressions in the list to unsigned short

12771674
ubuntu	linux
i am using ocamlc version 3.11.2 under linux ubuntu 10.04

12771689
put	get
now i put it on the internet at my host and when i load the site i get many warnings fatal error on the screen

12771723
comparator	comparable
alternatively you can implement comparable interface directly in person class and override comparator object obj method

12771749
highcharts	fusioncharts
i d recommend highcharts or fusioncharts

12771771
submit	submission
whilst there is a guide to submission it s not clear how to submit both arm and x86 configurations of the same app

12771786
fontfamily	font-size
when i wanna try to change the style like color fontfamily font size so on in the tinymce but it only print the tags like this without style font-size

12771788
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
in this assignment where i can only use javascript my page displays fine in safari and google-chrome but not in firefox

12771805
int	chars
possible values are na the default when type.convert is used null when the column is skipped one of the atomic vector classes logical int numeric complex chars raw or factor date or posixct

12771806
superclass	subclassing
if you really want to then create a class hierarchy and implement methods like value actdirectly in the subclassing in addition to result act in the superclass

12771849
expandablelistview	expandablelistadapter
you can use fragmentactivity loaders but inflate expandablelistview directly and bind data to it via expandablelistadapter

12771888
highcharts	highstock
adding multiple points dynamically | highcharts and highstock jsfiddle

12771932
innodb	tokudb
i m trying to convert a 400 million row innodb table to the tokudb engine

12771983
int	chars
you don t need binascii to get the int representation of a chars in a string all you need is the built in function ord

12771986
int	chars
you can use ord to get the int value of each chars

12771987
submit	submission
on clicking to submit the form i want it to check the database for a duplicate entry with ajax and if there is already 1+ entries present a confirm window confirming another submission

12771993
cpu	processors
numbering cpu registers is the norm almost any processors does that

12772000
fast-forward	merge
git pull upstream master if master was the branch in which your fix has been integrated the merge will be a fast-forward one no rebase needed at this point

12772000
fast-forward	merge
before submitting anything back to the original repo upstream you need to make sure your work is based on top of the latest from said original repo or the pull-request won t result in a fast-forward merge once applied back on upstream repo

12772000
fast-forward	merge
and from my fork on github i can safely make a pull request knowing that it will only add new commits to upstream without needing any merge resolution merging those new commits in upstream repo will mean a simple fast-forward merge

12772010
google-chrome	firefox
it works great with firefox and google-chrome but ie8 returns localstorage is null or not an object when i call showstuff

12772045
int	double
another option would be to use a double but that will lose precision so if you need int accuracy biginteger is the way to go

12772045
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
then use the add multiplying divide and subtract amongst others to manipulate your values like

12772105
ostream	istream
in particular the c++ paradigm is to add overloads for and for ostream s and istream s respectively to handle input and output

12772105
cout	cin	ostream	istream	std	ostream
finally std cout std cin and std cerr are instances of ostream istream and ostream respectively which is why they get the and overloads

12772105
std	ostream
finally std endl is a special ostream that adds a newline and flush the stream

12772106
std	ostream
for example std ostream operator is overloaded for many types and you can add overloads for your own types as well

12772122
std	ostream
is overloaded as a member function of std ostream and std cout is an object of std ostream

12772202
portrait	landscape
i ve written a small app which creates a visual programmatically and i m trying to print it out on a page in landscape orientation it clips in portrait

12772202
portrait	landscape
when i print it does come out in landscape but my visual is still clipped as through it were limited to portrait orientation

12772243
width	height
i thought of getting the device s camera height and width

12772247
scatter	graphing
i m displaying in the same graphing a scatter plot and a bar plot

12772356
width	height
to prove this try some of the 2 bezier solutions above with equal height and width - they should ideally approximate a circle but they won t

12772371
redhat	fedora
tested with gcc 4.7.2 and gcc 4.1.2 on fedora 17 and another platform slc5 - redhat based linux in order to make sure it does not depend on the compiler

12772439
versioning	upgrade
furthermore you should upgrade to last versioning 2.7 or 2.8 of jmeter as it contains many fixes regarding jms

12772450
int	chars
i have an array of strings represented as 32 bit int where each bit corresponds to a specific chars in the input string

12772454
form-submit	preventdefault
you ll need to call preventdefault on the form-submit event and then submit the data manually after confirmation

12772481
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it looks the same in google-chrome safari desktop and ios and firefox

12772526
button	checkbox
i can link the code to a button push or a checkbox change but i d like it to be automatic since having the user click something to run the check defeats the purpose

12772542
jasmine	qunit
performing this asynchronous testing is actually possible in qunit but is handled better in another javascript testing framework jasmine js

12772542
setinterval	settimeout
edit also jasmine has several built-in methods of faking out the settimeout and setinterval functions of the browser without hosing any other tests in your suite that may depend on that

12772542
setinterval	settimeout
i would take a look at using those rather than manually overriding the settimeout setinterval functions

12772566
put	get
if you create a view that handles the get request you could put the updating code in that view

12772576
put	get
the only time i get this error is when i call the put function from the dynamicarray class

12772585
udp	tcp
we using it in production both with udp and tcp transports

12772661
decoder	encoder
this is incidentally why you can make a two-funcall utf-8 encoder decoder in javascript without any loops or garbage generation by combining these primitives to cancel out all but the utf-8-processing side effects as the unescape and decodeuricomponent versions do the same in reverse

12772705
carrierwave	fog
rails + carrierwave + fog + s3 socket error

12772705
carrierwave	fog
i m trying to use carrierwave + fog + amazon s3 as described on wiki and in few similar questions here on stackoverflow

12772711
folder	directory
the war directory was somehow getting cross linked to a same named game so no matter how many times i remade it it was getting linked to an old folder i had before

12772711
folder	directory
so even though all the directory s in the properties looked right the war folder was wrong

12772711
folder	directory
to fix it i had to un-check the this project has a war folder from the property s |google|web application tab apply it then i tried running it as a web app it told me i didn t have a war directory so it would not run

12772711
folder	directory
the next time i ran i got to re-select the war folder from a full directory and not just my projects directory

12772715
multiplying	add
a solution for usability would be to add your error text near the input we have found that a square is the optimal shape... have the user enter one attribute you really don t need both length and breadth if they always represent the same value and change your calcs to square that value rather than multiplying length breadth

12772723
uiview	calayer
i just want to replicate the same behavior as uiview calayer drawrect but in an opengl view

12772739
folder	directory
since your test resource directory is in a directory that compiles java sources you could move your test resource folder

12772745
subtract	add
i tried to write some jquery functions to change some variables values when options of a select item are selected add a certain value if option is selected subtract that value if option is not selected anymore but it adds and subtract values in a very odd way

12772745
subtract	add
odd behavior example clicking option 5 doesn t add 10 to pds1 but instead it subtract 10 to pds2

12772754
hide	show
on the app bar show event you hide the webview control and display the webviewbrush and you do the opposite on the app bar hide event

12772781
clang	icc
all modern compilers have extensions that provide these gcc and family icc opencc clang have e.g the series of __sync.

12772802
put	get
i m using andengine and i m trying to save game state somehow but i don t really want to put my objects to an array while creating level i d like to get those items just when i need to

12772827
pop-up	dialog
since you apparently have an activity i want to make a button you can display your message in your activity s ui or pop-up a dialog

12772834
int	chars
the r and g parameters to your rgb function are unsigned chars and you are not casting them to unsigned int before shifting

12772848
google-chrome	firefox
unlike the domparser +text html method the is supported by more browsers google-chrome 18+ firefox 11+ and ie 10+

12772862
std	ostream
std ostream is not copyable

12772903
recvfrom	datagram
the datagram checksum validation is postponed until a user code calls recvfrom or some other api capable of receiving udp datagram

12772903
recvfrom	datagram
when the code calls recvfrom and the validating code detects a checksum mismatch a datagram is simply dropped and recvfrom ends up being blocked until a next datagram arrives

12772924
post	get
reading your post i get a feeling that your reporting architecture might need a redesign and to be broken away from the base system

12772937
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome tend to be fine with xpath queries

12772940
webclient	webrequest
the line of code that takes so long is i ve tried replacing webrequest with webclient hoping that it would go faster but no such luck

12772949
public	protected
moving the inherited methods to public and the data members to protected in the orderedlist header file worked

12772960
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
fileinputstream and fileoutputstream on nix use the read and write system calls internally

12772977
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
you can t talk about happens-before relationship in terms of the java memory model between your fileinputstream and fileoutputstream objects since they don t share any memory or thread

12772977
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
however fileinputstream and fileoutputstream share a file which leaves things up to the os which in main stream ones you can expect to read after write in order

12773078
getter	setter
when the save button is clicked a new instance of backing is built and then there are a lot of calls to the getrecord getter before the setid setter is called

12773092
hide	show
also i m planing to implement a button to hide show rows that match the text from the first column and another one to highlight text from the second one

12773099
mouseout	mouseleave
but i need to hide menu when mouseleave or mouseout with delay

12773184
hide	show
in some places in our app we show hide the status bar with

12773234
jasmine	qunit
besides those already mentioned qunit jasmine i recommend mocha.js it adds a little bit more complexity but it s so much more flexible you need to load the file add a script tag with the configuration and start testing the plus is you can use any assertion expectation library you like if it throws exceptions if the test fails

12773260
post	get
as far as i am aware i cannot do a get post because the application cannot read php because it is for a smartphone so the data handling on the device is through javascript data sent from json and structure with html

12773288
for-loop	arrays
use above code in the for-loop and set the arr arrays

12773314
google-chrome	safari
apparently google-chrome and safari automatically promote elements with the float attribute set to display block or display inline-block

12773346
post	get
when i access the post data on the server i get nothing

12773364
audiotrack	audiorecord
im using audiorecord and audiotrack to play the sound output from the microphone to the speakers.but real-time playback creates sound echo .i need to only play mic sound and not the sound played by android system which in this case is the mic audiotrack which is played for the second time

12773379
getter	setter
i guess the error is pretty easy to spot but i ve tried any versions of static public static and using functions setter and getter to do the work but nothing works

12773403
filtering	grouping
if you need some post processing on the list of orders returned like filtering grouping or merging introduce another domain object between your customer and orderrepository and name it like a domain object not a service

12773426
post	get
however you could get the forum post on your domain with some server side scripting like php

12773443
post	put
but is rails you can put _method post in the form action to override the method

12773491
onmouseover	onclick
event handlers are stored as properties of elements such as onclick onmouseover etc

12773491
onmouseover	onclick
if the dom element referenced by has either an onclick or onmouseover event handler set replace this element in the array with an anonymous function

12773507
clang	llvm
ruby is not fully ready for llvm compilation this includes clang there is at least one known isue with fibers but depending on llvm version other problems might appear

getter	setter
this only generate getter and setter for all entity class properties

12773579
spaces	delimiter
which will place into broken all of the words that you ve typed in delimiter by spaces

12773596
focuslistener	propertychangelistener
it uses jformattedtextfield to enforce numeric input as well as a propertychangelistener focuslistener to update the sum

12773609
for-loop	loops
while loops block should end right after k++ and in first for-loop you should initialize b with j instead of i

factors	matrix
impute.knn uses khanmiss which is a data.frame of factors which when coerced to matrix will be character

12773652
int	double
despite the strange example mat1 will when it is int or double as well

12773684
fast-forward	merge
even if this is not a fast-forward mergeÃ¢Â¹ there s nothing to commit as the merge commit is made automatically

12773684
fast-forward	merge
Ã¢Â¹because this is a checkout on your server there shouldn t be a need for a non fast-forward merge

12773689
opera	google-chrome
use rgb color syntax background-image instead of background and meter attributes to get it fully working in google-chrome and partially working in opera

12773699
super	implements
if you are a mac or linux user you maybe are familiar with tools like less or more that helps you see through documents by pagination in the terminal and pry implements this feature as it s super useful sometimes when there is much things being printed out to the terminal

12773707
subtract	add
in terms of updating you would add 1 if it is red and subtract 1 if it is blue

12784858
getter	setter
using a parent interface and virtual methods then making your function call those methods presumably getter and setter to handle the field manipulation will provide more freedom later at the expense of slightly higher runtime and having to inherit from that interface it will however allow new objects to be passed to the function at any time so long as they implement the interface

free	memcpy
i thought the memcpy in getstringforsizeandcursor would fix the segfault since its copying bytes outside of subbuffer before i free right now i would expect those to then be cleaned up by my struct deconstructor but either things are deconstructing before i expect or some memory is still pointing to the original subbuffer if i let subbuffer leak i get back the data i expected but this is not a solution

modulus operations on powers of two like 2 32 simplify directly to masking off high order bits and if you take a 64 bit integer and compute it modulo 2 32 the value will be exactly the same as if you had converted it to an unsigned int

12786755
division	modulo
programmers like to use this property to speed up programs because it s easy to chop off some number of bits but performing a modulo is much harder it s about as hard as doing a division

12790613
apache	nginx
nginx or apache could do some frontier communication for you

12790647
width	margin
then set a width on your table via css and use the margin 0 auto declaration you mention above

12790648
portrait	landscape
i believe this means that forcing the activity to be in portrait mode which i know how to do will not work unless someone knows how to specifically open the softkeyboard in landscape mode while the activity is in portrait mode

stdout	stderr
both can make sure your django instance stays running in whatever mode you prefer daemontools has a few more options for that and can isolate a directory for logging stdout stderr

flask	django
i am an experienced django user and have just started to use flask

12791089
flask	django
django s philosophy from early on was that it should be a batteries included framework whilst flask is very much a find-your-own batteries approach

google-chrome	firefox
the performance gains you seem to be expecting with a port of the firefox webcl extension to the google-chrome browser are i would surmise unlikely though the v8 engine does indeed process javascript faster than other engines webcl is by definition processed primarily on the gpu so the javascript component of the code will more than likely represent a very small percentage of the processing time

12791253
uibezierpath	calayer
it uses uibezierpath to create the path and calayer to represent the object that moves along the path

12791273

12791722
post	get
if i have a function call in the view that calls a function residing in the model and that function takes session post get vars for parameters

12791722
post	get
the reason i ask is because putting the arguments in the function calls in the view makes the view seem logic heavy but doing it the other way accessing session get post vars in the model seems a bit hacky and would make the code not very reusable

i have to input a string into an unsigned short array

12798428
google-chrome	firefox
hi i am seeing alignment difference in jqgrid frozen column demo between google-chrome v22 and firefox

12798428
firefox	safari
but the alignment was proper in firefox v 15 and safari v5 in windows xp

12798436
unsigned	short
wchar_t used to be typedef to unsigned short in c but c++ requires it to be a separate type

12798474
textview	imageview
i need to have marquee of textview and imageview as show in the image

12798474
textview	imageview
where onclick of either the textview or imageview it should open an activity

12798481
width	height
i have a canvas with width and height and i use jcanvas to draw on it

12798523
scatter	graphing
my graphing has a lot of points on the scatter plot 172 and hence infeasible to label all

12798526
unsigned	short	int	chars
the primitive int types are signed unsigned chars short int long long long as opposed to float or decimal types .

12798526
int	chars
however in addition to those int types there are four distinct unique fundamental types chars wchar_t char16_t and char32_t which are the types of the respective literals l u and u and are used for alpha-numeric type data and similarly for arrays of those

12798526
int	chars
those types are of course also int types and thus they will have the same layout at some of the arithmetic int types but the language makes a very clear distinction between the former arithmetic types which you would use for computations and the latter chars types which form the basic unit of some type of i o data

12798526
int	chars
so i think that char16_t and char32_t are actually very aptly named to reflect the fact that they belong to the chars family of int types

12798551
strtol	atoi
you should either terminate your strings put a zero at the end of them and stop using atoi use strtol instead

12798598
width	height
if you are looking to use a horizontal and vertical scroll outside of what the browser gives you then you need to set the width and height of the element you want to scroll on in this case .tabscontent this can be px or based

12798635
super	extends
the only way i found to use conversionservice without overriding the existing converters with my custom ones was either to extends or re-implement the conversionservice calling the super class s afterpropertiesset method to register the default converters and then add the custom ones

12798641
ubuntu	linux
i personally tested it on a jboss as 6.0.0 installation over a ubuntu linux machine openjdk for java v

12798649
mouseup	mousedown
i can handle the mousedown event to start a timer which will perform the action and stop it on mouseup event but i am looking for an easier way to solve this problem

12798653
getattr	setattr
in this project setattr is used to set attributes and getattr is used to get attributes in profile log setattr was called 2700 times and getattr was called 3800 times

12798653
getattr	setattr
though i do think setattr and getattr drag down the speed i m not sure if a rewrite of all the code would make it better

12798665
post	get
i need to get the id only of that permalink category i need this info so i can take few latest post from permalink category via custom query

12798765
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
without the doctype the menu renders correctly in firefox google-chrome and opera also my extjs windows are draggable

12798843
hide	show
the hide and show work but trying to add an effect - slide for example - doesn t

12798857
google-chrome	firefox
i found a perfect simple solution for this that worked for me on google-chrome ie and firefox on win7

12798857
width	height
i put a table with one cell inside the link that have same width and height as which is the image dimensions

12798857
width	height
because if i combined height width with padding it will produce different results on different browsers especially ie and chrome

12798877
swt	swing	awt	swing
java web start jws is the oracle corporation technology used to launch rich client swing awt swt desktop applications directly from a network or internet link

12798905
width	height
i have created a site and it works fine on all the major browsers unfortunately when viewed on a mobile device it is viewed at full height so the width of the site changes per page and i have an annoying white space to the right of the screen

12798905
width	height
i think the main problem is the ipad wants to scale the page to full height and i want it full width

12798958
button	checkbox
at the bottom i have a button select all that selects all the email checkbox

12798995
fast-forward	merge
when set to only only such fast-forward merge are allowed equivalent to giving the --ff-only option from the command line

12799037
qsplitter	qwidget
and under qsplitter there is qwidget and it s gridlayout children

12799037
qgridlayout	qwidget
i tested some cases and i found that when i use qgridlayout for qwidget s children

12799113
button	checkbox
i made a view which is a checklist it has text inputs fields checkbox and two button one for save the list and the other for delete all

12799185
google-chrome	safari
so far i can only see it on safari but my friend apparently also see s it on google-chrome

12799231
mouse	keyboard
blind users don t click with a mouse they tab with a keyboard and hit enter when they hear the link they want

12799243
for-loop	arrays
i have been doing a for-loop inside another for-loop in order to get 2 objects from the arrays at the same time but there must be a better way

12799245
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
from ios 6 it is given that uinavigationcontroller won t ask its uiviewcontroller for orientation support

12799309
google-chrome	safari
this string contains safari so you have to check specifically if the string also contains google-chrome

12799319
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome has both google-chrome and safari inside useragent string

12799325
imperative	declarative
c++ is an imperative object-oriented strict impure language c++ templates are a declarative hybrid logic functional non-strict pure language which was never intended to be used as a full-fledged programming language and thus lacks many of the features necessary for programming in the large

12799329
google-chrome	safari
so your function needs to check for safari and make sure the string doesn t contain google-chrome

12799351
google-chrome	safari
wow64 applewebkit 537.4 khtml like gecko google-chrome 22.0.1229.92 safari 537.4

12799352
subtract	addition
this is the version that uses addition but that has a negation at the end - might as well subtract and skip the negation

12799379
opera	firefox
now comes the strange behaviour when posting new messages opera firefox and even ie8 works well as intended like this

12799408
gif	png
however if you save it to a format that supports transparency like gif or png your image will not display the black background anymore

12799425
onresume	onpause
the fix you application should listen for onpause and onresume events in your activity

12799443
post	get
if it does then chars in get and post request data will get escaped with

12799446
typo3	templavoila
i am creating my first website in typo3 with templavoila

12799460
hide	show
i m using the following code for a simple toggle button to show hide some extra content

12799480
singleton	facade
use singleton facade service for wrapping your memcached client

12799500
profiling	debugging
so simply create a debugging profiling in eclipse ide to connect to your eclipse rcp product you must specify the port then

12799597
google-chrome	firefox
itÃ¢ s working fine on ios firefox when .ogg is used and google-chrome

12799603
operands	scalar
i tried something like but since the operands of are not scalar this doesn t work

12799627
put	get
my guess and that s probably the best kind of answer you can get here unless a linq to entities ms dev comes along is that they re doing exactly that generating the most effective query but leaving the head-hurtingly-difficult job of optimising the query to the bit they ve already put hundreds or thousands of man-days into the query optimiser in sql server

12799666
width	height
my requirment is to calculate the height width of each image and do the following if the height width is 5000

12799666
google-chrome	firefox
for this i have tried the below script for handling google-chrome since i have managed to work for ie and firefox using some other method

12799676
portrait	landscape
with ios6 apple suggest now to use 2 differences xib file to switch between portrait landscape view

12799723
google-chrome	firefox
all current browsers maintain a single thread for javascript which can be per-tab google-chrome or per browser window firefox

12799724
jpa	javax.persistence
instead of using the ormlite annotations you can use the more standard jpa annotations from the javax.persistence package

12799729
portrait	landscape
so now my screen is landscape but the status bar remains in its place like the screen is still in portrait mode

12799749
mp3	flac
i know there a lot of scripts out there showing you how to convert flac to mp3 but this is my script and i want to learn how to write the script using this method

12799794
cvs	svn
i think the easiest thing for you to do would be to install the git plugin for eclipse works more or less the same as eclipse cvs and svn plugins

12799800
button	checkbox
i also tried to remove the edittext button and checkbox i put in there thinking it was may be creating a conflict .

12799801
cvs	svn
i ve worked mainly with git and svn cvs in the past so i assume that this is a problem of understanding not a technical issue

12799835
implements	modifiers
you should implements your security policy somehow not rely on the java language level visibility modifiers or caller package names

12799839
folder	directory
i don t think you ll be able to name the file 9 10 2012 05 31 15.jpeg as php will interpret the slashes as folder directory when you try to save

12799845
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
further investigation reveals a stack-based counter in a for-loop resetting itself to zero at random points in the for loops execution and the stack-based values in the arrays that the for-loop is inspecting change for the same index value

12799894
post	put
the standard behaviour is to send a post if the model is new doesn t have an id attributed and send a put if the model id is set

12799894
post	put
in your case it s working as designed if you want it to use post to send updates you have to override backbone.sync to work as you need but i think it s easier for you to make your backend restful and create a put listener controller method for updates

12799951
ubuntu	linux
os linux ubuntu

12799965
portrait	landscape
it will not use a split action bar regardless of whether it is held in portrait landscape or is being stepped on by an elephant

12799974
uibutton	uiappearance
customizing uibutton done style and plain style separately using uiappearance

12800117
dev-c++	codeblocks
i have a problem dev-c++ and codeblocks on windows 8

12800119
nsstring	nsdata
if i get this to work i would also like to know how to get pubkey and privkey as nsstring or nsdata

12800178
jar	war
i have a version of jar inside war library and also on classpath of resource adapter

12800198
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
given that support font-face will be shipping soonish in opera safari and firefox this would need to be decided soon

12800241
button	checkbox
note i ve tried making a break point in the first line of this method but with this approach i must do like a monkey test pressing all button checkbox ...

12800249
kerberos	ldap
i m looking for ways to authenticate into my metro app by kerberos or third party systems like ldap

12800260
google-chrome	firefox
i have 3 available rc with firefox google-chrome and iexplore environment

12800294
getter	setter
above attribute is defined as a string and both the getter and setter methods are available for it

12800316
x86	64bit
i know that on 64bit windows 32 bit applications go into c program files x86 by default and 64bit into c program files

12800316
x86	64bit
i see the program files x86 directory as a legacy sandbox for old applications who were never designed for 64bit applications in mind

12800316
x86	64bit
to me the path without x86 is also more visually appealing and indicates that it s a modern application - adapted for 64bit operation where necessary

12800346
folder	directory
therefore i copied the contents of the plugin folder of qt into the application directory where collidingmice.exe is

12800375
ubuntu	linux
im have just deployed a rails app which uses paperclip to handle the file uploads to a linux ubuntu 10.04 server running apache2 passenger rails 3.2.3 and ruby 1.9.3

12800391
jboss	glassfish
maybe your transaction is in read-only mode under tomcat jboss but not under glassfish

12800427
ienumerable	iqueryable
neither ienumerable nor iqueryable linq queries will execute until you try to actually use the result

12800427
ienumerable	iqueryable
the general difference is that ienumerable is using funcs essentially delegates as the underlying storage of the query whereas the iqueryable is using expression trees so that the query can be translated to sql for example

12800436
qtcore	qtgui
from pyqt4 import qtgui qtcore

12800436
super	self
super treemodel self

12800438
x86	mips
if you use a mips cross compiler instead of a gcc that targets x86 you can complete this conversion compilation

12800438
x86	mips
the wording in your question seems to suggest you don t care as much that the output is mips but rather you want the output to be less complex than x86

12800451
google-chrome	firefox
i tested in google-chrome 22 ie 9 firefox 15

12800480
free	malloc
it then also checks for it being 0 - if it is zero it invokes - dealloc which is usually overridden by a subclass to free memory allocated by the constructor method - init or free memory allocated by malloc

12800549
portrait	landscape
i get this error cgimagecreate invalid image size 0 x 0 with ios 6 in an universal project only for new ipad simulator not for the old one or the iphone if i load a window with a uipickerviewcontroller over a splitviewcontroller and only in portrait not in landscape

12800668
free	malloc
the more interesting part is how free works and in this direction malloc too can be understood better

12800668
free	malloc
in many malloc free implementations free does normally not return the memory to the operating system or at least only in rare cases

12800668
free	malloc
this is also the reason why managing very small memory elements with the standard malloc free is not efficient

12800690
width	height
but i want to paginate the text based on page height and width

12800707
mdpi	hdpi
that is i don t want to create ldpi mdpi hdpi etc versions of every single graphic but rather i want to use the default graphics for most and then the specific graphics for things like this font

12800837
r-tree	quadtree
take a look at quadtree spatial index quadkeys and r-tree

12800841
equals	gethashcode
you could also do this with a system.string via type.name or type.fullname but it ll be slower because the string methods for equals sure and for gethashcode depending on their implementation are slower

12800877
xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
and the jqxhr in jquery 1.4.x xmlhttprequest object

12800881
post	get
when the page post back you should get that variable back and it should also match the one stored in the session

12800885
trackbar	cwnd
in ms trackbar implementation you cannot just call cwnd invalidate for deferred redraw or even cwnd redrawwindow for immediate redraw

12800886
accessor	properties
after a number as a decimal not a properties accessor so it sees it as this

12800890
getter	setter
this requires defining mapping on getter and setter however

12800948
hide	show
here is an example which show hide markers based on their categories again translated from mike williams v2 tutorial

12800948
hide	show
also copied to how to show hide markers from xml file without refreshing the page with the part of the question it applied to

12800999
nunit	nmock
i maintain a private build of nmock nunit et al

12800999
nunit	nmock
see testmetal a custom source build of nunit nmock and opencover with castle core for .net

12801002
hide	show
if you want to hide a string that needs to be show later you d need to use encryption instead

12801024
salt	md5
md5 hashing especially with a salt is a one way process

12801027
express	node.js
in node.js and express there are many examples showing how to get session data

12801027
post	get
so i asked him how we can get the session data and he said he doesn t know the best approach so i thought i d post the question here

12801051
for-loop	loops
secondly you will find a for-loop is easier than a do loops for implementing the logic as you don t need to keep track of loops counter manually

12801062
integer	fractions
i needed to convert a fractions part of a number into integer without a comma

12801070
width	height
the outer one has a defined width and height sets overflow to hidden and its position must not be static

12801091
nas	qnap
i m trying to install pycurl on my nas qnap ts-459 and i get error libcurl.a no such file or directory

12801109
width	height
to make the size of the pages depend on width and height you can always use em measurements

12801109
width	height
with a class selector replace by this and use paginate as the .each callback function and that s it obviously width and height aren t going to be passed but by using a closure you could set them correctly

12801120
folder	directory
once you have nginx set up to serve from the static content directory you need to run python manage.py collectstatic in your project root so that the static files in the various apps can be copied to the static folder

12801133
hide	show
supposing i have to decide if adding subviews when needed or built xib with all the outlets and hide show when needed

12801145
int	chars
i need to strip off the q and convert the remaining 4 chars numbers to an int

12801151
innodb	myisam
turns out that the new tables being created were using innodb rather than myisam like the existing tables

12801157
folder	directory
i see all the xml files in the classes folder of target directory

12801177
glfw	freeglut	glfw	glew	freeglut	glew
from my findings just about everyone uses freeglut or glew or glfw or gl3.h in some way to get around some of the platform-specific issues

12801196
public	protected
actually i can access the private fields by its public or protected methods

12801218
pdfsharp	itextsharp
just for the record itextsharp and pdfsharp will not be able to help you on this task unless your pdf files are composed by raster images only

12801268
superclass	subclassing
if tomorrow the implementation changes you don t need to change your subclassing - the superclass hides it

12801317
public	protected
you might want to read up on the meaning of the terms public protected and private in this instance

12801346
width	height
i require and would expect the imageview to adjust its height and width with each frame image in the animation list

12801346
width	height
instead it looks like the imageview takes the height and width of the first frame in the animation list and then scales all of the frames in the animation list to fit this initial height and width

12801435
glfw	glew	glut	glfw	glut	glew
i think you need your concepts right what glut glfw and glew actually are

12801435
glut	glfw
glut old freeÃ¢ and openÃ¢ and glfw are frameworks they create a window prepare it for attachment of opengl contexts create an opengl context and then give control back to you more or less

12801435
glfw	sdl	glfw	fltk	glut	sdl	glut	fltk	glut	glfw	gtk	fltk	sdl	fltk
you re not limited to glut or glfw there are others too qt gtk sdl smfl fltk wxwidgets fox toolkit to name a few

12801452
folder	directory
so for example if it ran in the directory c example it would create a folder a b and c under each of the 20 folder regardless of their name

12801480
twig	smarty
try twig or smarty

12801516
for-loop	arrays
in the for-loop you define the 1d arrays for each row with its length

12801571
rss	feed
i m trying to parse rss feed and then display them on my website

12801620
qapplication	qwidget
i solved it by wrapping the qt initialization qapplication and exec in a function that i call via pinvoke and then just use the qwidgets qwidget getdc returns the native handle

12801653
range	minimum
you ll need to set a window center and window width for the part of the dynamic range that shows the features of interest to you and compute the minimum and maximum pixel values that correspond to that window setting

12801677
google-chrome	safari
in a browser that has devtools eg google-chrome or safari load the page that is causing the error

12801710
width	height
in case they re full colour width x height x 3 you should add another colon operator in the assignment to ct3d

12801711
getter	setter
if you use the java-mode yasnippets by nekop you get the snippet prop which lets you define a private variable and it automatically makes a getter and a setter for that variable

12801712
button	checkbox
i will also need common form elements such and checkbox and radio button etc

12801717
google-chrome	firefox
the file is still being incorrectly identified as text html by google-chrome firefox

12801717
google-chrome	firefox
both firefox and google-chrome are incorrectly reading this as text html

12801772
width	height
else you need to calculate viewport width height element position -width and height and restrict positioning to viewportwidth minus elementwidth

12801779
post	get
once you start using post with ajax it becomes harder to switch to a standardizes form of data communications such as xml which makes data parsing so much easier once you get into oop with php

12801928
typedef	struct
you should untangle the typedef and the declaration of a struct variable first like this

12801943
width	height
40km width 60km height

12801972
post	get
with the limit parameter i get a different amount of post when using an access token provided by the graph explorer than i get when using an access token provided by logging in with facebook app data appid appsecret

12802004
stdout	fflush
i ve tried to fflush stdout but without success

12802006
opengl-es	glreadpixels
i have implemented the solution proposed by brad larson i will be always thankful to him i think he is doing a great job for the community sharing so much knowledge... in faster alternative to glreadpixels in iphone opengl-es 2.0

12802013
post	get
the method for the form can either be a post or a get

12802024
jpopupmenu	jmenuitem
you don t have to extend jpopupmenu class just make your menu non-opaque and then make the jmenuitem transparent instead and non-opaque

12802082
post	get
to get your friend s post you will need the read_stream permission and this call to the api

12802082
post	get
you will need to grab all the paginated data to get all the post from the user

12802109
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
while 1 works in google-chrome 2 in ie and 3 in firefox no one works in safari 6

12802122
move	drag
i currently subscribe to the preview mouse move event which is where i launch the drag and drop event if the left mouse button is pressed

12802155
width	height
three of the form boxes are for users to search width height and depth all numerical values but they only return results if the user is exact with the sizes

12802195
google-chrome	firefox
this code produces the layout correctly in ie7 mode google-chrome firefox

12802226
ienumerable	iqueryable
i learned that iqueryable or ienumerable datatypes do not return the results at the first place and only return them when needed

12802228
addclass	removeclass
try out toggleclass addclass and removeclass

12802272
hide	show
if screen width is 768px then show only six td and hide other from

12802272
hide	show
if screen width is 480px then show only four td and hide other from

12802272
hide	show
if screen width is 320px then show only three td and hide other

12802275
postgresql	mysql
this assumes postgresql - if you re using mysql or some other database it may look different

12802279
range	minimum
another way to do it is to do the sum of all the range and compare it to the delta of the maximum and minimum values across all range

12802294
put	get
if i simply put in the row number that i want ie 0 1 2... then i get the expected output without the for-loop in front

12802343
portrait	landscape
this is my button title because its landscape but the titles go still for portrait

12802404
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
ie9 firefox safari and google-chrome all display correctly

12802480
hide	show
when multiple values from a drop down parameter are selected i want to hide the box but when only one option is selected i want to show just the one option

12802480
hide	show
the above currently show the first value from a field which is correct but when as i said there are more values selected i want to hide this i am not sure if i need to wrap the above expression in something or change this in the text box properties under visibility

12802512
uiview	subviews
the subviews of a uiview are sorted in a way that the last one of the array is the frontmost one and then the first one index 0 is the one in the back

12802598
width	margin
instead of going with a fixed upper and lower margin you can sort a list of your entries based upon an absolute calculation between the traywidth in your table and the inputted width by the user

12802623
google-chrome	firefox
this was testing on google-chrome firefox and ie

12802642
ssl	https
ssl the s in https has more states but since it follows a fairly linear progression does not really have any kind of complex diagram

12802656
hide	show
i got some js code changing the visibility of an object from display none to display block jquery show + hide

12802734
int	double
all properties of type string bool long int ushort etc are serialized except for double properties

12802760
for-loop	arrays
instead of putting your select into a for-loop generate an arrays of orderitemids and use array.contains

12802794
queue	fifo
the recursion internally works with a stack a lifo structure while bfs uses a queue a fifo structure

12802794
postorder	inorder
from this pre-order inorder and postorder traversals can be done as recursions

i m about to undertake a large project where i ll need scheduled tasks cron jobs to run a script that will loop through my entire database of entities and make calls to multiple api s such as facebook twitter foursquare every 10 minutes

12807005
jobs	cron
this will require potentially thousands of cron jobs

12807032
folder	directory
the easiest way to determine if you ve created a website or a project is to check your solution folder where you saved your code and see if you have a .sln file in the root directory if you do then you ve created a project

12807037
width	height
i was able to capture the mouse positions during selectable s events start and stop create a div with the right width and height and position

12807060
hash	md5
i have an existing database with users each users password is stored as an md5 hash

12807071
disk	ram
on systems with virtual memory and current resource demands on ram that exceed the amount of physical memory some pages just blocks of memory of a common size often on the order of 4-8kb can be written out to disk and given as ram to a program trying to allocate and use new memory

12807071
disk	ram
there are lots of other tricks the mmu os can do as well like sharing memory between processes making a disk file appear to be direct-memory-accessible setting some pages as nx so they can t be treated as executable code using arbitrary sections of the logical memory space regardless of how much and at what address the physical ram uses and more

12807090
imagemagick	gdlib
there are several software products availabe that can do this including gdlib imagemagick and ghostscript

after installing maven mvn -v works fine i tried to do mvn install in a directory having a good pom.xml at the root of a maven project that i know works

12807147
pop-up	dialog
regarding dialog that pop-up each time you use a private key in your keychain this apple script will take care of the similar alert that pop-up the very first time you request permission to use a private key

12807160
hide	show
i want to be able to show hide specific text using jqery

12807167
x86	64bit
the ability to synthesize ivars via properties or class extensions or on the implementation is only available for 64bit x86 and arm architectures and presumably any future architecture as well

12807180
post	get
it somehow redirected my button1 post request lost data in the process and changed that request into a get request

12807192
qtcore	qtgui
from your question i assume that you already have set up other qt modules like qtcore or qtgui in eclipse if not please see this posting

12807219
button	checkbox
which directs me to a full page of basic settings like music on off checkbox background image selection like aradio button group etc

12807224
google-chrome	firefox
you can try it in windows linux and different browsers firefox google-chrome ie

12807247
wan	lan
i have a script which records your wan and lan ip but it also has a bunch of unnecessary characters around the printed answer

12807247
wan	lan
what i want is 2 different variables 1 to print wan and 1 to print lan

12807285
stdout	stderr
the next-to-last task performed by this function is removing the sys module which mainly consists of calling _pymodule_clear to clear all the entries in the module s dictionary - including in particular the standard stream objects the python objects such as stdout and stderr

12807305
width	height
it turns out width and height are also part of the constraints system in ios6 osx 10.8 i think its 10.8 - havent developed for mac os yet

12807338
post	get
problem is i don t really understand what the method should be post or get basically we need to redirect to the client with underlying parameters not query strings and then our current page that calls the request must be redirected to the client page with the parameters as well

12807359
mouseleave	mouseenter
you can loop through all your posts and add mouseenter and mouseleave events to each post

12807370
hash	salt
this salt is nothing more than a random arbitrary string that you concatenate to the passwords and it will make your hash password unique

12807370
salt	md5
i mean if someone knows what a md5 12345 is a string a this salt will make your users password 12345 as the string b in your db

12807370
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
so i d suggest that you hash your passwords with a custom function myhashmd5 that calls md5 adding the proper salt

12807380
division	addition	division	multiplication	addition	multiplication
it may be somewhat slower than the combined multiplication because it requires real multiplication and division instead of only shifts and addition but i didn t benchmark it so far concerning the performance in an abstract language

12807393
genson	jax-rs
i would also recommend you to use jersey jax-rs implementation + genson java json databinding library

12807404
post	get
not sure i totally understand your question but as your title goes here is the difference between post and get

12807411
hide	show
i am trying to toggle a div using jquery - basically want to hide part of a form and only show it when a user selects a particular checkbox

12807425
calloc	malloc
memory of a process is usually managed by the operating system you get new memory from the heap using os-provided functions like malloc calloc

12807431
versioning	upgrade
in our web.config file we have the following which is created automatically when you upgrade versioning of mvc

12807490
versioning	upgrade
further i am stuck with sql server 2008 so i can t simply just upgrade to a new versioning to get framework 4.0 support

12807498
pop-up	dialog
i m trying to open a user control in a jquery dialog pop-up but when i do none of the server side events fire and i m guessing the updatepanels will also be disabled

pillow	libjpeg	libjpeg	libpng
i use macports for python 2.7 and other open source stuff on my mac libpng libjpeg etc for pillow

12807512
cobertura	jenkins
if i generate the same coverage statistics from the same exact source .gcno .gcda files using the gcovr python script and pass the results to the jenkins cobertura plugin it gives me 100 on all counts - lines conditionals methods

12807512
cobertura	jenkins
the jenkins cobertura coverage page everything at a 100

12807535
post	get
i found the post titled moq returning value that was passed into a method which was quite helpful in that i can get one of the values passed in to provide as a return value

12807550
jobs	cron
tasks cron jobs to run a script that will loop through my entire

12807601
pop-up	dialog
either keep your webforms pages separate from your mvc content avoid using html forms in mvc content that may appear on a webforms page or use pop-up dialog for your forms that get created outside of the webforms dom area

12807682
getter	setter
i forgot to add getter and setter to properties of my model

12807708
bash	zsh
you can check user shell in etc passwd and change it with chsh -s path to new shell - list of allowed shells is available in etc shells - but make sure to pick bash zsh also note that links like sh- bash will not work as bash changes behavior based on the name that was invoked

12807724
vsto	add-in
i just create a vsto second edition project for word add-in and build the setup project

12807729
rss	feed
part of the project is clickthrough a set of add-on tools including a tool to automatically detect available updates via an rss feed notify users and install the update

12807730
getter	setter
the setter and getter methods will be individual for both the classes

12807730
getter	setter
apart from this there is nothing that much complex with setter and getter methods

12807739
getter	setter
with that in mind getter and setter don t have any idea or notion about any other class or instances unless they just happen to be a member of that class which i don t think is the case here

12807753
post	get
because no data i being sent in the body of the request i am debating whether it makes more sense for me to send a get instead of a post

12807761
int	boolean
creating mclassifier gives error con not find symbol constructor dynamiclmclassifier string int boolean

12807762
getter	setter
setter and getter are methods used to obtain the value of the field of a class

12807762
getter	setter
should you need to return something else or do something different the classes interacting with this particular class will still call a setter and a getter without being affected unless you make a major change like changing the type of the value...

12807762
getter	setter
the setter and getter are defined for each class because they re related to each particular context

12807901
put	get
but this means that another call must be made to get the resource to get any updates that may have occurred on the resource in addition to the ones that were specified in the put call

12807901
put	get
however having to make another get call to get the updated resource following the put though nice that it is intentional is additional overhead for a put where you need the updated resource you would have to put and then get

12807906
width	height
i also had to add some width height settings to the carousel because i think there may be a bug with jcarousel where the entire image is not displayed if you don t specify the height for example.

12807927
maven	pom.xml
if for example i want hibernate or weld then add these in my maven pom.xml

12807933
hash	md5
i know i can use an md5 hash to determine if they re different but i want to know how much different the two files are

12807937
getter	setter
if you have a class annotated with data it will generate the getter and setter for you based on the field names

12807937
getter	setter
if you use one of those getter in another class then decide the field is poorly named it will not find usages of those getter and setter and replace the old name with the new name

12807937
getter	setter
the lack of a declared getter setter can get annoying at times when you are trying to familiarize yourself with new code

12807937
getter	setter
if i javadoc the field i would hope the getter and setter would inherit that javadoc through the lombok compilation step

12807937
getter	setter
obviously you are not able to set a breakpoint in a getter setter unless you generate or code the method

12807937
maven	pom.xml
netbeans doesn t like it when you update your lombok dependencies in your maven pom.xml

12807946
folder	directory
i need to extract the files from an msi into a folder but change the directory structure of the files all from within a c# application ie not by doing an admin install or any other install of the msi

12807946
folder	directory
so for instance if i ran the msi installer the target folder for component1 would be c program files x86 company name demo product installer component1 but at runtime in my extractor application i d like to put change that to c someotherplace demo product installer component1 preferably by changing the applicationfolder directory path see below

12807995
put	get
i am trying to get the out put from ssrs export and send it direct to a server side printer without calling a print dialog

12807997
ssl	https
when a user wants to login i redirect them to my heroku application s non-custom url via https using piggyback ssl because i am cheap and don t want to pay for ssl endpoint

12808067
bash	subshell
when you run bash -c you create a subshell and shopt settings are not inherited

12808086
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
there are lots thousends of linux distros out there so obviously is a waste of time to try to make the ideal linux distro and compite with ubuntu mint etc

12808095
stdout	stderr
if the process writes to its stderr before stdout maybe you are getting into a deadlock situation

12808105
udp	mtu
as an over generalisation windows doesn t like 10 000 packets per second for udp but you can saturate a gigabit network with large mtu packets

12808160
post	put
i got the idea that i ll transfer my files by post and on php side i ll put files on the server

12808183
width	height
so php thought the text was going to be written on an angle which would make the height and width measure across the diagonals instead of from top to bottom and side to side

12808194
bluetooth	usb
unplugs a usb bluetooth adapter

12808194
cpu	processors
cpu id of the processors

12808194
cpu	processors
cpu id is only unique to processors model but nic mac address should be very unique

12808247
post	get
you could use post instead of get on your html form

12808248
rss	feed
i am pulling rss feed in using the following code

12808280
google-chrome	safari
webkit prefix is added for google-chrome and safari

12808285
terminate	timeout
timeout prevents the request from being terminate at readystate 1 and it succeeds afterwards due to content sniffing

12808285
post	get
certificate revocation checks may block the initial json post but allow subsequent requests after the get callback

12808294
width	height
i want to use the custom validation functions in the uploader behaviour width and height to create a new custom validation function which tests if the image is square

12808294
width	height
but how do i access those core to the behaviour validation functions inside a custom validation function and use them to check if the submitted file is square i want to allow any height width combo

12808362
post	get
when i visit or post to i get this error and traceback

12808384
portrait	landscape
i had this same issue an app which was meant to be in landscape that assumed the viewcontroller was always in portrait

12808425
awt	swing
for java the jdk has awt and swing

12808458
post	get
i think the choice of get or post is very personal as both of them will do the work but i would recommend you to keep a post instead of a get for two reasons

12808458
post	get
by default get requests are cacheable if there are no parameters present in the url a post is not

12808507
libstdc++	libc++
these abstractions are implemented in terms of pthreads for both libc++ clang s native library and libstdc++ gcc s native library

12808518
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
on firefox internet explorer google-chrome opera etc you will always see the broken image icon - because to the browser that image is indeed broken unintelligible

12808519
portrait	landscape
my app will support landscape orientation as well as portrait

12808519
width	height
the image sizes in pixels width x height for the landscape version of the background image are

12808532
put	get
what s happening is that i ve put down a webview in my xib file and connected it with outlet but i stil can t get the image to show up

12808548
put	get
as an aside i also recommend that you put the code generation tool to the side and instead create your swing gui s by hand for a bit until you get a firm grasp of swing and java fundamentals

12808586
nsurl	nsstring
i ll note that instead of returning nsstring objects from -activityviewcontroller itemforactivitytype if i return just nsurl objects they show up with that paperclip with no body text in the post

12808593
udp	mtu
just make sure you don t send more then mtu sans ip and udp header sizes to avoid fragmenting on ip layer

12808594
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
another gotcha to watch out for is to make sure that your uinavigationcontroller s and uitabbarcontroller s have restoration identifiers

12808638
versioning	upgrade
i know that the versioning being used is old and that to upgrade is a serious and expensive development job

12808659
google-chrome	firefox
during debugging my mvc model and formcollection are blank with no values in firefox 15 or google-chrome latest version

12808666
maven	pom.xml
all pom.xml files inherit from the maven super pom.xml

12808709
int	chars
if you are using a bool type as an alias for another int type like signed chars you can get a different result

12808713
x86	64bit
if you have 64bit x86 platform the it would be

12808713
jar	manifest.mf
if running from command line as jar packaged program - yourprogram.jar - inside the jar you must have a meta-inf folder that contains manifest.mf with the following entries

12808755
int	chars
devicequery.cpp in function int main int chars

12808815
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
uitabbars have some nice integration with uiviewcontroller and uinavigationcontroller but the benefits quickly drop off when you need more customizable behavior left to right scrolling for instance.

12808858
textview	imageview
a picturemethodoptionitem contains of a textview next to an imageview

12808903
oncreate	ondestroy
i found an oncreate method in the android application class but no ondestroy or an equivalent

12808933
pull	push
git is a decentralized version control system where you can push up and pull down code repositories

12808933
pull	push
although you could use heroku as the place to push up and pull down your branches and do all commits i would strongly recommend that you setup a additional remote repository i d recommend github where you do the majority of your code changes and only use your heroku repository for deployments

12809017
getter	setter
you need to create public setter and getter method to access fields and to access book instance you need to

12809041
ssl	https
even if ssl https is used there are some weaknesses in ssl which could still reveal your traffic to a suitably positioned attacker

12809046
int	double
4. use the following method it s a variant of getfromlocationname instead of using the version that you are using right now int double double double double

12809090
serializable	deserialization
the router is all about using serializable and deserialization to recreate it s state

12809090
serializable	deserialization
i think that dealing with one model makes the serializable deserialization process a lot easier to conceptualize

12809099
getter	setter
then in the addressline1 property getter put your address concatenation code and in the property setter just do nothing

12809099
serializable	deserialization
this way on deserialization addressline1 will just be ignored even if it s not present at all in the xml it won t cause an error but on serializable it will be correctly written out

12809230
pull	push
restart smartgit and you should be able to push and pull

12809246
google-chrome	firefox
maybe i m blind but i do not see any invalid characters in ie firefox or google-chrome

12809251
put	get
the answer is not unless you make modifications to the code yourself. which means to put a not-to-fine a point on it expect your web hosting provider to get religion somewhere along the way decide to upgrade out of a security hole by upgrading php which suddenly causes your website to crash

12809277
versioning	upgrade
from your sintax i assume you are using mule with versioning 3.3.0 so the example based on mel won t probably fit your needs although you should take this approach as soon as you d upgrade

12809310
checkbox	dropdownlistfor	button	checkbox
now what i am trying to do is pretty similar their maybe checkbox dropdownlistfor and radio button

12809336
put	get
beside put and get i don t do anything fancy with the memcache instance in my servlet

12809374
ubuntu	debian
edit just a quick note for anyone on ubuntu debian etc

12809374
ffmpeg	libav
make sure you install the additional codec package or else it won t work you must install ffmpeg and the extra libav codec package or you re gonna have a bad time

12809383
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
the web arrays is already in use as the target of the for-loop you can t expect to redeclare it within loops

12809386
post	put
also i could have the add person button put some command in a hidden field and have the editpersons action check that to see if it should add a person or save updated data for existing persons but i feel that would somewhat defeat the paradigm of single purpose actions as opposed to the horrific old-school asp post to itself forms

12809388
google-chrome	firefox
this code works ok in google-chrome and firefox but i can t get it to work on ie

12809408
post	put
i ve put this in elasticsearch.yml based on a random message board post i found

12809416
folder	directory
directory structure showing static i have also placed the directory inside of the meals app folder and users just to try it out

12809427
express	node.js
like i said those same templates can be used when you directly hit those links through the routers defined in express node.js

12809482
scribe	twitter4j
so your problem here does indeed come from mixing twitter4j and scribe

12809484

12809561
ssl	https
recently installed a ssl cert on our server domain and i am realizing now that ci doesn t like https seems like anything that works http gets a 404 in https so but i have some views controllers that don t require the whole https bit

12809619
google-chrome	firefox
firefox 15 returns invalid date ie 9 and google-chrome 22 return a date object for 1 march 2011

12809633
svm	cross-validation
the number of errors from cross-validation or the number of support vectors we get from svm

12809794
google-chrome	firefox
the only reason it doesn t appear as a problem in google-chrome firefox ie10 etc is because they all support css transitions and hence when the second call is made it short-circuits because the first one is still active

12809800
trac	bugzilla
if you really do insist on an ecilpse plugin you could still find one that integrates with bugzilla or trac

12809823
hide	show
i would need to hide show certain sections of the screen hide show certain labels and their text boxes and also modify labels based on different customers

12809823

if i try to put b in a bundle pass it to another activity and read it back i would get a classcastexception

12809939
packets	multicast	subnet	packets
in theory other subscribers on the same subnet could see each others services but afaik there s no provision for sending multicast packets over cellular networks

12809939
packets	multicast	subnet	packets
a bonjour service is generally visible to any other device on the same link-local network the same subnet assuming that the router doesn t filter multicast packets

12809939
bonjour	jmdns
you can use jmdns to do bonjour service advertising discovery with android it s pretty mature or you can even roll your own it s not that difficult

12809987
width	margin
basically it sizes the box to the declared width and adds the borders and margin inside of that

12809995
versioning	upgrade
all other files .ps1 .txt etc don t inherit the versioning and don t get replaced on upgrade

12809995
versioning	upgrade
i need to be able to versioning non-binary files so they can be overwritten on upgrade

12810000
freebsd	debian
it is not panacea as it doesn t deal with freebsd but it is helpful in most cases when all you need is to support windows and and say debian

12810001
packets	multicast
and i found wireshark can see all multicast packets sent and received when using jdk 7 to run my program

12810007
hide	show
if you want to simply hide and show the panel use setvisible as suggested by daniel

12810016
width	margin
i m using a fixed width in my container of about 1024px right now with a min-width of 1200px but it still cuts off part of the fixed navlist becuase i m using a -125px margin on the nav container to get it outside of the content container

12810027
mysqlpp	mysql++
if you need an easy fix for your problem try mysql++ aka mysqlpp

12810057
implements	extends
i have a class named foo that extends a class named bar that extends jpanel and implements actionlistener

12810106
prepare	execute
the way i did this in vanilla-php pdo was to prepare a query and then execute it within the output results

12810132
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome everything is working perfectly

12810160
for-loop	loops
you need to use a self-evaluating closure here to capture the value of i at each iteration of loops because otherwise you get the value of i after control has left the for-loop arr.length

12810292
eventlet	gevent
your application simply provides a python server to respond to http requests.gunicorn gevent and eventlet are excellent options

12810294
int	chars
num.charat i returns the chars not the int

12810314
int	chars
you need to convert each chars digit to an int before you do any math with the value

12810393
ssl	https
and about halfway down the page there s an example entitled ssl https request with pem certificate

12810393
typhoeus	httparty
if you re using some kind of wrapper around net http httparty typhoeus etc. that ll depend on the library in question

12810395
udp	rtp
when i get a udp packet especially rtp i have a different phenomenon

12810428
udp	tcp
if you re running wireshark at the wire which is generally how you run it you should see all packets udp tcp w e else regardless of local firewall settings and whether or not a port is open

12810428
icmp	udp
however regardless of operating system before that icmp packet gets sent the source has no way of knowing whether the port is open or not and therefore you should see udp packets even if the corresponding port is open

12810428
packets	multicast
in particular this is probably done to keep your machine and any others in a multicast environment from spamming the sender with icmp packets

12810457
hex	binary
i doubt that you can reliably tunnel protobuf whose payload is pure binary not text through json without doing some type of encoding like base64 or hex encoding

12810459
post	get
you can use both post get methods to pass the data to a php function

12810546
post	put
you have answered your own question in your followup comments but the myprofile update route uses an http put not a post this is generally the case with most of the valence apis create routes use post and update routes use put

12810559
children	parent
for example i have three tables one parent p1 and two children c1 and c2

12810573
public	protected
by default all public and protected members of the lazy class are thread safe and may be used concurrently from multiple threads

12810598
folder	directory
the error occurs because the compiler didn t find the files under the corresponding directory such as debug-bin or release-bin folder

12810678
super	implements
when implements methods in subclass like your switchviewcontroller.m when to call super methods is important

12810678
super	self
unless there is any special intention of yours almost always calling super implementation precedes local self implementation

12810694
subnet	vlan
to start you can cover the same subnet vlan case

12810694
subnet	vlan
next do the different subnet vlan case if you have time

12810732
width	height

if decimal numbers contain a leading zero itÃ¢ s always best to specify the radix as 10 so that you wonÃ¢ t accidentally end up with an octal value

what you have to do is to write login controller display the form on get and find user and perform password check on post then store the user in session and kill the session on logout

12821941
implements	extends
will it implements a different or extends base class

12821941

when running that query the db engine does not interpret to be a pararmeter so doesn t pop-up the parameter dialog because the name of the parameter is the same as the field name

12822245
margin	height	width	margin	width	height
in case all your items within the grid do not have a width and a margin set your best bet is to resize the columns without any modifier key in vs2012 it should not destroy the layout visually it should just add the unecessary margin height and width properties and then in the document outline window multiselect all the elements and in the properties view klick the set to auto button

12822297
getter	setter
that could be annoying since sometime u need some simple ivar without any getter setter control

this qould mean that that player starts a server basically listens to a predefined port number and the other players send out multicast packets to find the servers

12822560

the documentation does not explicitly state but the default value varies with the number of processors cores the platform has and i think the number is equal to the number of cpu cores

12822702

the ideal option is to find the continued fractions that represents the monic root because this cf will be computable as an integer ratio of any desired precision thus elminating the problem of rounding

12822859

google-chrome	safari
i applied this fix to my application but it broke other areas specifically it was identifying google-chrome and safari as uplevel which caused it to be detected in other areas as ie

12827871
width	height
you can see the open graph width and height tags for example

12827941
vim	emacs
of the clojureians i know all of them have moved to leiningen and connect to their project from an editor like emacs or vim

12827977
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
this feature allowed me to create both an upgrade only the changes since the last versioning or a full installation script if pointed at no target db

12827977
installation	upgrade
i cannot seem to find the correct combination of options to reproduce this script only behavior for upgrade and full installation when using vs 2012 or ssdt in general

12827996
post	get
you will need a programming mindset to think through what type of data is being sent in the post and what is being retrieved in the get

12828039
jar	war
exclusion in the jar or war ear whatever plugin configuration

12828039
junit	testng
i agree that shipping unnecessary classes is annoying i ve seen junit and testng jars in production deployments - brrrr... but for all practical purposes it s a rather minor one

12828080
fgets	fgetc
note i think i would probably have an easier time using fgets instead of fgetc to accomplish this task

12828080
fgets	fgetc
ok i decided to use fgets instead of fgetc to greatly simplify my function

12828137
keydown	keyup
i ve heard that keyup and keydown get missed in some browsers

12828164
serializable	deserialization
as long as they have some way of understanding the xml with a predefined way of serializable and deserialization it will be fine

12828172
button	checkbox
i then have a button id mail_selected which when clicked is able to construct an array with all the id s for the selected checkbox

12828202
profiling	debugging
if in question try attaching a profiling to your requests and debugging into the program to see when the queries are issued

12828255
mallet	lda
several lda approaches are implemented in mallet apache mahout and vowpal wabbit

12828261
versioning	upgrade
i know that probably issuing dotnetfx45_full_setup.exe q will have no bad effect if installing on a system that already has versioning 4.5 but i still would like to not install the upgrade if the upgrade already exists faster and less problems

12828319
google-chrome	firefox
when you resize the window in any other browser firefox google-chrome i tested with the footer moves with the window

12828368
put	get
the easiest way i found is to don t put the unit_price but the global price then make a division in the php code to get the unit_price but i was hoping sql could do something for me

12828376
switching	screens
sometimes after switching to the facebook app instead of the permission screens i ll end up on a blank page with cancel as the only button up top and pressing cancel does nothing i m stuck on that blank page

12828377
hide	fadeout
also instead of fadeout hide might work better again due to possible clashes with animation when mousing over quickly between the links

12828402
action-filter	onactionexecuting
given you want access to the model and parameters you can change your approach slightly and use an onactionexecuting filter action-filter scope instead and throw a 401 or 403 based on your validation

12828496
inherited	subclassing
and then two derived classes or instances of the same subclassing that inherited the same statusview but fill it with different images

12828498
getter	setter
as far as getter and setter i avoid them at all costs

12828514
burn	uninstaller
but during uninstaller action the burn log file says

12828514
burn	uninstaller
what should i do so that the burn bundle is freely able to uninstaller the msi which the user selected at the time of install

12828520
int	chars
you are truncating the fgetc s value of type int to chars

12828529
rfcomm	l2cap
so you have the following nested protocol layers to decode spp - rfcomm - l2cap - acl data

12828537
maven	m2e
heard of egit m2e in eclipse for maven github integration but not sure how to use it

12828541
glfw	derelict3
i m trying to use opengl and glfw with derelict3 for the d language but i have some problems with the glfw3.dll and i m not sure about what i did wrong

12828541
glfw	derelict3
as derelict3 seems to need the glfw3.dll i cloned the git repository git glfw.git.sourceforge.net gitroot glfw glfw

12828606
setinterval	settimeout
iirc jquery animations are based on the date time it isn t handled primarily by settimeout or setinterval

12828635
super	implements
just remember in your -viewdidunload to remember to ask if the super class implements the method before attempting to call it on super if that s what you re currently doing using

12828636
x86	mips	freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
gcl currently compiles itself and the primary free software lisp applications maxima acl2 and axiom on eleven gnu linux architectures x86 powerpc s390 sparc arm alpha ia64 hppa m68k mips mipsel windows sparc solaris and freebsd

12828681
stdout	fflush
the output from the loop is not appearing due to stdout being buffered the printf statement inside the loop contains no n and stdout is not explicitly fflush d and the call to execl in main which replaces the current process image and stdout buffer is not fflush as usual on a normal program exit

12828681
stdout	fflush
add a new-line character to the printf or explicitly call fflush stdout

12828681
int	chars
i can t see a reason for dynamically allocating this or even when it needs to be an array as the format of the lines seems to be a single chars followed by an int

12828700
folder	directory
as you can see i am deleting the directory then i am copying the folder back

12828718
post	put
im trying to process a masqueraded put using spring s _metgod hidden attribute but the request is coming through as a post even with the hiddenhttpmethodfilter in place

12828733
children	parent
after a quick search based on javier hint i came up with this solution i could implement a single parent hash in redis where the value fields will be the string representation of the children hashes

12828788
client-side	server-side
you can always cache a server-side solution as well which you can t really do client-side

12828809
fast-forward	merge
you can use reflog to see how the references were moving that registers activity sometimes not visible from usual git log like fast-forward merge but i don t think it should matter in your case

12828842
range	minimum
for inclusive range setting the hard minimum maximum values works just fine

12828899
interbase	firebird
if you really need an embedded database there are several good alternatives including but not limited to sqlite ms sql server compact or localdb 1 interbase firebird etc.

12828900
folder	directory
i could technically make a folder called rails on my local computer so that they are both in the same directory structure but that doesn t really seem like an elegant solution

12828920
outputstream	inputstream
another problem is that you open the inputstream and the outputstream but you never actually read anything from the input nor do you write anything to the output so the file on your sdcard is going to be empty

12828932
postgresql	mysql
should work for you at least for mysql postgresql and sqlite3

12828948
floating-point	integer
you ll need to convert the result to some integer type anyway to avoid the insanity of floating-point equality comparisons

12828948
min	max
it s almost flat near the peaks and troughs so the quantisation step multiplying by some large number and rounding to an integer will produce many hash values near the min and max rather than an even distribution

12828960
postgresql	mysql
appfog is an online service paas for java node .net ruby php mysql mongo postgresql and more

12828961
postgresql	mysql
appfog is a simple paas for java node .net ruby php mysql mongo postgresql and more

12828980
apache	nginx
if youÃ¢ re not using heroku and are using apache or nginx to serve static files then this wonÃ¢ t work in that case youÃ¢ d need to configure your webserver separately

12829015
inherited	properties
so i implemented the extension method for propertyinfo that will return all properties from all interfaces and base classes inherited by the type

12829015
ilist	icollection
the problem was that ilist does not have a count property however icollection does

12829100
temp	tmp
i have set my tmp tmpdir and temp to a writeable folder via renviron.site

12829142
rss	feed
i ve written a little class in php to generate a simple rss feed

12829229
hide	show
i did find that i could make the date-picker control close up by calling its hide and then show methods

12829260
try-catch	exception-handling
i need to make it possible for the users to send me back possible exception-handling messages which i show by wrapping the main method into try-catch but that also forces me to see that custom message instead of visual studio s exception-handling window

12829307
hid	joystick
i have been searching through how to do gamepad and joystick support on mac for some days and all resources that i found seems to suggest a pre-installed driver along with using apple s hid api which works

12829307
hid	joystick
the drawback about this approach is that each joystick and gamepad will require another kernel extension to be loaded so it can be recognized by hid manager or at least a code less info.plist saying it conforms to the earlier installed driver

12829307
hid	joystick
since iokit api actually provided keywords like khidusage_gd_joystick and there s an forcefeedback.h library i suppose apple designed their hid api with joystick and force feedback in mind

12829347
min	max
i want to select all records where month 10 and max start_date from prev month and min end_date from next month

12829355
viewmodel	caliburn
basically in caliburn you don t need to work vith usercontrols or views directly but if you pick the viewmodel first approach caliburn framework should be able to find the matching view for you

12829355
viewmodel	caliburn
in your case since you re loading xap files dynamically you need to add them to the list of assemblies caliburn looks to find a view viewmodel and bind them together and this is done through iassemblysource interface

12829386
versioning	upgrade
now if system.data.sqlite.org would come out with a visual studio 2012 compliant versioning i can check off my other big upgrade task

12829398
fast-forward	merge
one way to accomplish this without needing to type --no-ff is to disable fast-forward merge into master entirely

12829398
fast-forward	merge
however this is clumsy since it also prevents fast-forward merge when simply merging upstream changes in master to a local copy of master merge commits are created for normal git pull s.

12829403
put	get
you can only generate pre-signed urls to get or put an object

12829431
int	chars
so if i have temp table #data groupid int item chars with

12829439
range	max	range	min	min	max
if you want to set a whole range to get one same color instead of getting a gradient between your min max values you ll have to change the call to makecdata

12829488
google-chrome	firefox
this will allow the js fullscreen api to work in firefox and google-chrome

12829538
gif	png
the supported formats are png jpeg gif and pdf

12829541
next	except
when you actually start playing the video the next request will look like this everything except the range header ommited

12829565
jar	war
there you can find extracted war folder and jar if you add it to deployments folder

12829581
range	minimum
given a query i k you can now binary search mp for k in the range 0 i - 1 using indirection to get the actual minimum value from the minimum index

12829622
post	get
but there is a big difference if you do not specify the type - serialize will do a get and serializearray will do a post

12829653
width	height
i am using below steps to know the width and height of contentview on my display screen

12829668
isnull	nvl
using isnull or nvl or whatever the appropriate function is in your database could be appropriate there

12829676
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i ve tested this in google-chrome safari firefox and node.js

12829676
firefox	safari
in safari and firefox the first iteration is slower than the 2nd iteration

12829762
width	height
can anyone think of a way even with an image if necessary that i can increase the height keeping the width of the arrow automatically based on the number of lines the menu item takes up to achieve something like this

12829774
width	height
the image will fill the width of the container and its height will scale in proportion

12829786
margin	height
here s a solution courtesy of this question css 100 height with padding margin

12829829
google-chrome	firefox
this does not occur under firefox or ie just google-chrome

12829830
subclass	accessor
you can have your subclass conform to the uiappearancecontainer protocol and then mark the accessor with ui_appearance_selector in your header file

12829880
margin	height
you need to stop adding to the margin the moment value of combined with height of the #menu_border exceeds height of the body

12829930
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome is just faster than firefox which just faster than ie at bit-wise operations

12829964
move	drag
to move a breakpoint drag it to a new location

12830026
typedef	struct
i also have a mygraph typedef map which takes in a struct as value type

12830052
int	double
when we try to print an int value with format specifiers that are used for float or double and vice the versa the behaviour is unpredictable

12830052
int	chars
but it is possible to use c to print the chars equivalent of the int value

12830052
int	chars
also using of d to print ascii value int representations of chars is acceptable

12830058
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it work perfect in firefox google-chrome and safari return object file but ie return a error because files in e.target is undefined

12830094
fgets	strtok
so read each line with fgets and parse it with strtok

12830100
exponent	addition
all you really have to do is work out how you should do the calculating of exponent and addition

12830143
width	height
it is possible to get the width and height of an image from the server

12830143
width	height
better yet you could use list to retrieve the width and height

12830143
width	height
list width height getimagesize path_to_image

12830143
width	height
whereas the first two returns from the array are width then height they are then set the the variables oddly enough width and height and you can use those to re-size your iframes

12830167
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
firefox safari and google-chrome is another story you need some javascript to get it work

12830169
layoutparams	viewgroup
it looks like this method gets called to to assign a layoutparams object for each child in the viewgroup

12830200
post	put
updates to the user resource should use the put method not post

12830206
std	ostream
the logger has to act like a c++ ostream with operator except that a stream manipulator function std endl for example will indicate the end of the logger s output

12830210
width	height
i believe systemmanager has a mousex mousey property and you can find the new width height in the screen property

12830227
mouse	keyboard
i created a program that controls the mouse using the keyboard

12830227
mouse	keyboard
for example when i select another window of another program a browser word etc the mouse won t move when i use the keyboard

12830237
implements	sealed
if the class is sealed it may implements iequatable for its own type in addition to doing the above

12830237
equals	gethashcode
with regard to your particular class i would suggest that since there are only 65 536 possible distinct instances you should simply store an integer which identifies which combination of bits is used compare that in equals and return it for gethashcode

12830242
google-chrome	firefox
it works great in google-chrome and firefox

12830251
post	get
when you click the new post link you are doing a get request on the page so the form is unbound and the initial value is used

12830279
put	get
the problem is that both the invoice_number and credit_memo_number get put into the invoice_number variable

12830289
hash	md5
md5 is so badly broken that it no longer takes so long to find an appropriate collision or reverse hash

12830299
children	parent	serializable	deserialization
sample code using redis-py assuming you already have redis and ideally hiredis installed saving each parent as a hash field with the children as serializable strings and handling serializable and deserialization on the client side

12830317
int	chars
for example chars are promoted to int thus printf c really expect an int which it then casted to an unsigned chars

12830317
int	chars
passing an int directly has the same effect as passing that int casted to an unsigned chars and is therefore safe

12830344
google-chrome	firefox
it s a lot like mechanize but controls actual browsers like google-chrome firefox so it will be a legitimate browser request

12830345
submit	submission
it s been changed in the new living html specification so that a submit event must not be dispatched if submission is from the form s submit method

12830376
atomic	interlocked
you don t have to wait for c++11 support in your compiler though most platforms provide some platform-specific atomic operations that also include any necessary memory barriers gcc s __sync built-in solaris atomic operations or win32 s interlocked functions

12830399
int	boolean
for holding down use a boolean int to record whether your game loop should increase or decrease i

12830408
nsobject	ivar
for instance i have a class myclass which inherits from nsobject it has two methods of interest setarg and getarg which set and get a float ivar

12830441
post	get
the http request will be a post instead of a get when the data parameter is provided

12830483
google-chrome	safari
this is a known issue with macintosh text rendering on google-chrome 22 and apparently safari

12830492
integer	unsigned
if is not representable it becomes complicated i think the easiest way except for using a big integer library of course would be to compute the high and if necessary low 64 or whatever width unsigned long long has bits separately by splitting the numbers at half the width and compare those

12830508
mouse	keyboard
the kcganyinputeventtype eventtype will report the last timestamp for any input event keyboard mouse or tablet

12830520
debian	linux
i m running linux debian and php5

12830541
division	addition	division	multiplication	addition	multiplication
note that the addition is not the trickiest operation to implement wait till you hit multiplication and division

12830547
touchesbegan	touchesended
i m wondering if someone knows how to implement the touch up inside response when a user pushes down then lifts their finger in the touchesbegan touchesended methods

12830581
touchesbegan	touchesended
you can implement touchesbegan and touchesended by creating a uiview subclass and implementing it there

12830608
daemons	systemd
i recently experienced a similar issue in v8 on a production box and what we think was happening was the network time daemons was changing the systemd s clock -- as it s designed to do

12830615
width	height
the obvious problem with this is that the width of the rotated element grows along with the height of the parent element

12830688
width	height
currently i am using the following to set height and width

12830688
width	height
the only conclusion i ve come to is that this is setting the height and width like this

12830705
centos	linux
bigcouch 0.4.0 couchdb 1.1.1 erlang r14b04 linux version centos linux release 6.0 final on ec2 and centos release 6.2 final on vmware 5.0

12830724
post	put
say if i put in the search terms interesting and fantastic the above post should be there in the result set

12830730
width	height
regardless of the orientation of the device the width is the horizontal and the height is the vertical

12830730
width	height
i am pretty sure width should be before height

12830738
put	get
i ended up having to put the code for the ibaction in my prepare for segue method to get it to work

12830742
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
output in firefox google-chrome and safari is correct

12830758
inherited	properties
properties inherited from uiscrollview

12830789
folder	directory
the samples folder inside your openwatcom install directory contains a number of sample projects all with makefiles or build instructions

12830870
firefox	safari
also it would be nice to have a solution that supports ie but frankly firefox and safari are sufficient

12830871
freebsd	linux
this happens on linux and freebsd regardless of ncurses version and 32 64bit architecture

12830893
hide	show
hide row1 columng and rows and columns that show blank

12830897
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
on google-chrome safari and firefox 10 this rendered a full chart as expected which took up the whole white box

12830941
google-chrome	firefox
browser s i ve tested against firefox 16 and google-chrome 22

12830943
activemq	rabbitmq
and there s a lot of good choice these days such as activemq rabbitmq 0mq

12831039
hash	salt
i am trying to replicate the results of a .net function to create the sha-256 hash of a password + salt

12831115
versioning	upgrade
if you upgrade to the latest versioning of geddy should be released tomorrow you ll be able to access the session directly from the template

12831116
width	height
scrolling can be applied to any element by adding overflow auto and fixed width and or height

12831125
width	height
you ll have to handle the degenerate case no height no width no depth no length no colour yourself

12831148
invokelater	invokeandwait
matter whether it uses invokelater or invokeandwait

12831151
folder	directory
you can get your total folder size and it sub directory like this

12831160
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
ios 6 uitabbarcontroller supported orientation with current uinavigationcontroller

12831185
width	height
you then know which images are at a clicked point by rectangle intersection - check your array of images and their x y points with width height for point intersection

12831196
implements	extends
the very first issue that i could find is the that you have declared a scale abstract method with no parameters but when you are extends the abstract class you are implements the scale method with parameters

12831215
hide	show
the new problem still related with the same thing which is the query did not specify session so different question across session might be mixed together i suggest you query out the sessionid in your select list for grabbing correct data and hide it on the page if you don t want show it however keep in mind you need to record that if you have some other detail page to show the question you still need to pass sessionid and questionid altogether to that page for identify the unique data

12831243
put	get
you can redefine the the whole style i mean put some other control to redefine the content and use templatebinding to get the external dependency property

12831267
post	get
once you get this permission you can then make a wall post using page access token

12831312
jython	pypy
other implementations such as pypy or jython can have completely different behavior in regards to the memory location of each instances in the above examples but all conforming implementatons including these 3 will behave exactly the same from the point of view of the python program 1 it does have access to the instances it keeps a reference to 2 the data of these instances is not corrupted or mangled in anyway

12831358
width	height
for example is just going to have an image url but is going to have the width and has the height

12831371
nscoder	nsobject
for example uikit has categories on nsobject nsindexpath nscoder and more

12831405
int	chars
create table esm etud int 11 sess int 11 modval chars 3

12831426
filtering	grouping
in the first grouping you filtering it to leave only the first n open stores

12831426
filtering	grouping
in the second grouping you filtering out the first n open stores and you set it to be hidden toggled by a text box in the first grouping - of your choosing

12831426
filtering	grouping
in the third grouping you filtering it to the first n closed stores

12831426
filtering	grouping
in the fourth grouping you filtering out the first n closed stores and you set it to be hidden toggled by a text box in the third grouping

12831426
filtering	grouping
you could drive the filtering of all four grouping with your parameter and all four grouping are in the same tablix so it has the appearance of one table

12831439
width	height
you still need to take care of managing your layout in snapped and filled scenarios and assign the width height of your viewbox and other controls to fit those

12831463
client-side	server-side
the good news is once you get your caching right it ll work server-side and client-side

12831481
freebsd	linux
another note i m doing this in freebsd which uses a different sed from what you ll find in linux

12831492
hide	show
a simpler alternative you could put all of the content on one page and give each section a unique id and a common class and then make the links in the nav correspond to the unique ids and with jquery hide the other content areas and show the one that was clicked

12831502
box-sizing	border-box	height	border-box
the wrapper div has height 100 box-sizing border-box and top and bottom padding equal to the height of the top and bottom divs respectively

12831502
width	margin
lastly middleleft is positioned absolutely and middleright has a left margin equal to its width which causes it to fill the remaining horizontal space

12831522
inherited	properties
but i can t figure out how to set the default properties of the editor control of an entire column nor the properties of a single row column editor which according to the documentation are inherited from the column s editorcontrol

12831571
int	boolean
type mismatch can t convert from int to boolean

12831595
hide	show
all working great now i need to hide the div#nivoslider from my index.php file so the slider will only show with the shortcode option

12831620
google-chrome	firefox
this works in google-chrome 22 but not in firefox 15 or ie 9

12831622
cout	cin
i ve added a couple other cout s just to see along the way what s going on and it appears my cin is only taking in the the part of the given text to read in

12831670
mouse	keyboard
to control the rotation with the mouse and keyboard it may be easiest to add a mousewheellistener to the jslider so that you control thumb rotation with the mouse wheel

12831712
pull	push
in that model yo can work offline and push pull back to the cloud

12831746
children	parent
a node can have multiple children but only one parent

12831748
oncreate	setcontentview
however if you desire you can customize the screen layout by setting your own view layout with setcontentview in oncreate

12831771
google-chrome	firefox
if all of this is true then it would seem that google-chrome s behavior is invalid whereas ie and firefox are correct

12831919
setinterval	settimeout
first off i would use the settimeout function once ajax request has loaded with or without error instead of using the setinterval function which does not take into account possible connection problems delays

12831930
superclass	subclassing
in a long run this will definitely pay off by not forcing you to repeat what have been already implements in superclass and keeping your subclassing implementations more manageable

12831939
chown	chmod
i made chown and chmod to var lib and data db and log mongodb

12832031
mouseleave	mouseenter
if you had a touchevent trigger a mouseenter the second touch pattern start end end sends a mouseleave assuming you don t randomly via subtle tap differences trigger a click combo

12832046
min	max
what i want is that whenever max or min is changed i want all elements currently in the elements array to update their color

12832046
min	max
but when an element is added to the elements array i just want to set the color of that element but that requires max and min and so i dont know how to separate the calls properly so that min and max updates will call one and an element update will call the other

12832058
happy	alex
i always install alex and happy from my distro s package manager apart from ghc and then use cabal

12832084
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
in a subclassing you can overload the methods inherited from the superclass

12832084
superclass	subclassing
such overloaded methods neither hide nor override the superclass methodsÃ¢ they are new methods unique to the subclassing

12832174
uicontrol	uibutton
note this solution runs through the subviews of the searchcontentscontroller which is one of the reasons i used ismemberofclass instead of iskindofclass uibutton is a subclass of uicontrol

12832246
button	checkbox
here is an updated fiddle with your code fixed as well as an example with 3 columns i also updated the javascript and added button for toggling the checkbox

12832250
width	height
and in particular it used to be that lack of width and height attributes was treated as sort of equivalent to setting them both to 100 except it didn t really play nice with actually setting a width or height in css and had some other problems

12832250
width	height
so now the behavior is that if you set width and height those are treated like presentational hints just like width and height attributes for and if you don t you get the default 300x150 intrinsic sizing which you can then override with style rules as desired

12832307
accessor	properties
as a shortcut you can dynamically assign the object value using the properties accessor

12832336
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
use a for-loop to loops over your 1d arrays

for-loop	arrays
inside that for-loop you ll need to figure out where each value in the 1d arrays should go in the 2d arrays

12832337
content-length	content-type
besides setting the proper xml document as request body don t forget to set the proper headers soapaction content-type and content-length

12832357
post	get
the reason being within the logic of the submit function there are variables i would like to pass through to another page but it consists of complex data structures objects arrays etc which would not be appropriate for post get data

ng-show	ng-hide
i would like to use ng-hide and ng-show directives of angularjs

12832807
client-side	server-side
but in any case you should never rely only on client-side javascript check server-side check is a must and client-side is nice to have in addition to that

12832807
setinterval	settimeout
i call this workaround a hack since timerid value returned by settimeout setinterval is not defined in any specification i could find

12832843
postgresql	mysql
i have tried to compare nosql mongo and sql postgresql mysql for my requirements

test.cc in function Ã¢ int main int chars Ã¢

12833080
x86	64bit
for example on x86 computers c and c++ double values are normally 64bit ieee754 floating point numbers but the math processor stack uses 80 bits per value when doing the computations

12833153
kindle	nook
i want to port an existing android application to nook and kindle fire devices

12833170
vbo	normals
then i try copying the array to a vbo and binding the positions and normals meaning vecattributetype.vposition and vecattributetype.vnormal in terms of offsets via glvertexattribpointer to the appropriate in attributes in the vertex shader

12833170
vbo	normals
my guess is that i m simply calculating the offset into the vbo for the positions and normals wrong

12833262
uiview	subviews
then add the mini table s view as a subviews to the main view maybe have a transparent uiview between the mini table and the big table so that user gestures do not get passed to the big table

12833288
post	get
you don t post accessors so i ll assume they are the standard type that actually get and set things

12833392
stdout	stderr
if you d rather not edit the build.xml it is probable that ant is using stderr rather than stdout

12833392
stdout	stderr
find out what shell you are using and look up how to redirect stdout to stderr

12833405
noexcept	throw
noexcept was added because it s the one reasonably useful use of an exception specifier knowing when a function won t throw an exception

12833405
noexcept	throw
noexcept was added rather than just removing all throw specifiers other than throw because noexcept is more powerful

12833405
noexcept	throw
if the boolean is false then the noexcept doesn t stick and the function may throw

12833410
noexcept	throw
when a function that is declared noexcept or throw attempts to throw an exception the only difference is that one calls terminate and the othe calls unexpected and the latter style of exception handling has effectively been deprecated

12833426

g++	gcc
the c file is compiled using gcc while the cpp is compiled using g++

12833749
equals	tostring
generally to implement equals method what i do is i generate those from eclipse as eclipse can generate hashcode tostring and equals methods very well

12833767
free	malloc
as far as i can understand the void malloc means that malloc returns a pointer to void void pointer and free is just void

12833769
int	double
though what you can conclude from this observation is that the int shown in the questions are definitely converted into double

12833801
hide	show
i added a bunch of custom styling to a textbox and other than a little js to show hide the ajax spinner hopefully this will get you part of the way there

12833845
free	malloc	int	chars	int	double
you cannot malloc an array of int chars double or any other struct - there would have to be a malloc free pair for any type possible including your own structs

12833845
int	chars
where type is the type you want to malloc int chars struct... and x is the number of instances you want to malloc

12833845
free	malloc
the free method just takes the pointer from malloc and frees it

12833866
hive	hdfs
i ve also seen from a suggestion that the encoding for these files is iso-8859-1 - but i don t see how to use that info in hive or hdfs

12833917
getter	setter
i can set and get colors of shapecircle fine because the color getter and setter are in shape but the dimensions of circle is only for the circle class radius

12833937
kindle	nook
to query for the manufacturer would be a better option since you are ready for new devices but as far as i know this works only for the kindle fire devices as these have amazon as the manufacturer while nook devices have foxconn

12833959
multiplying	add
multiplying by 5 shift right 2 multiplying by 4 then add with this number a 5 a 4 + a your code should like

12834024
uiview	subviews
uitableview which main tableview and add this in your main view after add one uiview and set as a subviews of your main view after add uitableview in your new view

12834055
implements	extends
the best way to correctly implements rawcomparator is to extends writablecomparator and override compare method

12834138
google-chrome	firefox
i have seen this in both firefox and google-chrome not tested with any other browser

12834194
free	malloc
you just have to forget to free any memory that you previously malloc d

on checking the explain plan i see that it is doing a index full scan min max on the table

12834212
google-chrome	firefox
should be able to work with almost all the web browser like ie google-chrome firefox etc

12834237
pop-up	dialog
3 the next dialog that pop-up is vitally important - you need to 1 define that the stored procedure returns a collection of complex types then you need to 2 get the column info from that stored procedure to know what columns it will return then 3 you tell visual studio to generate a new complex type based on that column info

12834256
folder	directory
i have a some directory that contain some other directory which at the lowest level contain bunch of csv files such as folder a - b - c - csv files

12834397

12834399
post	get
you use formmethod.get when you make http get request and formmethod.post when you make http post request it is methods of parameters

12834404
implements	extends
you have to implements like this in your class which is extends sqlite helper class

12834418

12834481
int	chars
assigned to an int and the conversion to chars should only be done

12834516
google-chrome	firefox
however you may try firebug plug-in in mozilla firefox or google-chrome browser its built-in dev

12834526
uiview	subviews
since segment control is a subviews of uiview this should work

12834564
google-chrome	firefox
either use the firebug plugin with firefox - you can insert breakpoints there or use google-chrome s debugger

12834641
width	height
the width and height of the webpage html is 356x405px the problem is when i convert it to a4 pdfs size 8.5x11.69inches the html shows very small in pdf

12834641
width	height
so i have to increase the width and height of the html to fit the pdf size while increasing the html size to 8.5x11.69in

12834641
width	height
the content inside the html should also increase proportionally ie the text font size background image images width and height top left should also be increased proportionally

12834711
post	get
but is complicated for a beginner.i suggest you learn how to make post and get request using qt and then start developing an automatic forum poster

12834750
bluetooth	usb
of course you can you should have le bluetooth usb adapter even if you have a built in bluetooth

12834793
perl	tcl
for instance if you have git installed changes are good you already have perl and tcl available at your disposal

12834844
width	height
actually you don t have to use width and height attributes they are deprecated

12834918
width	height
in this method change bitmap size as per your height and width

12834939
google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly in google-chrome but i want to make it work for firefox as well

12834947
strlen	realloc
i could write a fairly horrible loop that keeps calling strlen on data and counting until length bytes have been encoded appending a 0000 string every time i need to encode some more bytes realloc ing some buffer to accomodate each extra chunk of encoded data

12834994
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
i thought it would be easy just doing with touchesbegan and touchesmoved

12834994
touchesmoved	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended
so i thought i could create two integers which to one i will set value to in touchesbegan then in touchesmoved setting the another and lastly comparing them checking if the move is in the same view button - if it is not then it calls the touchesended

12835010
int	boolean
creating indexers for int strings boolean etc

12835060
kindle	nook
this most probably includes the kindle fire and nook

vbscript	vba
in your case you can use vbscript which can for the most part also be used with vba

12835192
prepare	execute
when using a binding parameter you have to prepare the query bind the parameter and then execute the query

12835223

the answers i see here actually merely answer whether it is possible to prevent serializable or deserialization of some class marked serializable

12835231
hide	show
with javascript you just have to hide the one div and to show the other

12835258
int	chars
malloc is a memory allocation function which primary job is to return pointer to starting address of the memory block allocated by malloc .the problem is that malloc is designed to be generic not for the any single type so the address return should not be for a specific type e.g chars int it should be generic so malloc returned a void pointer which is giving an option to programmer to cast it to any type and use that memory

12835258
int	chars
for free it a memory freeing function which primary job is to free the content of the memory address pointed by the argument this also designed for generic by which it can able to free any memory type not for only chars int etc.so its argument type is void

12835286
getter	setter
the manager must be the owner of the list and would need the methods setter getter and deleters methods

12835325
integer	unsigned
but your test in your for-loop will fail for the case when is zero because count returns an nsuinteger which is unsigned and subtracting -1 to 0ul creates an underflow as -1 interpreted as an unsigned integer gives you the maximum value of an integer instead because -1 is negative and unsigned integers can only store positive integers of course

12835325
for-loop	arrays
so when you don t have any contact and is zero you are entering into your for-loop anyway thus the crash when trying to get the object at index 0 in your empty arrays of people

12835327

i thought that entitymanager of singleton bean does not hold state of entities correctly if it is injected by multiple beans.i thought that same singleton bean instance must be get from connection pool

12835425
des	rsa
it uses rsa and des however you can easily change it from the code

12835450
debian	linux
i get the same result on linux debian environment

12835555
versioning	upgrade
as patches are designed to upgrade just the differences from one versioning to a another 1.2 to 1.3 having the patch id set to is completely invalid

12835562
super	abstract	super	extends
what you could do is make an abstract super class which all of your classes will extends and then make a list of that

12835562
super	extends
any class that extends this super class will then fit into the same list

12835584
memcpy	memset
so i am confused with the abnormal behavior of memchr on mac os while other mem functions like memset memcpy works fine

12835636
width	height
some groupboxes ecxeed the width and height so i want to put this all in scrollbar

12835750
temp	tmp
it will be slower but it will not run out of ram unless tmp is on ramdisk in that case you need to change where imagick writes its temp files

12835774
width	height
when this happens the div loses any css defined width height and the grid is broken

12835799
getter	setter
if you have getter and setter for pagetools then in jsp it is as simple as that

12835869
uicontrol	uibutton	touchesmoved	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended
ok so found out that adding touchesbegan touchesmoved and touchesended to a uibutton subclass doesn t work as expected so i have switched to adding targets for each of the uicontrol actions

disk	ram
the goal is to make imagick put its pixel cache on disk instead of in ram

12835966
temp	tmp
the default place seems to be files tmp magick-xxnnnnn so make sure tmp is not on shmfs ramdisk or change the temp directory imagick uses

12835970
public	protected
this means that public protected and private methods in the helper become public protected and private methods on the views

12836068
ctime	strftime
if you have a std chrono system_clock time_point then you can use std chrono system_clock to_time_t to convert the time_point to a time_t and then use the normal c functions such as ctime or strftime to format it

12836200
width	height
however a height maybe width and overflow rules need to be added to a containing element in order to stop the text wrapping under the image

12836205
filtering	grouping
creating two column grouping with the same structure is due to the need to filtering out results differently in the two grouping

12836235

12836938
button	checkbox
when i ve been making forms with checkbox and radio button in my jquery mobile mvc 4 project if i use razor syntax to spit out the controls according to the view model html.radiobuttonfor etc instead of just writing the standard input type radio jquery mobile doesn t apply the styles to the elements

packets	pcap
i opened a pcap in wireshark and it displays a lot of packets as tcp segment of a reassembled pdu

12836952
prepare	execute
you can achieve this using the prepare execute deallocate commands for handling statements which is really what we are talking about here

12837071
valgrind	memcheck
memory allocation is hooked with memcheck if you use it otherwise valgrind calls the libc memory allocation routines

12837097
pull	push	squash	branch
i am wondering what happens if you squash between branch and push pull from remote in between

12837222
post	get
i add that if your request is an http request then you will not be able to alter parameters coming from get or post parameters

12837222
post	get
these parameters are virtually added to all parameters via overriden accessors so setparam on a these requests with a get or post variable key as parameters will simply do nothing because setparam tests whether the key is present in the intrinsic parameters of the requets not http ones

12837229
width	height
you can change the height and width of chart web part otherwise you can follow scrolling like below

12837300

folder	directory
the app directory loader looks for templates in a templates folder in any of the apps listed in installed_apps in settings

12837569
namenode	hdfs
unless you have two clusters my guess is you meant the app_path to point to the same hdfs instance as the one named in your namenode property in which case try

12837572
oncreate	ondestroy
resources cleanup i use a single activity create the sqliteopenhelper in oncreate and close it ondestroy

12837580
rss	feed
detecting events from rss atom feed so anytime a new feed arrives it can fire some rule

12837614
stdout	stderr
where 2 equates to stderr 1 is stdout printf debugging and both would be just

12837634
uiview	calayer

12837686
rss	feed
android rss feed reader example

12837734
keydown	keyup
if you need to bind to an element up in the hierarchy you can subscribe to the keyup event in the keydown handler

12837764
rss	feed
it should be as this loads of the rss feed for accountset and that specific account

12837813
keydown	keyup
i had a specific case with tab key which changes the e.target in keyup so that s solution - bind to container element grab target input in keydown handler subscribe to keyup and read the value

12837826
versioning	upgrade
as an aside i d strongly advise you to try to upgrade to a more modern versioning of c#.

typo3	templavoila
i am developing a typo3 website with templavoila

12837933

free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	malloc
even if you have no garbage collector you still have a memory manager which is what lies behind malloc free realloc and so on and new also for that matter

12838110
int	chars
this is probably due to the arithmetic conversion rules first any int type of conversion rank less than int eg unsigned chars will promote to int or unsigned int

12838110
int	chars
whether the result will be int or unsigned int does not directly depend on the signedness of the original type but its range int is used even for unsigned types as long as all values can be represented which is the case for unsigned chars on mainstream architectures

12838110
int	chars
i would imagine that in the first case the compiler thinks i have a comparison operator whose operand types are unsigned int and unsigned chars

12838154
keyevent	onkeydown
within one of your own activities override methods like onkeydown examine the keyevent to see if it matches and start the activity if it does

12838158
slideup	slidedown
it will look for a div for each of the options with all spaces removed from the text and perform a slideup for all non-selected ones and a slidedown for the selected one

12838158
hide	show
ideally you would give each of the divs to show hide a class that you can use to hide them all and then it becomes easier to just show the one relevant one

12838159
pop-up	dialog
the error you have is due to a cross-domain request the pop-up is known as the cross-domain data access dialog

12838197

yii - cakephp - codeigniter - zend

12838204
int	chars
whenever a chars type is used in an expression the int promotion rules in c implicitly converts it to an int

12838204
int	chars
int promotions are performed on all chars so it gets implicitly converted to

12838239
oncreate	onnewintent
if the activity was still running it should be called with onnewintent instead of oncreate and the intent delivered to onnewintent should have the appropriate extras

12838244
fortran	ada
you cannot get stable c-like performance across different microbenchmarks from anything less mature than prehistoric languages such as c fortran ada and c++

12838249
vsto	add-in
i created a vsto add-in and udf class for excel 2007

12838276
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
instead of dealing with fileinputstream s and bufferedreader s.

12838307
viewdidload	viewwillappear
yes - void viewdidload method is first call at the time view is loading process and - void viewwillappear bool animated method is call at the time of view will presenting process

12838379
vim	emacs

12838447
google-chrome	firefox
i have found a solution which works properly in google-chrome firefox and internet explorer

12838454

other way to tackle this problem is to have only one grouping since in your case the grouping rules are the same just create a parent grouping that grouping based on the filtering you want to apply

12838455
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox dev tools handle this dynamic styling ok

12838523

12838568
viewdidload	viewdidappear
i know that i am returning correct numbers to uitableview because if i call it after viewdidappear it works perfectly it just doesn t work in viewdidload

12838568
viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
when i move this code from viewdidappear to viewdidload or viewwillappear it will crash

12838584
google-chrome	safari
i noticed that when i open this gif using safari google-chrome it will play just once till i manually refresh the browser

12838584
width	height
i set break points in ondraw method and i am sure the mmovie can load the gif mmovie can return correct width and height of the gif

12838595
width	text-align
you could of course stretch the element the width of its parent and use text-align

12838607
post	get
i can access with post and get method but only after the user has been connected via the usual form of spring security

12838613

12838741
mediarecorder	audiorecord
you can t use mediarecorder audiorecord for this because there s no way in android to specify an audio output as an input for a recorder

12838781
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
if i understand you are trying to access every different tag in the xml document so you should use getelementsbytagname instead of getelementbyid

12838792

interfaces do not support getter and setter

12838800
post	get
could anyone help me to find the right way to get the post data sent from the httprequest

so to actually get it working not only do we have to put down the config in yml which has been solved by chmeliuk - thanks but we also need to configure the cacert.pem file for curl

12838882
folder	directory
here i create a folder structure in application files as c program files test setup productname test setup is the installdir and within this i have sub directory one of which launch contains the exe files

put	get
the problem that i have is when it tries to use js to render the partial my restful resource activity_task_path sends a get method instead of the put method that i am specifying

12839104
getter	setter
you can specify the property on the interface but you can t enforce whether getter and setter are used like this

12839104
getter	setter
in this example the interface doesn t force the class to use getter and setter i could have used a property instead example below - but the interface is supposed to hide these implementation details anyway as it is a promise to the calling code about what it can call

12839106
put	get
i use paramiko module and i can simply put and get files to and from remote host

12839186

12839927
tinyint	boolean
i knew boolean in mysql as tinyint 1

12839947
comparator	comparable
in the comparator i am attempting to invoke the comparable method comparator to obtain a negative integer that gives an approximate location for where an item would be if it were in the array on a failed search but again i m having trouble with generics getting this error the method comparator e is undefined for the type e

12839957
tstringlist	tlist
i believe it is much much faster than using tlist descendant or tstringlist

now there are a number of differences regarding how google-chrome and firefox trigger the popstate event i shudder to think what i m up against when i get around to testing ie but one that s giving me problems here is that google-chrome will trigger a popstate event whenever i click on either of those two links and then again when i hit the back button

12840563
clang	llvm
since has different results from for many arguments there is no rewrite rule for that so you really get that slow function with ghc s native code generator it seems that llvm replaces it with nevertheless from the huge performance difference of the two ghc backends and the clang result

12840603
versioning	upgrade
you need to either downgrade or upgrade to a different jre versioning

12840653
serializable	deserialization
however an ui component like htmlform isn t serializable with the simple reason that its state is sensitive to request-based changes which would in case of being serializable only cause possibly corrupt unsynced state after deserialization

however when we prepare for release release prepare maven execute the tests during test phase

12840869
prepare	execute
we do not want to skip any tests we just want release prepare to execute just like any other maven goal

12840911
put	get
i put heroku logs and get this

12840947
serializable	deserialization
to stop the serializable deserialization of such an object you have to configure a customobjectmapper that extends objectmapper

12840955
switching	screens
switching to the second screens -

12840956
width	height
since only one item per section is allowed the extent width height is

12840956
width	height
virtualizing panel height width explicitly

12840956
width	height
i didn t understand what you meant by fixed cells but if you have fixed width height per item you could write better virtualization than the one i provided virtualwrappanel

12840956
width	height
but if you combine it with the fact that each item has the same width height i believe you could do better

12840982
postgresql	mysql
if you are using an rdbms which has tuple-capable in like postgresql mysql and oracle

12840990

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i ve also noticed that when going fullscreen in firefox a black band appears across the bottom of the screen which does not happen in google-chrome or safari

12841116
inherited	properties
in the oop world what you have implemented in terms of a type properties would normally be implemented via inherited

12841233
free	malloc
no without manipulating memory explicitely malloc free

12841233
free	malloc
if you need to modify the array dimension at run-time use std vector because it saves you from dealing directly with malloc and free

12841272
typo3	fluid
check typo3 sysext fluid classes viewhelpers translateviewhelper.php for sample of correct inline usage so for an example setting your label as a default value of the input field would look like this

12841278
unsigned	short	int	chars
arithemitc types covers int and floating types 6.2.5.18 and finally int types are chars short int long and long long which exist as signed and unsigned types 6.2.5.4 and 6.2.5.6

12841293

12841554
put	get
then can t be a subtype of because you can t put any object of type base into a but can t be a subtype of because if you get an object out of a it might not be a derived

12841554
put	get
edit and if you had a collection that you could neither get data from nor put data into then it might be both co- and contravariant

12841555
post	get
when i press search submit button in the form then post data is sent to that script and i get search results

12841555
post	get
after login i get that page but no post data is sent to that page

12841622
width	height
i have noticed that _mousedrag method of resizable sets width and height to their actual values in the dom element s style attribute

12841683
post	get
then i get post query with code and signed_request arguments

12841703
getter	setter
to answer your original question you need to have a static variable that have static getter and setter

12841788
int	chars
thus in the c abstract machine unsigned chars values must be promoted to int before arithmetic is performed

12841788
int	chars
there is an exception for perverse machines where unsigned chars and int have the same size

12841788
int	chars
in this case unsigned chars values are promoted to unsigned int rather than int

12841788
int	chars
in this case using unsigned chars arithmetic to do the addition could yield a different result than converting the values to int and using int arithmetic

12841788
int	chars
e.g. if a is 250 and b is 200 then their sum as unsigned chars values is 194 250 + 200 256 but their sum in int arithmetic is 450

12841800
range	max	range	min	min	max
2b a combo of datum 1 comparison plot 2 plots sharing a combined range max min y of both

12841810
spaces	delimiter
my solution in the end was to hide additional data in the id tag separated by some sort of delimiter one underscore is a spaces two is the end of that arg the second arg there is an id

12841907
min	max
even easier is to use max and min

12841944
getter	setter
yui compressor doesn t accept ecmascript features like getter setter

12841945
google-chrome	firefox
you can this post use in firefox google-chrome browser

12841966
inherited	properties
or if by stuff you don t need you mean inherited properties methods of your object you can check that with object.hasownproperty

12841969
hide	show
what i would like to do isÃ¢ to hide show a view when i click on the button and toggle the state of the button changing his text

12841969
hide	show
it hide show the view but it does not change the text on the button

12842106
int	double
define sum as int and average as double

12842161
sum	coalesce
or use right join and group on s.id in both case use a coalesce on sum t.points if you don t want null values you must also check for null transaction datetime or use the date predicate in the join

12842185
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
and free is called only if you need to free memory that you have allocated dynamically in the heap using malloc or calloc - which is not the case in your code

12842188
jar	war
on the other hand if you use an application server like tomcat you can either package the jar inside the war of your application of place it into a shared library folder of the server

12842196
free	malloc
you can only free memory which has been allocated using the malloc family of calls

12842196
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
1 you only need to free s if it was allocated using malloc calloc or another call from that family

12842332
int	chars
would make sense and means take the second chars of the first in argv . imho the code is trying to detect a -q command-line flag and subsequently setting testnum to the int version of the next argument blindly assuming it is present but it s skipping checking for the - and blindly assuming it s there and no other arguments would ever have q as a second chars

12842333
implements	extends
i just tried extends socketchannel but it seems that socketchannel have some new api methods available starting from jre 1.7.4 problem is if i implements those methods my jar would throw the following error whenever i m using java 1.6

12842359
hide	show
external modules are useful in sense they hide the internal statements of the module definitions and show only the methods and parameters associated to the declared variable

12842360
google-chrome	firefox
why does this not work in ie8 but just fine in firefox or google-chrome

12842399
ggplot2	lattice
i m not sure if i understand the problem and you asked for a lattice solution but i thought it may be helpful to see this done with ggplot2

12842408
google-chrome	firefox
everything works correct in google-chrome and even ie but it doesn t work in firefox 15.0.1

12842425

Ã¢ an object or expression with an integer type whose integer conversion rank is less than the rank of int and unsigned int

12842451
unsigned	short	int	chars
conversion of the various kinds of chars or short or _bool to int or unsigned int

12842470
children	parent
i have a parent model which hasmany children which belongsto the parent

so a parent will have many children

12842489
thin	webrick
so i ve switched from my standard webrick server to thin evented server

12842536
width	height
again this works because i have defined the height and width of 1 1 square container

12842536
width	height
with responsive we can t define the height of the square container because the width changes

12842551
hide	show
in your html you d use those scope items to set show or hide your areas

12842551
ng-show	ng-hide
one thing to note is that ng-show and ng-hide are simply not displaying the html.

12842638
mouseup	mousedown
however in any other event mousedown slide of another slider mouseup click anything.. it does not respond

12842662
linefeed	delimiter
i think imap uses linefeed at least for some of its message delimiter

12842699
textview	imageview
small things such as a textview having an image source would be resized to the image in older versions of android but the image size being ignored in android 4.0 because it thinks you should just use an imageview instead

hash	hmac
as you can see when comparing ios hmac and php hash they contain the same characters but once you base64 encode this the result is not the same

12842790
implements	extends
if you are calling a method whose parameter implements any type then you must ensure you generic type t implements extends that type

12842795
datagridcomboboxcolumn	datagridtemplatecolumn
i personally fought with datagridcomboboxcolumn for long time and i think the way is to use datagridtemplatecolumn

12842822
prepare	execute
prepare statements with bound parameters are not only more portable more convenient immune to sql injection but are often much faster to execute than interpolated queries as both the server and client side can cache a compiled form of the query

12842910
prepare	execute
in theory this should append -dskiptests to the arguments that the prepare and release goals pass to the sub-executions of maven that they execute

12842913
for-loop	arrays
your mapitems wasn t displayed in twig because you have to make your for-loop on pagewithmapitems.mapitems if you do it directly on pagewithmapitems it ll not work because your pagewithmapitems variable contain un object of page and not an arrays

12842919
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the most baffling thing is that the font works correctly in ie 9-7 but not firefox google-chrome and safari

12842930
temp	tmp
it is accessible via either drupal.respirometry.org or respirometry.org which have slightly different openbasedir settings so my options seem to be either set the temp directory to tmp or to change the openbasedir settings on both sites so they can access each other s temp directories

12842937
put	get
i put it all together to get this

12842959
rss	feed
it is the same problem for the links to rss feed

12842961
hash	salt
for the second part since you re authenticating your users you should also be worried about how you store their passwords use some one-way cryptographic hash for that with a salt

12842961
hash	salt
and check if calculating the hash again from the user-entered password using the original salt matches the database entry

12842971

i ve searched for a while and every post seems to suggest i need to use the ccombobox class however i have no idea how to get the class variable from the resource id of the combobox element in the gui editor

actionscript	mxml
imo flex and mxml is essentially just a markup language for actionscript

12843101
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
when you create your own ami from one of the amazon predefined beanstalk images and you don t actually make any changes to the file system install anything create files etc. amazon-web-services will not create a new snapshot while creating a custom ami

12843353

but my end users don t have a mouse or keyboard

12843382
put	get
i cannot just put it into the topic again since all subscribers would get it then

12843384
min	max
i don t know the reasons for the design decisions made in mysql but considering that you can get the actual related data from the same row s as the aggregate came from max or min with only slightly more work i don t see any advantage in returning additional column data from arbitrary rows

12843395
post	get
if you only route for a controller for instance comments id then you only need to use params id to get the params but if you have multiple controllers and multiple id s involved and accessible then it would be something like post id comments comment_id to avoid confusion between which id you accessing

12843439
folder	directory
then inside that directory there will probably be a folder with the database name

12843450
hide	show
the code essentially just show hide the given div

12843453
bash	zsh
i experience the same behavior regardless in iterm2 terminal and while using any of zsh bash or a normal login shell

12843467
dbcontext	objectcontext
when using ef code first it appears wcf ria services wizard that runs when adding a new domainservice in vs 2012 does not recognize the dbcontext defined in the project it only recognizes the objectcontext

12843470
equals	gethashcode
to change the equality behavior you need to override equals and gethashcode

12843489
equals	gethashcode
either override equals and gethashcode in your car class or define an class and pass that to contains

12843500
hide	show
trouble is i can t show and hide a div because it will screw up my php redirect if i ve already generated output before the

12843503

dbcontext	objectcontext
i was surprised to see that the generated code inherited from objectcontext ef 4.x style rather than dbcontext ef 5.x

12843517
inline	inlining
and then inline this in user modeladmin but i want to achieve the opposite effect something like inverse inlining displaying the fields of the model pointed by the onetoone relationship user in the page of the model defining the relationship userprofile

12843540
sorting	grouping
a key to make this work was figuring out how to inject my collectionview with proper sorting definitions and grouping definitions into my datatemplate

12843543
width	height
the reason mainframe.repaint forces the map to refresh is because repaint calls repaint 0 0 0 width height which marks the entire mainframe s area to be marked as dirty for the repaintmanager

everything sdl does has a language localization globalization aspect to it

google-chrome	firefox
i also tested firefox it also worked fine the issue is only with google-chrome

12843624
client-side	server-side
this is absolutely impossible to call a javascript client-side function from within c# server-side code

12843624
client-side	server-side
server-side code renders the client-side code

12843624
client-side	server-side
but for asp.net provides you a hook that actually transforms client-side html controls most html tags into server-side controls as the .net framework supports and then you can access their properties and some methods which only invoke at server-side

12843624
client-side	server-side
anyway using ajax at client-side you can still invoke server-side methods using ajax.net and or ajaxpro ajaxpro.info or a custom javascript lib jquery

12843648
hide	show
then you can use js as i prefer jquery to show the div or hide the div when applicable

12843652

12843827
uitableview	reloaddata
the correct way would be to modify your datasource to claim n-1 rows when you want to remove one then call uitableview reloaddata to have it regenerate the table and ask you for new cells for each visible row

12843850
wakelock	powermanager
you solve the problem by getting a partial wakelock from the powermanager which keeps the cpu from sleeping when the screen goes off

12843876
folder	directory
but all your folder come from the same parent directory

12843880
pull	push
when i try to push my commits to github and i haven t checked for someone elses push first i have to do a fast forward pull

12843926
superclass	subclassing
in fact you don t need to type cast explicitly from a subclassing object to a superclass reference

12843926
superclass	subclassing
but when you create an object of subclassing and make reference of superclass point to that object then compiler never has an problem with that

12843927
versioning	upgrade
if you do that you will run a strong risk of your code breaking if you upgrade your compiler build with a different compiler build a debug versioning instead of a release versioning etc etc

12843928
google-chrome	firefox
the page does not work in google-chrome but does work in ie and firefox

onclicklistener	ontouch
the thing is if i start swiping over the imageviews that don t have an onclicklistener the ontouchlistener works but when i start swiping over an image that has an onclicklistener then the ontouch function doesn t work nor does the onclick of that imageview as it is normal

12844321
put	get	post	get	post	put
i don t have an id defined because it is a post not a get or put

12844332
put	get
it sounds like you want to use an ng-repeat and index to get the index of the item to put in the form input field s name

12844364
int	chars
i thought the #define matched up the variable type with the input so if i put in an a #seed would be a chars and if i put in a 1 #seed would be an int

12844390
int	double
although matlab uses double everywhere you should try to use int data types when possible

12844390
int	double
differently than in c a cast of double to int implies a round operation

12844461
ant	maven
note visualstudio and msbuild will always run a makefile project - it does not check the timestamp on the output file but instead punts that job to what it expects to be some other build tool nmake cmake make ant maven etc.

12844461
pop-up	dialog
visualstudio always running makefile projects also means that every time you press f5 to debug your project visualstudio will annoy you with a poorly worded pop-up a dialog box if you haven t told it not to telling you that you your project is out of date and that you must build it again

12844494
int	chars
i maped them tostring to get the actual value when applied toint and not the int value representing the chars returned by tolist

12844711
folder	directory
is there a function in std boost filesystem or any other cross-platform library that can tell me given a string whether it is a legal directory path even just syntactically meaning it doesn t have to check if there is already a file or folder with that name but without creating the directory and deleting it in order to check

12844750
hide	scrolltop
some people have suggested that i use the scrolltop function to hide the back to top button but there are just too many cross-browser issues with that

16-bit	64bit
it seems unlikely that any 16-bit machine has any hardware support for 64bit operations

12844820
16-bit	64bit
if the machine has no support for 64bit types it s possible to implement it in assembly language c or whatever other language you use using 4 16-bit hardware registers

12844820
x86	64bit
the machine may have no support but maybe someone has already written libraries that implement it this was is the case with the old x86 systems which had good libraries for 64bit floating-point type double

12844820
16-bit	64bit
the machine may have some 64bit capabilities the 32-bit arm has a command smlalxy that multiplies 16-bit numbers and adds the sum to a 64bit number

12844835
put	get
currently i have no problems using the php library provided by google to get the data and put it to good use

12844839
exponent	modulo
i have been researching this and have found rsacryptoserviceprovider but for encryption decryption that seems to want the key to be in an xml format with a modulo and exponent

12844839
exponent	modulo
my question is is there a way to generate the xml format with modulo and exponent using the data i have or is there another way i can decrypt the string using the data i have

as a general rule don t upgrade your haskell platform or ghc until you know that all of the packages you rely on support the new versioning

12845067
post	get
the website doesn t have an api that i can find so i m trying to submit an http post request to their .aspx form and get a response back that can then be stripped and stored in an ios table view

12845067
post	get
i have the uiwebview setup and have tried composing various post requests but i always get the default page back

12845099
versioning	upgrade
i regret to say that you cannot upgrade your device to an older firmware versioning like ios 4.3 for which apple is not providing signed shsh blobs anymore

12845111
integer	unsigned
in this buffer blob there are unsigned 16bit integer numbers each distributed over two entries in the buffer

12845171
division	modulo
the modulo calculates the remainder after division

12845181
division	modulo
the modulo returns the remainder after integer division

12845209
int	chars
so if the high bit of is set it will be a negative value and when you use it in an expression it will first be promoted to a negative int effectively propagating the high bit of the chars into all higher bit positions

12845209
int	chars
the reason that -ing with 0xff works is that the chars value is promoted to int before the operation is performed

12845242
winpcap	libpcap
the byte order of data in packets captured by libpcap winpcap is the byte order in which the data is transmitted on the network

12845242
winpcap	libpcap
libpcap winpcap supply raw packet data except for pseudo-header information such as radiotap radio headers which don t appear on the wire and are in whatever byte order the software that generates them use little-endian in the case of radiotap

12845345
public	protected
also remember if you want your children classes to inherit this variable from your base class you will need to set it as either public or protected

12845365
public	protected
there are 4 of them public default protected private

12845365
superclass	subclassing
another thing to be noted is that a subclassing can override the superclass method if this method is not private

12845436
folder	directory
you could compile your source files to object files in different directory folder is not really the appropriate word on unix

12845438

12845571
inline	inlining
the inline on the changebits function means that that definition is to be used only for inlining

12845577
public	protected
public keys are not sensitive information and may be known to anybody whereas the private key needs to be protected very carefully by a strong passphrase

12845584
inherited	properties
should you by accident have any inherited different css line-height properties the solution to set vertical-align -5px will need to be re-checked and re-adjusted every time

12845590
uiview	subviews
right now this is causing the uitextviewlayer to be completely transparant - i see the background color of the uiview that the uitextviewlayer is as subviews of

12845622

i suspect that android may be opening the options menu in some kind of internal onclick callback which coincides with your onkeyup

12845665
queue	fifo
let s put all cars that arrives to the crossing into the single fifo queue regardless of the direction a car is going

12845683

client-side	server-side
client-side app and server-side app are placing on different hosts but both domains are added as domain of app on facebook developers site

12845742
ready	each
one the client side the loop would examine each chunk of data for the keyword and if it found it then whatever is in the buffer would be written to file and the buffer reset ready for the next file

12845803
16-bit	64bit
the main usage of the mmx instruction set is based on the concept of packed data types which means that instead of using the whole register for a single 64bit integer two 32-bit integers four 16-bit integers or eight 8-bit integers may be processed concurrently

12845817
google-chrome	firefox
i m having problems with setting validations date format google-chrome in asp.net mvc for other browsers like ie firefox works correctly

12845868
nexus	artifactory

unfortunately because keydown keyup do not show the ascii characters i can t use these events without having to write some sort of parsing algorithm

12845963
submit	submission
note that this won t prevent people who intend you ill from submission other things - jquery validate sits on top of the form and it s possible to submit stuff underneath it with a bit of hackery - but it will make sure that everyone who s trying to do the right thing is guided to the proper path

12845968
popover	tooltip
for performance reasons the tooltip and popover data-apis are opt in

12846253
disk	ram
i need some suggestions on performance tuning this script which reads url headers dumped by the proxy on a temporary ram disk it reads the file and appends it to a list after some checks it reads the list and if the line contains user-agent redits and is flushed out using standard output.

12846266

checkbox	dropdownlistfor
make sure you re using the dropdownlistfor from the grid not the one at the top of the dialog and do not check the create new solution configurations checkbox when adding your new project configuration

12846855
folder	directory
however since each databases requires the creation of one directory on the file system and the file system may have a limit on the number of directory in one folder there is an effective limit

12846855
filesystems	ntfs
check your filesystems documentation for the maximum number of directories it allows ntfs 4 billion ext3 32000 ext4 unlimited etc.

yes getattr and setattr are much slower at least at the cpu level

12847015
versioning	upgrade
when a new versioning of the app is released i d like to be a little smarter about copying files over during the upgrade process

12847017
min	max
also in your code it seems the min and max values are mixed up

12847027
inherited	properties
on the other hand sometimes a group of properties are only relevant to a subset of items that cannot be expressed via single inherited

12847064
mouseover	mouseenter
try with mouseenter instead of mouseover so it will only fire when the mouse first enters the element and not every time the mouse moves

12847090
children	parent
all children of the common parent ancestor of the anchor and focus nodes with the containsnode method

12847128

i don t really see the need to let a rule return both a double and int if you ever need an int simply cast the double

12847168
onkeyup	onkeydown
i get the same result with onkeydown and onkeyup events as well

12847173

however the new persona browserid api now has a navigator.id.logout function that you should call as well as a onlogout callback inside the navigator.id.watch where you specify what happens when users logout cookies get deleted

12847179
put	get
you may get even better performance if you put the limit 0 5 inside the reply_date subquery

utf8-decode	percent-encoding
when tidhttpserver decodes the arequestinfo.document in d2009 and later it requires percent-encoding data to decode into utf8-decode data which is then decoded into the final unicode string

12847495
utf8-decode	percent-encoding
in utf-8 the Ã£ character would be utf8-decode as and thus percent-encoding as c3 b6 not f6

12847499
nsmutablestring	nsstring
don t assume that because you re accepting an nsstring that it s not actually an nsmutablestring

12847502
for-loop	loops
i have been using for-loop while loops foreach loops in scripts

12847522
width	margin
to center the container div and so have all its children appear centered you need to use margin-left auto and margin-right auto shorthand margin 0 auto plus a set width on the div applied through the class span8 in my example plus removal of the float property which is bundled into all span- classed elements

12847555
for-loop	loops
placing the count all in the for-loop makes it calculate this statement for each loops

12847596
implements	modifiers
when implements the facade pattern in java i can easily hide the subsystem of the facade by using the package-private modifiers

for-loop	loops
to the best of my knowledge there is little to no performance difference between while loops and for-loop i don t know about the for-each loops

12847609
versioning	upgrade
the existing versioning of the solution has a reference to entityframework.dll which is the one i had to add to use the include method but the upgrade versioning i m looking at in vs2012 does not have such a reference nor can i find a dll of that name in the location it was on the other machine

error-handling	exception-handling
in the called context i.e the defaultfunction that throws the exception-handling i could of course meticulously try to catch all exception-handling but these functions are hot-pluggable possibly ranging in the hundreds in the end and i don t want to burden each of these functions with 100 full-proof error-handling

12847948

12848695
width	height
i was somewhat able to achieve the desired effect but the padding-top is dependent on knowing the ration of the height to width for the image

12848695
width	height
this method does produce the desired result but i cannot always know the height and width of the image

12848704
folder	directory
if you need more information you can either calculate the value based on the mail folder or save some more on nsuserdefaults or even create a plist file on your document directory

12848716
width	height
if you want to do this on your own you would make a div that has 100 width and 100 height and you could set .1 for opacity so you could see through it

12848718
google-chrome	firefox
in previous versions of ie and apparently google-chrome and firefox getelementbyid would check for an object with the given id and if it didn t find it it would take an element with that name

12852603
getter	setter
you use it through methods called getter and setter

12852603
getter	setter
getter for getting the value of the variable en setter for setting the value of a variable

12852603
getter	setter
in this case the getter method is current_user and the setter method is

integer	unsigned
it is - disregarding the hypothetical padding bits problem - portable because the conversion to unsigned integer types and the representation of unsigned integer types is prescribed by the standard

12856334
integer	unsigned
conversion to an unsigned integer type is reduction modulo 2 width where width is the number of value bits in the type so that the result lies in the range 0 to 2 width - 1 inclusive

in the click-eventhandler of your icon you can then set the visibility of the listview to true and the visibility of the gridview to false and vice versa

12860441
stdout	stderr
if you use the processbuilder api you can merge the stdout and stderr streams into one using redirecterrorstream true so you can read both outputs in a single inputstream

12860441
stdout	stderr
if you read stdout and stderr as two streams you will need nio or two java threads

12860441
stderr	fflush	stdout	stderr	stdout	fflush	fflush	gets
if the child process doesn t fflush the output and you use pipes then this gets worse because stdout will be sent to your process in 4kb blocks while stderr will usually arrive line-by-line

12860441
stdout	stderr
one approach might be to use perl or similar to run your command in a pty this causes stdout to become line buffered read stdout and stderr from there and prefix each line with 1 for stdout and 2 for stderr

all nice and well but unfortunately the array that gets returned does not only contain the literal text strings but also primitives of type date int double etc

12861148
width	height
there s more to it than just swapping the width and height values

12861148
width	height
if i take a square then rotate it by 45Ã¢ then swapping the width and height will do nothing - the image is actually sqrt 2 times as wide and high as it was previously the length from one diagonal corner to another is sqrt 1 2 + 1 2 times the length between adjacent corners

12861148
width	height
it s unclear if you d like to rotate by 90Ã¢ 180Ã¢ or 270Ã¢ - i suspect so by the simple swapping of width and height though i can t be certain

12861161
width	height
i need to have a box div with some text over multiple lines and this box needs to have a fixed width and a fixed max height

g++	gcc
either you can use the -l flag see either manual for the compiler - i am assuming that you are using gcc or g++

super	abstract	super	implements
i d suggest you to implements something like a cloneable but not the standard java one here it might be okay to provide an abstract method in your super class interface

12861712
public	protected	inherited	subclassing
a subclassing inherited all of the public and protected members of its parent no matter what package the subclassing is in

12861712
inherited	subclassing
if the subclassing is in the same package as its parent it also inherited the package-private members of the parent

12861712
superclass	subclassing
you can declare a field in the subclassing with the same name as the one in the superclass thus hiding it not recommended

12861712
superclass	subclassing
you can declare new fields in the subclassing that are not in the superclass

12861712
superclass	subclassing
you can write a new instance method in the subclassing that has the same signature as the one in the superclass thus overriding it

12861712
superclass	subclassing
you can write a new static method in the subclassing that has the same signature as the one in the superclass thus hiding it

12861712
superclass	subclassing
you can declare new methods in the subclassing that are not in the superclass

12861712
superclass	subclassing
you can write a subclassing constructor that invokes the constructor of the superclass either implicitly or by using the keyword super

12861712
inherited	subclassing
a subclassing does not inherited the private members of its parent class

12861712
superclass	subclassing	public	protected
however if the superclass has public or protected methods for accessing its private fields these can also be used by the subclassing

12861712
superclass	subclassing	public	protected	inherited	subclassing
therefore a public or protected nested class inherited by a subclassing has indirect access to all of the private members of the superclass

12861807
inherited	subclassing
once the subclass-outside-the-package inherited the protected member that member as inherited by the subclassing becomes private to any code outside the subclassing with the exception of subclassing of the subclass.

12861968
width	height
i set a width of 194dp and a height of 64dp

12861968
width	height
when using the graphical editor to resize the button by holding shift and dragging the corner this doesn t change the width and height values in the xml but just adds margins

12861978
inherited	subclassing
once the subclass-outside-the-package inherited the protected member that member as inherited by the subclassing becomes private to any code outside the subclassing with the exception of subclassing of the subclass.

12861995
int	chars
so in your example you have a chars which of course takes 1 byte and an int which takes 4

12861995
int	chars
then with no padding the chars would be placed at 0x1000 and the int at 0x1001

12861995
int	chars
so now you have chars 1 byte padding 3 bytes int 4 bytes total 8 bytes

12861995
int	chars
like say you had three chars s and three int s

12861995
int	chars
then the compiler will add 3 bytes after the first chars to align the first int and then three more bytes after the second chars to align the second int

12861995
int	chars
that gives chars 1 + pad 3 + int 4 + chars 1 + pad 3 + int 4 + chars 1 + pad 3 + int 4 24

12861995
int	chars
then you d get chars 1 + chars 1 + chars 1 + pad 1 + int 4 + int 4 + int 4 16

12861995
int	chars
years ago i read the advice to always put the largest elements first to minimize padding first put longs then int then shorts then chars

12862209
width	height
like is is discussed on the thread the height or width would not be the perfect solution due to the distance between camera and the vehicle

12862233
width	height
variants with change height width or zoom also did not give good results

12862244
multiplying	multiplication
in this case we have a multiplication of a long by an int and this is handled by widening the int to a long and performing a long multiplying

12862350
fadein	fadeout
jquery has a very good and simple way of doing fadein and fadeout you can check their site to see

12862352
int	chars
in case of chars only one byte just needed by the data so no need of alignment as each byte itself is available in ram there are pages and each page size is 1 byte but for int we need 4 byte and no 4 byte is avail able or there is nothing called accessing 4 byte at a time so compiler making a alignment rule by which the int data are in the correct addresses

asterisk	ivr
ivr design in asterisk is not difficult but there is a bit of a learning cliff associated with getting your first asterisk server up and running

12862724
portrait	landscape
in the function you have defined the position of each object in your view for both portrait and landscape

12862724
portrait	landscape
if you use two uiviews one for portrait and another for landscape in one uiviewcontroller you would change that first part of the code to look like this

12862724
portrait	landscape
in the original you have to code for every object in this edited sample this code is all you need however you need to essentially allocate objects twice one for a portrait view and another for a landscape view

12862729

min	max
for finding extreme values create two variables max and min and initialize them to the first user input

12862860
min	max
e. not an input meaning end of execution check whether the value is greater than max or less than min

12862860
min	max
if so replace max or min by the input

12862861
atexit	main

12862868
solaris	aix
i have tested the script with solaris 10 linux 6.3 and aix 7 and the script works as intended and accounts for the differences in the way netstat outputs it s columns and for the difference in delimeter characters

12862952
width	height
the blurry problem will happen if you use css to set the canvas height and width instead of setting height and width in the canvas element

12862966
int	chars
i know that chars short and int get promoted to int while long long does not get promoted

12862966
int	chars
this implies that when reading the varargs va_arg args int should be used for chars short and int while va_arg args long long should be used for long long

12862981
calloc	malloc
c difference between malloc and calloc

12862981
calloc	malloc
essentially the calloc call would allocate the same amount of memory as calling malloc nmem size so all that s really happening is the asterisk is replaced with a comma

12863287
hide	show
now we re moving into a situation where a column may be hidden in multiple reporttypes and i want to avoid getting into if report type val1 or val2 or val3 then hide as it will make it very hard to see for any given reporttype what columns are meant to be show as all the logic is in each column visibility expression

integer	unsigned
the latter can happen if int contains padding of if size_t is an extended integer type of same width as unsigned int

12863700
integer	unsigned
assuming integer representations do not contain padding bits you can cover both edge cases by reading an unsigned int variadic argument which will work on all reasonable implementations of the c language despite possibly being undefined behaviour

cpython	pypy
it s also not something that could be merged - the python implementation that is provided by pypy is generated using a framework they have created which is extremely cool but also completely disparate with the existing cpython implementation

12867292
cpython	pypy
there are some very concrete differences between pypy and cpython a big one being how extension modules are supported - which if you want to go beyond the standard library is a big deal

12867293

12867414
min	max
first after some period of time you may collapse hourly data into min max avg values

12867428
cpython	pypy
pypy is not a fork of cpython so it could never be merged directly into cpython

12867428
cpython	pypy
theoretically the python community could universally adopt pypy pypy could be made the reference implementation and cpython could be discontinued

12867428
cpython	pypy
pypy and cpython behavior is not identical in all respects especially when it comes to implementation details behavior that is not specified by the language but is still important at a practical level

12867428
cpython	pypy
cpython runs on more architectures than pypy and has been successfully adapted to run in embedded architectures in ways that may be impractical for pypy

12867428
cpython	pypy
cpython s reference counting scheme for memory management arguably has more predictable performance impacts than pypy s various gc systems although this isn t necessarily true of all pure gc strategies

12867428
cpython	pypy
for instance django can run on pypy and that makes templating faster but cpython s database drivers are faster than pypy s

12867428
cpython	pypy
for cpython most of the cpu-intensive game stuff is offloaded to the pygame library which pypy can t take advantage of since pygame is primarily implemented as a c extension though see pygame-cffi

12867428
cpython	pypy
pypy and cpython have radically different approaches to fundamental design questions and make different tradeoffs so neither one is better than the other in every case

when targeting a csproj file it will also look for a nuspec file with the same name as your project file myproject.csproj -- myproject.nuspec

12867712
nuspec	csproj
this means that you can add extra metadata to the resulting package by defining it into the nuspec file whilst still targeting your csproj file

12867712
nuspec	csproj
in essence you ll end up with a package containing the merged metadata from your csproj file and nuspec file

express	node.js
i have an api created in node.js using express mongoose etc

12868107

addition	multiplication
you could perform arithmetic multiplication by 10 and addition of a digit with hex strings

12870413
accessor	ivar
the problem here is that your accessor and your ivar have the same name

12870413
accessor	properties
here you re not using the accessor to access your properties you re using the backing variable directly so it never gets initialize

12870413
accessor	properties
you might want to change your ivars to something you won t be tempted to use or that will be immediately apparent that you haven t gone through the accessor like _managedobjectcontext or even _privatecontext or whatever will stick out to you until you get used to accessing properties through the accessor

12870413
accessor	properties
i don t like this method as people forget that it s not a direct properties access and it is using the accessor so they think it s okay to interchange the dot syntax for a direct access when it s not like in your case

12870426
button	checkbox
here is the packs form which is displaying all cards and a checkbox next to each one and a submit button

12870468

12870610
int	chars
and for chr you can cast back to a chars from an int like this

12870614
button	checkbox
if you use button checkbox radiobutton on your list item then list item is not clickable

12870713
int	chars
these methods are for strings and int not for chars

12870942
accessor	properties
will use the properties accessor method actually the setter

12870946
superclass	subclassing
it s important to pick one of your initializers as the designated initializer and make sure all subclassing initializers call the superclass s designated initializer directly

12870948
hash	md5
besides that your function does not return anything for and 0 the final hash value does only consist of the md5 hash values of the hexadecimal characters 0 Ã¢ 9 and a Ã¢ f which are

12870948
hash	md5
this is because their md5 hash value does begin the same octet

12870994
glut	glew

12871057
width	height
width height

12871064
salt	md5
like already linked by nulluserexception in the comments you should not do it by just adding a static salt to md5 if security matters

12871064
salt	md5
both static salt and md5 are not considered very safe approaches

12871064
hash	salt
a common mistake is to use the same salt in each hash

12871064
hash	salt
just have to apply the salt to each password guess before they hash

note that the image must have equal width and height for this to work

12871140
width	height
if the image doesn t you can set the width and height with css as well

12871159
width	height
child div - this should behave like a word fixed width cannot be determined but has a fixed height as image height css can be applied

12871159
width	height
image - this should behave like a character in a word has fixed width same fixed height as of child div

12871178

the idea is that you use settimeout instead of setinterval since you cannot guarantee that the time the function needs to execute is enough between interval time

12871479
serializable	deserialization
if the creators of your 3rd-party dll never designed that type to support serializable you will basically need to write your own serializable deserialization code for it

12871515
qsharedpointer	qscopedpointer
qscopedpointer and qsharedpointer are not aware of whether their target object lives or dies so if you keep the smart pointer anywhere else than among member variables then yes in your case destructor might be called twice

openni	kinect
personally i think simpleopenni is really easy to start with the nicest openni wrapper i ve seen if you re just started with kinect development and want to easily follow the making things see example it will probably be simpler to stick to processing with or without eclipse and simpleopenni

12876231
openni	kinect
a bit off topic it might be possible to actually use both the official kinect sdk and openni using a bridge library but i haven t used it myself yet so can t advise from experience

12876250
put	get
you have to put and get from it

12876286
post	get
one application always uses post someone wants to validate get parameters as well and a completely different application doesn t even have http requests but does want to validate input from the commandline

12876323
free	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	calloc	malloc	realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc
which is might be causing you a problem as you can t free the memory which is not allocated either by malloc calloc or realloc

12876350
pull	push
i cloned the repo so that i could develop in one directory and then push to the repo and then pull in the live prod directory would be interested in suggestions for a better way to do this if there is one but that s outside the scope of this question

12876355
serializable	deserialization
unfortunately there s no specification for the serializable and deserialization of dates in json so this is really up to you

12876358
pull	push
i then used update project in intellij to pull the latest changes from the central repository so my upcoming git push would not be rejected

12876382
rss	feed
hello there im trying to figure out how i can parse rss feed with vbs and display the contents into cmd

12876382

12876390
rss	feed
it s confusing because the rss feed loads perfect on validators rss readers in firefox s built in url reader and i can t seem to figure out why only when the feed are fetched will it crash my server

12876402
ant	maven
judging from my experience i did it several times when migrating project from ant to maven you should take all the jar files that your project used to depend on and convert them into maven dependencies groupid artifactid version

12876408
post	get
i have achieved this with a single post but can t get it to work with multiple post

12876423
postgresql	mysql
when the _conn is mysql sqlite or postgresql i want to be run the testtwo method

12876425
fold	catamorphism
yes i think it is a fold catamorphism

12876441
int	chars
one minor thing in c a chars constant such as x 0 or n is actually of type int not of type chars

12876441
int	chars
will store a null chars value in c the int value is implicitly converted from int to chars

12876441
int	chars
chars and int are both int types and you can freely convert between them

12876441
int	chars
the reasons for chars constants being of type int are historical

12876478
excel	listobject
the solution would be to pivot over a listobject instead of a range - in excel when you select say range and format as table from the ribbon the table that results will span

12876478
excel	listobject
in excel you turn a range into a listobject by selecting the range in question and clicking the format as table ribbon button from the home tab

12876503
folder	directory
and the two header files are located inside the include folder which again is in the root directory of the project

12876548
apache	nginx

edit this happens in google-chrome and safari try searching for london or toronto

12876748
devise	sorcery
now i decided to make that authentication much lighter and add some logging so i decided to move from devise to sorcery

12876752
ostream	istream
the stl uses the operator for output and the whole istream ostream class hierarchy uses this operator to input output

12876810
folder	directory
os.listdir works with other directory so the cause of the problem is obviously some strangely-encoded file or folder within f music itself

12876818
post	get
it is basically goes to accounts login url and i check if its get or post then do the try to do appropriate action

12876851
google-chrome	firefox
those you can see javascript works client side so unless it s all been minified to make things harder you can go through and look at the included javascript via the developer console in google-chrome or firefox or even ie argh

12876876
post	get
this blog post is more detailed but unfortunately does also not mention where to get the product key

12876876
post	get
i asked this question to a microsoft evangelist i have contact with and will hopefully get an answer soon that i ll post here

12876895
pop-up	dialog
after the error pop-up my app shows up blank on my phone for a minute and then shows a dialog to force close it

12876898
try-catch	exception-handling
assuming you re handling exception-handling using try-catch you can make sure the wireshark process is closed in the finally block at the end of your topmost try-catch statement

12876920
uiview	subviews
so if you would want a line on top of image you would need to add to imageview an uiview subviews class in which you have corresponding drawrect with line drawing

12876927
put	get
the function then goes to the function comparecars to determine what elements get put where

12876929
int	chars	int	double
bool byte float chars double int long string ..

12876969
portrait	landscape	width	height
let s say i have an image that take up 320pt x 480pt in portrait and 480pt x 320pt in landscape width x height

12876969
portrait	landscape
if we create a single image file at a 480pt x 480pt resolution instead of landscape and portrait files it would prevent the app bundle from having two files that which each contain 320pt x 320pt area of duplicate image data

12876969
portrait	landscape
landscape or portrait

12876969
portrait	landscape
instead of four files ip4 landscape ip4 portrait ip5 landscape ip5 portrait there would be only one file in the app bundle giant square

12876969
portrait	landscape
iphone 5 landscape or portrait

12876982
put	get
i even tried to put the expression in a cdata element but i can t get this to work either

12876996
instances	transient
while a transient instances of nvidiagraphicscard will not be a proxy

12877019
portrait	landscape
then it works but i can t do it because user can rotate phone to portrait landscape

12877040
pop-up	dialog
essentially i need a dialog or window to pop-up containing a string of text a close back dismiss button and possible hyperlinks within the text

12877040
pop-up	dialog
those hyperlinks in turn launch other pop-up windows dialog of their own

12877042
min	max
note we are using the default settings for min max pool size 0 100

12877051
postgresql	mysql
this is very likely how all the other dbms work as well at least considering the major ones postgresql sybase oracle db2 firebird mysql

12877070
setinterval	settimeout
the solution is to use settimeout instead of setinterval

12877070
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout is only triggered once but it is easy to tell it to trigger itself again inside its own function so you can get the same effect as setinterval but with much more control

12877090
stdout	stderr
just use print statements as you see from the above snippet hoping for supervisord to catch it and send to stdout stderr logs

12877101
google-chrome	firefox
use json if possible with google-chrome firefox or most likely ie10

12877146
strncpy	malloc	strdup	strncpy	strdup	malloc
then a note in createrecord i recommend the use of strdup instead of malloc strncpy and friends

12877148
int	chars
i m assuming you have a reason for representing int chars int as a string rather than just define a struct to hold the data

12877192
membase	couchdb
there are several reviews on that topic by thoughtworks and some in fowler s book and some in cassandra vs mongodb vs couchdb vs redis vs riak vs hbase vs membase vs neo4j comparison

12877269
portrait	landscape
my live wallpaper crashes when it s turned into landscape and then back to portrait several times in a row

12877273
for-loop	arrays
the easiest workaround would be using a copy of the original arrays in your for-loop as

12877281
hide	show
now i know when crashes if i tap the screen to show the button and tap again to hide it it works as many times as i want

12877286
cout	cin
or could omit the using and refer to std cin and std cout

12877292
google-chrome	safari
so far i ve noticed this in google-chrome and safari

12877301
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the video will play in firefox ie and opera but not in google-chrome or safari

12877301
google-chrome	firefox
if you scroll down about half way there is a video that works in firefox and ie but not in google-chrome

12877301
google-chrome	firefox
also the disqus comments aren t loading on the bottom in google-chrome that also works in firefox

12877333
stdout	stderr
in my case the problem seemed to be that stdout is buffered whereas stderr is not

12877370
versioning	upgrade
no idea why i couldn t get the aliasing to work in the httpd.conf but i noticed the apache files were all pointing to older versioning of the mac os webserver from snow leopard when i upgrade

12877397
cout	cin
mostly all standard library utilities are inside namespace std as for instance the variables cout and cin

12877435
post	get
my project is too complicated to post but with the simple test case below i get the following output and it makes no sense whatsoever to me the result is the same

12877483
folder	directory
then finally once you are able to code sign you need to use bbwp to sign and package the zip file generated by the build the zip is in the build directory of the phonegap folder

12877537
integer	unsigned
in other way you didn t need but for a performance save as unsigned 10 integer in database instead timestamp or date time

12877563
int	chars
you can t directly because a chars automatically gets promoted to int

12877584
put	get
when we put it all together this is what we get

12877631
jruby	mri
i have a script written with jruby and i need this script to be executed from rails app which runs on mri ruby

12877638
tiff	png
they are removed when the heatmap is transformed to an picture format like tiff or png

12877689

min	max
e.g. 220 360 180 0 min 400 200 580 max

12877899
hash	md5
i maintain a sequence number and keep incrementing it along with some other variables and sum them up and want to get a hash of the total i am planning to use md5 for this and then pick the first 32 bits of the output

12877945
portrait	landscape
every thing is okay with displaying data but when i change the device orientation from portrait to landscape and vis versa an additional number of rows is added to my table view

12878068
google-chrome	firefox
however that doesn t work and produce me this error in firefox and a blank screen in google-chrome and ie9

12878116
fgets	strlen
and you really don t have a reliable way to get the length since fgets doesn t return it to you and strlen expects a c string

12878137
ubuntu	linux
for example on my ubuntu 12.04 linux system the following command takes about a second to complete and produces the output shown below the command

12878143
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome works perfectly

12878273
public	protected
remember private protected and public are also simply methods and not keywords

12878291
postgresql	mysql
i m not sure about mysql but in postgresql ids are only allocated once from the autoincrementing sequence and will be unused if a transaction is rolled back or aborted

12878335
post	get
i can see that this is most likely because although iÃ¢ ve managed to get the url and the links to work showing the full path wp and hence the walker donÃ¢ t see the custom post type project as sitting below mediums mediums-term and so doesnÃ¢ t create the nav items required to show this state

12878356
for-loop	loops
what you can do is either have a while loops inside the for-loop that continues until that condition is met or continue the for-loop but decrease the count variable with one so a new character is generated with that index so to speak

12878497
for-loop	arrays
i tried to run a for-loop which declares say 10 char arrays but by printing their base addresses i see the same addresses for all arrays

12878543
free	strdup
declare servip as a instead of or if that s not possible strdup 127.0.0.1 in the second case just remember to free it later

verilog	vhdl
i am looking at developing on an fpga but it would be easier for me to write the code in python or scala and have it converted to vhdl or verilog

12878676
verilog	vhdl
there are two open-source libraries that can help make this easier in development but i am not certain which would be a better platform to use to convert a program to vhdl verilog

12878700

solaris	aix
the option nm -a includes the library name and member object file name on linux mac os x and solaris hp-ux and aix not checked in conformity with posix nm which explains the uniformity

12878917
hash	salt
because your 3rd argument is true cakephp will salt the hash with the value stored in your configuration

mouse	keyboard
i know that making such things from scratch requires basically mapping textures to quads like the buttons writing stuff on them and testing mouse keyboard events which trigger other events inside the code

12879088
post	get
since you are using from_post_id and to_post_id you will have to find a way to group the post_links for from post and to post to get the total set of post_links for a post

udp	tcp
other ip protocols such as udp do have a broadcast mode where one packet can go to multiple receivers but there is no such thing for tcp

12880682
inherited	properties
inherited - the value of the width properties is inherited from parent element

12880695

you can use json-java library like gson jackson flexjson etc

12880696
debian	linux
on debian linux i would set permissions like this

12880711
traceroute	packets
ogn2.ogamenet.net has address 79.110.87.154 - traceroute traceroute to 79.110.87.154 79.110.87.154 30 hops max 40 byte packets

12880719
apache	nginx
sounds more like a mono bug than an nginx apache issue

12880719
apache	nginx
when using mono try to use the xsp webserver that ships with mono to host your application without using nginx or apache and check the results of the cache-control headers

12880719
apache	nginx
if they are wrongly set to even without nginx apache in between this might be a bug in mono

12880763
fadein	fadeout
i have looped fadein fadeout

12880769
int	chars	int	boolean
in every example i saw the data is somehow synonymous to basic raw data -- int chars array of boolean and so on -- this is too limiting for me because i would like to pass a regular object

12880776
width	height
it seems the following does not do what i had thought it would at least not for width and height

12880776
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
yet again another instance of where i agree with firefox s implementation and frown at google-chrome or safari

width	height
meta name viewport content width device-width height device-height initial-scale 1.0 maximum-scale 1.0 user-scalable no

12880860
viewdidload	viewdidappear
and because viewdidload is called before viewdidappear delegate is simply nil not set

12880876
getter	setter
note that you don t even need to keep a member variable for the layout since qwidget has that anyway and provides you with setter and getter

12880978
jmeter	neoload
are you sure neoload is not already listening to this same port and jmeter could not start on this same one

12880993
int	double
the code you posted just creates an int and converts the int into a double which is not what you want

12881067
width	height
the height and width are not supported in html5

12881084

12881145
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	g-wan	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd
the benchmarks i have seen indicate that nginx lighttpd g-wan in particular and friends blow away apache in terms of performance but this blowing away appears to manifest more in high-load scenarios where the web server is handling many simultaneous connections

12881145
cherokee	lighttpd	apache	cherokee	apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	g-wan	lighttpd	g-wan	cherokee	nginx	cherokee	nginx	lighttpd
the benchmarks show that even at low numbers of clients some servers are faster than others here are compared apache 2.4 nginx lighttpd varnish litespeed cherokee and g-wan

12881231

12881280
int	chars
i haven t check the spec but i guess chars can be automatically cast to int

12881309
disk	ram
it is not quite as important these days 15 years after gdi+ was designed modern machines have lots of ram and disk space

12881325
fadein	fadeout
you are better off using fadeto as fadein and fadeout often take the starting opacity as the shown opacity

12881335
post	get
and instead of passing so many information in your url use instead of get because get method has limit of passing the data in the address bar where post doesn t moreover your data will be hidden if you use post method

12881336
addeventlistener	onload
you can place that in the onload attribute of the body element but ideally stop using inline event handlers and use the addeventlistener method instead

12881339
rss	feed
the xml rss feed manually through a browser your script is probably

12881374

12881418
textwatcher	charsequence
after reading some topics in so i know that i should use textwatcher instead but i m still wondering how to handle enter key event inside because parameters provided there are only charsequence editable etc

12881420
snmp	mib
if you are looking for a toolset to create a snmp agent command responder with snmp4j -agent then why not using agent++ mib designer to define the mib specification and then agenpro to simulate the agent based on snmp4j-agent and generate the stub code for snmp4j-agent

12881468
children	parent
then you are out of luck and have to access them with selectors xpath by their ancestry and position in the children set of the direct parent element

12881578
rss	feed
while i was writing a custom rss feed for my php program i ve come across an issue that the ampersand character has to be converted to

12881579
width	margin
hence you have to set the left position to 50 and then set the left margin to be negative half of the width of the element

12881581
width	height
since .language2 is a block element div you do not need to give it a width and a height

12881585
put	get	post	get	post	put
your application will be able to interact with the api sending http requests get post or put to specific urls each of them represents a particular user s setting

12881651
addition	multiplication
once you have the appropriate mov routines you can implement addition as repeated increment and multiplication as repeated addition

12881651
subtraction	multiplication
in both you ll need the inc trick to get jnz to work and in the multiplication routine you ll need to end with a subtraction

opera	google-chrome
all works fine into opera but google-chrome have problem when i have scrolling top align gets too much y pixels.

12882405
int	chars
pointers only shows to pointers not to values of int floats or chars

12882409
min	max
your program should calculate and print the avg max and min weights of these people

12882454
min	max
after you gather the data you can loop over this array to determine the min max and average

12882511
range	max	range	min	min	max
there is an array of integers i have to find the number of sequences of k length having range max - min of the subsequence less than equal to r .is there a relation between number of sequences of length k and number of sequences of length k-1

12882511
min	max
i was thinking of a deque like structure to maintain min and max elements of the array upto a certain index.however when k is closer to n this would become close to o n n which is too slow i am ideally looking at o n solution or o n log n solution

12882512
rss	feed
then it ll work with other rss feed

12882516
getter	setter
setter getter expose data type of those data member

12882516
getter	setter
if those data member have to change their type setter getter function member have to change their interfaces too

12882610
getter	setter
if you want to avoid writing your own getter setter manually each time you can easily using templates extend c++ to allow property like modifiers

12882622
getter	setter
writing setter and getter means you can validate accesses to the private members and you can change the underlying implementation for example by changing the internal data types without affecting any of the client code

12882671
src	attr
you should use .prop instead of attr to set the src attribute of those elements you create

12882773
lxml	elementtree
use lxml instead of the standard library elementtree

12882790
nsoperationqueue	nsblockoperation
i would create a nsblockoperation and add it to a nsoperationqueue

12882818
getter	setter
getter and setter are usually only useful when you do something more than just assigning a member variable

12882818
getter	setter
when your class consists of data which do not share an invariant basically the class just collects different values but there are no rules between the members you can argue whether getter and setter are useful

12882818
getter	setter
for example in the case of a date class you should really use setter and getter because the members day month and year share an invariant when month is incremented above 12 year should be incremented aswell

12882818
getter	setter
however in the case of a point class where x and y do not share an invariant you can skip the getter and setter unless you really want to make it an interface and use polymorphism

12882829
maven	pom.xml
if it s maven then the concepts are the same but obviously server-side we d be talking about pom.xml files instead of ivy.xml ivy supports maven repositories

12883296
sequence	permutation
i was wondering if there is an implementation in r where it sorts a permutation of n numbers into the original 1...n sequence and provides the number of reversals needed

width	height
i first suspected this is because there was 0 width and 0 height on the widget

12884615
width	height
however the cout in the constructor tells me that the widget is positioned at x 0 and width 1000 and so i assume that since that matches my resize statement that the height is also 1000 as was specified

however this isn t necessarily helpful - the parent node only ends up testing the bits common between the children so if there are only a few of those you still end up testing lots of leave nodes

12884781
trie	tree
in fact this second approach could be generalized into a tree as well which would give you some sort of trie

12884794
verilog	vhdl

switching	screens
i need to disable it because is a touch screens app and i dont want user to switching to other applications

12884891
width	height
just remove the height if you set width and no height the broswer will keep aspect ration

12884901
public	protected
i only checked a few lines of code but i noticed that you are not calling super.oncreate and your oncreate method should be public not protected

12884986
public	protected
class member objects not separated by an access specifier public private protected are laid out in memory in the order in which they re declared but there may be an unspecified amount of padding between member objects

12885011

puts	gets
but i have a php scripts wich gets an uploaded file and puts it in downloads directory

12885187
range	max	range	min	min	max
it could also be merged into a script or a simple c code in order to let the user decide the number of axes number of attributes and the different range min max for each specific axis

12885188
min	max
i m new to java and i am trying to write a program that asks the user to input the name of a txt file containing only numbers and the program will output the sum average max and min of the numbers in the file

12885188
min	max
i have written most of the program however i am stuck trying to find the max and min of the values

12885191
prng	random
it depends on the specific implementation of the pseudo random number generator prng in question

12885218
min	max
have two variables min and max of course min and max should initially be int.max

12885239
min	max
declare two int variables - one min and one max

12885239
min	max
initialize min with integer.max_value and max with integer.min_value

12885248
ssl	https
some dls cable isps do this too. for an app making an https request though this breaks the ssl handshake because the remote host is different from what the app is expecting

12885264
hide	show
these toolwindows are meant to free-float around the user can drag them hide them and show them but they have no taskbar entry

12885270
client-side	server-side
considering that a lot of frameworks are moving to a restful model and in general it is hard to keep up with the changes of the client-side frameworks while coupling them with the server-side framework like cakephp

12885272

12885340
portrait	landscape
i have my application only support landscape mode should work for portrait mode also and have iad showing up on the top of the application

12885350
int	double
in c++ implemented for primitive types like int and double but not for array array is not a primitive type so you should never use to assign an array to new array instead you should use something as memcpy to copy array

12885387
post	get
with this i get an error #200 this post wasn t created by the application

12885425
rsa	aes
this is done mainly for speed public key cryptography is very slow so encrypting files using an algorithm such as rsa will probably not be a good idea besides aes is supported on the chip these days in a lot of the intel processors so it would be extremely fast to use it that is what bitlocker is based on

12885432
put	get
when using tcp you must keep in mind that the size of the data blocks you put in is not guaranteed to be the same size of data blocks you get out on the receiving side

12885462

hi i have this working upper menu section in google-chrome firefox and proper browsers but its broken in ie 9 in the searchbar social icon header area

12885622
children	parent
if your heirarchy has only two levels then you can join the parent with the children flatten the resulting list and then include the index for each person

12885662
hide	show
set a position absolute and a z-index that is higher than your other elements on a div and trigger it to show hide with javascript and you should be fine

12885671
portrait	landscape
each page have portrait and landscape orientation support

12885724
fastcgi	scgi
you may consider using fastcgi or scgi instead

12885778
inherited	properties
i can hard set the background to be a specific color or even bind it to a template parent properties but when the frameworkelementfactory gets a dynamic resource type of properties then the foreground gets inherited from the templateparent

12885885

12886173
width	height
then alter your image to have a width of 100 and remove the height

12886195
int	double
is there a way to convert actual input int to double

12886195
int	double
i dont want to get string values and use isdigit to check if it is double or int

12886213
int	double
if you have an int value that you wish to turn into a double simply use a cast

12886242
int	chars
by the way i should note that there is the string.charat int function too which returns the chars at the specified place.

12886272
integer	unsigned
each element of data is unsigned 16-bit integer

12886272
int	chars
to play the sound i divide each 16-bit unsigned int into two chars and then every 3 ms using a timer i send 256 chars to the audio card

12886286
mouse	keyboard
i am trying to make a canvas app that responds to keyboard and mouse input

12886286
keydown	mousedown
the mousedown alert comes up whenever i click the mouse but the keydown alert never comes up

12886298
width	height
you don t have to specify the #pagewrap height and width

12886342
int	chars	int	double
or you can take input as int or chars type and then typecast it to double

12886364
int	chars
even though we are typecasting to int before outputting the first line in the result why is chars showing values similar to int even when chars is 1 byte and int 4 byte

12886364
unsigned	short
unsigned short showed different value because its memory requirement was 2 byte

12886379
int	chars
and in the output from the compare method you get four bytes shown because you cast to int for the output so the chars value -4 gets converted to the int value -4

12886385
int	double
the error message tells us that you ve declared calculatepkg_c double double double but you implemented calculatepkg_c int int int

12886389
children	parent
i have a basic tree structure composed of a simple node class linking bidirectionally to it s single parent can be null for root nodes and an ordered list of children

12886413
hash	md5
advice make a md5 hash of the urls and save them in a binary field with an index

12886418
multiplying	add
and when he creates the variable pixel why would he multiplying y by width and add x

12886494
int	chars
i want to convert the chars in command line argument into int type and print it out

12886497
implements	sealed
the compiler knows it can t go well except if ot were to be null but the rules of c# still disallow the cast from a sealed type to an interface not implements by that sealed type

12886542

12886619
lxml	html5lib	lxml	beautifulsoup	html5lib	beautifulsoup
the best solution is to install an external parser lxml or html5lib and use beautifulsoup with that parser

12886628
int	boolean
another way to do it taking advantage of the fact that a boolean is just an int with value 1 or 0 is to say and generate

12886640
matplotlib	scipy
numpy is a reasonably high-performance matrix library and it works well with python and many other standard packages pyopengl python imaging library scipy matplotlib etc.

12886779
sorting	grouping
this one does all the job of splitting grouping and sorting

12886799
for-loop	loops
i am trying to optimize a chunk of code where speed is very important and wondered if checking the int that holds the number of times a for-loop is about to loops and not doing the for-loop if it is equal to zero was any faster or slower than just letting the for-loop execute 0 times

12886814
children	parent
since the parent element in this case has a lower z-index set then children elements with higher z-index won t affect siblings to the parent

12886834
subtract	addition	multiplying	addition	multiplying	subtract
so i was thinking if i pulled the second piece of data in the string using substr i could then check to see if it was multiplying divide subtract or addition

12886847
getter	setter
you can avoid reflection by using dynamic methods or expressions to create a custom property getter setter based on a selector expression like

12886847
getter	setter
the only hard part is creating a setter expression from the getter expression the setterexpressionfromgetterexpression method above but that s a known solved problem

12886847
getter	setter
in this approach the cost of compiling the getter setter delegates from the expression is incurred only once when you create the action provider not every time you create an action or invoke redo or undo on one

12886865
int	double
i had the counter s as int instead of double

12886888
children	parent
counting the number of children parent has having name child and checking if the child is the way i am thinking of going about the problem

12886902
children	parent	queue	fifo
i have code that takes a parent node from a queue checks if it has been visited if it hasn t generates its children pushes them to the queue and repeats the loop taking the next parent node from the queue in a fifo fashion

12886902
queue	fifo
changing q to a queue fifo data structure is literally the only change i have made to this code

12886902
children	parent
the parent children are stored as tuples so feel free to ignore all of that work -- that doesn t seem to be where the problem lies

12886911
awt	swing
also this example can easily be changed from awt to swing by replacing frame with jframe panel with jpanel button with jbutton and label with jlabel

12886917
hash	md5
md5 hash was designed for data comparison purposes

12886926
lxml	html5lib
your code works as is on python 2.7 python 3.3 if you install more robust parser on python 2.7 such as lxml or html5lib

12886946
for-loop	arrays
for arrays this compiles to an indexed for-loop

12886978

12887108
min	max
a heap is usually used to answer questions that revolve around what is the max min element in the set

12887108
min	max
while a heap could coincidentally efficiently answer who are the children of the max min node a heap doesn t stand out as a good data structure to use when you need to access an arbitrary node to answer your question a node that isn t the max node

12887108
children	parent
it s also not the data structure to use if there are specific parent child relationships that need to be represented and maintained because the children can and do get swapped between different parent nodes

12887119
folder	directory
i need to do the same thing for each file exist in a specific folder directory

12887210
hex	binary
if your binary data looks like this in hex

12887210
strlen	strcpy
with no null bytes then strcpy or strlen or any string function will continue past the end of your buffer with unpredictable results

12887219
pbkdf2	salt
if the original key is actually a password you should use pbkdf2 or similar to create the key using the salt and key

12887219
hash	salt
otherwise you may use a salt and secure hash method

12887292
client-side	server-side
the upside is that if you get the server-side right you can freely experiment with the client-side

12887314

vimclojure	counterclockwise
similarly there is vimclojure and you can find plugins for intellij laclojure and eclipse counterclockwise that are also popular and well-maintained

12887607
hide	show
when some clicks a button it hide the old content and show the new but it doesn t reset the browser scroll position and thus the end user will get a bit confused

12887760
division	addition	division	multiplication	addition	multiplication
for example sandy bridge has 6 execution units p0--p5 floating point multiplication division runs on p0 floating point addition and integer multiplication runs on p1

12887760
division	addition	division	multiplication	addition	multiplication
also division takes 3-4 times more cycles then multiplication addition and is not pipelined the execution unit cannot start another instruction while division is being performed

12887760
division	multiplication
so in test2 while the vector code is waiting for the expensive division and some multiplication to finish on unit p0 the scalar code can be performing the extra 2 add instructions on p1 which most likely obliterates any advantage of vector instructions

12887800
google-chrome	firefox
i did some reading that functions defined within the document.ready are ignored by google-chrome and firefox so i removed that declaration from the top

12887824

it s like something s stuck in the pipe and it gets fflush by the next request or some cleanup mechanism

12887976
cassini	iis
the same project run on the same machine under iis express or cassini works fine

12888002
nunit	mstest
some test frameworks mstest let you access private members for just this purpose while others nunit don t since they don t think you should be doing it in the case of .net it doesn t take too much to write your own reflection class method to give you access though

12888024
g++	gcc
i also have gcc installed in the same directory as g++ and all the other compilers that come with mingw

12888067
sorting	filtering
also in a lot of other place in the application we are using wice grid to display data and we love the filtering and sorting capabilities of this grid

12888067
sorting	filtering
and in this results wice grid i would only show the customers attributes so the user will be able to use the built in filtering and sorting features of wice grid on those customer attributes

width	height
when using the pdf function in r for saving a plot in an external file we can specify width and or height to adjust the size of the plot

12888225

if you want the header to always stay in the same position relative to the body of the page then place the two into a common div and apply the width and margin properties that you would have applied to the body to that container

12888690

i have a file which in the first subdirectory has different user directory and in each of these user directory contains some folder that have text files in them

12888819
ant	maven	ant	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml
if you want to fix this permanently then you should add the stop to include sqljdbc.jar to your web-inf lib while building war file in your build system in build.xml if you are using ant or in your maven s pom.xml under dependencies section for this particular dependency

my suggestion to you is never give margin specially from left aur right direction.because for example if you give margin from left to 50px than it looks ok in normal device while not look well in high resolution devices beacuse it will take 50px in any resolution device.instead of margin use this kind of syntax android alignparentleft true and always have a habit of using such kind of syntax inside ur relative layout.with ssuch syntaxes your elements will be always at the position in which you get desired..goto the android developer site and check what is a difference between linear and relative layout and what is different properties of linear and relative layout study all properties like a meaning of fill_parent wrap_content match_parent than 100 you will get solution.if you have any query than join with me here you can ask me your issue here.and i will suggest you to post your image

equals	gethashcode
it means that if node doesn t overrides the gethashcode and equals methods when you call containskey it will match against

12893601

but because the gem i created is no application it has neither specific controllers nor routes so i cannot use get or post to call any action

12894053
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
if you re doing any kind of 2d blending or 3d shading or almost any image processing then you want your intensities in a linear color-space so you can just add subtract multiplying and divide numbers to have the same effect on the intensities

12894053
floating-point	integer
it s becoming conventional to follow the rule that 8-bit colors are always srgb so you do your srgb-to-linear conversion at the same time as widening your intensity from 8 to 16 bits or from integer to floating-point

12894053
multiplying	add
yuv is a linear color-space so if you double the number in the y channel you double the lightness of the color but you can t add or multiplying yuv colors together like you can with rgb colors so it s not used for image processing only for storage and transmission

12894078
cpu	processors
browsing the web i came across a assembly instruction in x86 which is used to give hint to a processors that a spin-lock is currently running on this cpu

12894101
hash	salt
i d like to build an authentication system where each user has her own salt - each password gets hash with the salt of the user it belongs to

12894101
hash	salt
here s a design i came up with but i m not sure about it as hash depends on salt and this violates third normal form

12894154

method overriding is when a method defined in a superclass or interface is re-defined by one of its subclassing thus modifying replacing the behavior the superclass provides

12894262
portrait	landscape
on didselectrowatindexpath i am going to open another view which is in portrait mode but at that time status bar does not move from landscape mode to portrait mode that s why the space of 20 pixels remains with white background when i open new view controller

12894262
portrait	landscape
so my viewcontroller is moving from landscape mode to portrait mode but my status bar is not moving from landscape mode to portrait mode

12894270
inherited	properties
you need to return a function from the constructor which is extended with the properties from the current instance which in turn is inherited from event.prototype

12894365
jsf	seam
regarding to my previous question the jsr 303 bean validation the extended constraintvalidator cannot use the cdi the seam validation module give me a perfect solution for centralizing all jsf and ejb business validation with out repeating the code

12894376
mouseleave	mouseenter
when the mouseenter the overlay image is displayed as it should be but when the mouse moves inside the hover button the overlay image is flashing and the mouseenter and mouseleave events are triggered repeatedly

12894376
mouseover	mouseout
i also tried with mouseover hover and mouseout with the same result

12894405
int	boolean
primitive they are not called unboxed types such as int or boolean usually map to their primitive counterparts as far as my jni experience goes but as there are no structs they don t need to arrange

12894418
post	get
since i didn t get the required xml file and required entry for the url i counldn t actually understand what balusc tried to tell in that post

12894430
google-chrome	firefox
my question is like this one but my problem is not in ie not tested but in google-chrome and firefox

12894460
post	get
because the code is too long so i just can post get id function here

12894467
min	max
it will show you min target and max sdk version

12894521
svg	vml
that will generate vml for the older ie versions and svg for everyone else

12894598
hash	salt
it doesn t fully break 3nf as hash is not strictly dependent so to speak on the salt it was just computed from it along with the password

12894611
box-sizing	border-box
you can set the value smaller 100 or use the box-sizing attribute and set it to border-box

12894720
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
the wav format is supported by firefox 3.6+ safari 5+ opera 10.5+ and internet explorer 9+ on the audio tag

12894720
mp3	wav
you would need to add an mp3 source in addition to the wav source to get chrome support

12894732
addclass	removeclass
the bug is that when you have a horizontal scrollbar in an element its height increases on addclass removeclass

12894815
folder	dir
my static file folder is under same dir as settings.py

i have downloaded jacoco from internet and copied the folder under my source directory inside a folder named reports now i have the following

12894988
width	height
so i want to save these predefined set of height and width in some kind of data structure

12894988
width	height
so that when i get request for some width and height i can check if this belongs to predefined set

12894988
width	height
id 123 width 20 height 30

12894988
width	height
i dont want to do this stuff if set of requested width and height is not legal

12894997

at runtime only i can get min and max values and i dont know the width and height

eventually i need to have a checkbox for each object so that the user may select a row and then press a button for some back-end action

12895351
pop-up	dialog
create applications modal pop-up window based only on dialog becasue jwindow doesn t alloved input to the jtextcomponent with jtextcomponent implements there keybindings for esc key the same for lost fucus for dialog then could be undecorated without any issue

12895363
super	self
in case you do not want a separate foo instance - you want normal inheritance - there s no need to create an instance of foo simply call foo.__init__ self hello or super bar self .__init__ hello in the bar constructor and possibly accept the value as an argument instead of hardcoding it

12895397
disk	ram
this caused windows to write the whole db file to disk each time while linux would only update the buffered version of the filesystem inode in the ram

12895434
int	boolean
primitives like int boolean etc...

12895434
int	boolean
references like int boolean custom objects etc...

12895436
children	parent
the elements children h1 are as standard behaviour positioned at the top of their parent

12895443
onresume	onpause
well first of all i think that the reason for the crash is a nullpointerexception and you should check what happens in your onpause and onresume

12895494
getter	setter	accessor	properties
this is just a guess can t test it right now because i m not on my own pc but your problem is probably related to the somewhat underdocumented fact that jython generates properties accessor for javas getter setter methods which clash with your attribute names and thus shadow your actual attribute

12895494
accessor	properties
both of these solutions should cause the attribute to no longer be shadowed by the properties accessor

12895559
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
more robust and even better is to use nscalendar and nsdatecomponents like

12895563
int	boolean
value boolean isselected boolean hasfocus int row int column

12895583
sorting	filtering
creating the new person removing the form sorting the grid filtering the grid grid paging..

dependency injection di and single responsibility principles srp are highly related

12895632
hide	show
i m trying to hide show some divs depending on what button is clicked

12895640
put	get
this is because the operating system tries to split out the command line arguments for you however can get it wrong if you don t put quotes in the right places

12895707
disk	ram
i have an embedded linux device without a huge amount of ram but a decent amount of disk space no swap though

12895719
getter	setter
you re using public properties make properties private and use public getter and setter

12895734
maven	pom.xml
all i am looking for running maven projects from eclipse no command prompt or manual copy paste of wars in local tomcat server just like normal j2ee projects without modifying pom.xml seriously i don t want to modify this

12895766
disk	ram
my files are quite big so i have to save every piece i download to a disk can t store them in ram

12895784
hide	show
that way you only really have one form on the page in terms of the html but you hide and show one page at a time with javascript

12895787
put	get
use get and put to store value to the local storage of most modern browsers

12895849
folder	directory
the latter method works especially easy if you follow your naming rules like putting them in separate folder make sure that these directory will exist in the distribution and are not just copied to the top level directory as by default

12895858
oncreate	recreate
br in the logs i see that oncreate get s called again after a while as though the application was restarted recreate

12895935
hide	show
show hide

12895947
width	height
suggestion when you set x y width and height properties convert the values to int for performance reasons

12895963
put	get
you would initialise your object with a filename to put the finished file in and the url to get the file from something like

12895966
ant	maven
a further step would be to write a maven plugin we use maven for our build cycle or an ant script ant still has its uses... to do this and possibly make this part of our build process - you cannot compile the project without ensuring all of the save xml files in its sub-project also compile

12895984
acaccount	slrequest
however on ios the access token is never set directly by the app as this is all handled under the hood by the slrequest acaccount classes

12896002
avr	microcontroller
all avr microcontroller and many if not most other brands as well have an internal watchdog timer

12896043
qsort	bsearch
here is an implementation that uses built-in sorting and binary search functions qsort and bsearch of the standard c library

12896204
next	except
in the code you showed f and b are not related except by being instantiated right next to each other

12896222
gif	png
allowed mime types are image gif image jpeg image png

12896236
folder	directory
the actual error then occurs because the developer assumed that the library will be in the folder mingw lib but with mingw w64 it s located in a seperate directory mingw version lib and so ar.exe didn t find the library

12896260
width	height
two calls of eglquerysurface for getting width and height take about 10 microseconds 100 milliseconds when called 10000 times so it doesn t reduce performance and it give 100 guarantee that screen rotation will be handled

12896298
floating-point	integer
as chao and nneonneo points out there is an exception if the platform doesn t have floating-point support or even integer division support those could trigger hidden execution of compiler-provided library functions

12896326
voip	sip
i want to be able to add my own sip account to that list of long lasting accounts rather than using the sipprofile sipmanager classes for short lived sessions so that i can still receive voip calls once the app has closed

12896341
versioning	upgrade
so just upgrade your library versioning if it s old or define focus somewhere in your js file

12896358
post	get
1 don t use get request when you change object use post instead

12896368
java.util.date	simpledateformat
first step would be using simpledateformat to parse it to a fullworthy java.util.date instance in the controller

12896381
uiview	uiwindow

12896382
post	get
can you post your actual code - the code you posted doesn t compile but with some small changes to some of your brackets and variable naming it does - but i get a different result than you a2 contains both b s as expected so the problem may lie somewhere else

12896445
portrait	landscape	switching	screens
now i would like to know how is possible to update that value in realtime and reload that div in case that user switching screens from portrait to landscape mode

12896478
apache	nginx
if not i would like to suggest just using nginx or apache as they are really stable well established and performant especially fo static files

12896480
srp	principles
i am trying to implement the srp single-responsibility principles and from what i understood this involves splitting out most functionality in seperate dedicated classes to keep code more organised

12896488
google-chrome	safari
meaning google-chrome and safari won t tell you if it s gonna work well on bb

12896512
foldable	traversable
update this also provides an example of a structure that is a functor foldable but not traversable

12896533
hash	md5
once you md5 hash it you have to map that to the token that is less than that hash

12896552
put	get	post	get	post	put
this way when you post the form containing the ul you will get an array in your post values in the order you just put your list

12896563
bash	zsh
in all the shells i tried dash ksh zsh bash the above snippet outputs only a

12896613
post	get
i saw some post regarding based on url routing is there any way i can get the data from browser or from request to server and process

12896688
gridbaglayout	springlayout
have to look at gridbaglayout or springlayout

12896746
loops	while-loop
think of sum as a local variable in your while loops that s why sum appears not to be set when you go out of the while-loop

12896764
folder	directory
i try to write function that return array of string all files and folder that located in some directory

12896798
prng	random
your main question of how you should get the prng stuff out of your benchmarks you should be able to evaluate the random input fully before your defaultmain benchmarks g stuff with evaluate and force like

12896803
getter	setter	width	height
i don t understand why he wrote a sethw method if he already got setter and getter for width and height with synthesize

12896809
super	implements
i don t know the exact answer but you should be able to find out by subclassing the view and implements an override of setframe that just calls the one in its super

12896810
client-side	server-side
server-side checks are better than client-side

12896824
serializable	deserialization
at the first sight memcpy is the best choice to work with serializable and deserialization routines that s my real case of use indeed for example to send some values through a custom serial port library

12896824
free	malloc
afaik the malloc free functions aren t forbidden into the c++ scope although they re from c

12896824
int	chars
unsigned chars isn t int nor float nor my_awesome_serialization_struct if i m forced to choose some kind of dummy pointer to binary data i will prefer instead of

12896824
serializable	deserialization
so when i need a dynamic buffer for serializable deserialization purposes there s no way i can avoid the stuff in order to refactor into a type secure buffer management

12896830
photoshop	fireworks
you can think of as being a single layer in photoshop gimp fireworks or an mspaint document

12896915
onkeyup	onkeydown
besides that you should hook onkeyup and not onkeydown

12896918
width	height
he is synthesising width and height but the method you are asking about setwh looks lie a badly named convenience method to set the width and height in one place

12896919
width	height
i have set a bitmap to an imageview and then want to set wrap_content for both width and height

12896946
hash	salt
to remove the offending column and yet retain its function you could consider simply concatenation the salt and the hash inside one field

12896946
hash	salt
alternatively you can use bcrypt as your password hash the hashing takes a random salt together with the password and a cost factor

12896999
onkeyup	onkeydown
it is best if you use onkeyup instead of onkeydown

12897030
cruisecontrol	teamcity
we ve done this with cruisecontrol teamcity and team build

12897040
uiview	uipangesturerecognizer
i use uipangesturerecognizer for move my uiview objects on the screen

12897091
nsstring	nsdata
and it looks like i can t convert this nsstring to nsdata and get my nsdictionary back

12897110
width	height
basically i am using jcrop to crop an image to a specified x y width height and am using the following on the back-end to process the image

12897172
concurrenthashmap	blockingqueue
after the data arrives it will be stored in some java.util.concurrent collection such as a blockingqueue or a concurrenthashmap

12897194
onresume	onpause
create the executor oncreate of your activity start the execution onresume and stop it onpause

12897205
pop-up	dialog
i m trying to get an nice pop-up dialog box that shows when it s running but it just isn t showing

12897240
prepare	execute
even if the full query with inserted parameters is not available the prepare query along with the array passed by execute would suffice as i can recreate the full query

12897242
nsstring	nsdata
send nsdata objects and don t convert to from nsstring at all

12897245
javassist	cglib
you can use javassist or cglib - the byte code engineering libraries that allow creating proxies that wrap classes so you can add code that performs logging

12897250
int	double
i am trying to convert quite big double number to int or long or long long but have some difficulties

12897253
rss	feed
i keep getting this error randomly when trying to read arstechnica rss feed

12897253
rss	feed
i m not sure how to remove the invalid characters from the rss feed

12897258
union	distinct
the union statement does a union all followed by a distinct

12897291
google-chrome	firefox
firefox 15 - google-chrome

12897304
pop-up	dialog
specifically i want the logics to be able to make a pop-up box in the gui class dialog visible when some certain condition that is checked in the logics class is fulfilled

12897306
children	parent
as far as i understand signals sent to a parent process should not be sent to children

12897335
google-chrome	firefox
it s work fine for google-chrome and firefox .

12897335
google-chrome	firefox
i tried many scripts and nothing work well like firefox and google-chrome

12897358
google-chrome	firefox
i am trying to get this script working in firefox and it seems to only wanna work in google-chrome

12897369
ant	maven
there are a number of approaches for that we have a maven plugin for it org.mortbay.jetty jetty-jspc-maven-plugin and i know there are ant tasks for it as well

12897439
width	height
note how the container #background is set to 100 width and height with a min-height of 730px and the image inside is set to 100 width but is given no specific height just a min-width of 1200px

12897439
width	height
this basically says that it will scale up and height will change in proportion to its width but the width will never go below 1200px so at that point the container will collapse around the image and hide the excess that doesn t fit within its area overflow hidden

12897492
implements	extends
i know that the normal way of implements a servlet is extends the httpservlet class

12897582
google-chrome	firefox
in any case what s happening here is that firefox is giving the overflow hidden block the width it should have per section 10.3.3 and then clearing it past the float while google-chrome and ie seem to take the they may even path

12897642
sorting	filtering
if you really need sorting and filtering on count then that can be little big process

12897655
put	get
i believe you are supposed to use swing s invokelater otherwise they get put on the event dispatch thread

12897674
mouseleave	mouseenter
the codes works fine as the bigger image is showed on mouseenter and hides on mouseleave

12897674
width	height
since the image showed on hover can have dynamic width and height it depends on the image size.. i want to decrease the image width and height to 75 of the actual width and height

12897795
jar	war
the only solution that deploys in jboss as 7.1.1 is to copy a.jar both in the ear s lib location and in the war s web-inf lib but then i have two copies of the same jar in my ear

12897861
hide	show
as the table is dynamic there could be any number of rows so i have had to identify the areas to show hide by classname

12897862
spaces	delimiter
if you un-double spaces the first file with sed -n 1 2p you can use paste with a newline delimiter tested with gnu paste

12897906
x86	64bit
i tried this in both x86 and 64bit powershell

12897944
width	height
but if not we save the height or width inside that attribute and then uses it

12897955
ant	maven
once you get used to this process it s better to automate it using a build tool such as ant or maven

12897955
ant	maven
ant is a little easier to begin with maven has some additional capabilities that make it a little more complex

12897966
hide	show	mouseleave	mouseenter
you could set the size back again when you hide it but my advice would be to calculate the values on document ready and only show and hide the image with the mouseenter and mouseleave events

12897982
mouseleave	mouseenter
it just undoes in mouseleave what you did in mouseenter

12897994
submit	submission
in order to change the submission of a form to be triggered by a link as opposed to a submit button you must use javascript instead of raw generated html only

12898014
post	get
here is a great blog post on how to get a vm up and running with web deploy with only one script

12898025
rspec	capybara
one way to do that is to start with an end-to-end test with rspec and capybara or cucumber and capybara and then add more fine-grained tests as you need them

12898034
inherited	properties
so i have a class called items which inherited from the inotifypropertychanged class and implements the properties change handler

12898044
children	parent
as you can see if children have got 500 of z-index is under the next parent

12898057
youtube	vimeo
i m trying to match youtube and vimeo urls on javascript

12898101
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome 10+ safari 5.1+ ios 5+

12898101
opera	firefox
firefox 16+ ie10 opera 12.50+

12898114
opera	firefox
for example in firefox ie opera the following code can always return true when i click the button labeled submitnamesearch as id

12898114
google-chrome	safari
however when i test my code in google-chrome safari the return value is false

12898123
int	chars
but as seen above if i use scanner to read input i ve tried to convert the string into a chars array then to its int unicode equivalent but it comes up with a ridiculous number and i can t display it correctly

12898128
width	height
i understand that i should override the onmeasure method as well and call setmeasureddimension width height with my desired dimensions

12898176
many-to-many	one-to-many
it is briefly listed in the api under the collection associations one-to-many many-to-many

12898189
google-chrome	safari
the demo will work only on webkit browsers google-chrome or safari

12898198
public	protected
the reason is the method isvalidrequeststring of requestvalidator that does the check is protected internal virtual and so you can t just invoke it outside but by creating a custom requestvalidator you may achieve that you may have to create a public method that call the protected one

12898255
glut	sdl
for this reason and other frustrations we eventually ported our code from glut to sdl

12898259
uiview	subviews
also these uiview represent pages and sometimes multiple pages are stacked on top of each other resulting in a pile of pages setup by adding subviews to a given view

12898309
public	protected
this does not work because dbset does not have any public or protected constructors

12898352

parent has n children and child has 1 parent

12898790
children	parent
there s only 1 parent in the sql server database and 25 000 children for that single parent

12898790
children	parent
whenever i load either the children and the parent in the same dbcontext it takes a really long time

12898790
children	parent
load the parent from dbset 0 001 seconds then load the children from dbset 8 6026 seconds

for example you can automatically play videos using the autoplay parameter or cause a video to play repeatedly using the loop parameter or in your case hide or show controls

12899216
children	parent
i m a little confused as to what is the best way to implement initializing the children objects when a parent is created

12899260
crypt	salt
the problem is that base64_encode may generate a string with + symbol which is considered an incorrect salt by crypt function

12899260
crypt	salt
var_dump your along with and you ll see that each time + character is used in the salt crypt function will return a string - the sign of failure

12899328
oledbcommand	sqlcommand
use oledbcommand instead of sqlcommand

i was looking to get all the parsing done before the switch so that i only need to parse all entries once and then have a 0 put in for the empty one as this would give an error

12899768
getter	setter
it would automatically make an ivar with the same name as the property and write a getter and if needed setter to read and write that ivar

12899768
accessor	ivar
the one other piece of information you should know is that you should always use the accessor to access the ivar even inside of the object

12899781
portrait	landscape
i want to rotate only some specific angle in landscape and portrait

12899799
ant	maven	wsimport	xjc
so put .xsd files and ant maven task wsimport xjc etc. under version control and think about this xsd-files as about primary document

12899818

but about the post id the story is a bit different you can save the post id in session when the page is being viewed but if the user opens multiple post at the same time the comments get mixed up since the post id value is changed on every view post request

12899823
allocator	stl
in case of stl containers they do support custom memory allocator

12899843
post	get
indexcontroller.php was modified and it was not forwarding the post get variables

12899917

pop-up	dialog
i could nt figure out how to pass the recordid to this insert page in the dialog pop-up

12900028
getter	setter	accessor	properties
as far as i knew properties and synthesize simply create accessor methods the getter and setter

12900158
hide	show
instead you have to have all controls loaded onload and then simply change their visible flag to show or hide them as needed

12900159
uiview	subviews
one approach is to add an instance of uiview as a subviews of the directors glview

12900184
post	get
my question is how to get the images to display using the code in my original post

12900228
post	get
so you can use any http client library for delphi indy synapse... and use http get post delete do read insert delete records

12900239
maven	m2e
this may not be the best approach for you at this particular time in your release cycle given that you are so close to your release deadline but i would use maven for the build and use the m2e plugin to provide maven integration inside of eclipse

12900276
submit	submission
in order for the form to submit and send all the information from your inputs you need the submit button to be a proper form element that is capable of submission the form

12900333

ienumerable	icollection
if you think this is a missing feature in mvx - if you feel lists should bind to any ienumerable or maybe to any icollection then please log this is an issue on github

12900488
width	height
height should be scaled exactly as width is to maintain correct aspect ratio

12900488
width	height
this means that the width may not fully stretch to parent width if limited by the height

12900488
width	height
in landscape mode the maximum height is irrelevant because scrolling is allowed width should always be parent width

12900488
portrait	landscape
if i start by selecting an image in portrait mode then switch to landscape mode the image now displays as 1px by 1px

12900526
maven	pom.xml
to do so we should execute the command to install the pom.xml file in the local maven repo

12900526
maven	pom.xml
be aware that when maven resolves dependencies it always looks for pom.xml files already available in the repo

12900542
put	get
i don t know how to get the same result the file decrypted using email.message class and gnupg i tried to save the payload of the attachment to a file and this is different from the downloaded from thunderbird one i can t decrypt it i tried also to put it into a stringio and also encoding it with base64

as you can see it works flawlessly in google-chrome firefox but in ie it just says that i cant use the method indexof and points somewhere inside the kineticjs.js ..

12900622
implements	extends
you also need to create either a base class or an interface that they will both extends implements

12900663

what i m going to explain here is how to load the raw data of a webpage using node.js and express and send it back to the client inside a json object

12900664

you might want to think of remotipart or plupload or jqueryfile_upload or uploadify to acheive

12900770
memcached	apc
if anyone else runs into this my solution was to ditch cacherouter did not perform as expected authcache too beta and boost simply to avoid hitting apache at all for cached pages Ã¢ proceeding with memcached api the drupal module memcached the caching system apc and varnish 3.0

12900819
for-loop	loops
move your while loops inside the for-loop because i guess you want to validate your input grade for each index -

12900835
width	height
the workgroup size is 8x8 and the number of workitems is height x width 16 which is 2048 x 128 on the images i m running on

12900846
octal	hex
my goal is to convert that 8-digit hex into a octal

12900846
octal	binary
i already know how to get from binary to octal and thats by masking and shifting the 32bit binary digit

12900928
maven	pom.xml
instead this is an android project which uses a maven pom.xml to organize its settings

12900930
width	height
i think i can find the columns with the same height width and length using this code

12900958
hide	show
tap to show hide ui is also just a uitapgesturerecognizer set up to animate show hide the controls

12900976
hide	show
since you re already using jquery for the label solution you could add code that checks the value of the input after the document has loaded then show or hide the label accordingly

12900993
onkeyup	onkeydown
an alternative method would be to separate the onkeydown and onkeyup events and explicitly define the map subitems in each event

12900993
pop-up	dialog
notice that without the return false line the bookmarks dialog will pop-up

12900993
put	get
always put larger combinations first in the if..else chain so you don t get an alert for both enter and ctrl+enter at the same time

12900993

but as i ve tested this works in every browser i currently have on my computer including maxthon 3 google-chrome internet explorer 9 and 8 and firefox

12901029

seems like the popups on windows 8 suffer from the same problem as they did on windows phone in that when you put a textbox on one of them - it does not get pushed up together with all the other content as it does when it is not in a popup

12901100
for-loop	arrays
you can write a simple for-loop that iterates over both arrays s and you or both values and your done.

12901145
express	node.js
for instance i just did a google search for express mongoose json where mongoose is the data model for the mongodb database and i found this a simple node.js web application that uses mongoose express and mongodb and returns json

12901194
hide	show
i just get the problem with hide and show

12901226
superclass	subclassing
putting it all together we can create a function that returns new subclassing in which we apply arguments to the superclass s constructor

12901230
submit	submission
for example if you already fill the form and click submit you can make a function for store data first on variable flag and show the data in form submission so when you click back button you can call the value that you store on variable flag into edittext

12901244
actualheight	actualwidth
you can t get the actualwidth actualheight without doing something like this because they are calculated when the control is rendered

12901294
min	max
as discussed here ellipsize multiline textview ellipsize causes issues with the min max lines attributes

12901347
tiff	png	gif	png
an image stored as nsdata can be in any number of formats such a png jpg tiff gif raw etc

12901393
put	get
so you should be able to just create the json you want with fake values and then put in the calls to the relevant ruby code to get the real values at runtime

12901411
gif	bmp	gif	png	bmp	png
a quick google found this implementation in ruby that determines file type jpg bmp png and gif and pulls the dimensions of the image

12901425
ready	each
the result is each time it checks for the file it uploads the chunk of the file that is ready

12901428
hide	show
the closest option would be to close or hide the first and show the second at the same location on the screen

12901468
ostringstream	std
considering vs2010 sp1 i found that in the header there is this overload for std ostringstream and

12901469
hide	show	switching	screens
when you want to switching between different screens you can hide or show the group control by setting the visible property and calling bringtofront and it will hide show all the controls on that group control

12901525
width	height
or a 2-item array representing width and height in pixels

12901540
subscript	superscript
this is still going to have issues with distinguishing between fractions and exponents 47 64 where 47 is wrapped in superscript tags and 64 is wrapped in subscript tags and 10 13 where 13 is wrapped in superscript tags

12901561
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	width	height
what i m doing so far work s well in firefox and webkit browers safari and google-chrome not tested in maxthone and actually it s pretty simple i m just adding an event hover changing the width and height in the gallery to gain space and let the image with the zoom of the jqzoom appears

12901639
getter	setter
add a public property of type frame to the application view model with a getter and setter

12901686
floating-point	integer
you should use the longserializer as a double-precision floating-point number and a 64-bit integer are not the same

12901686
int	double
it s not at all surprising that 64-bit negative int would come out strangely when using a deserializer expecting double as the encoding is different

12901688
google-chrome	firefox
this seems to always work for google-chrome and firefox on windows

12901704
children	parent
in tests 3 and 4 the relationships between the parent and the 25000 children get fixed up when the entities are loaded from the database ef adds all the child entities to the parent s childs collection and sets the parent in each child to the loaded parent

12901704

width	height
if you call setconsolescreenbuffersize with illegal value in coords too little height width then you get an

12901850
factors	mean
also it tends to produce sparser factors than cholinc which results in faster application of the factors as a preconditioner which can mean faster solution times with pcg

12901850
factors	matrix
finally note that by default ichol references the lower triangle of the input matrix and returns a lower triangular factors

12901871
chown	chmod
after compiling i have tried chmod +x and chown 777 to no avail

12901894

each box has some text and a show and hide button

12903725
hide	show
i m trying to create a show hide all button

12903725

12903736

it really depends on whether you want to first hide them all or show them all

12903841
swing	windowbuilder
also many here would recommend learning to code swing gui s first by hand before using code-generating tools such as windowbuilder

12903841
swing	windowbuilder
again avoid use of any windowbuilder software for the moment and go through the swing tutorials as all of this will become second nature to you if you can first do this coding by hand

i was under the assumption that the api would adapt and scale the image appropriately but when i build and run on my retina device i am given a uibarbuttonitem that has appropriately scaled the height of the image down to 19px but has kept the 40px width of the image intact so i have a horizontally stretched image fitting inside a wide uibarbuttonitem

jobs	cron
my understanding is that this in its most simple form this is achieved by setting up cron jobs

12904005
jobs	cron
however i have a real dislike for running cron jobs when i am not 100 confident of the amount of time they are going to take to complete

12904005
jobs	cron
the indexes are going to grow very quickly and would like to avoid being in a position of having to deal with the reindexing cron jobs overlapping an grinding everything to a halt

12904078
width	height
image sources hold true image dimensions width height

12904101
width	height
i think what you re seeing is that the image has not yet loaded when you query the width or height

12904101
google-chrome	firefox
ironically for me firefox immediately reports the width in the first example ie and google-chrome show 0px but that just goes to show it depends on the timing of the browser the load time for the image etc

12904114
portrait	landscape
i have an app with some views in portrait mode and i want to present modal view controller in landscape mode.

12904155
std	ostream
i m looking into providing ostream operators for some math classes matrix vector etc. a friend has noted that the gcc standard library implementation of the ostream operator for std complex includes the internal use of a string stream to format the output before passing it to the actual ostream

12904173
children	parent
i m trying to position multiple children canvasses randomly on a parent canvas

12904238
std	ostream
consider what happens if you set an output width on the ostream then write a std complex to it - you don t want the width to only affect the first output operation the character

12904293
hash	md5
how about having a structure utilising timestamp upload date as the 1st level directory md5 hash of the file contents as the 2nd level hash of file contents ensures the file is unique name independent upload timestamp as the 3rd enables you to have different versions of the same file uploaded at different times and the file with it s actual filename in the 4th level

12904293
hash	md5
the handicap with the file contents md5 hash is that if you have significantly large files there s going to be a slight overhead in generating

12904293
hash	md5
the hash of file contents is the way to go to guarantee filename independency i believe and although it will add a small overhead to calculate the md5 of the contents it is a trivial one compared to the uploading time

width	height
i will prefer to work with divs but for this kind of grid maybe a table will be easier way but for sure use precents as a values for width and height you maybe use colspan and rowspan to fit your table cells in the right way

12905152
width	height
there s no best solution the simplest is to use table s the most modern to use display grid but won t work on all browsers you could also try putting whatever you write in a fixed width and height element and using css3 s transform scale to fit screen but that also doesn t work in all browsers you could also do it using 4 inline-block with height 100

12905152
width	height
elements inside 4 block elements with height 25 or using 16 inline-block elements with width 25

12905152
width	height
height 25 another solution is could define all 16 elements with position fixed or position absolute and width 25

12905159

sorting	grouping
if they re consecutive or close together sorting them may help so you re reading in ascending order to improve prefetch and grouping reads from the same cache line together

12905398

google-chrome	firefox
did you check that you are storing session for a longer time and it is not destroyed early.or may be it has to do with google-chrome settings for accepting session and cookies data as there is no such code in codeigniter which will work on firefox and it will not work on chrome.also make sure you are auto loading your session library

it seems that the act of applying the filter changes how the browser calculates the width and height so the clickable area is reduced to the text within the pageblock div and not the whole div itself

12909947

the simplest solution would be to use a background image a small 5px x 5px 60 transparent black .png will work just fine will add a minimal footprint to your overall page size has browser support from ie7 upwards and will not overwrite the width height declarations you ve set for pageblock

12909949

12917968
getter	setter

12917984
vmware	virtualbox
i think you already answered your own question use virtualbox or vmware xen etc..

12918026

hexbin works directly with lattice and ggplot2 but the center coordinates of the bins are in binned xcm and binned ycm so you could also plot the result in base graphics

12918388
getter	setter
however when you provide both a getter and a setter you get an error

12918441
getter	setter
i usually set such properties up as getter setter so that the property can be nulled when the child is removed from the stage and the child can remove its listeners

12918467
post	get
the web application written in php codeigniter accepts post or get and returns the proper results and displays it on the page

12918475
getter	setter
when you provide both getter and setter there is often just no need for an instance variable at all when you just forward those messages or store data in other places

joomla	typo3
conclusion is simple if somebody wrote such mapper between his typo3 and his joomla most probably will not work in any other combination

12919362
joomla	typo3

superclass	subclassing
for instance methods for example this is done at runtime which results in the ability of a subclassing to override a superclass s methods polymorphism

12924640
super	implements
you can implements the error interface in typescript but this won t give you access to super as you aren t using inheritance

12924653

however when i try to play it in safari google-chrome and firefox it acts like it s playing but doesn t have any audio

12925011
google-chrome	firefox
it acts the same way in google-chrome and firefox

12925019
implements	extends
my attempt to simply extends the map class fails because list is an interface and cannot be extended but must be implements

12925044
post	get
furthermore this query is probably supposed to be a get rather than a post

12925044
post	get
imho there is almost never a good reason to create post or get parameters by hand - it s far simpler to use an object of key value pairs

12925109
folder	directory
i have created 3 sub-domains with my example.com domain and the hosting account created the folder for the same sub-domains on the the directory

12925147

by looking through various questions on this site i have found 3 workable methods of reading a 4 byte 32 bit unsigned little-endian integer from a file

12925218
for-loop	loops
1 you want to loops through the values such as with a for-loop

12925218
int	boolean	int	double
this then leads into a small side-lesson which might be beneficial to you since you are new java has both primitive types boolean byte short int long float double and object versions of the primitive types boolean byte int etc.

int	chars
also you should note that you used cin to initialize num so amongst the issues pointed out by others keep in mind that you should use cin to initialize a string chars then change that to an int

12925353
cpu	affinity
i have libopenblas.so .3gf and it is highly optimized with the option cpu affinity that is to say when you do numerical vector or matrix computation the openblas package will just make 8 threads and make each one of the threads stuck to one specified and fixed cpu to speed up the codes

12925353
cpu	affinity
removing cpu affinity will make you lose some efficiency when doing numerical computations that s why though the openblas maintainer dr

12925353
cpu	affinity
xianyi zhang knows the problem he still publish the codes with the cpu affinity as a default option

12925378

12926245
min	max
one common example of this is the std max or std min template

12926288

int	chars
okay after much experimenting and looking at sources i figure out that bson_append_int bson b const chars name const int i doesn t actually append an object of int type

12926392
multiplication	exponent
it may be useful for embedded systems compilers to have special scale-by-power-of-two pseudo-op which could be translated by the code generator in whatever fashion was optimal for the machine in question since on some embedded processors focusing on the exponent may be an order of magnitude faster than doing a full power-of-two multiplication but on the embedded micros where multiplication is slowest a compiler could probably achieve a bigger performance boost by having the floating-point-multiply routine check its arguments at run-time so as to skip over parts of the mantissa that are zero

12926395
int	chars
the api expects this string to hold only numeric chars for an int conversion

12926434
folder	directory
the current working directory changes depending on how you run the program and in your case it looks like the bin folder is not your current working directory

12926447

getter	setter
books says that there are setter and getter if a model was generated

12926478
put	get
my code worked when it was in the main method but once i try to put it in its own method i get args cannot be resolved to a variable also i am very new to java is there a way to simplify this code block i have a book that shows modularized code but it is not explained in detail

you re much better off taking a more traditional approach with a sql server like mysql or postgresql which do basically that same thing

12926701
wnck	pygobject
note for newer versions of wnck 3.0 you have to use pygobject gobject introspection but you get the idea

12926709
hide	show
you can show and hide your window with javascript

12926780
getter	setter
utilizing property getter and setter are highly effective and provide extra stuff as a benefit such as automatic support for key value coding however they also have drawback of doing extra stuff

12926780
getter	setter
1 loss of polymorphism on the getter and setter - by accessing the variable directly you lose the ability for subclasses to extend the functionality of those getter and setter which may be undesirable from an oop perspective but then again that could also be a benefit depending on your architecture

12926788
getter	setter
all of the code works except the dynamic getter setter - if you read my comments in the code or run the code you can easily see why

12926811
setinterval	settimeout
the advantage of using deltatimer over settimeout or setinterval is

12926864
margin	height
i tried setting the background in the ontouch handler but the background does not fill the height of the actionbar in the same way as the default one see example image below it seems like there is some padding or margin in place but i don t know how to remove it

12926872
setinterval	settimeout
both settimeout setinterval work the same way

12926872

12927389
post	get
i can get the full post individually by making a separate request for that post s open graph id but this doesn t lend itself to fun code because requests are asynchronous and nesting more asynchronous calls within asynchronous calls doesn t lend itself to fun code

12927397
nsmutablestring	nsstring
i finally solved the problem using nsmutablestring instead of nsstring for contents

12927399

viewdidload	viewwillappear
and that to i m reloading the gridview in viewwillappear and viewdidload also

12927968
inline	inlining

12928123
profiling	debugging
another debugging tool you should definitely try is opengl profiling

12928135

std	ostream
this is a convenient way to define a subclass of ostream that sets a buffer mystreambuf is some subclass of std streambuf

12931999
std	ostream
here std ostream s constructor is called before the constructor of buffer so the streambuf being passed in is pointing to an unconstructed object that has virtual methods

12931999
std	ostream
the same issue applies in mystream as buffer is destructed before std ostream is so the destructor of std ostream will be looking at a destructed buffer object

12931999
std	ostream
i have heard that this technique is safe because the standard does not allow std ostream to call methods on the buffer in its constructor and destructor

12931999

the question is also not how to rewrite the code above to get around the issue - for example by using multiple inheritance to get the buffer to be constructed as a super class before the std ostream super class

to be fair they are correct if you re talking about the application bundle directory structure or for the rare case where the image is in a blue folder in xcode more on that later but not for the most common cases

if your images are in a group that is attached to a directory in your file system via create groups for added folder then you still don t need to worry about the name

12932893
stdout	stderr
the other thing you could do is to capture and print any output that is written to the processes stdout and stderr

12932958
width	height
another solution is to get all the images with xpath and get only those with a specified size bigger than 150px x 150px and limited width height ratio for example from 0.5 to 2

12933024
apache	nginx
nginx and apache are both webserver of course you can use nginx proxy_pass.

12933024
apache	nginx
so i think first you should decide if you want nginx or apache has you re web server

12933036
google-chrome	safari
i have found a difference in the way safari and google-chrome select select boxes

12933043
children	parent
i have a bi-direction one-to-many relationship ie one parent can have many children one child must have one parent many children can have the same parent

12933043
children	parent
selecting a parent by its id successfully returns the parent object that includes a set of its children if any

12933043
children	parent
however when i create a new parent add some children and then ask hibernate to create the parent the children aren t saved along with it

12933043
children	parent
i suspect my issue is because the parent has a db managed sequence as an id so the children can t have their parent s id until after the parent is inserted

12933045
width	height
i called the getter for the width and height getwidth and getheight respectively which overrode the methods inherited from jpanel

12933071
submit	submission
while submission i m not using ajax submit

12933083

12933218
many-to-one	one-to-many	many-to-many	many-to-one	many-to-many	one-to-many
if you want a solution that is as generic as possible and will work in any simple graph modeling case one-to-many many-to-one many-to-many just model the links as source_id target_id pairs in a separate link table

12933218
children	parent
whether it will be a tree-like structure where one object can have just one parent but many children or a more generic graph where one object may have several edges coming and going

12933218
children	parent
as far as the second point goes if the graph you want to model resembles a tree or a forest every object has 0 or 1 parent and 0 to n children all the links are of the same type - uni- or bidirectional you can just add something like parent_id to the objects themselves instead of modeling the connections on a separate link table

12933225
range	max
i ve removed room price from group by query now will will return unique guests and number of rooms they booked with price in given range and max price for each guest

you should be able to subclass nsurlcache and substitute it for the shared cache used by the uiwebview as described in this cocoa with love article substituting local data for remote uiwebview requests

12933516
uiwebview	nsurlprotocol
for another approach have a look at drop-in offline caching for uiwebview and nsurlprotocol

listview	gridview
so when i used a gridview there were no problems but when i use a listview the image is changed only in the first item

12933785
getter	setter
however that would be wrong since dynamic is supposed to be used for turning off warnings if getter and setter are implemented somewhere else or during runtime

12933826
width	height
then for the height and width of the bitmap the rgb values are extracted using a combination of bitwise anding and bit shifting right

12933869

12933953
imperative	declarative
in your declarative layout you would declare each button explicitly while in your imperative layout you would most likely use a for-loop

12933956
getter	setter
if you have a readwrite property don t have a synthesize have a getter and don t have a setter then it will generate the ivar

12933956
getter	setter
if you have a readwrite property don t have a synthesize don t have a getter and have a setter then it will generate the ivar

12933956
getter	setter
if you have a readwrite property don t have a synthesize and have both a getter and a setter then it will not generate the ivar

12933956
getter	setter
to me this reads like it ok to mark a property as dynamic even when you are directly implementing the getter and setter

12933980

12934679
typedef	struct
you appear to abuse struct inheritance quite a lot to achieve typedef behaviour

12934697

on the other hand the eclipse was solved by moving the jetty folder out of the program files directory

12934720
subtraction	addition
at each step or interval i want to go one value closer to the target color through addition subtraction

12934743
exponent	modulo
all i need is a plain modulo exponent pair which should take up exactly 131 bytes 128 for the modulo and 3 for the exponent

12934743
exponent	modulo
there are also two bytes between the modulo and the exponent

12934743
exponent	modulo
i tried manually stripping out the modulo and exponent using

12934752
strcpy	strncpy
first of all you are using strncpy and not strcpy

12934756

i need these photos to scale with the browser window so i ve given them a width and height to scale with the body

12934768
width	height
this is easy to do when i know the values of the image s width and height because i can just crop or resize

12934777
inherited	properties
the former will force you to have all entities inherited from an entity object with an id properties which is not necessarily a bad thing but i can see the pain in this.

12934786
post	get
in the form you can use only get post

12934837
children	parent
private can only be accessed by the class which defines neither parent nor children classes

12935183
joptionpane	jdialog
try using jdialog joptionpane and then redirect to main jframe

12935205
superclass	subclassing
if however your object has any pointer members or any members of a type that have pointer members or any subclassing or superclass or any members of types that have subclassing or superclass etc this approach may not be sufficient and may yield either nonsensical or plain incorrect output

12935286
post	get
my problem is some of my forms use post and get request

hash	salt
i ve already decided to use django s built in pbkdf2-sha256 with randomly generated salt hash to store a user s password

12935409
hash	salt
now here s my solution let each encryption key the hash of the users actual password and a randomly generated salt different from the salt already used for the password stored hash

12935409
hash	salt
the salt would be stored in the table the actual password and the hash of it obviously not

12935546
yslow	pagespeed
pagespeed yslow etc. are guidelines not gospel

12935557
padding	overlapping
the issue i ran into which i m surprised i haven t seen discussed is the trick of overlapping previous elements with padding or a transparent border prevents hover and click actions at the bottom of those sections because the following one comes higher in the z-order

12935578
uiview	uipangesturerecognizer
2 use a uipangesturerecognizer for moving the uiview s around

this works good in firefox google-chrome and safari

12935720

i am actually only getting data and should use get and not post

12935720
post	get
as get is used to retrieve remote data and post is used to insert update remote data

12935746
stdout	stderr
maybe that message being an error of sorts i guess is coming to stderr not stdout

12935746
stdout	stderr
the 2 1 part means redirect stderr 2 to stdout 1 and stdout is what is piped into awk

12935794
map	quadtree
now the quadtree is going to have a 2d map of all your datapoints split into buckets

12935794

there can also be cache benefits to using a get instead of a post

12935904
post	get
to switch to a get you d just update your code from a post to a get

12935925
children	parent
which puts it in the centre and then the children divs take up a percentage of that parent div

12935925
children	parent
the parent #container can be resized and the children will fill it up appropriately

12935934
post	get
get s should be used for retrieving data and post s should be used for inserting new data

12936024
button	checkbox
i d like to customize the way checkbox and radio button are drawn

12936024

there is only -setbuttontype no getter and neither -showsstateby nor -highlightsby seem to give any unique return values for checkbox that don t also apply to regular push button with images and alternate images

12936024
button	checkbox
i d really like this to be a straight drop-in replacement for nsbuttoncell instead of forcing client code to use a separate ulithemeswitchbuttoncell class for checkbox and a third one for radio button

12936042
folder	directory
i have to keep list of swf files in a local directory in my local system not inside the project folder

12936086
int	chars
you can have a style war over 2b vs 3 whether to include the sizeof chars or not -- some people leave it out because it s redundant i usually do other people put it in to create a kind of consistency with the same code setting an array of int

12936148
versioning	upgrade
upgrade openssl to latest versioning

12936176
puts	gets

12936443
width	height
in general the simplest thing to do is to zoom out the image in a way that current center of the image remains at its place and handle the image drawing in a way that x and y coordinates are divided by 2 and width and height are multiplied by 2

12936495
tostring	string.format
i think at the very base string.format uses stringbuilder by overloading the tostring and using stringbuilder it should be cleaner and more efficient

12936593
clang	llvm
an advantage of working inside some existing compiler framework like gcc or clang llvm is that you benefit at once of all the compiler s machinery

12936593
fortran	ada
also you can for compilers accepting several source languages like gcc also handle other languages than c c++ go ada fortran objective c for gcc

12936690
ati	nvidia
maybe it s just my imagination but it doesn t seem to occur on machines with nvidia geforce cards but i have seen it happen on machine s with ati cards and nvidia quadro fx cards

avassetwriter	avassetreader
you can use the avassetreader and avassetwriter apis to convert an mp3 file into raw pcm or .wav data

12937304
setinterval	settimeout
you re using settimeout which will execute some code after a certain time what you want is setinterval which will execute some code every so often

12937314
getter	setter
i ran into this old question while searching for ways to adjust the template used for setter getter generation in netbeans

12937314
getter	setter
basically the answer is no you can not change the template of the setter getter generator in netbeans

12937340
setinterval	settimeout
- use setinterval not settimeout

12937342
folder	directory
i just kept another copy of the entire directory in a deprecated folder and deleted the problematic files folder

12937455
post	get
i tried to get it through picasaweb api but the album photos from post is not listed when trying to get the list of all albums

12937464
spaces	delimiter
in the second case the word delimiter isn t a spaces character so the necessary whitespace between command and first argument isn t merged with the arguments and the line becomes

12937519
int	double
with this i would be able to add any object that implements both iconvertible and icomparable including double and int as well as my own objects

12937570
innodb	myisam
also the engine on the tables were different innodb vs myisam on server.

12937581

public class rawmap extends mapreducebase implements

12937591
rss	feed
the rss feed i m using has multiple values for category

the general way to solve this in any web application is to have your post redirect to a get to display the results

12937687

12937757
hide	show
i use a jquery .change event listener to hide show divs

12937758
subtract	add
when you have an even number of values we subtract odd iterations from location to get the new position and add even iterations to our location to find the next value

12937777
rubygems	bundler
actually your users don t need bundler rubygems itself handles the dependencies of gems and yes it will be easy for people to use

12937792
min	max
for the min max pixel you ll need to record the value of the first pixel and then compare each other pixel to it storing the new value if it s lower higher respectively

12937792
median	max	min	median	min	max
for the median you ll need to sort all pixels and select the middle one once sorted of course finding the min max is trivial as they ll be on either end of the list

12937810
getter	setter
the only way to call a function without parenthesis would be to define it using getter and setter

12937819
implicit	shapeless
syntactic convenience aside the combination of singleton types path-dependent types and implicit values means that scala has surprisingly good support for dependent typing as i ve tried to demonstrate in shapeless

12937819
agda	idris
however it s often objected that scala isn t a fully dependently type language because it doesn t have dependent sum and product types as found in agda or coq or idris as intrinsics

12937819
agda	idris
in practice however in scala we wouldn t start by encoding sigma and pi types and then proceeding from there as we would in agda or idris

12937834
g++	gcc
to avoid searching in the native host s directories use -nostdlib and -nostdinc for gcc g++

12937856

12937957
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
try refresh f5 browser refresh symbol home button firefox and ie9 works safari and google-chrome doesn t all the time

12937981
int	boolean
they have no true boolean type although in c++ and c99 there are typedefs for providing some small-width int type to act as a boolean so any nonzero int floating-point or pointer value is treated as boolean true and zero as false

12937998
put	get	post	get	post	put
in that file you put the code from your post plus some logic to get image data from database

12938039
min	max
a max of 60 min window every 60 min - new altered data need to go to vertica

12938055

12938060
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox the grid renders perfectly even with forcefitcolumns true

12938083
maven	pom.xml
look at this pom.xml as well as various other poms in maven central

12938110
nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue
i would use an nsoperationqueue and submit the downloads as individual block operations with synchronous nsurlconnection requests

12938113
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
this presents obvious difficulties if you re parsing something that needs to be case-insensitive in some places and case-sensitive in others or if you care about preserving case for cosmetic reasons

12938117
jboss	glassfish
tomcat is not a full blown application server btw that would be jboss glassfish et al

12938145
queue	fifo
type a some data can be incorporated directly as it arrives 10 hz a fifo queue would be enough for this

12938185
for-loop	loops
add another for-loop around your code for example loops over i then in the end do not assign the value to var but to var i

12938197
superclass	subclassing
that s because you cannot assign a superclass object to a subclassing object

12938232
superclass	subclassing
in this case superclass is bigger than subclassing that s why the second statement is correct

12938324
width	height
suppose i have an jpg image width of 780px and height of 2546px

12938335
google-chrome	firefox
works in ie firefox and google-chrome just fine on my laptop

12938376
implements	extends
the basic idea is that you extends the asynctask class which makes you implements a doinbackground method

12938457
getter	setter
serializing objects are more for objects created or modified inside classes like arraylists or something though a getter setter method wold probably be more conventional and more useful

12938485
gridview	detailsview
lets say i have couple tables and some tables i used td tag to place the gridview and detailsview in side

12938485
gridview	detailsview
note that these detailsview and gridview are not related like one click another refresh just display records

12938574
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested with ie 9 firefox and google-chrome

12938609

this generates an extras directory in my project wich haves a folder called mymodule and inside this folder are the generated .properties files

12938809
getter	setter
attr_accessor is a ruby code to quickly create setter and getter methods in a class

12938809
getter	setter
now what is missing as an explanation is that when you create somehow a link between a rails model with a database table you never never never need attr_accessor in your model to create setter and getter in order to be able to modify your table s records

12938817
width	height
assume that i am defining a button or text view width as 100 dip and height as 30 dip in xml file

12938817
mdpi	hdpi
as for as i know android itself take care of that button or text view appearance proportionate or same among ldpi mdpi or hdpi devices as i defined dimension in dip

12938817
mdpi	hdpi	width	height	screens	mdpi	screens	hdpi
my question is does dip is only useful in handling ldpi mdpi or hdpi devices with same width and height means all 320x480 or all 400x840 like that or is it also support across multi screens dimensions means if i define a button with 100x30 dip for 320x480 device after adding all screens support true in manifest file android system it self will recalculate the widget size to some 200x60 dip to 700x1024 device

12938823
qtreewidget	qitemdelegate
method 2 override qitemdelegate and qtreewidget ...

12938854

the closest thing to the properly calculating a moving average was accomplished with the zoo and plyr libraries and the following command

12938870
children	parent
as you can see whenever i hover the parent the children become visible

12938870
children	parent
this selects all children of the parent which are not child1 and applies the style to them

12938886
width	height
you can also set the div width and height as needed

12938904
min	max
using a normal group by showing min date and max date i would get something like

12938918
screens	tablet
the problem with that dim was that i had to terminate my tablet s systemui-process to achieve a kiosk mode with no system-bar and the progressdialog dims everything but the area where the system-bar was so i have a bright border at the bottom of the screens

12939059
cout	ofstream	stdout	stderr	ostringstream	std
stream abstraction you can use the same overloads so you only write them once to format to stdout and stderr cout cerr and files std ofstream and strings std ostringstream

12939100
int	chars
since it s an oo-language we can easily refer to chunks of memory we allocate because they are usually primitive variables int chars bytes or classes we defined that are made of our own types and primitives

12939100
subtraction	addition
did you know you can override what addition subtraction etc

12939105

if i substitute get with post something really weird happens

12939148
portrait	landscape

width	height
also set your object embed code to have a height width of 100 instead of a fixed width

12939164
folder	directory
above s configuration will tell plugin to generate classes in target generated-sources com4j directory in the project folder

12939199
google-chrome	firefox
the two divs are not lining up on the top as they do in higher versions of ie as well as work fine in firefox and google-chrome

12939225
maven	pom.xml

12939234
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
and it appears that the color is consistent across the latest versions of ie firefox google-chrome opera and safari

12939239
simplecursoradapter	listactivity
an alternative to using preferenceactivity in this way would be to create an activity with an adapterview or perhaps a listactivity and use simplecursoradapter to automate binding the data to the view

12939240
ubuntu	centos
if you were actually pulling in metris 45 into lib ab on centos machine 2 then they would not show up on the link line like they don t under ubuntu machine 1

12939273
yslow	pagespeed
but these changes are not reflected by google s pagespeed and the yslow addon for chrome

12939288
getter	setter
if then c is an instance of c c.x will invoke the getter c.x value will invoke the setter and del c.x the deleter

12939321
uibutton	uiappearance
as i was switching my code to using uiappearance i noticed that backbutton.appearance is unsuprisingly inherited from uibutton.appearance and therefore changing it will change all uibutton s throughout the application and not just my custom buttons

12939332
tablet	mdpi
for example there are 10 tablet that are still mdpi and of course layouts that look well on small mdpi phones will look terrible on those devices

12939495
httpconnection	downloading
then rather than connecting to a database your app would connect to a url using httpconnection and downloading the location data

12939520
src	attr
since you are using jquery to change the image s src attribute you can do this through the attr method

12939579
portrait	landscape
one thing i m finding that s fairly consistently annoying is that one of my views shifts up by about 50 pixels or so everytime i rotate between my landscape and portrait mode

12939585
udp	tcp
the problem i see with how they are doing it though is that this only accounts for tcp usage and does not account for and udp usage

12939591
min	max
now i want to subtract the single value from first value of the list and then subtract consecutive members of the list from each other-- and in the resulting set of difference values i want to obtain the min max values.

12939591
min	max
and from the resulting list i want the min max values.

12939599
express	node.js
i am developing an application with node.js express couchdb and using nano to communicate with couch

12939624
queue	fifo
if you re not afraid of the time taken you can just use a deque as a fifo queue but that depends what your real-time requirements are

12939626
folder	directory
to answer the second part of your question of getting the leaf folder count just modify the where object clause to add a non-recursive search of each directory getting only those that return a count of 0

12939651
for-loop	loops
so i would recommend using a for-loop to loops through each of the .txt files in the directory and then use findstr to search for the intended string

12939680
xdebug	xhprof
to get more detailed information on the run time of your code including which functions are taking a long time and how often they are called you should look into the xdebug and xhprof extensions

12939776
daemon	cron	stdout	stderr
i would like to know if i could make cron.d execute a cron command so that whatever comes on stdout or stderr is redirected to a daemon process running on the same machine waiting for an input

12939776
stdout	stderr
in this case it would be the output at stdout or stderr

12939820
fflush	gets
if memory gets tight these caches will probably get fflush and the freed memory becomes available to your application

12939820
nsbitmapimagerep	nsimage
you create an nsimage which consists of nsimagereps one of which is very likely an nsbitmapimagerep then get its tiffrepresentation re-encode all that data to tiff possibly compressing it again then create an nsbitmapimagerep from that decompressing and decoding the tiff again and then getting its bitmapdata

12941347
calloc	malloc
c difference between malloc and calloc

it just depends if you want to look at the location position as a bounding box x0 y0 by x1 y1 or instead by a location and size x y width height
