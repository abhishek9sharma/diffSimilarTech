pop-up	dialog
so lets begin.firstly i would like to say that i have implemented the vlcj in a swing-based application in windows but that should not make you sad because for an immediate pop-up player that you mention we could just make a dialog and place the video-surface in its contentpane

15843453
x86	64bit	folder	directory
1 so the first thing that should be done is to download vlc media player we will need the 32 bit version that plays in both 32bit or 64bit computer environments .i had a terrible month trying to configure why my app wasnt loading the required libraries succesfully and found out that when you run a jar exetutable file it runs on 32-bit jvm in eclipse was running in 64bit jvm and everything was ok.thats why we need 32bit version while i had 64bit native libraries to load from.anyways if you download and install 32bit vlc media player make somewhere a folder to include your project lets say c myproject inside myproject create another folder and call it for instance needed here we will place all the required libraries for vlcj in order to work properly .now from the contents of c program files x86 videolan vlc copy the plugins directory and the 4 dlls

15843453
jwindow	jdialog
so what i do is to make a thread for swing-based apps because you cannot play media if your media canvas is not displayable and everything in the constructor is fully built when its code is done.that means that before making the player we should first create a delay mine is 2 seconds for our constructor to end his job and our jframe or jwindow or jdialog etc to become displayable.next i calculate my path dynamically taking the path of my runnable jar attention not from workspace inside eclipse and entering the needed folder to implement the required native libraries.inside the if statement i tell the system to look for the libvlc.dll in the specific path i calculated and then load it and thus make one step forward to play media files.outside if-else statement i actually create my player and place the canvas for its videosurface canvas is a canvas java.awt object i use windowscanvas because i work only in windows you could find for linux or mac a similar canvas dont worry about that

on windows 7 this is the c programdata folder by default. your application should create a directory beneath there and store the counter information in a file in that location instead

cpython	pypy
for example with 64-bit cpython 2.7.2 list and generator are always neck-and-neck while iterator gradually climbs from 1.0x to 1.4x as the lists grow but in pypy 1.9.0 iterator is always fastest with generator and list starting off 2.1x and 1.9x slower but closing to 1.2x as the lists grow

15844134
cpython	pypy
so if you decided against iterator because it s slow you might be trading a large slowdown on pypy for a much smaller speedup on cpython

multiplying	add
you now need to scale and center them based on your screen resolution and camera zoom factor and aspect ratio for instance you might want to multiplying by zoom and add screen_center to both your x and y components beware most graphics rendering systems have the y direction pointing down so you might need to swap signs for the y component

15845337
multiplying	transpose
that just means that you need to multiplying all your 3d coordinates by the transpose of the camera rotation matrix

i think the best way would be to have parentclass implement comparable and implement comparator so that it can handle subclasses in the desired way for instance if it s a childclass pay attention to the date attribute

15845751

you also need to specify the leading edge left and probably the width and height too maybe not because a button sometimes has an intrinsic size

thirdly your javascript call within the onclick events use single quotes both for the attribute value definition surrounding the js call and for the string parameter the id to show hide .

15845960

15845978
getter	setter
for your specific situation its faster just to have a public variable all getter and setter are turned into functions at compile time

15845978
getter	setter
unlike java which if you have getter setter functions they must be called as functions

15845978
getter	setter
if at some point you want to change your public variable to a getter setter the code base doesn t have to change but it must still be recompiled this means if you are developing a library and you want to hot swap the dll and you change a public variable to a getter setter it will break the target program

15845989

i would suggest you to move your project eclipse.exe and re install sdk folder along with eclipse and sdk to a new directory and since the old one will always reference back to the paths that might contain errors

for-loop	arrays
there is nothing wrong with your for-loop a 2d arrays in java is a 1d arrays of 1d arrays

15846039

your for-loop puts them together into an arrays of arrays so the result is a 2d arrays

15846041
uiview	calayer
the money-back guaranteed reinforced-concrete-solid way to force a view to draw synchronously before returning to the calling code is to configure the calayer s interactions with your uiview subclass

15846041
uiview	calayer
this is possible because calayer s expose more drawing functionality than uiview s doâ layers are lower-level than views and designed explicitly for the purpose of highly-configurable drawing within the layout and like many things in cocoa are designed to be used flexibly as a parent class or as a delegator or as a bridge to other drawing systems or just on their own

15846423
button	checkbox
these button and the checkbox are shown only when the mouse pointer is positioned over the image

15846423
button	checkbox
the static css stype as with the button and the checkbox is unrelated

15846423
button	checkbox
the css classes show-image with the given tag the-buttons with the given button and the checkbox are interacting with the jquery code that gives this effect

15846423
button	checkbox
the two other button displayed on the image should however have that effect when the checkbox is unchecked again it should have that effect as it is meant

avr	microcontroller
i would say this could be handled easily by just assuming that unsigned int is good enough but on 8-bit avr microcontroller int is defined as 16-bit but the memory data bus width is only 8 bit so 2 memory load operations would be required

15847617
16-bit	64bit

boost	allocator
the pattern described in the wiki and especially in the source article has a very different objective from what the boost pool allocator try to accomplish

15848117

you re on the right track the problem is indeed that you don t override gethashcode while you override equals

15849798
equals	gethashcode
the problem is not that hashcodes can have collisions but that if two elements that should be considered equals are actually never compared using equals if their hashcode returned by gethashcode is different

15849798
equals	gethashcode
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value.however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values

addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition
bodmas or bomdsa are exactly the same since multiplication division and addition subtraction are at the same level of precedence in facts they should be written more correctly as b o dm as with whatever order you prefer inside the various groups

15850276
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition
these mnemonics may be misleading when written this way especially if the user is not aware that multiplication and division are of equal precedence as are addition and subtraction

15850276
subtraction	multiplication	division	multiplication	division	subtraction
in other words what you are missing is that normally both when doing math manually and in any sane programming language the operators are actually grouped by classes of precedence where multiplication and division have the same precedence as well as sum and subtraction

15850276
int	double	subtraction	addition	division	subtraction	division	addition
although for math on reals this is not really relevant unless talking about division addition and subtraction are associative if you consider subtraction as addition of the opposite in programming it is double important since math on fp numbers and on int is often not associative

15850276
associativity	operator-precedence
also programming languages provide many more operators not associativity commutative with different associativity and not so well established precedence rules so it s normal that they specify their rules for operator-precedence in a more refined way

15850276
associativity	operator-precedence
see for example the operator-precedence and associativity table of java it s way more complicated than the simple bodmas rule which is inadequate to correctly express it since there are many classes more operators in each class classes with different associativity ...

inherited	subclassing
in addition to objectspace a smart hook method you can define is inherited which ruby will invoke every time its class is subclassing

15852653
getter	setter
as calls are described as just proxies to the real thing on the server you need a fake model object like a entityproxy or valueproxy to ensure that the only calls that can be made are getter and setter - and that sometimes setter are not allows when an object has been read from the server but before it has been edited

15852653
getter	setter
however if the model holds sub-objects then this is more difficult - the only way possible is to leave out those getter and setter

jobs	cron
i am using the whenever gem to configure my crontab and schedule cron jobs

15852658
width	height
by scaling doesn t work i mean when i zoom in too much it stops increasing width while still increasing height and content so it adds line-breaks and everything looks completely wrong

width	height
the only way out so far is setting position to absolute and setting top left width and height parameters manually in cm

15852661
getter	setter
i wish to use with private inheritable properties and also some getter and setter in there

15852661
getter	setter	inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing

getter	setter	inherited	properties
if you wanted to inherited from the person class and modify the getter and setter you d have to get the properties descriptor modify it and redefine the properties

15852848
getter	setter
and it doesn t support accessing the super getter setter

15852848
getter	setter
then you can simply define your getter and setter in the prototype like this

15852848
getter	setter
this will let you access the super getter setter when using inheritance

15852848
getter	setter
there is a cutting edge feature that would let you have both true privates and inherit getter and setter weakmap

int	double
this code however does not compile it displays invalid conversion from int to double in else section

15852866

xmltype	clob
also you can use getxmltype instead of getxml at the end to save you getting a clob and then having to xmltype in the insert

15853091

what you probably want is the fake scrolling approach where two background images are moved and switching position after one completely left the screens

15853929
implements	extends
above 2 points basically sets up a freamork for implementation you can extends this to implements other aspects also like if multiple requests more than 2 comes up then to queue then up sequentially you can use fairnes lock also if you want to ad any additional delay between multiple requests then that can also be done

15853962
width	height
the issue on this line is you are not giving width or height

15854003

width	height
the method outlined in the link requires you to provide a target width and height in pixels for the sub-sampling to work

15856796
width	height
for my list view this is fine because the thumbnail width height are defined as dimension resources and are easily converted to pixels

the target imageview is within a relativelayout with a fixed height set in the resources area and the width set to fill_parent

15857144
int	boolean
now you can simplify by replacing the array of int with an array of boolean but that should be self evident

15857173
for-loop	loops
yet when i call the addvenue method in the for-loop i can only pass it string result from the parameters of loops and can t figure out how to pass it a second argument which should also come from the json parsed by getresultsfromjson so i ve used hello world as a placeholder for now

listview losing gridview display when applying itemcontainerstyle

15858008
vmware	virtualbox
after aquiring a copy of virtualbox or vmware either is great personally i prefer virtualbox because the display settings are more customizable

15858008
vmware	virtualbox
virtualbox allows setup on initial setup while vmware requires an extra step to ensure compatibility

15858008
vmware	virtualbox
i will not condone anyone for where their source of software is but do keep in mind setting up a vm with vmware or virtualbox and an install dvd is only legal if you personally own the install dvd you created the install image from yourself

for-loop	arrays
i created an arrays of player objects in team.java and used a simple for-loop to search through my arrays

15858074
portrait	landscape
i hope your landscape and portrait mode has the same layout

15858074
onresume	onpause
to add more to this i would suggest you to look at the onpause and onresume methods and if you are playing with fragments then have a watch on onsaveinstancestate and onretaininstancestate rather than applying the xml changes as activity is destroyed by design

15858087
folder	directory
i could just have the filename i.e 3346642.4565676.jpg and let php or the query figure out the relative path from the image folder or i could have the file directory and the file extension separately in the tableâ

disabled elements do not get submitted with the form you must remove disabled atrribute before post back

15858136
clang	llvm
other uses which have been left in the dark with recent llvm clang improvements were to define private methods

15858136
public	protected
the key part to take from all this is that anything within interface within the header file except instance variables defined there via private or protected are public and anything within the implementation file is inherently private

15858141
floating-point	integer
the standard dictates that this specific literal operator form is reserved for integer and floating-point types

15858156
setinterval	settimeout
when at all possible avoid sending strings to settimeout setinterval --use an anonymous function instead

15858157
width	height
because if you do that then if you tell opengl to draw a square it will appear as a rectangle on the screen instead if you don t have your x axis edges be larger than your y axis edges when your screen width is wider than your screen height as suggested by the image

i recently upgrade to mvc 4 but one thing i am debating is it worth it to migrate to razor engine

15858389
post	get
meaning if you just use html.beginform it will post with the same url values that you sent to the get request

15858391
int	chars
it turns int to chars

15858393
floating-point	integer
this is a bit cumbersome and if forgotten once it could produce problems there is code that reacts differently to floating-point integer string .

15858444
int	double
i just read that ieee754 floating point can represent int up to 2 24 exactly and double up to 2 53

15858444
int	double
according to this question 2 53 +1 9 007 199 254 740 993 is the first int that cannot be represented exactly by double and hence float

15858444
int	double
shouldn t rounding have caused the left-hand side not representable by double or float to round to a value that wouldn t match the right-hand side an exact int

google-chrome	firefox
the next fastest loop manages 100k in firefox 6k in ie10 and barely 2k in google-chrome

15858471
setinterval	settimeout
you might want to look into jquery which provides a nice convenient frame work for xhr but i think you can fix your memory problem by moving your call to settimeout to an outer scope changing it to setinterval and only calling it once

15858481
int	double
i think it has something to do with whether the generic type e is static like int or double or if it is a reference type like string or other classes

15858493
google-chrome	firefox
only tested in google-chrome and firefox so no idea how it works in ie not important in my case but for me this works flawlessly

for-loop	arrays
you re assigning the index of in the arrays over and over every time the inner for-loop runs

post	get
you can convert your post request link to a get request link instead be removing the ssjs event and creating a basic link instead

15858909
innodb	myisam
something like this may work this is untested purely pieced together from research and you will have to use innodb as the storage engine because myisam does not support transactions

15858954

uiview	calayer
to use custom calayer classes in uiview you override the layerclass method to return the class of calayer you want the view to use

15859296
cashapelayer	calayer
layers can be nested and or stacked within a view so you could for example stack a catextlayer over a cashapelayer on top of a calayer whose contents have been set to your png image within one view

15859352
matplotlib	scipy
it was a huge rush the first time i got numpy scipy and matplotlib up and running in less than a minute

i want to allow both get and post on this route but whatever i try it only allows the #index action and doesn t access the #create action when a post is requested

15859626
folder	directory
you can also give relative or full paths if you wish or probably tell vs to use the folder with your images as the working directory

15859628
macports	homebrew
that s why there are package managers like macports and homebrew

15859628
macports	homebrew
each with their on philosophy macports tries to separate it a little more from the os than homebrew does the latter shares more os libaries

15859724
des	aes
the app has a set of basic algorithms such as sha-1 sha-256 md5 des aes and so on

15859727
integer	unsigned
to treat pointer values as integers use uintptr_t an unsigned integer type that can safely store a pointer regardless of the platform capacity

15859729
getter	setter
each of those fields would typically then have an associated getter and setter method

15859729
inherited	properties
so the on-disk representation of each component is essentially a nested array each layer in the hierarchy stores all the properties it inherited from its parent class in the first element of the array then stores all the properties that it defines in additional array elements

15859729
inherited	properties
this process provides an easy way to maintain component state across requests -- each layer of inherited need only concern itself with the new properties that layer defines -- but these state maintenance methods are easy to forget to implement

15859774
put	get
finally i put the value inside the user-extensions.js and use storeeval to get the value back

15859973
thin	unicorn
although once unicorn-rails is installed unicorn should be the default app server so you could also just run rails server and it should use unicorn assuming you don t also have thin or mongrel in your gemfile in which case they may conflict and you might want to remove the ones you re not using

15860000
gridview	rowdatabound
one thing to be aware of when applying custom settings for controls in the rowdatabound event is that if the page does a postback unless you rebind the gridview the custom settings will be lost

15860000
gridview	rowdatabound
possible work arounds would be to either ensure that you always rebind the gridview on every postback or alternatively apply the enabled readonly setting in the prerender event iterating through the datarows but you would also then need to store ship_trail_status somewhere hidden field during rowdatabound so that you could get access to it in prerender - the viewstate would ensure that the value stored would remain static during postback s

getter	setter
you don t need reflection you need to define setter and getter methods in your superclass

15860225
superclass	subclassing
thats why you can not access those superclass fields if you have redefined field in subclassing

15860225
getter	setter
if you want to access those you should provide getter setter in superclass

15860231
portrait	landscape
i use accelerometer in my application but on several devices senor axes is different depends on default device orientation is portrait or landscape

15860253

15860488
post	get
this works only with get requests so it might not be suitable for your case from what i can see you are attempting to send a post request

15860489

15860682
inherited	properties
this can cause problems when two instances of the an objects have the same properties but the inherited equals will return false because it uses the memory location which is different for the two instances

15860686
free	malloc
resolved looking further into the details of the function pathtontpath in io_util_md.c i can see that filetontpath will only return null in the case of an out-of-memory error so i guess we don t care if we neglect to free something we malloc ed when the jvm is about to crash

15860697

15860917
onresume	onpause
i d suggest to use onresume onpause unless you know you need it other way

15860947

what you are trying probably does not work because implementing cloneable does not force the implementor to override the protected object.clone with a public one

15861862
postorder	inorder
itâ s possible we have different form of tree for each pre-order postorder and and inorder

musically educated people hate abc notation but apparently it is ideal for forums just as tex for math fomulas via mathjax

15861969
tex	lilypond
lilypond is very advanced in its integration tex html and platform support windows linux mac

you won t get the height or width of the view which hasn t been drawn on the screen

15862339

i get this error a lot such as if i put brackets or around userin1|userin2

15862374

15862986
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
first of all i presume you are not using a uitabviewcontroller since it cannot be pushed into a uinavigationcontroller stack so i think you are using a standalone uitabbar embedded in a uiviewcontroller

15863016

until then i can only guess that you are probably parsing an rss 2 feed that does not contain elements but just elements

15863052

int	chars
as per the following link - sets in c++ s stl are typically implemented as binary search trees i am able to gauge the behavior of the data type in cases such as sets of int or chars or floats or strings for that matter as in these cases it is easy to see the bst ordering being imposed on set elements but considering the binary search tree data structure implementation of sets i am not able to visualize how are the following data types implemented using binary search trees

15864444

also wouldn t happen if you rewrote your loops as an infinite for-loop with a break in the middle

15889987
equals	gethashcode
argument in favour of distincta obviously the constraint on t is not required because does not require it and because instances of any t are guaranteed to be convertible to system.object which provides the same functionality as namely the two methods equals and gethashcode

15889987
equals	gethashcode
argument in favour of distinctb the generic parameter constraint while not strictly necessary makes visible to callers that the method will compare instances of t and is therefore a signal that equals and gethashcode should work correctly for t

15889987
equals	gethashcode
after all defining a new type without explicitly implementing equals and gethashcode happens very easily so the constraint might help catch some errors early.

15890029
eurekalog	madexcept
i am aware that i m reinventing the wheel because the folks over at madexcept eurekalog jcldebug have already done this but i d like to know how it s done

15890044
int	chars
no is any int value and it is equal to the number of chars you want to read in this case 7

bash	subshell

15890309
jobs	cron
a method without cron jobs

15890313
uilabel	nsstring
plantscreen implies a variable containing uiscreen and plantname implies an nsstring more than it implies a uilabel

15890319
comparator	comparable
call that method without supplying a comparator to sort by the natural order if it s comparable

15890319
comparator	comparable
you should have the class implement comparable and provide a comparator method if the class has a natural ordering as indicated in the comparable javadocs

15890319
int	double
an example would be for int and double which certainly have a natural mathematical ordering

15890319
comparator	comparable
you should create a class that implements comparator when you cannot make the class of the object to sort comparable or when you want to present an ordering that is an alternative to the natural ordering or when you want to impose an order when there is no natural ordering

15890330
subshell	ifs

for-loop	arrays
when i run the print_r of the arrays it s as if the for-loop is only running once when it should be running multiple times

15890736
getter	setter
so i thought i d solve that by adding a getter and setter for the user part like this

15890773
ubuntu	debian
they advise that when running your app locally you should disable the usual postgres setup used in debian ubuntu and run the server locally to avoid permissions issues

15890773
ubuntu	debian
i can t find a simple explanation of how the debian ubuntu standard setup is supposed to work or how you re supposed to use it and my experiments have all ended with something demanding my password and usually warning me that it s then going to write it to disk as plaintext

15890813
folder	directory
i would like to redirect the user to the blog directory everytime he visits any folder any file in my application except except if he is already in that blog directory

15890816
eurekalog	madexcept
third-party exception loggers like madexcept eurekalog etc handle those details for you by hooking into key functions and core exception handlers inside of the rtl itself

15890818
google-chrome	firefox
direct links of the images work fine on both google-chrome and firefox but your img src links seem to be broken

15890818
google-chrome	firefox
apparently firefox doesn t block non-ssl content on ssl pages by default but google-chrome does

15890841
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
in firefox google-chrome opera is code ok

15890856
folder	directory
let s say i m using a batch file and want it to direct to a folder located in the same directory of the batch

15890877
ggplot2	aesthetics
i am trying to find the list of aesthetics and geoms in the ggplot2 package for r and the problem that help qplot does not yield any results

15890894
bash	zsh
for something more robust perhaps look into the source code for popular shells like bash or zsh

15890894
fgetc	getline
fgetc would be interrupted and errno would be eintr so you could add a check for this in getline

15890936
getter	setter
once you get the results you can access the fields with the normal getter and setter

15890957
ggplot2	aesthetics
ggplot2 has an unexported character vector .all_aesthetics which contains all the possible aesthetics

15891054
width	height
once the element is hidden its height and width are zero

15891054
hide	fadeout
note fadeout will use hide at the end of its animation so it doesn t really help here

15891195
google-chrome	firefox
i want to use cucumber capybara to test my app on the vm after each deployment - after all this is a different os and i want to leverage the power of my test suite to test different browsers firefox google-chrome and ie against the deployed site

15891302
put	get
currently the php forms get put into a html email template and sent when the submit button is pressed

15891332
put	get
i ve tried to write the add method but when i try to .put it into the database i get an error message put java.lang.string java.util.set in java.util.map cannot be applied to java.lang.integer studentdatabase.student

15891348
int	chars
when i create a simple file with 2 columns int and varchar and then put a chars value in the int column and run a test package that redirects rows from the flat file source object nopn int columns are redirected

15891368
gridview	sqldatasource
the error message is telling you that a column called id is not present in the results set returned by the select query in the sqldatasource assigned to the gridview

15891368
gridview	sqldatasource
or alternatively assign the datakeynames as the name of the primary key column from your results set returned by the sqldatasource assigned to the gridview

15891423
jar	war
...for each and every jar file in my war s web-inf lib directory

15891430
put	get
the only way to get what you want is to put these classes in a separate class library project

15891517
width	height
take the values jcrop gives your for your crop x y width and height and multiply them by your scale ratio

15891527
int	chars
converting an int to a chars will likely not do what you want anyway

15891531
getter	setter
you shouldn d be naming methods get and set - not even getname and setname because if i remember my c# readings right the clr does that by convention when translating properties into cil code the getter becomes a get method and the setter becomes a set method

15891541
versioning	upgrade
clamp the msi package versioning number product code and upgrade code

15891599
min	max
i thought this was an interesting problem the only solution i have is a mess of nvl min and max and it seems like there should be a neater way

15891641
redhat	fedora
if you are in a rpm system fedora or redhat use

15891658
width	height
so as i resize the window width height or both the canvas element gets increasingly taller

15891658
width	height
i run a similar line only replacing height with width and the problem doesn t happen on that axis

15891659
portrait	landscape
my app runs in landscape mode so my main layout is inside land-layout only apparently the first logcat is when i have only the landscape the second one is when i have it inside the portrait layout

15891659
portrait	landscape
ok so the first logcat was given to me when i had the layout only in landscape transferring it to portrait solved the first logcat

15891666
hide	show
you can either use layers to hide things you don t want showing or i guess you could also call on blocks you don t want show

15891709
width	height
remove the width and height values give the style this way

15891787
required	placeholder
i am using swfupload on a site to facilitate file uploads obviously however it required placing a placeholder using a span or something of the likes

15891855
hash	md5
usually applications use an md5 hash of the file contents for revision markers for example ant build script yeoman drupal

15891981
width	height
you give it a lower z-index then the span you set its height to 100 of the span s height set left to 0 and a width equal to the width of the container

15891999
google-chrome	firefox
i executed this on modern firefox and google-chrome

15892048
proj	tilemill
i then created a new proj in tilemill and added the particular .shp files i wanted as layers to the new proj

15892055
client-side	server-side
or at least i can t get it to work on the server-side it does not fire but it works great client-side through javascript

15892075
versioning	upgrade
i will likely threat such browsers as no javascript enabled browser display them a pure text versioning of the website or a warning message to upgrade their browser

15892134
portrait	landscape
of course you may just end up removing the seam that corresponds to the smallest dimension in your image a vertical seam for a landscape image or horizontal seam for a portrait since it will more likely have low energy

15892273
int	chars
it then complains at a that it can t match expected type int with actual type chars

15892285
post	get
this post may help how do you get rspec to output what it encountered rather than it didn #39

15892296
hide	show
i am trying to show and hide divs with select tag

15892400
int	chars
nume a is an error because nume is defined as nume int so it must be followed by an int not a chars

15892401
folder	directory
if you want to stash the file in some constant directory ask an nsfilemanager for the caches folder in the user domain library caches then tell it to create a folder inside that folder whose name is your main bundle s bundleidentifier then write the file in that directory

15892406
post	get
use post or get instead request first of all

15892483
post	get
you must treat an ajax request as you treat a get request or post request

15892484
width	height
now you have to make sure you re actually drawing the whole screen in your spritebatch coordinates base them on your width height

15892504
slony	bucardo
one thing you might be able to do is to use something like slony or bucardo to replicate and then triggers to move data into secondary child partitions and replicate those onto a consolidated server for comparison

15892526
switching	screens
i was thinking of using a tabcontrol hide the headers and programaticaly switching from the first screens to the second one once the user has clicked on a next button then to the third screens once files have been dropped on the window.

15892530
awt	swing
i personally would just skip using awt and move to swing which provides better built in functionality for this type of thing

15892531
lodash	underscore.js
normally underscore.js lodash methods follow this pattern

15892531
lodash	underscore.js
keep in mind when using lodash chaining is automatic w o .chain though .chain is supported in the lodash underscore.js compat builds

15892569
next	except
they all work nicely except the images are cut off and display to next page pictures are split to display in 2 columns

15892604
width	height
i believe you should be able to simply use scalex and scaley properties instead of attempting to multiple the height and width values

15892624
bash	zsh
i think that using an asterisk in zsh is somewhat different with bash

15892676
carrierwave	fog

15892730
portrait	landscape
portrait can also be landscape

15892742
tinyint	boolean	int	boolean
this happens with activerecord and mysql which considers a tinyint 1 an 8-bit int to be a a boolean value because mysql didn t have any boolean type prior to 5.0 it has bit now

15892747
avcapturesession	avassetwriter
because you re asking for the use an avassetwriter as an output for an avcapturesession isn t possible

15892747
avcapturesession	avassetwriter
and an avassetwriter is not an avcaptureoutput subclass so there is no way to use it directly from an avcapturesession

15892747
avassetwriter	avassetreader
if you want to use an avassetwriter you ll have to write the data out using an avcapturefileoutput instance and then read it back with an avassetreader modify your data somehow and then output it via an avassetwriter

15892819
getter	setter
but since your getter are in the same scope the constructor card as the variables they have access to them like the getter and setter of classical oop

directory class does not provide a means to skip over inaccessible files and folder

15901096
folder	directory
you can write your own directory scanning method that will recursively go into each folder and skip it if exception occurs

15901168
put	get
if i put the call to load the map in my update function i get the map flickering in the canvas

15901259

15901426
versioning	upgrade
it went extremely well for me both for versioning 4 - 6 upgrade and versioning 6 - 7 upgrade

15901452
integer	unsigned
did you use an unsigned byte for storage rather than a signed datatype or an integer

15901460
try-catch	exception-handling
you don t even have to use a try-catch block because imageicon does not throw any declared exception-handling

15901569
folder	directory
simply include the file by dragging it to your project folder and in its options tell it to copy to the build directory

15901577
portrait	landscape
using them allows you to use different css rules depending on the screen resolution the width of the viewport or even the orientation landscape or portrait of the screen

15901602
hide	show
use jquery to hide and show it

15901632
cvs	rcs
previous version control systems like cvs rcs sccs etc. handled the version-number-on-each-file by adding a counter for each branch merge

15901644
put	get	post	get	post	put
i can perfectly do a post in my requests using httppost and even attach a json string to it.however if i have a custom http verb android does not support it directly via existing api s though i could do that in ios using setrequestmethod.i did come across httpurlconnection class that lets me set the request method however it limits me to post get delete put and throws up an error if any other http verb is used

15901673
width	height
for example you could sub-class uibutton have an initwithdictionary method that parses the json collection per button - and because you say you have great control over the web service you could also combine the size and origin fields into a string representing the rect x y width height and inside your initwithdictionary field for the given frame key convert the string to a rect with cgrectfromstring

15901683
webclient	webrequest
i dont t want to use webrequest webclient and blah blah just looking for mvc related solution or something simpler

post	get
my problem is that when i try to pass the models through the controller i only get access to one of my models either post or comments

15901802
free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	malloc
if you work with data that doesn t need construction destruction and requires reallocations a large array of ints then i believe malloc free is a good choice as it gives you realloc which is way faster than new-memcpy-delete it is on my linux box but i guess this may be platform dependent

15901802
free	realloc
anyway i don t see why you shouldn t use both provided that you free your malloced memory and delete objects allocated with new if can take advantage of the speed boost sometimes a significant one if you re reallocing large arrays of pod that realloc can give you

15901804
swt	swing
on mac when i add a swt reference to a swing app the app .jar doesn t launch anymore

implements	extends
you can implements a category for this extends uitabbarcontroller like

15902361
range	max
this is joined against itself to get a range of integers you can easily expand this part to get a larger range of numbers depending on the max number of values in the serialised array

15902367
for-loop	loops
the roll in this case is used as a counter in the for-loop to break loops once the limit has been reached

15902413
serializable	deserialization
first of all may i suggest you to use a library for handling the json serializable deserialization

15902415

subtract	add
i would use the distance from the goal in each direction and add it if you move towards the goal and subtract if you move away

15902513
getter	setter
c++ does not support object getter and setter like that

15902538
getter	setter
you use a getter and setter to achieve better encapsulation and to make it possible to change the underlying implementation in easier way

15902538
getter	setter
you will have to write a getter and setter method

15902574
int	double
here i am trying to parse an int but write it into a double

15902647
client-side	server-side
i think phil s answer is the way to go - when you can mark an entire module or type it does not add too much noise and it also allows you to distinguish between server-side and client-side code in websharper

15902667
waitpid	fork
keep in mind that fork wait and waitpid translate quite thinly to the system calls with the same name so you should be familiar with man 2 fork man 2 wait and man 2 waitpid

15902757
getter	setter
if you have this foresight it might be best to provide getter and setter functions now

15902757
getter	setter
as an alternative naming scheme for your getter and setter it s quite common to simply have two overloaded functions - one for setting and one for getting - like so

15902812

15902865
width	height
adjust width height of iframe to fit with content in it

15902909
getter	setter

15903026
qcombobox	qcheckbox
i need to use combinations of qradiobutton and qcombobox in first window and qcheckbox and qcombobox in second window

15903069
yslow	pagespeed
and i would stick with last-modified alone if the changes to your resources can be detected using this criterion alone â etag is a more complicated thing to handle especially if you want to deal with it in your php script yourself and pagespeed yslow advise against this one too

15903090
super	self
you do not need to pass in self when calling the inherited __init__ method with super

15903142
client-side	server-side
a rule of thumb in websharper development is to separate server-side and client-side code so you can simply annotate the module class containing client-side code instead of every function member if you re targeting .net 4.5

15903168
inherited	properties
block all inherited and reset all properties as if no rules

15903762
width	height
to get around this specific case the user had to set the width and height to 0px

15904386
width	height
use you have to set android layout_width in linear layout equal to wrap_content not match_parent since match_parent is used when we want to equal the width height as the parent of the widget container and wrap_content as name suggest requires space only to write the caption of view container no extra space required

here s some info for windows users....if you check the boxes for show console when stdout stderr change you may find that the output tab does not show up even if stdout stderr change

15905301

if you dont want android to automatically scale your image size which will look ugly because you will lose quality you should have different icons for different screens sizes for example mdi - 32x32 hdpi 48x48 xhdpi 64x64

15905356
coldfusion	verity
coldfusion has a service called verity but it seems i have to first query all of the database and then index it--this sounds very costly

ember.js	backbone.js
at the moment the ones i think are worthy of attention are backbone.js ember.js knockout.js and angular.js in this particular order

15905434
ember.js	backbone.js
without keeping node in mind i think i d prefer ember.js + handlebars for templating or backbone.js + underscore for templating

15905445
children	parent
the first is to set an attached property on the parent groupbox and in the onpropertychanged callback loop over all the children and add a binding to a multibinding which is then hooked to the groupbox visibility property

15905445
children	parent
the problem with this approach is that you will have to specify the type s of the children you want to include in the multibinding because you need to find them to add them to the group that dictates the parent s state - findvisualchildren will need to be called with multiple generic types if you want to capture everything you d like it to...easily done though

15905449
post	get
reading the official documentation it says that it only supports post by default but couldn t find a way to implement get

15905461
children	parent
if you don t want to use a gem you could consider first getting your parent using something like where parent_id is null and then for each parent get its children and its children and so on using

15905553
post	get
in general you should consider what parts of your api should be available via get and which via post

15905553
post	get
the resources available via get should normally be described using nouns the actions like perhaps posting an answer to a quiz should rather be available via post or delete maybe described using a verb perhaps after a noun - name of the resource the action is taken on

15905605
min	max	range	max	range	min
by default it sets the bottom of the range to min values_you_are_mapping and the top to the max which if all your values are identical results in the width of the range being zero and the mapping v - max_v max_v - min_v blows up

15905612
post	get
i need to post any value to line.js and in line.js get this data to use it

15905652

15905658
post	get
i use supertest sinon modules to make get post requests to actions but due to undefined value of session.user value it doesn t authenticate and gets redirected to proper action

15905660

15911556
prepare	execute
haven t tested it just coming to my mind right now but it should set up pdo prepare a statement based on the conditions you seem to look for add the parameters in the execute method pre-filtered although there s far better filtering techniques and return all results associated with your query

15911556
post	get
it s a good starting point on pdo and of course get a nice tutorial on get post variable filtering or use a 3rd-party tool like html purifier for that matter

15911882
phong	shading
phong shading may achieve an even more realistic looking approximation but the difference in computation can be very big

15911882
phong	shading	quad	shading	quad	phong
phong shading on the other hand will perform lighting calculations for every pixel that makes up your quad shape which can get a lot of calculations pretty fast

15911882
phong	shading
what s missing in legacy opengl to perform fast phong shading are not any missing or otherwise discarded normals but a way to perform the mentioned per-pixel operations pretty fast

15911882
phong	shading
other than you were told the main problem in trying to perform phong shading using legacy opengl is not that any normals are discarded but that it wasn t designed to perform per-pixel lighting but only per-vertex lighting

15911962
int	chars
if you want to print an int8_t value as an int rather than as a chars you can explicitly convert it to int

15911962
int	chars
for c there s no particular reason to define an 8-bit extended int type when the chars types are available

15911962
int	chars
even putc the lowest-level chars output routine in standard c takes the chars to be printed as an int argument

15911962
int	chars
int8_t and uint8_t if they re defined will almost certainly be defined as chars types -- but chars types are just small int types

15911962
int	chars
i think the root of the problem is that there s something missing from the language very narrow int types that are not chars types

the idea is an activity creates an instance of this class and when i want to display the image i call the class s show method passing x and y coordinates along with width and height and a default image name to use if it can t load one from a server

15912518
union	distinct
also note that by default linq does union which will eliminate duplicates therefore there is no need for distinct which will likely improve performance

15912577
rss	feed
i ve done some rss feed programs before

15912577
rss	feed
12 mb is a lot but i hardly think that this has anything to do with the rss feed itself since most of the codes found online are written very good and if not i really doubt they would increase your memory to 12mb just by using a simple xml parser

15912599
hide	show
i am creating a calendar and need to be able to select to show hide div.event who s data-dates which may be string or array depending on number of days the event appears in by determining if any of the unix timestamp dates stored there are such that they fall between the unix timestamps which represent the start and end of the currently chosen month

this is only happening in ie in firefox google-chrome and safari it is only displaying the list-style specified whether it is a normal string of text or if it s a hyperlink

15912690
google-chrome	firefox
my guess you already had an element on the page with the id addentrydate and firefox doesn t recognise the new one as owning the id but google-chrome has chosen to give it priority

15912698
put	get
if you want this to run in the background and thus not get closed when the user navigates away you will need to put it into a service instead of an activity

15912707
min	max
select only the first element from each row and create a min heap and a max heap

15912725
post	get
we have some service running in backend which responds to these get and post request and take proper actions with data sent

15912759
submit	submission
you can can call the submit event of the second form during the submission of the first one

15912763
width	height
to explain the logic all it does is sets the width to 100 and checks if it s height is greater if it isn t then width 100 is fine

15912827
nhibernate	queryover
i have medium experience in nhibernate and mapping and little experience in queryover and icriteria

some method is not available in ie 9 so you can shim it or use simple for-loop to check if data arrays contains any value between start and end

15912866
many-to-many	many-to-one
in rdbms most of the people folllows the one-to-one many-to-one many-to-many relationship in datastore as it has no joins thing but still we can achieve our normalization using referenceproperty one-to-one relationship example

15912866
put	get
this where we all are interested in as in rdmbs we require one query for insert update delete and select just like rdbms datastore has put delete get dont get too excited because datastore put or get in terms of write read small operations read costs for datastore calls and thats where data modeling comes into action

however i don t see any way of using slcomposeviewcontroller to bring up my custom uiactivity s user interface

15913001
min	max
now let s say that in the function associated with the slide event i want to check if the current min and max values are different from the initial ones

15913001
min	max
i know i can access the current values with ui.values and i can get the initial min and max with the following code

convert mp3 to wav

15913185
knn	adaboost
i want to use the svm knn adaboost classifier on my data features

15913211
error-handling	exception-handling
what this means in practice is that if you throw an exception-handling and don t catch it yourself and you do so in a function that was directly called by express express can catch the exception-handling and call the error handler you ve installed assuming you ve configured some piece of error-handling middleware like app.use express.errorhandler

15913213
width	height
once i set the windowstate to maximized the height and width properties of the form remain unchanged as does the clientrectangle and clientsize property

15913217

i m taking the same assumptions + and are addition and multiplication with overflow ignored

15913234
min	max
in the code below i dictated an array of randomized numbers from which i have to have pull out the max the min and the average

15913234
range	minimum
the minimum value i have no idea why it s wrong it keeps saying it s zero and the average value stays anywhere from 10-19 which is impossible considering the range of randomized numbers goes from 1 to 1000

15913262
try-catch	exception-handling
perhaps put a try-catch around the body of the loop or the method that runs all your code add a logging framework of your choice log4net or nlog seem good and then in the catch log the exception-handling

15913279
children	parent
i m trying to find the operation result parameters such as new position parent new position order index of the element among all children of a given parent etc

15913327
versioning	upgrade
in that case you ll want to upgrade your dependencies via composer upgrade which should also upgrade your lock file and the versioning commit points therein

15913348
min	max
before you start looping create a min max and total

15913348
min	max
then when you are creating each element of the array also check whether it is less than the min or more than the max

15913348
min	max
you definitely shouldn t be iterating through the whole array each time you add an element and you shouldn t be resetting your min and max each time through the loop

15913447
rss	feed
so the best you have to do for seo means is to create and keep well-informed all the xml files sitemap feed rss atom include keywords taxonomy tags and metadata coherence at internal and external links keep a clean design output and a lot more parameters that needs a lot of space and time to analyze

instead of setting the method attribute to get set it to post

15913685
post	get
this will tell it to pass it as a post variable removing the restrictions the get gives you

15913685
post	get
as far as php is concerned it doesn t care if it was get or post aside from the fact that it needs to know which array to look in for the mapping

15913685
post	get
even then the _request associative array will look in both get and post arrays

15913726
post	put
it is important to also put a unique constraint on the slug column in the db because this algorithm is subject to a race condition if two post are created with the same title at a similar time

15913727
post	get
the only change here is the post parameter for the method attribute in place of get

15913736
post	get
clicking an a element will send a get request not a post

15913758

serializable	deserialization
try binary serializable deserialization

15913847
serializable	deserialization
as soon as you serializable an object with a reference that you already stored before serializable before then you could add a special tag and so you would be able to rebuild the reference to the same object during deserialization

15913856

if i put this code in declaration of a class i get this 1 second lag when i m starting an activity

15913857
getter	setter
i have a class record with three private integer fields getter and setter and a default and specific constructor

15913865
multiplying	add
you then use this by multiplying the number of y characters you want in on each line using but keep in mind that the for-loop starts counting from zero so you need to add + 1 to your i variable

15913898
turing	decidable
some languages are not decidable or even turing recognizable for the reason that there are uncountably many languages yet only countably many turing machines

15913906
sudo	passwd
you should probably handle the sudo passwd prompt + -t ssh option to get a tty and use p.expect eof before p.close to avoid killing the child process prematurely

15913947
qfile	qtextstream	qfile	qdatastream	qtextstream	qdatastream
you can use qfile and qtextstream qdatastream to create your own custom file

google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox but google-chrome seems to shrink the background gif xy by 1 pixel every 4 images

15914161
google-chrome	firefox
so my overlays don t line up in google-chrome but do in firefox

15914180
inherited	subclassing
you ll also need to change the private access modifier to protected in order for the field to be inherited by subclassing

15914229
put	get
firstly consider that local variables might not even get put in memory they might get stored in registers only or optimized away entirely

15914261
google-chrome	firefox
in an ideal situation i want the image to animate like it does in google-chrome but i want the text to slide into position like it does in firefox

15914287
audiotoolbox	avfoundation
i have used avfoundation before but my latest project require audiotoolbox i changed my code and now the audio playback is extremely low specially over the headphone jack regardless of the device volume

15914361
int	boolean
the whole idea behind all this is that unlike c languages java was created as an object oriented language from the beginning ok there are some minor aspects in java that are not really part of oo like the primitives boolean int etc

15914374
width	height
public void reshape glautodrawable drawable int x int y int width int height

15914382
restrict	shared
simple shared-memory does not work for me because the memory sent by a may be anywhere in its address space unless i restrict a to use a specific memory allocator that works on shared memory or temp files which i d like to avoid

15914443
audiotrack	audiorecord
currently i m recording with audiorecord and copy the data into an audiotrack where the visualizer is listening on

15914445
integer	unsigned
in c you can pretty much treat a signed integer as an unsigned integer of the same size although you may have to ignore warnings to do so in some cases

15914445
unsigned	short
what exactly that does depends on your platform but on a 2s-complement platform signed short -0x08fb is the bit-for-bit equivalent of unsigned 0xf705

15914472
namenode	hdfs
in your case if you have 3 nodes cluster +1 main namenode your source file size is 1 mb your replication size is 64mb and replication factor is 3 then you will have 3 copies of blocks in all 3 nodes consisting your 1mb file however from hdfs perspective you will still have only 1 file

15914482

15914502
awt	swing
right now the only way that you can have retina-capable programs that use swing or awt is to run java 6 on the client machine

15914502
swt	swing	awt	swing
it should also be noted that eclipse doesn t look blurry in java 7 because it uses swt rather than awt or swing

15914502
swt	swing	awt	swing
you could get the same effect if you run swt instead of swing or awt but you have to turn it into a cocoa app and modify the info.plist file for the app instructions here at the bottom

15914522
debian	linux
i used git 1.8.1.1 on debian linux

15914543

15914690
width	margin
if you know the width of your images and the number of images per row then you can set the width of your container and center it horizontally with margin 0 auto like in fiddle while floating the container of your images to avoid the whitespace 4px gap between each image due to inline-block

15914690
width	text-align
or you can center with text-align the container and set the width of the .sub like in this other fiddle

15914758
clang	llvm
i have been using clang for quite a while and i can use clang -fno-builtin -emit-llvm -c hello.c to prevent the generation of llvm built-in functions such as llvm.memset

15914842
public	protected
the default access modifier of class members is private in c# so if you do not write anything like private public protected or internal it s 100 like if you wrote private

15914850
serializable	deserialization
i think both languages support multiple ways of serializable deserialization you just need to find the one that are compatible to each other

15915068
viewswitcher	imageswitcher
i have tried to use imageswitcher viewswitcher and some other things but to no avail

15915085
implements	extends
one possible reason why this is often overlooked is that autoretryhttpclient implements httpclient interface instead of extends abstracthttpclient

15915124
nunit	mstest
i currently support mstest and nunit

15915154
width	margin
.clientwidth returns the inner width of the element i.e it does not include border margin or vertical scrollbar widths

15915255
for-loop	arrays
i have a for-loop that goes through the directory and will then create the arrays but it is not stored anywhere

if you are using bash sh then use or if you are using csh tcsh then use setenv variable value or if you are using some other shell then you will need to look that up

15915595
for-loop	loops
and here the sub you see that it is almost 1 1 except for the exit sub since no for-loop is there to exit but since the method contains all the code executed until end of loops therefore an exit sub here does the same as an continue for in previous version

15915601

the above works for the mouse events as well as keyboard focus events

15917189
listview	gridview
what zombiesheep explained was actually quite correct but that scenario happens only when you utilize the incremental loading of the gridview listview however in your particular case the scrollbar changes size because of the padding property of the gridview if you can set the right and left padding values padding 116 0 40 46 to zero or something less then you can see the difference there might be no need to place the gridview inside the scrollviewer

width	height
the height and width of div#toons2 is important it must match the exact height and width of one single sprite 40x40

15917212

15924695
min	max
if you want to get fancy you can implement a method on your custom object which compares two objects and then create a sort descriptor using that method or you could declare a read-only property returning for instance the max or min value of the nsset and then simply use a normal sort descriptor on that property

15924712
getter	setter
wrong you can use them in any uicomponent implementing valueholder note that this interface definies a getter and setter to get set the converter

cvs	svn
by working directly on the repo you might also mean something like svn cvs or other centralized version control systems in which you only have a local working copy not a copy of the complete repo

15924804
min	max
but you have to specify a collection operator that is applied to the set to choose an object for sorting max min or avg

the method needs 2 parameter name and pcode which have their own setter getter

15924805

ant	pom.xml
i use the ant targets called from my pom.xml btw

next	except
all good except how do i populate re-generate the pagination numbers when user selects 5 and then clicks on next button

i use breeze for querying in our spa and raw http methods for post put delete methods

15925179

other metrics based on the joint local angle swept out at the joints which can be derived from evaluating a path from an inverse kinematics solver may be acceptable - but i haven t tried this in practice

15925237
portrait	landscape
just fyi my whole application works only in portrait mode and only video plays in only landscape mode

15925265

15925311
post	get
this can also be customized for your doing with post and get requests

15925553
free	malloc
early preprocessed objective-c had a programmer knows best policy similar to c s malloc free system

15925568
apk	dex
to my understanding dex optimization is purely an install-time process and is not performed on any dex that is not part of an installed apk

15925568
apk	dex
and since a dex that is part of an apk cannot change without installing a new apk there is no need to regenerate an odex outside of the normal install process

15925581
post	get
but i usually have one get and then multiple post requests 1

15925581
put	get	post	get	post	put

the main reason of specifying width and height is to let the engine render the page faster

15925606
width	height
it contains a string with height yyy width xxx an can be used directly in an img tag

15925631
implements	extends
you can use clojure meta-data feature which allows meta data a map to be attached to any object that implements imeta interface which turns out to be every object as iobj extends imeta and every object extends iobj

15925639
sorting	filtering
ps i have a similar problem with sorting after filtering but i suspect that for the same reason

15925896
google-chrome	firefox
i wrote from 001 to 0010 and much more digit like this that started with 00 in google-chrome console and firefox even in ie and get this result

15925944
division	multiplication
first case first executes division and crops the last digits after 28th after decimal point since float or double or decimal or any other fixed-precision data type can t store the infinite long values then executes multiplication of the cropped value increasing the loss in 39 million times

15925944
division	multiplication
the second case first executes multiplication which don t loose precision and stores every 8 digits then executes division with less precision loose by 6 decimal points

15925949
octal	decimal
thus 10 interpreted as octal is equal to 8 in decimal

15925982
post	get
you need some form of event to call the function on link click be it a get post or an ajax query

15925989

15926002
post	get
not sure if this works works for my get and post variables

15926100
switching	screens
it seems like a good idea to keep the responsiblity of responding to keyevents within the objects instead this would for instance allow me to change the current screens and have the new screens behave differently without checking different global states like switching to a gamemenu

15926100
awt	swing
but i have no idea how to implement a keylistener for my custom objects it seems it must be a swing awt component

15926223
getter	setter
getter and setter are ommited

15926225
google-chrome	firefox
probably you tried firefox and google-chrome with the browser console open and ie without opening the browser console

dbcontext	objectcontext
whether it be objectcontext or dbcontext a call to savechanges method will tell entity framework to saves all changes made in this context to the underlying database.

15926462
client-side	server-side
when you say javascript file i am assuming you mean a client-side javascript file and not a server-side file in express

15926482
union	distinct
union works like select distinct on resultset obtained from both the tables

15926488

15926608
width	height
replacing width and height as required it will draw rectangles rather than single pixels - giving a thicker line but not very pretty i imagine

15926654
folder	directory
some older tutorials say to put the .jars in common lib--but i don t see that folder in my apache tomcat directory structure

15926721
getter	setter
the correct approach for that is to let the getter and setter delegate to uicomponent#getstatehelper

15926783
csv	tsv
the possible solutions for excel are to 1 either writing the fields with special double quotes like may 16 2011 as or 2 importing the csv tsv file with the external data wizard and then selecting manually which columns you want to read as text and not general which could convert fields to dates

15926807
children	parent
now when you issue a em.delete parent or session.delete parent the delete will be cascaded by the chain and children will be deleted too normally called orphans by default hibernate will not issue a delete statement on orphans so that s why is configured

15926847
filesystems	ntfs
looks like a really neat way of having a file identifier on ntfs filesystems renames content changes or moves doesn t affect it

15926890
knitr	latex
i used sweave2knitr since the file originally was created for sweave but the result was not better now all ã ã ã have been transformed to ãƒâ pãƒâ ãƒâ both in the r chunks and in the latex text and knitr still gives an error message

for each such value multiplying the accumulator by 5 then add the corresponding value

15929348
multiplying	add
instead of iterating once in forward and once in reverse direction it might be easier to not multiplying the accumulator by 5 but instead multiplying the value you add to that by a suitable power of 5

15929348
multiplying	add
in other words you maintain a factor which you initialize to 1 and multiplying by 5 every time you add a value

atomic nonatomic retain copy readonly readwrite assign strong getter method setter method unsafe_unretained

15929828
getter	setter
if the thread is performing getter method then other thread cannot perform setter method on that object

15929828
accessor	properties
you can use the nonatomic properties attribute to specify that synthesized accessor simply set or return a value directly with no guarantees about what happens if that same value is accessed simultaneously from different threads

15929828

there was a time when properties and synthesize would only generate the accessor methods for you and you had to take care of making sure storage was created for their use - declare a the ivar between the curly braces

15930064
getter	setter
because property defines attitude of variable as well its accessibility limit if you dont write property it will also work but if you want compiler to automatically create getter and setter method for variable then use property and synthesize it in .m file

15930064
getter	setter
brief to define setter getter method as well its accessibility

15930070
getter	setter
outside of the braces is where you declare properties which automatically generate a getter and setter for the object and any non-private methods you define in your implementation file

textblock	itemscontrol
i bind a list of strings to an itemscontrol of textblock

15930976
post	get
you can get an idea of how to implement this by reading this blog post i wrote

15931009
integer	unsigned
you can use strtol function it convert string to unsigned long integer for any base you want

15931023
mouseover	mouseout
im trying to change the color of the links in a div mouseover mouseout but it doesnt work.

15931043
for-loop	loops
the second set of for loops is only big o of n because the inner for-loop will run at most of 2000 times and that in the scope of things is very minor especially when n is huge

15931069
opera	firefox
it will set url in firefox or opera browsers url bar and navigates it

15931085
super	self
this enables you to add endless embellishments to existing methods and still call super actually self and reap the benefits of the original method s handiworkâ even without access to the original source

15931092
integer	fractions
your numbers represent the integer and fractions number of days that have passed since the origin date

15931093
inherited	properties
i can get the controller to select the correct version of the viewmodel and all the properties for the inherited class and base class show in the debugger

15931093
inherited	properties
when the viewmodel is passed to the view only the properties from the inherited class show up

15931129
int	chars	int	double
so this means i need to send count elements of type data chars double or int pointed at the address by buf

15931171
pull	push
why should it matter which method each of us use to push pull

15931172
getdate	dateadd
just do a simple insert into recordtable select reportname dateadd day datediff day 0 getdate 0 count from tabledataset

15931232
cpu	processors
as i have an arm926 cpu which is an armv5tej processors gcc ld will always set tag_thumb_isa_use thumb-1 as it just means that armv5tej is recognized as being thumb-1 capable

15931252
int	chars
when a subroutine of form foo char1 real1 real2 gets called where char1 has length 200 in both the calling subroutine and in foo i get forrtl severe 408 fort 18 dummy chars variable char1 has length 200 which is greater than actual variable length -858993460 image pc routine line source libifcoremdd.dll 02aed3fe unknown unknown unknown stack trace terminated abnormally i looked around and that number seems to be a hex address 0xcccccccc converted to an int

15931312
inherited	properties
what i would do is to use inherited for the classes + interfaces if there is an option for a combination of properties for example if you have a warriorking class

15931328
hash	salt
the great thing about bcrypt is that it is slow which means that it is relatively expensive to try and crack a bcrypt hash depending on iterations and randomness of salt

15931410
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i have a image scroller that s working finr in ie firefox opera but not google-chrome

15931413
cobertura	jenkins
i m trying to get coverage results from jenkins using the rest api and the cobertura plugin

15931421
scrypt	pbkdf2	pbkdf2	hash
if you just store a hash of the userâ s password using a strong password hashing scheme like bcrypt scrypt or pbkdf2 the hacker would need a lot of resources time or processing power to guess or brute-force passwords

15931477
put	get
as there are many images i have put an loop which would download all images which are stored in the database however when i run the script in the loop i get one big download and no separate images

15931496
dateadd	datepart
using datepart and dateadd

15931513
fadein	fadeout
however you can use one single form and fadein and fadeout different containers within in

hide	show
i use twitter bootstrap modals s js to show and hide a modal

15931886
hide	show
my problem is when show and hide modal multiple times the code in do something.

15931886
hide	show
using the way fco suggested below did solve the show problem but unfortunately the hide does not work still execute more than one times one thing different i hide the dialog using the markup not through js

15931923
int	chars
as a k and b j are both of the chars data type think of the string as an array of chars but you are trying to compare them to an int 0

15931961
folder	directory
i have a thread that needs to listen when ever user opening any directory folder in windows and it should return the absolute path of the same

15932060
bmp	png
you could use it to convert to pages to bmp in diferent formats tif jpg png and check the size of the bitmap

15932077
client-side	server-side
ddp is a standard way to solve the biggest problem facing client-side javascript developers querying a server-side database sending the results down to the client and then pushing changes to the client whenever anything changes in the database

i have started to program in c# few weeks ago for work and i am trying to extract some information from big bunches of data actually gathered by get post http requests

15932183
rspec	capybara
currently i m using rspec with shoulda and capybara to test my application

15932230
unix	aix
i need to create a zero byte file with arbitrary names on unix aix ksh

15932365
getter	setter
personally i will put method calls in the property setter occasionally to me thats the whole reason for having the ability to create setter and getter - otherwise there s very little point in having anything other than auto properties

15932384
rss	feed
i got this from eran kampf and a scott hanselman vid forgot the link so it s only slightly different from some other posts here but hopefully helpful and copy paste ready as an example rss feed

15932391
post	get
i can get only one post to show in the carousel the buttons do not show any other slide and it is driving me mad

15932466
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
in my example google-chrome takes about 3s to get to this point and safari takes 25s firefox is all over the place

15932487
put	get
however i can t get the addpiece method to put the pieces where i want them to go or even at all

15932514
cpu	processors
your assumption about each processors having its own memory sounds like an attempt to improve cpu cache usage ram remains the same regardless of how parallel your task is - unless you are distributing it on a cluster

15932526
maven	pom.xml
i am working on a java maven project in intellij idea but the pom.xml file has so many dependencies from the other programmers that i have a feeling the project is not using most of the dependencies

15932572
getter	setter
these include and dealloc methods but unfortunately not getter setter methods

15932577
post	get
i get the checkboxes to work correctly as well as a jquery function to automatically post the form when checking a checkbox

15932593
draggable	droppable
i have been experimenting with sortable draggable and droppable for quite a while now to no avail

15932598
int	double
this would be called for all int double and strings

15932675
put	get
given this information i put a try catch on just that statement to get past it since it is putting the attribute in anyways

15932675
put	get
it then will also get the exception on the bind method and bind did put the appropriate values userdn and password into the object as well

15932700
google-chrome	firefox
tested it in ie firefox and google-chrome and looks good.

15932737
uidatepicker	uipickerview
you ll probably want to use uidatepicker in one of its datepickermodes instead of a stock uipickerview

15932750
maven	pom.xml
when i use maven i go to the second level pom.xml folder and run mvn clean install

15932771
post	get
the pre link and post link functions get called in the expected order but not after the children of the elemenet with the s-center-content directive get rendered

15932804
stdout	fflush
i ve also tried to fflush stdout buffer without any success

15932815
hide	show
i ve created an invoke-msbuild powershell module to make building with msbuild a snap while providing lots of parameters for additional functionality returns if build succeeded or failed can show hide build window can wait not wait for build to finish can automatically show build log on failed builds etc.

15932868
fileinputstream	filechannel
a second much more important would be to use filechannel and the java.nio api instead of fileinputstream -- or at least wrap the fileinputstream in a bufferedinputstream to optimize the i o

15932879
post	get
if you are calling external restful services you will need to create http requests via post or get and handle the response returned by the requests appropriately

15932884
width	height
each having the same width and height regardless of the length of their content

15932918
jasmine	qunit
i m not sure anything specific to qunit has been written a lot revolves around jasmine but the content can be applied to any framework

15932928
textview	listactivity
a listactivity will automatically bind the +id android empty and +id android list views so the empty textview is only shown when the listview is empty

15932958
pop-up	dialog
the dialog pop-up when i click on the delete link button in my gridview

15932978
width	height
as the scroller is only enabled when the document s height width is bigger than the screen s width you can use this to check can it be scrolled

15932980
width	height
a cabinet consists of too many items and these depend mainly on width height depth + some additional characteristics around 5

15932987
width	height
assign width and height accordingly to your needs

15932993
post	get
then you judge if it s a post or get

15933003
csv	tsv
so a mapreduce job will not be able to make sense out of a xml file block since xml is structured unlike a simple csv or tsv files

15933100
multiplying	add	sse	avx2	sse	avx
i have learned that some intel amd cpus can do simultanous multiplying and add with sse avx flops per cycle for sandy-bridge and haswell sse2 avx avx2

15933146
for-loop	loops
for example i have list of listeners fixed size and i loops through this for-loop a million times a second

15933179
for-loop	loops
for example i have list of listeners fixed size and i loops through this for-loop a million times a second

15933181
post	get
you can get an idea of how to implement this by reading this blog post i wrote

15933248
mdpi	hdpi
this tool auto-scales for hdpi ldpi mdpi xhdpi etc

15933339
post	get
in the controller method configured to handle the post after performing the necessary processing i was trying to redirect to another controller method configured for a get

15933339
google-chrome	firefox
it worked in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

15933339
post	get
the issue was that forward uses the same request method scope ie post in this example so i had to remove the request method get specified on the second controller method for this to work

15933348
google-chrome	safari
it works with google-chrome and safari

15933353
post	get
this will allow to your script to make cross domain post get and options

15933388
box-sizing	border-box
i ve been running into an issue lately where i seem to get very inconsistent behavior with the box-sizing border-box tag in css

15933452
put	get
the class has just two functions to get and put items from the queue and one function to close the queue and avoid further access

15933452
put	get
this can happen no matter what the thread is doing if get or put items

15933462
salt	md5
once upon a time when i started programming i used md5 for hashing password than later found that md5 can be cracked easily and i should use salt to make it secure

15933462
hash	md5
another thing is to add a new field in database that store new hash values and if all the fields are filled than remove the md5 values from db .but thing in this way previous hash values are still visible

15933465
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested this feature out in google-chrome and it works perfectly but it doesn t work in firefox

15933483
glut	glew
i use this code for including glew and glut for cross-platform development

15933495
background-color	transparency
i want a li element of the list to be more transparency i want it to have background-color set to rgba 15 15 15 0.5

15933498
google-chrome	safari
i am having a lot of issues absolutely positioning a div called id verticalgenesis on the following website in a mobile browser including both safari and google-chrome on the iphone

15933505
do-while	break
break can only be used in switch loops for while do-while

15933521
put	get
it appears to get thrown any time my dbcontext class accesses unity - particularly in the onmodelcreating method we use ioc to put type configuration and other ef initialization code closer to the actual entity instead of sticking it all in the dbcontext class

15933532
hash	md5
everybody knows that you should be hashing their passwords using bcrypt but still a surprising number of developers uses insecure md5 or sha1 hash just look at the recent password leaks

15933532
hash	salt
this will create a password hash using the default algorithm currently bcrypt the default load factor currently 10 and an automatically generated salt

15933532
hash	salt
the used algorithm and salt will also be part of the resulting hash so you don t need to worry about them at all

15933532
hash	salt
remember the salt and algorithm are part of the hash so you don t need to provide them separately

15933571
int	chars
notice it says int not chars

15933658
for-loop	arrays
a better alternative - would be to use the length of the arrays in the for-loop as the bound

15933677
multiplying	add
the compiler is allowed to fuse a separated add and multiplying even though this changes the final result by making it more accurate

15933677
multiplying	add
an fma has only one rounding it effectively keeps infinite precision for the internal temporary multiplying result while an add + mul has two

15933694
int	chars
you are trying to convert a chars to int but a chars is an int value

15933750
getter	setter
being object oriented in your programming approach especially when using a good quality oop mvc framework like fuelphp prevents you from reinventing the wheel always dry by providing you access to ready made getter and setter

15933761
google-chrome	firefox
i tried putting the picture outside of the paragraph and deleting changing the span but all three major browsers firefox google-chrome and ie all space the text with a line-height close to 2.0

15933776
opencv	emgucv
you can use computer vision libraries like opencv or the emgucv c# wrapper or aforge.net

15933795
getter	setter
some getter and setter

15933798
free	malloc
recently i switched from system memory management malloc free to intel s tbb scalable allocator

15933800
rss	feed
the feedparser module is for parsing feed rss atom and rdf

15933802
width	height
since the sprite covers a certain area you might want to store not only its origin but also its height and width

15933866
box-sizing	border-box
i m not sure you understand what box-sizing border-box is supposed to do

15933866
box-sizing	border-box
for example adding padding to an element using the normal box model will add the padding to the outside of the element however using the same padding with box-sizing border-box will add the padding to the inside of the element which will preserve your original size

15933866
width	border-box
this is fine but adding padding to it without border-box will cause the total size of the divs to equal more than 33 33 width + 1em padding in this instance

15933866
width	border-box
using the border-box will instead put the padding on the inside of the element keeping each at it s 33 and ensuring that no matter how you space the elements they will stay at the width you originally told it to be

15933884
min	max
you can then use this tree to find you max and min values

15933887
spawn	execv
to get around this you have to spawn a new process for each execv you plan to run

15933890
oncreate	recreate
therefore the system is forced to recreate activity a calling oncreate even if the task stack is handled correctly

15933943
width	height
when i say fit i include changing the size of the fonts used and changing the width and perhaps height of divs imgs and other rendered elements as well as allowing fluid movements of elements

15933943
onresize	onload
these layout ways include using css em and sizes wrapping of text and elements and javascript run by the onload and onresize events

15933945
implements	extends
but there is interfaces extends that interface and objects implements them should not be contained in nodes

15933986
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
deploy a separate http server like apache lighttpd nginx specifically to deliver your static content and write your url s accordingly for example the host will be cdn.example.com

15934000
getter	setter
in the setter of the maximumimages the wpf framework is notified that currentimages has changed and in the currentimages getter i have a lot of clunky code that realizes that the maximumimages number is now higher than before and adds new items to currentimages all in the getter

15934005
button	checkbox
q i would like to create a button instead of checkbox which acts like checkbox and in case of checked or unchecked it sets corresponding color image on button

15934013
min	max	range	max	range	min
actually we can generalize it by doing an extra pass before 1st pass to find min a and max a and another extra pass to move each element in a to the range of min a and max a a 0 -min a

15934013
min	max
after 1st pass and 2nd pass note that we should mod the elements by max a -min a instead of n we could add min a to the duplicated number found at last

15934074
put	get
after a new entity is saved indexes are built asynchronously which result in the fact that get after put will always return the result strong consistency but query after put is not guaranteed to to return result immediately eventual consistency

15934074
put	get
the docs are a bit vague on this subject but it does mention that get after put forces the apply phase probably resulting in indexes being applied too see point 1

15934074
put	get
so put and then query is not guaranteed to give you the expected result but put get and query is at least that s how i read the docs

15934117
google-chrome	firefox
also for animations google-chrome chromium behaves much better that is why i use it for development but do my general browsing in firefox

15934142
octree	quadtree
octree or more likely a n dimensional version of the quadtree or octree principle i will use the term octree herein to denote the general data structure

15934147
express	node.js
i m currently playing around with node.js express and jade and can t figure out why it won t redirect when i use a jquery post

15934161
google-chrome	firefox
it works in browsers such as google-chrome but not firefox

15934170
put	get
i wanna get some result from multiple table and put it into a temporary table

15934209
folder	directory
i am trying to echo out all of the images in a folder directory with a couple of exceptions ignores

15934234
for-loop	arrays
the above is pretty much the same code but now my for-loop advances through an arrays

15934308
google-chrome	firefox
ok so i found a video which helped get it working in ie and firefox but it is still ugly in google-chrome

15934313
superclass	subclassing
my problem is two of the three subclassing have a common method that it s not present in the third so i don t know if is best to add this method in the superclass without implemetation it s a void method or implements it separately in both classes

15934382
stdout	stderr
means that stderr is redirected to stdout

15934413
onmousedown	onmouseup
i am using onmousedown and onmouseup events for the images

15934431
implements	extends
- can be extends or implements abstract class or interface

15934502
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
firefox isn t interpreting my background header image the way ie google-chrome or safari do

15934527
stdout	stderr
dev null is a black hole and it seems both the results sent to stdout standard out usually your screen and stderr standard error to the black hole

15934589
onmousedown	onmousemove
i see that in onmousedown and onmousemove

15934662
subtract	add
different instruction sets do different things with the carry out bit for subtract operations basically on the way into the adder a subtract means invert the second operand and invert the carry in then do a normal add on the way out though some processor families invert the carry out bit if the operation was a subtract some do not

15934662
subtract	addition	subtract	add
just like add then a series of addc operations to cascade an infinitely large addition you can use sub and sbb to cascade an infinitely large subtract

15934662
multiplying	addition
so if you break up your multiplying operands into digestible pieces and keep track of how much you need to shift each item which basically lands that item in a particular column using our infinitely wide addition we are already breaking things in to columns or groups of columns

15934662
multiplying	addition
if you want to multiplying two 64 bit numbers using 16 16 32 bit multiplying operations and 16 16 16+carry addition operations you can hardcode based on the above

15934662
subtract	add
implement this in a high level language first using basic operations add and subtract synthesize the carry bit

15934704
put	get
put this at the beginning of your php script so you can get some proper debug information

15934742
folder	directory
this is happening because your cgi script is running as a different user possibly apache or root so python won t use the the site-packages directory in your home folder

15934742
folder	directory
what you probably want to do here is add the site-packages directory in your home folder to the list of site directory that will be used by the entire system

15934770
client-side	server-side
you try to use a client-side runtime javascript variable index in a server-side resolved expression

15934781
int	boolean
the cast of the boolean to int results in 0 or 1

15934975
post	get
what i want to do is i want to get a specific get like design and scatter the post titles around that tag and draw a line from center to each of them.

15934975
post	get
get the tag design and type the post titles that contains design tag around it randomly

15934988
int	chars
but 99 of cimg methods looks exactly the same for unsigned chars int or float type like load_raw or blur for example

15935071
gruntjs	yeoman
i am a newbee in the world of yeoman gruntjs etc

15935074
width	height
image width 300 height 300 everything s as expected

15935124
hide	show
as soon as you click on div it hide the div but same time it firing mouseleave on div where you again calling show

15935182
getter	setter
with a getter and setter and it would be populated for you

15935184
children	parent
group has no layout to it it s the parent for vgroup and many other classes for that matter and so all the positioning is handled by the children rather than the parent the group

15935220
min	max
you are trying to do a sum which goes across multiple records of the min and max values which also goes across the records

15935220
min	max
you would need to redo the query where you get the the min max first and then do the sum statement checking them

15935260
stdout	stderr
that s probably not guaranteed so you may have to play with it a bit but given the pid of a running bash some script sh process you can look in at the file descriptor links - 0 1 and 2 are of course the predefined stdin stdout stderr ones and there may be others depending on what your script does but it shouldn t be too difficult to sift through the contents of that directory to figure out which file descriptor corresponds to your script file which you can than cat or whatever cat proc 12345 fd 255 to see the original script

15935296
hash	md5
while there do exist practical collision attacks against md5 which render it insecure for things like digital signatures breaking a password hash would require a preimage attack and all currently known such attacks against md5 are purely theoretical

15935296
hash	md5
that said to paraphrase bruce schneier attacks only ever get better so starting to move from md5 to more trustworthy hash functions such as sha-2 or sha-3 is certainly not a bad idea even if you don t need to do it yet.

15935296
hash	md5
the catch is that md5 alone is unsuitable for hashing passwords for two reasons both of which are actually deliberate design features and shared by other hash functions like sha-2 and sha-3

15935296
hash	md5
this is a problem for password hashing since somebody could and indeed some people have just compile a huge database of the md5 hash of common and not so common passwords allowing anyone who knows the plain md5 hash of any password found in those databases to just look it up and find the original password

15935296
hash	salt
the solution is simple and you already know it combine the password with a random salt before hashing it and include the salt as part of the final hash so that it can be used to verify the password later

15935296
hash	salt
with sufficiently many possible salt say a few billion at least to randomly choose from compiling a hash database becomes impossible since any single password could hash to billions of different values

15935311
ant	maven
i haven t used the maven flexmojo but with ant you need to specify the include-classes attribute to force the classes into the built library

15935327
width	height
changing the width and height of an empty display object will do nothing

15935327
width	height
if the display object has graphical content then it will scale that content so that it matches the desired width and height which would also change the scale factors

15935327
width	height
if you are going to draw a shape in a disp.object to give it a width and height you do not then need to set those values explicitly

15935376
button	checkbox
then inside your event code much easier if you use jquery for button for checkbox selects radios... put the code from your second link looking more like

15935452
google-chrome	firefox
version works in firefox and google-chrome

i ve found some comments and references that seem to indicate that setting the height greater than the width will cause the browser to change the orientation automatically but in my testing that only works in opera used to work in opera but not anymore

15935838
width	height
first set height greater than width

15935838
width	height
the ua determined the orientation of the control from the ratio of the style-sheet-specified height and width properties

15935838
width	height
as of today no browser implements a vertical slider based solely on height being greater than width

15935838
width	height
regardless setting height greater than width is needed to get the layout right between browsers

15935838
width	height
the caption for the vertical slider demo in the ie documentation erroneously indicates that setting height greater than width will display a range slider vertically but this does not work

15935838

in the code section it plainly does not set height or width and instead uses writing-mode

width	height
if your image style are used in a responsive slideshow or something and or you want all images to be an exact size height width you could achieve this by using two filters

15936095
width	height
scale to 400x300 height or width will match this size and the other will be equal or smaller

15936095
width	height
crop to 400x300 since height width already is equal or smaller than 400x300 it will add black space top bottom or right left if needed

15937868
screens	tablet
just because of the cell phone ipad craze doesn t mean that highly functional full featured sites are suddenly obsolete and those who decided to make framesets obsolete seem to be the same complainers who never figured out their full potential in the first place or maybe they re the lobbyists of the mega-corporate cell-phone and tablet makers who couldn t be bothered to make a decent frames capable browser for their itty-bitty screens

pop-up	dialog
in the properties dialog that pop-up use the checkboxes in the installer category

15938310
rtp	sdp
in rosenberg s tutorial i believe the re-invite is sent because the sockets chosen by ice are different from those in the media and connection m c-lines lines of the original sdp and in order for any network elements that are in between the two user agents to be informed of the actual sockets that will be used rtp a re-invite is sent with the ice selected socket s in the media and connection lines of the sdp

15938568
stdout	stdio
when you include stdio stdout is a variable defined there

15938568
stdout	stderr
and apparently every unix program that is opened has its output input and error streams set by default to stdout stdin and stderr respectively

15938585
cpu	affinity
sounds like a cpu affinity setting either through the code or system settings

15938585
affinity	processors
you can set processors affinity and thus limit to 1 processors per application pool which would effectively limit the app that runs in that pool to use one processors

15938585
cpu	processors
this will limit the w3wp process to only use one processors and thus if you have a quad core cpu it would run at 25

15938599
unsigned	short
so i am trying to read an unsigned short array which is returned by a void pointer in the c library i am using

15938599
unsigned	short

15938614
stdout	fflush
note that in the actual code i fflush stdout after every print so i now it is this line.

15938623
affinity	processors	cpu	processors	cpu	affinity
beyond processors affinity if your requests are long running you maybe running up against default limits to the number of concurrent requests per cpu that iis allows especially in integrated mode....12

15938623
cpu	affinity
the 25 on a quad core cpu hints that affinity is your problem but if it isn t you can check this as well

15938648
folder	directory
if your data is too long and you want to get each model directory seperately when user expand folder in your view you can create a model with lots of collections or collection with lots of collection with the same idea then fetch data from server in the model and the backend must support directory something like this api file folder1 folder2 file1.txt

i have a ul each li has a row of images and i am trying to bind a function to each li so that on mouseenter the row of images appears and on mouseout the row of images disappears...i call bind on the image wrapper div within each li based on a an #id so that they work independently

15938674
mouseup	mousedown
everything is working except that the bind function seems to be binding each discrete function to its respective div and then to each subsequent li div beneath it...not above though...so as i move the mousedown through the lower list items which are currently collapsed the focused row of images flashes in and out for each li...if i have one of the lower rows of images un-collapsed only one can be un-collapsed at a time and move the mouseup over the above list items no flashing occurs.

allocator	stl
the othervect s allocator object has to be copied and used as well which needs more efforts to get it performant in the stl implementation

15966434
allocator	stl	memcpy	memmove
all of them including the copy constuctor when othervect uses the default allocator should boil down to a memmove memcpy in a good stl implementation in this case

15966434
memcpy	memmove
using the container s method is generally more performant than using generic algorithms so a combination of vector resize and std copy or even memmove memcpy would be a work-around if the vendor didn t optimize the container sufficiently

in that case you have to download from some place to your local computer and add the path of local folder to right click project - properties - linker - genaral - additional library directory

in other rdms you cannot use group by clause without aggregate function on fields that are not in the group by clause and this makes sense since those fields need to be aggregated min max count etc but in mysql it lets you use fields without any aggregate function and it will show you the first value encountered for that field

well public inheritance is your normal inheritance so the semantics of public and protected members in this case are exactly what you d think they are

that is your public members are public and your protected members are visible only to the current and more-derived classes

integer	unsigned
takes the address of the first byte in buf converts it to unsigned and prints the resulting number as a signed integer

15967514
integer	unsigned
typically sizeof unsigned bytes of the pointer value are interpreted as an unsigned integer typically includes that the size of a pointer is not smaller than the size of an unsigned

15967514
integer	unsigned
this line has the same semantics as the corresponding line of main but since it s a different array buf the unsigned integer obtained from the conversion is different

the issue is that the draggable div elements work fine but the button elements won t engage the drag in firefox but they do work in google-chrome

15967786

i think this might have something to do with the way firefox handles the already existing events of the button which is probably different than how google-chrome does this

i am working on a simple iphone app that is loading data from the web service rss feed inside uitableview

15967874
rss	feed
when the user scrolls down to the bottom of tableview i am using the following method to load more data in the tableview by fetching the next page of rss feed by incrementing the counter

15967874
rss	feed
the counter is incrementing each time user scrolls down to the bottom of tableview hence calling the next page of the rss feed

15967874
rss	feed
but if the user after reaching at the bottom scrolls up multiple times the counter also gets incremented multiple times hence a different page of the rss feed is reached and added to the bottom of the tableview

15968648
width	height
all percentages with regards to width height are calculated based on the parent container s width - in this case the #child element will have a width of 200px and height of 400px

15968648
width	margin
meanwhile paddings and margins when percentage-based are calculated from the containing parent s width therefore #child will have a top margin of 100px

put	get
i would like to know how i would be able to use ajax in order to get a hold of this data so that it can be put back on to a database

15968738
for-loop	arrays
in the for-loop where you are inserting the items from your arrays into sendxml you are inserting at index i+1 which is a character offset so the second element is being inserted at character 1 of the first string which is right after the first hence giving you the poor result

15968821
onresume	onpause
just override onpause - where you get the current time and then when application returns from foreground override onresume where you get the current time too.

ubuntu	linux
my software that compiled fine on linux a few months ago stopped compiling on my new ubuntu

15974461
vb6	vba
you are looking at vba not vb6 though the syntactic differences are small

15974494
profiling	instrumentation
i am a little bit confused about the the readings in instrumentation when i test my app with allocations profiling

15974495
mouseleave	mouseenter
the mouseleave event will fire if the mouseenter a child control which is probably not what you want

15974537
uiview	subviews
create subviews of uiview and overwrite the drawrect where i draw the gradient in current context

15974537
uiview	cagradientlayer	uiview	subviews
create subviews of uiview but instead of overwriting the drawrect use cagradientlayer

15974552
free	malloc
i have the following code in which whenever i try to free my malloc ed memory i sometimes get a segmentation fault

15974638
put	get
on the other hand if you have multiple vectors that you want to associate with the same name you can put them into a cell array and get each vector as

15974640
chown	chmod
if you have ssh access you can do this directly through the command line look up chmod and chown if you re using cpanel or some other similar control panel front end to manage your server with a filemanager web app then it probably provides you with some method to alter permissions or if you re using an ftp program like say filezilla it will likely provide you with some method to change permissions for a folder

15974652
octal	hex
first you must convert your character codes from hex to octal

15974669
getter	setter
let s call the parent class classa and the child class classb left out getter setter for brevity

15974687
put	get
you could just get the results with a where condition and then put an if statement around the results count

15974688
jar	war
step 4 right click libraries add jar folder navigate to web-inf lib of inflated war folder select all the dependency jars and click on open of netbeans project

15974719
inherited	properties
this will not work because ef understands your inherited as a table per hierarchy scheme so it expects to have the properties of entityviewmodel on the same table as the properties for entity

15974733
nsstring	nsdata
if the arrayâ s contents are all property list objects nsstring nsdata nsarray or nsdictionary objects the file written by this method can be used to initialize a new array with the class method arraywithcontentsoffile or the instance method initwithcontentsoffile

15974736
zlib	libpng
the compiler and all modules are free and open source under the zlib libpng licence

15974736
int	double
byte short int long float and double numeric data types

15974770
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
this is not a problem in google-chrome safari or firefox

15974840
getter	setter
you need to use getter and setter methods for this class because the coursename field is private

15974840
getter	setter
using getter setter methods helps insulate client code from changes to how the class is implemented

15974840
getter	setter
automated software generation tools rely on the existence of property getter and setter

15974849
mp4	webm
move the webm tag above mp4 and i bet it works

15974928
jar	war
step 4 right click libraries add jar folder navigate to web-inf lib of inflated war folder select all the dependency jars and click on open of netbeans project

15974969
opera	google-chrome
note that we see something similar in the google-chrome developer tools also in opera only it s labeled as position instead

15974980
hide	show
when its time to move on to the next screen you simply hide the current user control and show the next one

15974980
hide	show
when its time to move onto the second screen you hide the first control and show the second etc etc

15975052
for-loop	arrays
just build a new arrays from the old one with a for-loop and limit its length to the however many models i need to in my new collection

15975064
getter	setter
it looks like you are actually asking about parameters and what they are used for not about getter setter and encapsulation

15975067
post	get
you can get an idea of how to implement this by reading this blog post i wrote

15975087
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
code works in firefox google-chrome and safari

15975088
inherited	properties
when you use for-in to loop through the names of the properties of an object you see all of the enumerable properties including those the object inherited from its prototype

15975088
inherited	properties
it would appear that the person implementing that method didn t want to copy properties inherited from the prototype and so only included ones that the object itself directly owns

15975088
inherited	properties
in the above t1 inherited the infoforallthings and speak properties from its prototype which gets set to thing.prototype when t1 is created

15975106
google-chrome	firefox
i get this error whether i hit the url directly or load the url via ajax in both google-chrome and firefox

15975106
put	get
if i then put nginx in front of this to forward to the same gunicorn runserver i get this error

15975122
imageview	universal-image-loader
i had some trouble with the sizes of imageview that are used with universal-image-loader too and this helped me

15975155
addclass	removeclass
addclass removeclass is far more efficient since it contains all the styling externally where it s easy to add remove that styling to the element when needed

15975208
implements	extends
public class audiodemo extends activity implements onclicklistener

15975266
trie	tree
one way of doing this quickly would be with a trie - basically you d store all the keys in a tree where the root node represents an empty input and each character you enter takes you down a branch to a subtree which holds all the names starting with the set of letters you ve put in so far

15975271
sudo	passwd
the only thing that you can do to get this effect is to set the effective uid of the peer process to root or whatever uid gid you want and for that you need either root passwd or sudo privileges

15975378
post	get
in your case you will be making a get call and not a post

15975380
post	put
put post into a separate div let s say

15975384
int	double
that would be double float long int and short

15975420
google-chrome	firefox
if user browser is firefox or google-chrome etc. it s work with sizelimit parameter but if you user use ie you should handle it by some method etc

15975426
symfony	silex
i m trying to build a symfony form in silex by name

15975533
public	protected
so you can choose protected or public

15975541
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
please note that although document.getelementsbyname is supported well in firefox google-chrome and safari it has limited browser support

15975570
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the down side is that browser support is limited ie10 google-chrome opera firefox safari

15975617
stdout	stderr
when the file does exist the condition is where n will be greater than two due stdin stdout and stderr occupying file descriptors 0 1 and 2 and fp is assigned 0 and the if branch is not entered

15975654
int	chars
i got a problem that says form a chars array based on an unsigned int

15975700
accessor	properties
something else if you keep the set accessor of your properties public you will have a mutable struct

15975715
charindex	substr
select substr ab cd charindex ab cd +1 8000 cd

15975715
charindex	substr
select substr ab cd 1 charindex ab cd -1 ab

15975720
google-chrome	firefox
works fine in firefox but not in google-chrome

15975725
width	height
where the linearlayout height is clipped and the width set in the layout is not respected

15975725
put	get
if i put the attribute in the parent linearlayout i get the following

15975726
width	height	portrait	landscape
upon using the convert method i would like to be able to transform a landscape or portrait image given the height and width specify without altering the ratio

15975800
children	parent
in my java class i remember making a barn class that held animal class objects and my chicken and cow classes which were children of the animal class would fit into the barn as if they were their parent

15975822
melt	reshape
i m pretty new to reshape and melt but i think that s what i want in the last line

15975825
getter	setter
by analogy in eclipse ide and many others when i declare some private attributes of the class i can generate the getter and setter methods automatically

15975859
put	get
you will also get this error if you accidentally put a cpu variable as one of the arguments for your gpu device function

15975861
vundle	pathogen
some people like it other not but i d advice you to use vundle instead of pathogen

15975896
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
i have got a limited list of objects which i am serializing to storage using objectinputstream and objectoutputstream

15975915
pyyaml	libyaml
neither comes with pyyaml or libyaml installed

15975922
textarea	textbox
i have a textbox input field and a textarea below it

15976008
junit	mockito
i ve asked a couple of junit and mockito oriented questions recently and i m still really struggling to get the hang of it

15976059
getter	setter
but in the long term if you use a property in your interface you might change it later to have an actual getter and setter that do for example validations or make the object react somehow on the new value

15976090
google-chrome	firefox
this approach worked fine for ie but the javascript does not fire in google-chrome or firefox

15976090
google-chrome	firefox
as stated this works fine in ie but in google-chrome and firefox the oncomplete event never fires

15976101
hash	salt
i want to try out a system where i use a key and salt it with the name of a website then hash it and use the hash as my password on the site that it s salt with

15976117
int	double
the object passed can be double int string long etc

15976127
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox we already support element.mozsrcobject stream to become element.srcobject and which google-chrome should have soon though i don t know if they ll prefix it for the time being

15976134
ubuntu	linux
but under linux ubuntu 12.04 gnome-shell 3.4.1 this does not work qt 4.8.0

15976200
std	ostream
in your case the declaration of your operator is not visible at the point of definition of the template since the header is included afterwards and it does not live in any of the associated namespaces of the function arguments namely std for std ostream and bar for so it won t be found

15976209
folder	directory
i was working on a project in a certain directory that was linked to it s corresponding remote git repo but i had to copy the contents of the project to a different folder and now need to relink it to the remote repo

15976209
pull	push
but i want to pull the latest changes of the remote project and don t want to push my local repo

15976248
accessor	properties
use properties and the accessor methods are created for you during compilation

15976272
serializable	deserialization
i m trying to get the gwt serializable deserialization source.unfortunately i have been stuck with other works and couldn t look on this right now

15976278
min	max
so if min is 5 and max is 10 user could post values empty 5 6 7 8 9 or 10

15976306
git-rebase	amend
in this case git will reset you to that commit allowing you to amend it and a following git-rebase --continue will replay the remaining commits

15976360
toggleclass	each
what i want to do is apply the hover and toggleclass functions so that when you hover over each of the 4 top row images the div below s background image changes

15976378
textarea	textbox
basically this plugin allows you to insert a piece of text at caret of multiple textbox or textarea

15976409
primes	modulus
since the modulus 7 is primes every number modulo 7 has an inverse

15976461
google-chrome	firefox
the first jsfiddle sample has its own window.onload included so you may want to add everything that s not inside the window.onsubmit inside window.onload like this tested in google-chrome firefox

15976507
min	max
you can try to use numerical validator by setting its min to 5 max to 10 allowempty and integeronly to true

15976525
post	get
i did manage to get idle to work using send to and until i get an answer to my idle issue post that is what i suppose i will have to do

15976531
children	parent
this is problematic for me since i d like to set the width of some children to equal the width of their parent

15976542
superclass	subclassing
if your superclass is fruit and subclassing is banana you can assign if banana isa fruit

15976571
dictionary	map
i was going to pass the map data into a c# dictionary but the map is always null

15976576
put	get
i can not for the life of me figure out what to put in iâ ve tried model.sites.abbreviation model.sites 0 .abbreviation and various other combinations but get errors

15976593
hash	salt
also normally you ll have to store your salt and that s a bad idea for the most part since that will just null the hash thought all togeather

15976597
post	get
so your values need to be passed via post or get the same way they would be passed if you were doing this in an html + perl only solution

15976659
textarea	textbox
basically this plugin allows you to insert a piece of text at caret of multiple textbox or textarea

15976707
post	get
i tried the get properties but i need to have the post too in order for php to take the information of that dj

15976720
google-chrome	firefox
so it would appear firefox is allowing you to change it while google-chrome is not

15976730
folder	directory
git works based on files rather than folder so ignores empty directory

15976730
folder	directory
a standard way to store an empty directory is to place a .gitignore or readme file in the folder and commit that

15976740
free	malloc	strtok	malloc
strtok returns a pointer to the token that is included in the string you have passed so you can t free it because it doesn t always point to something you ve allocated with malloc

15976751
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome both respond appropriately

15976751
google-chrome	firefox
what should happen and works on firefox and google-chrome is that as the site becomes less than 640px the header font in the slider should become a smaller size

15976766
outputstream	inputstream
here is a function that takes parameters to dot and then runs the process piping in an inputstream and piping out an outputstream

15976786
portrait	landscape
for example in portrait it s 384 and landscape is 589

15976786
portrait	landscape
if i rotate to landscape from portrait it ll report an orientation change to a window.innerwidth of 384 which is the portrait s

15976786
portrait	landscape
if i then rotate to portrait it reports 589 which is landscape s width

15976786
google-chrome	firefox
this occurs in google-chrome firefox

15976796
portrait	landscape
i am trying to add a class to an image after determining if it is landscape or portrait

15976806
client-side	server-side
your server-side script here findnames can work as fallback then and the client-side script can avoid unnecessary roundtrips improving the user experience and reducing the network and server load

15976819
min	max	range	max	range	min
you will want to look at properties such as position to set the position on the figure and max and min to set the possible range of values

15976822
pull	push
push changes to a kiln repo using git and then pull them using

15976823
hide	show
if you want something to be visible only when js is enabled then you by default hide that content then use js to show it

15976856
gridbaglayout	boxlayout
i was originally using gridbaglayout and then tried boxlayout each row a panel with an x-axis boxlayout all on a y-axis boxlayout but i get the same results

15976907
getter	setter
getter and setter are generated implicitly by the compiler for your class properties

15976907
getter	setter
2 a getter and a setter

15976907
getter	setter
it is nice because this way your code is not cluttered by trivial getter and setter

15976907
getter	setter
if you want your getter or setter to do something else than just set or return a value you need to define the method the usual way

15976938
int	chars
but then you have to add enough leading zeros to get to length 6 and then break it into 2 chars bits and convert each to an int and that s way more work than just mod-ing by 100 and diving by 100 and 10 000

15976947
pull	push
i am trying to implement soap calls to pull push information from ms crm dynamics but i am not able to find any wsdl or sample calls

15976968

it is ok in google-chrome firefox and safari

15976982
thin	webrick
capybara boots up your rack application using webrick or thin in a background thread

15976984
trie	tree
in addition to chris okasaki i may suggest you calculate for each tree node trie or patricia number of leafs in corresponding subtree you can easaly do it with depth first traversal

15977040
g++	gcc
the terms gcc and g++ are both linux and unix compilers

15977084
dictionary	map
one solution is to serialize the map into something json xml ... and then deserialize it in c# again into a dictionary

15977087
google-chrome	firefox
github.com benvanik webglbrowser also be aware of github.com kripken emscripten because firefox recently came out with asmjs on odin monkey techcrunch.com 2013 03 21 firefox-nightly-now-includes-odinmonkey-brings-javascript-performance-closer-to-running-at-native-speeds this enabled firefox to port over unreal engine to webgl in only a few days at the last gdc so hopefully google-chrome and other browser start supporting asmjs for the obvious speed boost

15977112
gridview	detailsview
i have one page which has a gridview and another that has a detailsview

15977112
gridview	onclientclick	gridview	detailsview	onclientclick	detailsview
the gridview has a template button on each row with an onclientclick event that loads the second page with the detailsview on it

15977112
gridview	detailsview
when i click the template button on the gridview it then loads the second page with the detailsview and inserts that particular record from the gridview into the detailsview table

15977139
unsigned	short	integer	unsigned
nlink_t is typedef d as an integer type unsigned short or unsigned int so you should be able to cast stat.st_nlink to an unsigned or unsigned long without the compiler complaining

15977153
ubuntu	linux
this works well on a windows and a ubuntu server however on a different linux server it sometimes 5 out of 6 times doesn t execute the javascript the pdf only contains data that wasn t generated modified by javascript

15977213
unsigned	short
unsigned short is 16 char 8 long 64 etc. so you re declaring a 32 bit bitfield container

15977302
stdout	stderr
i assume that the summary message must be printed to stderr as i pipe stdout to a file and its content is correct

15977305
multiplying	multiplication
since matrix multiplication is associative you can multiplying the matrix with itself several times before feeding it the initial vector

15977324
onelogin	okta
box is different from many oauth 2 providers in that a large percentage of our customers use a single sign on provider ping okta onelogin etc to log in to box

15977335
uinavigationbar	uiappearance	uibutton	uiappearance

i had set up a simple fade in out function which i then found a better versioning from css tricks or something similar so i upgrade to that one

15977508
min	max
i suspect that it might be a problem when i m doing the projection on the 3rd step but i ve used the same projection technique for poly s what i ve used here for the aabb and the min and max projection for the circle should be the circle s center then minus and plus the radius respectively - at least as i understand it

15977551
integer	unsigned
the structure bitfield packs a c and b into a single unsigned integer

15977551

post	get
i am trying get my store to call the post method of my servlet but it keeps calling the get even though i set actionmethods to be post

15977742
post	put
after reading some more post from scott and david ebbo it seems that i could put a blank connection string in web.config with the correct name and then azure will overwrite the values correctly

15977821
filtering	grouping
i have a math expression field_a - field_b that i want to create an exposed grouping filtering for select-list so that i can effectively filtering out my results

15977842
folder	directory
here is the directory of my extension folder

15977855

15977914
stdout	stderr
this will pipe stdin through mbuffer to stdout and write the processed stderr to stderr

15977924

15978024
getter	setter
i recommend creating getter setter for fields where it can occur and filter it there

15978030
int	chars
ok so that is definitely a 4-digit int followed by six instances of chars 0

15978030
int	chars
...which also can t be converted to an int whether you ve replaced chars 0 or not

15978039
viewdidload	viewwillappear
you try by adding manually to viewdidload or viewwillappear method in that controller

15978044
gdal	ogr
it uses gdal ogr to read shapefile and plots correctly donut shape polygons

15978105
stdout	stderr
if your goal is to direct stdout to a file and capture stderr this should do it yes it s counterintuitive to map stderr to stdout then stdout to a file but that s how redirection works you re sending stream 2 to where stream 1 points to at that moment which is stdout

15978149
put	get
but when i put this file test_filter.py in the nova scheduler filters folder and restart openstack i get the following exception

15978212
hash	salt
passwords should definitely be hash and salt in the database and never saved anywhere in plaintext

15978308
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
joshua bloch s effective java recommends throwing nullpointerexception over illegalargumentexception in this situation item 60 favor the use of standard exceptions

15978308
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
if a caller passes null in some parameter for which null values are prohibited convention dictates that nullpointerexception be thrown rather than illegalargumentexception

15978335

you can try to fix it by introducing a check on the image width and height to be larger than 2448 and 3264 respectively and then just swap its width and height

15979456
hide	show
this way you could add and remove the show hide toggling by simply removing the class .btn or .item

15979461

gson	jackson
i prefer jackson but when i evaluated it i found it was just too big for me to feel good about putting it in an android project so i went with gson

15980257
post	get
this seems a little over simplified to me as interest calculations in particular can get quite complex and capturing the required data first seems logical to me especially because my work colleagues also argue that we should be able to post the results of a calculation and know it is the same as what the calculation actually processed

15980269
mouseover	mouseout
you should not nest mouseout or click inside of mouseover

15980269

downgrading to v3 is not an option since the sgml parser used in bs3 is not near as good as the lxml or html5lib parsers that are available with bs4

15980799
min	max
as the timestamp doesn t matter i ve gone for the min max possible on the variables

15980802
bash	zsh

bash	zsh
echo -e 0 should produce a 0 on both zsh and bash and dash

15981476
lxml	libxml2
the same lxml version built on libxml2 2.9 vs

15981493
int	double
the most obvious optimization would be to load the int progressively in an in-memory buffer during the scan to prevent double i o operations

15981518
client-side	server-side
also without ajax you are going to run into trouble since php is a server-side language and not client-side so it was not made to respond to user events but rather server-events like receiving a submitted form

15981525
bmp	png
you can set the clicked image and load the same bmp png to the image on the second panel and set to it do this in the image click event is just a trick you can do alot of things just have imagination

15981575
google-chrome	firefox
however say i have successfully logged in to the site with google-chrome and i open an instance of mozilla firefox or any other browser to log in simultaneously google-chrome s user session will be shut down immediately i know that because an asynchronous script is requesting whether or not the user is logged in and it prompts me to log in once i sign in using the other browser

it resizes an image fit inside a defined width height and if the image has not the same proportions as the required thumbnail s unused free space is set transparent

15981598
jboss	glassfish

from both examples you can see that you will have a xml file where you put the connection attributes database url user password min and max pool connection size how many connections to database will be open

15981600
gridview	formview
basically i have a gridview that is the master control that uses a formview as a detail

15981607
pop-up	dialog
the program s execution starts from a frame and when the button is clicked the dialog pop-up

15981642
hide	show
firstly you would need to hide the second button and then add an event to the first button to show the second button when you click the first

15981642
hide	show
this would initially hide the second form and then setup a click event on the first button to show the second form

innodb	myisam
understanding that you re using innodb the answer is no the lock level is row not table unlike myisam

15981836
typhoeus	eventmachine
it can use eventmachine directly or libraries like typhoeus for when you decide to get concurrent

15981872
for-loop	arrays
if you must stick with using an static arrays you should test if an index has a null value in the for-loop and decrease the size when it finds one

15981894
min	max
first max maxstr min minstr reduce shuffle sum

15981901
width	height	switching	screens
i have read on changing screen.orientation at runtime that screens height and width do not change if you switching the orientation

hide	show
show hide is used to call the show or hide methods depending on whether the check-box is checked or not

15981946
mouseleave	mouseenter	fadein	fadeout
i would explicitly use fadein and fadeout on mouseenter and mouseleave just in case the order in which events are resolved ever gets lagged

15981948
sorting	filtering
the sorting and filtering is built-in and requires no post-backs

15981953
superclass	subclassing
the problem i ve ran into is that if a subclassing also has an initialsetup method it would override the superclass initialsetup method and thus the superclass would have to have the method be public in order to still function

15981960
post	get
but they use the post method not a get method

15981962
hide	show
what you have to is when you hide show an element make sure you hide the other one

15982017

15982034
google-chrome	firefox
various extensions exist for firefox and google-chrome to check your html without having to visit the validator service manually

15982051
superclass	subclassing
then your debug builds will raise an exception if a subclassing or superclass ends up calling your init method

15982149
width	margin
so it would also be possible to have all three textblock columns starsized but that means width clipping does occur earlier and there is more margin

15982177
google-chrome	firefox
here is an example that works for me in recent version of firefox and google-chrome

15982179
post	get
now i want to query post s tags in another page to show only the very certain post i want to get

15982217
put	get
get rid of the .solid or put this before you set the forecolor.rgb i think that is overriding something i have noticed this and some other bugs inabilities to perform certain actions even as the macro recorder would make it seem these methods should work properly

15982227
dllmain	getprocaddress
if dllmain is exported use getprocaddress

15982244
rbac	acl
it ll have some users with different privileges rbac acl

15982244
rbac	acl
i feel that this is an insecure authentication method database connection is always done using a db user with full or very high privileges on the db so what can and can not be done is managed by the web application by writing an rbac acl authorization layer so i have a bunch of tables in the db which holds users privilege levels etc.

15982260
put	get
this is the reason that if you put your ui thread to work the ui itself hangs input and paint messages get queued for processing but they cannot interrupt the work you are doing

15982261
min	max
to find min or max in a subset of a vector -

15982261
min	max
if a is a vector and lowerbound and upperbound are the bounds of the vector among which you need to find the max or min value then use this command -

15982367
rss	feed
i would suggest parsing the rss feed provided by nexus

15982394
for-loop	arrays
you can manually use a reverse for-loop from the end of the arrays to the front excepting the 1st element or use arraycopy

15982406
width	height
with winfo_width and winfo_height you can get the width and height or the window and also you can bind an event handler to the event

15982418
setinterval	settimeout
normally counting to infinity is done using setinterval or settimeout which allows other code such as the click handler to run between timer ticks

15982430
folder	directory
if you are actually looking to get a list of files from a given directory it has nothing to do with the assets folder and i suggest you check out a tutorial on android external and internal storage

15982476
put	get
then the methods calling put will need to keep retrying until they get a true response

15982543
content-length	content-type
you could pass that in the same way as you would chunk-encoded-requests but you d have to make sure you set your own content-type and content-length headers

15982572
teamcity	jenkins
to be honest i m not familiar with jenkins but i had same issue when i wanted to integrate gruntjs with xcode custom build step or within teamcity deployment process

15982576
cvs	rcs
this is called keyword substitution and variants of this idea are implemented in a number of version control systems like rcs cvs and subversion

15982577
cvs	rcs	cvs	svn
some version control systems rcs cvs and svn at least automatically insert the revision number and last modified date of the file with those special variables

15982580
cvs	rcs
this isn t specific to python it s something used by source control systems going back to rcs and cvs

15982595
put	get
what happens is i put the info into the form click the button and the alert tells me that it does indeed get the data from the form

15982596
google-chrome	safari
the behaviour as shown in google-chrome and safari is the one i m trying to achieve

you could highlight the corresponding small blue box with a similar ng-class or ng-style attribute ng-class active selecteduser user

15982683
width	height
int mipmaps width height w h

15982683
width	height
width and height are the dimensions of the original texture 256x256

15982688
int	chars
however remember that initializing a chars to blank space is not the same as initializing an int to 0

15982693
int	chars
so since what android supports for native logging is the __android_log_print int prio const chars tag const chars fmt ... method which works with a printf-like syntax with indefinite number of arguments i made the abstract log method to work with a similar syntax

15982693
int	chars
it also exists in log.h and is called __android_log_vprint int prio const chars tag const chars fmt va_list ap so i just have to pass the arguments for that method instead

15982693
folder	directory
this vfprintf was in stdio.h so i started searching and found another stdio.h in a similar folder i found stdarg.h so i added it to include directory too and moved it to top

15982812
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it works fine in firefox opera etc....but as you will see google-chrome resizes it incorrectly

15982826

15982876
hash	md5
the md5 hash as bytea will use only 16 bytes in instead of 32 for the hexa representation

15982900
udp	tcp
the next step is to look at a different approach so that the clients will remain synchronized more closely using udp ip as the network transmission protocol rather than the currently used tcp ip

15982900
udp	tcp
the expected results of using udp ip is to reduce the various lags introduced by the tcp network transmission protocol in order to provide the connection oriented sequenced byte stream provided by tcp

15982900
udp	tcp
however using the udp network transmission protocol requires that some of the delivery mechanisms used by tcp in order to provide the dependable sequence of bytes must be assumed by the user of udp

15982900
udp	tcp
java-gaming.org udp vs tcp

15982907

15983093
width	height
never use the size width or height property they ll inevitably depend on the border and caption size

15983097

within eclipse the m2e plugin is the connector between eclipse and the assembly line maven

15984328
mouse	keyboard
gwt html5 canvas wrapper can responds to mouse and keyboard events it binds to 5 - 6 types of different events my question is it is possible to define entirely new event system such as canvasevent and related handler canvaseventhandler extends to gwtevent etc bind this to canvas object and then handle all events differently using a handler interface methods will be something like ondraw ondrag onmove onselect etc

15984331

google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome has it when inspecting elements with right-click firefox has it with the firebug extension and ie has it with f12

15984893

15984894
hex	binary
i have done conversions binary hex ipaddress but it still stores a bad value

15984930
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox

15984958
screens	mdpi
now mdpi screens s height is 480px

15984958
screens	mdpi
so i designed my ui to have a height of 480px on mdpi s screens

15985001
setcontentview	findviewbyid
r.id.hello cannot be found by findviewbyid until after you call setcontentview and add r.id.hello to your activity s view

15985001
setcontentview	findviewbyid
move setcontentview above your findviewbyid line

15985011
setcontentview	findviewbyid
you have to arrange setcontentview before getting views using findviewbyid

hide	show
i am not sure what exactly what you want but i like using this plugin for situation like when you want to hide the scrollbar by default and show up when you hover on the textarea

15985080
folder	directory
you could svn checkout to a directory which is visible through your web server just make sure it prevents you from accessing the .svn folder

15985085
put	get	post	get	post	put
for this you simply post a runnable to the ui thread s message queue and it will get put at the end of the message queue...which is exactly where you want it

15985120

the other option is to upgrade to a newer versioning of hibernate 4.x as this at least by default uses the columnlabel for retrieving values

15985355
stateless	stateful
it is the same result in both stateless and stateful beans

15985374
for-loop	arrays
then use generic for-loop iterate till count and acess the values as arrays indexes

15985376
screens	mdpi
but you have specified that you have designed the ui for 480px on mdpi s screens

15985376
screens	mdpi
since it is not clear how you designed the ui to 480px on mdpi screens

15985376
screens	mdpi
i guess might have used drawables used in image view which fits the 480 px for mdpi screens

15985376
mdpi	hdpi
lpdi mdpi hdpi xhdpi 3 4 6 8

15985382

don t call getwritabledatabase or getreadabledatabase in the sqliteopenhelper s methods as those methods call oncreate and you ll get yourself in a loop and in trouble

15985457
hash	salt
hash algorithm means an algorithm combined with add some salt sha-1 uuid timestamp...etc

15985485

2.1 on the right is utililtes pane.show and hide it with view - utilities- show hide utilities command-option-0 or with third button in the view segmented control in the toolbar

15985587
hide	show
you should hide by default images using a css class and when window onload and image resized show them

15985663
children	parent
but there could only be three sub-levels children of a parent

15985663
children	parent
that is we need each item that has parentid 0 and each parent can have up to three levels of children

15985667
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
so yes normally you would increment an arrays using a for-loop or a similar method but in this scenario that s not possible as i am already in a loops and need to only set one value in the arrays and move on

15985687
switching	screens
basically i m having some really awful issues trying to play a song in the title screens then when the user clicks to start game switching to a game play song

15985758
swt	swing
it s just a program in core java without any gui swing or swt

15985761
int	chars
i understand how to declare the argument part of the prototype using abstract declarators but just don t know how to declare the return type if we are to return addresses of arrays or functions.i only know that if we place a before function name in declaration that it means the function returns a pointer to the respective primary data type like int chars or float

15985764
ubuntu	linux
i am running on ubuntu linux 12.10 32bit x86 due the budget limit we can not afford to buy windows and use g++ as compiler

15985771
int	boolean
besides that the setpremium code makes pretty much no sense - for example you are using int operations on a boolean

15985803
swt	swing
if it s not swing you are using there is a similar function in swt called jobs

15985894
ssl	https
all other security settings when someone tries to open you redirect him to https something.com restricted it has to use ssl

15985916
width	height
first drop all height width border attributes on your image tags

15986035
versioning	upgrade
try putting this before you write to the file and if it fixes it you can either leave it in or ideally disable magic quotes upgrade to a newer php versioning

15986066
implements	extends
another way you could to this is to create abstract classes out of a and b and have two abstract methods one in each as you already have then you create the class c which then extends instead of implements the other classes

15986081
nasm	fasm
using org directives to put variables at specific locations works in masm but not in fasm or nasm

15986081
nasm	fasm
with fasm and nasm you have to do it like this

15986166
super	abstract
one alternative is the creation of a abstract super class

15986190
implements	extends
public class mainactivity extends activity implements view.ontouchlistener

15986193
button	checkbox
in the first datatable i am displaying the radio button and checkbox whereas the second datatable contains

15986193
button	checkbox
everything works fine except that when i select the value from the dropdown the checkbox and the radio button values are cleared

15986193
button	checkbox
n.b the requirement is such that the datatable with checkbox and radio button has to be placed at the top

15986226
for-loop	arrays
indeed the arrays of objects is formed correctly because the for-loop correctly prints out two different program names and two different routes

15986326
hide	show
why don t you use jquery and use the show and hide methods

15986333
implements	extends
but it you d like to have a concrete implementation that has both interfaces implements in a possibly different ways you can create an abstract class as a basis for concrete implementations abstract class basepanel extends panel implements draggable resizable

15986356
postorder	inorder
for example i should be able to specify whether i want dfs postorder pre-order inorder bfs etc

15986362
implements	extends
public class player extends activity implements onpreparedlistener

15986397
google-chrome	safari
i have noticed that between safari and google-chrome the font size is different even when no css is used

15986397
google-chrome	safari
the code is so simple with no styling involved but still shows major differences in size when seen in safari and google-chrome

15986437
folder	directory
i have a folder let s say c myfolder and in this directory i have many subfolders and in each of this subfolders i have exactly one folder that contains pdf files so my file structure looks something like this now i want to move all these pdfs one level up such that it will be like this

15986451
jtextpane	jlayeredpane
hi i am using a jlayeredpane which has many jtextpane s buttons labels etc

15986465
stdout	stderr
both of your examples there are redirecting stdout not stderr because there is no qualifier before the

15986465
stdout	stderr
also useful are to merge stderr onto stdout and shorthand to redirect both stderr and stdout to the same file

15986473
width	height
xna has spritefont class which has a measurestring method which can return the width and height of a string

15986473

i first had xcode 3.1 installed and when i ran brew doctor it correctly informed me my xcode was an old versioning and told me to upgrade to 3.2.6

15986500
textarea	textbox
if answertype is textbox write textarea or textbox element

15986532
put	get
you probably don t want that hanging around on your path the whole time as you will get a warning when you first create a struct you could turn it off but that might hide other problems so you should probably put it in a folder that s not normally in the path and temporarily add it to the path for unit testing addpath rmpath

15986538
accessor	properties
i m not sure how to write the accessor mutator and constructors for that vector variable so i can use them properties

15986626
post	get
an api for a mobile app would usually involves requesting via post or get data from an api

15986629
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
you are using an objectoutputstream which is used to send serialized objects and must be decoded by an objectinputstream on the other end

15986629

i could write a small function to get the image width to height ratio get the label width and height find the smaller of the two proportionally and calculate the new height and width manually

15988166
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
so add subtract divide multiplying and then round but never use that rounded number for another formula

look at this dicussion to get code which returns corectlly x86 program files dir c# - how to get program files x86 on windows 64bit

15988405
post	get
you can get an idea of how to implement this by reading this blog post i wrote

15988456
width	height
the images are all of different dimensions so this requires them to resize all the images down to this equal width and allows them to have these different height images

15988456
width	height
if as you say all of your images are of equal height and width then you won t get this effect without having different column widths

15988456
width	height
but then all of your images will be the same width and height as all of the others in that column

15988472

15989362
google-chrome	firefox
i changed it to 2px and everything works fine for both google-chrome and firefox

15989431

width	height
i am trying to figure out how to get an image to display with the full width and height of the referenced image

15989680
width	height
the problem is that the image href will be set using javascript so the image being referenced is never a fixed width or height

15989680
width	height
what i am wanting is the image to display in it s full width and height not scaled up or down

15989680
width	height
what i was hoping for is the ability to automatically set the width and height of the image based on it s content such as setting the width and height attributes to auto

15989693
multiplying	transpose
a three-component vector multiplying by its transpose result in a 3 3 matrix like the following example

if it is smaller - it will fit into integer assuming it has no fractions

15989905
int	double
by the time you get outside the range of long all double values are int and separated by more than 1

15989905
int	double
you might instead want to check how close the double to the nearest int and have some sort of tolerance

15989911
google-chrome	firefox
i tried this in ie firefox and google-chrome but i always get the following source code which is the source code for page not found page..if you any other info please let me know in a comment.

so i have a server with a php script that is going to get bombarded with xml post

15989956
int	boolean
in the case of c where int can be used as boolean the value 0 is considered false and anything else is considered true

15989971
getter	setter
one thing i see here is the place you are calling the getter setter for nsuserdefaults

15989978
margin	text-align
you should set the margin at least left and right to auto for the elements you want to center and for old ie verions you should add text-align center

15990024
multiplying	add
operator overloading in c++ using overloaded operator is semantically equivalent to calling a function a+b c equates to add a multiplying b c

15990085
ember.js	backbone.js
right now sails.js api blueprints support backbone.js out of the box but obviously that doesn t do you a lot of good if you re using ember.js i created an issue for that here

15990097
srp	principles
the measurement should not know that it is running in another thread because of srp single reponsibility principles

15990255
box-sizing	border-box
i recommend using box-sizing border-box because it will not break the layout when you add padding to the element

15990298
prepare	execute
this stems from a common misconception about how the placeholders in prepare statements work they are not simply substituted in as strings and the resulting sql execute

15990298
prepare	execute
instead a dbms asked to prepare a statement comes up with a complete query plan for how it would execute that query including which tables and indexes it would use which will be the same regardless of how you fill in the placeholders

15990304
knitr	stargazer
since the topic has gone a bit stale i ll assume the issue at hand is to somehow use stargazer with knitr and not per se the conversion of the stargazer objects into html

15990304
latex	stargazer
stargazer tables remain as latex code in the resulting markdown file

15990304
knitr	stargazer
alternatively one can use lyx with knitr plugin to get stargazer tables nicely output in pdf format

15990304
latex	stargazer
these two strategies help use stargazer outside latex

15990340
put	get
i am ready to throw out the hours of time i ve put into this if someone can give me the easiest way to get my question fixed

15990341
for-loop	loops
a for-loop needs a do to start the body of loops

15990488
prepare	execute
to understand why binding a table or column name doesn t work you have to understand how the placeholders in prepare statements work they are not simply substituted in as suitably escaped strings and the resulting sql execute

15990488
prepare	execute
instead a dbms asked to prepare a statement comes up with a complete query plan for how it would execute that query including which tables and indexes it would use which will be the same regardless of how you fill in the placeholders

15990507

google-chrome	firefox
i created a site that uses two canvases layered on top of each other which display properly in google-chrome but in firefox only one of the canvases will display

this way your approach is much more concise by first looping through the first layer and then going through the children of each parent and composing the css for each property value pair

15990818
jasmine	mocha
npmjs.org package testem together with libraries like mocha or jasmine

15990827

switching	screens
im not sure but i bellieve in space invaders if you kill all columns but the most left it doesnt move completely to the right side of the screens before switching its direction

15990841

folder	directory
i noticed that i also need to run my code editor in admin mode in order for it to have permission to save directly into the plugin folder in said directory

15990887
listview	gridview
notifydatasetchanged tells the listview or gridview etc to redraw the entire viewgroup which can be slow and should only be used when you want to actually see each change

i m mainly interested in google-chrome and firefox for desktop

15990953
std	ostream
passing const std ostream as this argument of

vbscript	vb6
so you have taken working vbscript code and ported it to vb6 by declaring all the variables as object

15991341
salt	md5
it is 2013 you should not be using md5 even with a salt and even with the method that you are doing so

15991341
salt	md5
you should not be using pdo without bindparam and you should not be using md5 at all with or without a salt

15991343

i want to send a post or a get doesn t matter which as i can control the other side to the third party but not expose any details within it say a sid or a user token and have it s html content js html images loaded into the iframe

15991485
pull	push
this is especially important as those merged commits would be reflected in your github pull request when you push those updates to your personal github feature branch even if you do that after you issued the pull request.

15991485
pull	push
git will tell you to first git pull --rebase then push again but this wonâ t be a simple fast-forward push as your history got rewritten

15991485
pull	push
when you would push all of this to your github feature branch those changes will get reflected on the original pull request which will get very very ugly

15991485
pull	push
so donâ t pull just force push like this

15991526
google-chrome	firefox
when i inspect the page using google-chrome or firefox i see the following source

15991542
int	double
my own translations into simd for dsp shown switching to simd does take some overhead since a simd opcode does take 1 or more cycles over the typical double int opcode you have to spend opcodes to translate between simd the old maths

bmp	png
tested with png jpg bmp 565 resolution 32x32 and 64x64

post	get
in my opinion the second way to achieve this is better because using get is not thats ecure in my opinion.it s easier than using post

15992008
hash	md5
so i think the best solution here is to use post request while connection to back-end sending some hash string using md5 or sha1 at least that s the way we are securing connection with our server + some more extras

for-loop	arrays
if you don t use an iterator but simply have a for-loop and inside it use the remove method you will get exceptions because the contents of the arrays changes while you iterate through

16000403
for-loop	arrays
e.g you might think arrays size is 10 at the start of the for-loop but it wont be the case once you remove stuff

related to my previous question javascript math.round and math.floor work fine in ie and opera but not google-chrome safari or firefox

16000696

chrome extensions are run locally ie client-side so looking into server-side ways to get the id s is pretty pointless

16001028
hide	show
you can optionally show hide the nav bar on item2viewcontroller and vcb by setting their respective properties

16001053
width	height
ok some sources say placing an iframe with 0 height and width just before the element that needs to be on top will help but is a dirty hack

but when i put some text in it get cut-off

16001090
google-chrome	safari
the codes are tested on google-chrome and safari

16001104
put	get
if you get more files that are not sources or header it might be a good idea to put sources together with headers in a separate folder and documents in a separate folder etc

16001129
int	double
i assume price and listprice are numbers int or double so it is possible they appear to be numbers when echoing them alone but they could be strings with whitespace that is preventing them from being parsed

16001137
getter	setter
implementing all this getter and setter confuses me since that c# allows to have properties

16001198

16001750
ssl	https
don t consider an api any different then using a web page -- and you don t salt passwords before you submit a form on a website instead if you need that level of security you rely on https ssl

16001756
width	height
the problem i m having is that the background image repeats for the width of the entire menu and the height of the drop-down menu when the drop-down is active

16001771
src	attr
i mean instead of cleaning the src set a fake value like attr src notting

16001803
for-loop	arrays
..and then use a for-loop to create the columns while using the arrays of pointers as rows

16001837
post	get
problem is i have no idea how to get all the post from within a plugin

16001880

16002060
min	max
set a min width 1 pixel higher than the max width of the next query

16002061
mouseleave	mouseenter
if you re using jquery you can make use of the jquery mouseleave mouseenter events which do not have this problem

16002061
mouseout	mouseleave
the mouseleave event differs from mouseout in the way it handles event bubbling

16002084
google-chrome	safari
seems google-chrome safari on ipad needs to get the canvas size declared on the css otherwise it won t work when adding divs on top of the canvas

16002084
width	height
so adding width 100 and height 100 to the canvas object solved my problem

16002112
post	get
i been trying to get every post from a facebook group with graph api then show the post and comments on a different webpage my only problem is that i cant get the comments right so far i have this

16002118
mkannotationview	mapkit
you can certainly use custom images for an mkannotationview see ios mapkit custom pins

16002122
put	get
you can put the string in jquery so you will get data .text and that will return the string as text

16002170
width	height
use whatever width and height is needed for your buttons

16002220
box-sizing	border-box
padding makes elements bigger if you are not using box-sizing border-box

16002222
stdout	stderr
so the above line would capture stdout in output.txt but you want to capture stderr instead

16002222
stdout	stderr
second you need a mechanism to swap stdout and stderr

16002222
stdout	stderr
the batch file or whatever process may write interleaved messages to stdout and stderr with stderr piped to tee and stdout going directly to the console

16002222
stdout	stderr
the stdout is immediately forwarded to the console but the stderr is delayed while tee prepares the input and output streams

16002222
stdout	stderr
occasionally tee.bat produces the correct output but usually one of the numbers is dropped or else some stdout and stderr output gets merged into one line

16002222
stdout	stderr
the original program writes both stdout and stderr to the console just fine because it is one process controlling writing everyting

16002222
stdout	stderr
test.bat is writing stdout and tee is writing stderr

16002222
stdout	stderr
you can redirect stderr to stdout and pipe both to tee

16002222
stdout	stderr
this will keep the console output straight but then there is no way to separate the stderr output from the stdout

16002234
post	get
you get the same post listed multiple times if it is assigned to more than one category

16002243
width	margin
basically the width is set to 100 and then the margin borders and padding add on to that pushing content outside of where you want it

16002243
box-sizing	border-box
you can also use box-sizing border-box

16002251
packets	multicast
my purpose is to use multicast as a synchronization method over local area wifi send a dummy multicast packets to multiple receivers

16002256
for-loop	arrays
i do this by on each key up use a for-loop to iterate through the arrays and if it matches at item in the arrays then run the pass function but if it is longer or equal to in length and not equal to an item in the arrays and is the end of the arrays has been reached then run a fail function

16002269
strsplit	substr
every string in python has a function within it called split. if you call strsplit substr it creates a list which does exactly what you are looking for

16002269
strsplit	substr
so if you use strsplit you can call the index in the resulting list to get the substr you want

16002325
width	height
inside such div i have another element with fixed height and width

16002354
width	height
if you have fixed width and height of inside element you may use this little trick

16002374
bitarray	bitset
use a bitset for the bitarray

16002412
gif	png
to allow jpg jpeg png and gif extensions and block others

16002472
hash	md5
the jar has to be the same jar for any given jar filename same size same md5 hash

16002491
memset	malloc
if you want to fill the memory allocated with malloc with spaces you should use memset if you want to assign a string literal you should not use malloc at all

16002648
width	height
it has it s own width and height that are 2 k

16002675
3des	aes
instead i recommend that you use a well-known secure algorithm like aes since you are on software or 3des should you ever want a hardware approach

16002734
int	double
there is the verification inferred static type of a variable which can be int float long double returnaddress or an object reference

16002754
dictionary	map
personally i prefer using hash map dictionary to handle name value pairs like these

16002774
post	get
each web-service s configuration web.config file in my case since i m using iis should allow the management of the protocols allowed to access it get post and or soap

16002781
int	chars
there are five standard signed int types â œ signed chars â â œ short int â â œ int â â œ long int â and â œ long long int â

16002781
int	chars
types bool chars char16_t char32_t wchar_t and the signed and unsigned int types are collectively called integral types

16002781
int	chars
however this is not the case as chars is not among the list of signed int types standard and possibly extended signed int types

16002781
int	chars
therefore either int8_t is a typedef of signed chars or it is an extended signed int type whose objects occupy exactly 8 bits of storage

16002792
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i speculate that perhaps it s because what i m saving as detailcontroller in my subclass is a uinavigationcontroller and not a uiviewcontroller

16002825
implements	extends
i found a way to do this by implements a class called edittextpreferencewithsummary which extends edittextpreference and overriding some methods.

16002880
google-chrome	firefox
this form works in firefox but not google-chrome

16002880
google-chrome	firefox
i would like to understand what firefox is doing that google-chrome is not and fix this page so it works in all browsers

16002880
google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox but google-chrome is unresponsive including the submit button

16002934
equals	gethashcode
also if collection contains objects of your custom type make sure that these types override equals equality operator and gethashcode

16002947
hide	show
i took kasdega s suggestion of using classes and instead of trying to hide show a pair of options i used replace to manipulate the element s value

16002953
put	get	keydown	keyup
however for some reason it doesn t seem to be receiving the message as i ve put messageboxes in both the keydown and keyup cases and they don t get triggered

16003078
subnet	vlan
there are multiple subnet sitting inside this vlan

16003115
post	get
i made the following function to get the like count of a public post

16003122
post	get
why doesn t the post guest get filled

16003127
minimum	max
the goal of this script is to run 5 tests on one string detecting the string length of each string while giving the string a parameter minimum characters to input and max

16003127
min	max
it works 100 fine if you don t go over the max or min setup

16003146
mouse	keyboard
if by idle you mean absence of mouse and keyboard events from user and i understand your requirement correctly you should check the jquery-idletimeout plugin

16003153
portrait	landscape
for instace i m trying to set a media query so that i can have different layouts in portrait and landscape views on the ipad but it looks like safari is simply re-sizing or zooming rather than loading the media query

16003176
charindex	substr
i want to show the result by inputting query using substr and charindex only

16003182
mouseleave	mouseenter
you can attach mouseenter and mouseleave functionality on all current and future elements like this

16003182
mouseleave	mouseenter
hover is equivalent to mouseenter and mouseleave so hover cannot be directly used with on

16003182
mouseleave	mouseenter
it s a little heavy to add both functionalities to hover so it s preferred to use mouseenter and mouseleave separately

16003193
post	get
will make a query string in post which you can easily access as you get on usuall form submission

16003197
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested this in the latest stable versions of ie firefox and google-chrome

16003215
integer	unsigned
the inline asm appears to access the power control register and save the result from the register into an unsigned integer in the first line to be called up at some point i expect

16003301
charindex	substr
two that they would constrain you to charindex and substr

16003301
charindex	substr
a slightly more clever way if you can drop the charindex substr requirements is

16003328
charindex	substr
your second charindex staffname return the position of the first whitespace and you are using this position as the length of the substr to get

16003337
hide	show
you still have to listen for the keyboard hide show notifications so as to know when to adjust the height of your scrollview

16003371
google-chrome	firefox
for local files firefox and presumably google-chrome too won t load a stylesheet that isn t in the same directory as the xml file

16003411
folder	directory
you would have to go even deeper in the directory structure if the folder you would have found are like models dtos or exceptions

16003424
disk	ram
since your entire dataset will fit easily into your ram you don t need to do anything clever with ordering it and don t need to use the disk space beyond loading the data in the first place

16003433
oncreate	ondestroy
more specifically my native library is being loaded in oncreate but in ondestroy it is not unloaded i don t even know if you can unload a native library here but at the next oncreate it is still the same process so all global variables from my native library are still alive with their state preserved

16003435
put	get
when using wsaaccept instead you get access to client remote ips earlier and can chose whether to accept or reject individual clients before they are put into the queue to be connected

16003436
width	height
i need to create a black uiimage of a certain width and height the width and height change so i can t just create a black box and then load it into a uiimage

16003442
rtsp	rtcp	rtp	rtcp	rtp	rtsp
based off of spydroid here is what i understand about rtsp rtcp and rtp

16003442
udp	rtp
transport rtp avp udp

16003442
rtp	rtcp	udp	rtp
i think what this is saying is that the client vlc in my case is listening on 65234 using udp for rtp and 65235 for rtcp messages

16003442
rtp	rtcp
also spydroid is listening on 44580 for rtp and 44581 for rtcp

16003442
rtp	rtsp	udp	rtp
now in the describe sequence for rtsp spydroid is telling the client m video 5006 rtp avp 96 i think this is saying that it will be sending the video via udp over port 5006

16003442
rtp	rtcp
so i have forwarded ports 8086 5004 and 5006 but i don t know which port to forward for the rtp and rtcp connection because it changes every time

16003528

richtextbox	textblock
so what i trying now is to replace all rich text controls with textblock s and replace the textblock with a richtextbox when the user clicks

16003761
richtextbox	textblock
i could also try to figure out the clicked character position on the textblock then create the richtextbox and set the focus and caret accordingly

16003761
richtextbox	textblock
for the record i am aware that there s more work to be done i need to make sure that the textblock appear identical to the richtextbox appearing later that tab behavior needs to be handled

16003961

ostream doesn t have such a constructor you probably wanted to use an ostringstream and something like

coldfusion	railo
i have come across very very few incompatibilities - one trivial one i can think of - with coldfusion in railo s cfscript implementation

16004101
coldfusion	railo
railo on the whole strive for cross-compatibility with coldfusion with their cfml and they generally only veer away by design when the coldfusion way is just wrong in any sensible way of measuring such things

16004696
onclick	onsubmit
replace your button with a submit input and move the function to form onsubmit instead of button onclick

16004704
implements	extends
in general the rule of thumb is to use an interface if you can cause a java class can implements many interfaces but extends only one class

16004706
rdf	owl
rdf rdfs and owl are means to express increasingly complex information or knowledge

16004706
rdf	owl
owl serves to build ontologies or schema on the top of rdf datasets

16004706
rdf	owl
as owl can be serialised as rdf xml it is theoretically possible to query it via sparql yet it is much more intuitive to query an owl ontology with a dl query which is usually a standard owl class expression

16004708
implements	extends
on the other hand if your classes simply need to have the same signatures then go with an interface which is much more flexible you can for instance implements several interfaces but you can only extends from one class

16004715
abstract-class	superclass
so the decission is to define a superclass that is an interface an abstract-class or a instantiable class

16004715
abstract-class	superclass
the abstract-class when there are no objects of the superclass but the implementation of some methods will be shared by all or nearly all the subclases

16004744
mongodb	bson
it s also better just to grab objectid from the mongodb or bson libraries instead of reaching so many levels

16004748
width	height
it needs to get the height width attribute of the image elements

16004752
put	get

as reusableuiview inherited uiview you can easily config its sizes and positions using frame properties and adding it as a subviews on parent view

16004982
post	get
to get you started you need to register the return url thankyou.php with paypal and then the instant payment notification ipn will be submitted to the registered url as a post object you should verify the post object with paypal to ensure it is valid after which you can parse the fields and extract whatever data you need to complete your own process as required

16004985

just like firefox and google-chrome allows you to do in their developer tools. i want to be able to do this without the use of fiddler

16005136
width	height
alternatively your solution could be x0 y0 width height if its somehow simpler i can adapt my function s parameter input by it

16005136
min	max
all i can tell is that they are unsigned integers min 0 and with unknown max

16005157

you check if a point is in a rectangle by checking that x and y are between min and max of a rectangles x and y range

16005269
dmz	was
also pc was placed into dmz to avoid any port forwarding issue

16005271
implements	extends
in case this background information is helpful the sparse_matrix module defines an abstract data type which the csr_matrix module extends and actually implements

16005311
for-loop	arrays
i tried to use the property in a for-loop using the arrays s length property but the length property is unavailable in the current scope

16005324
post	get
at the end of this i would like to just run one query function using eloquent orm and get all post and their respective data regardless of post_type

16005339
put	get	post	get	post	put
i have also tried using the push method on the system event queue to put my own in and override the post method i get all my invocation events and i get component events but no key events

16005340
dbcontext	objectcontext
this is a static method of objectcontext so you can readily use in in a dbcontext environment

16005350
for-loop	arrays
iterate through the character arrays using a for-loop as follows on iteration 1 if the first character is equal to the last character then proceed to the next iteration else return false

16005352
width	height
i enclosed the entire nav bar in a div called cont and gave it a set height and width

16005358
post	put
as a side note when posting these kinds of things it helps to post the error number and put a comment or some kind of indicator of where the error is happening so we can see it in your giant blob of code

16005389
int	chars
function printbill â accepts 4 arguments a string account number a chars service code an int total number of minutes used and an amount due

16005460
getter	setter
the .attr function when used with two arguments works as a setter while as a getter with just one argument

16005557
actionlistener	changelistener
it seems a bit unusual that you re jbutton is triggering a changelistener and not an actionlistener

16005558
folder	dir
if you used tokens 2 the environment variable folder contained the value dir

16005558
folder	directory
after the loop is done lastfolder contains the folder of your current directory

16005644
put	get
the response is fine if i do a put response.body i get the body of the webpage

16005648
min	max
if you only need to checks aabb collisions only have to determine min and max coords of every vertex in the bounding box to compare with the bounding min and max.

16005648
min	max	width	height
in a space the min vertex is 0 0 0 and the max vertex is width height depth so you only have to check if the bvertexinaspace vertex are inside.

16005673
appfog	heroku
here is my code for a node.js tcp server hosted on both heroku and appfog

16005822
width	height
this should not be a problem as the width and height are always calculated based on the children position and sizes

16005823
int	chars
if you represent 1 to 2 pow n int in binary and place your chars in the place where 1 is present finally you would get the solution

16005865
hide	show
each time the function is called it either hide the cursor if it is currently visible or show it if it is invisible

16005865
hide	show
in order to realize different delay times depending on the state of the cursor the above code advises the internal function that show or hide the cursor

16005900
mouseup	mousedown
i ve got a volume buttons that bind to the the touchstart and mousedown events and the touchend and mouseup events i ve also tried touchleave and touchcancel

16005932
int	boolean
a single boolean which is true if any of the remaining bits in candidate is set and a single boolean which is true iff candidate is int

16005951
required	placeholder
however inserting placeholder keys is inconvenient and should not be required

16006001
children	parent
you would think that defining the association in one direction would automatically create the association in the other direction but apparently that s not the case and you must define the association on both parent and children

16006069
operands	scalar
a list operator in scalar context returns that to which its last operands evaluates so

16006088
viewdidload	viewdidappear
and i set self.pat in viewdidappear animated and viewdidload

16006093
int	chars
there are five standard signed int types designated as signed chars short int int long int and long long int

16006093
int	chars
therefore int8_t is either signed chars or an 8 bits long extended non standard signed int type

16006093
int	chars
as said the c99 standard section 6.2.5 4 quoted above defines 5 standard signed int types chars is not one of them and allows implementations to add their onw which are referred as non standard signed int types

16006093
int	chars
types bool chars char16_t char32_t wchar_t and the signed and unsigned int types are collectively called integral types

16006093
int	chars
therefore chars is an int type but chars is neither a signed int type nor an unsigned int type and section 18.4.1 quoted above says that int8_t when present is a typedef for a signed int type

16006093
int	chars
this also implies that chars is not a signed int type as defined by 3.9.1 2

16006093
int	chars
i admit that my interpretation and specifically the sentence chars is neither a signed int type nor an unsigned int type is a bit controversial

16006100
hide	show	fadein	hide
i have tried fadein i ve tried chaining together a few different combinations of show or hide or toggle or fadetoggle

16006115
stdout	stderr
i am trying to store the stderr and stdout in our database for the future debugging purpose of our background processes

16006115

i want also the capture to be transparent like a proxy by that i mean that i want to still have the stderr and the stdout outputed to the regular logger in plus of our database one

16006126
udp	tcp
the source and destination ip address and port are present in every tcp segment or udp datagram

16006143
implements	extends
mock objects are objects which take the place of an object which depends on an external resource by either extends it or by implements the same interface but only simulates its behavior

16006173
google-chrome	firefox
this happens on google-chrome firefox and ie latest builds

16006286
int	chars
you are reading your file for int but more than likely that file is filled with strings or chars

16006321
post	get
i have noticed that every post request returns the form authorization cookie with empty in its value while get requests do not send back auth cookie

16006341
entity-relationship	diagram

16006347
int	chars
that all those fields in the structure are actually chars arrays or equivalent pointers rather than int population for example

16006401
post	get
so in a deleteview the get request returns a confirmation page and a simple post request with no fields except for the csrf_token actually gets the deleteview to delete the object upon which the user gets redirected to the success_url

16006401
post	get
it seems like while unit testing no matter what kind of data i try to send in the post request it still gets treated as a get request.

16006427
post	get
if you absolutely have to fix this and are willing to get down dirty with performance counters this blog post might be of help

16006450
put	get
but you ll need to put some smarts outside of wget to get that behavior

16006468
x86	64bit
32bit vs 64bit make absolutely sure that your application is set explicitly to x86 not anycpu

16006498
firefox	safari
also it works just fine in firefox but safari and chorome it breaks

16006563
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox

folder	directory
i ve run across a problem now however where when i m trying to read from files the streamreader is trying to read from the previous folder directory

16006607
onkeyup	onkeydown
use onkeydown or onkeyup not onkeypress

16006607
keydown	keyup
whereas keydown and keyup respond to the user pressing buttons not typing text.

16006613
ubuntu	debian
in debian ubuntu there s an opensource look into this written in c

16006618
cos	exp
if your code includes mathematical functions like exp cos etc.

16006627
post	get
however i cannot find any information or examples on how to format a request to this url variables get post auth header etc.

16006627
post	get
using a jsonserviceclient to send username and password variables by get or json post to auth basic with and without an auth header also containing the user pass

16006654
awt	swing
make sure you have a read through custom painting and painting in awt and swing for more details

16006666
put	get
however when i put nothing in attempt to sign up and get the error the rest of the page will move down

16006667
folder	directory
having tagged this with xna your root directory should also be specified to a relative place content data etc. so that when the executable boots up it ll look in where the executable is + inside the folder content or data

16006673
hide	show
you don t have to remove the view you can simply show hide it nothing wrong with it

16006680
umount	mdadm
to do this you must stop lv and mdadm and have the drives umount in a system

16006687
punctuation	words
i m new to python and i m trying to make a function which is able to detect if a string has the words i i m my was our me replace it with you you re your were your and you and also add a question mark at the end if it did not end with any punctuation

16006697
put	get
alternatively put everything in just one table with null-able fields that get progressively filled as the booking advances

16006717
put	get	post	get	post	put
then you can set the method attribute post put get delete and the action attribute the path to the php page to process the values

16006776
rss	feed
you can also capture the rss feed from that weather station

16006776
rss	feed
read this article if you want an an example as how to parse a rss feed

16006835
portrait	landscape
i would like to only change between portrait and landscape orientations on a function call not by the user holding the device

16006859
int	chars
one to hold int frequencies values and the other is to build a c style chars array to simulate a two dimensional c array an array of chars arrays

16006859
int	double
if we want double frequencies instead of int then we may need to reduce the size of the strings appropriately

16006860
erd	diagram
but i ve been trying to understand how to create a proper erd diagram with a database full of a few tables

16006890
put	get
if i find i have a bottleneck in how i m using channelspecific because of too much vtable overhead i get to refactor and put a mega-function in it

png	ico	gif	png	gif	ico
this script just caches ico jpg png gif css js gz files not html

16006926
versioning	upgrade
this wrapper makes it more simple to setup a development environment configure ci and manage upgrade to future versioning of grails

16006926
versioning	upgrade
when the application is upgrade to the next versioning of grails the wrapper is updated and checked in to the source code control system and the next time developers update their workspace and run the wrapper they will automatically be using the correct versioning of grails

16006995
division	multiplication
for example combining the maximum value division and multiplication by 100 into 1 step

16007000
int	double
as a final recommendation i would say that unless another piece of your program demands 100 - -100 if you re using float or double using the range -1.0 1.0 is infinitely nicer to work with and can be a lot more powerful when doing things like scaling numbers and such that go into other inputs and outputs including raw int values that will go into a server

16007016
hide	show
it is easy to implement but my problem is with the show or hide of the label the layout of the whole page will be changed

16007017
logmein	hamachi
eth0 is my wan interface and has external ip accessible from the internet and ham0 is an interface to a small vpn network logmein hamachi

16007058
post	get
these post also get tweeted into their twitter account using the twitter gem

16007058
post	get
the post table has a verify column inside it which defaults to false however certain post will get flagged as true

16007085
postgresql	mysql
mysql supports regex and for data validation you should use a trigger since mysql doesn t support check constraint you can always move to postgresql as an alternative

16007146
vim	emacs
not quite production ready yet but you can check out which has a web ide and ssh with emacs or vim and git integration

16007180
min	max
it is as juergen d says sql functions like max min and using limit will only return 1 certain number of rows based on their conditions

16007205
disk	ram
boot each of the ides from a ramdisk and you ll see that they boot equally as quickly from ram the first time as they do from disk the second time

16007207
int	chars	int	double
leaving out the condition checks the variable against the default zero value for its type 0 for chars 0 for int 0.0f or 0.0 for floats and double null for pointers

16007216
implements	extends
i thought about using bundles but then i would have had to extends the float class to make it implements parcelable

16007243
google-chrome	firefox
tested in ie7+ google-chrome firefox

16007311
packets	multicast
i wish to send udp multicast packets to loopback address and receive the same in other application

16007319
draggable	droppable
destroying a plugin means reverting the added behavior that is removing both draggable and droppable behavior from the affected elements

16007319
draggable	droppable
both the droppable and draggable plugins provide a destroy method to revert the changes made

16007343
equals	gethashcode
note normally equals does not need to use gethashcode first

16007343
equals	gethashcode
dictionary the main reason gethashcode exists always checks hash code itself before calling equals

16007343
equals	gethashcode
in most cases both gethashcode and equals are implemented as per-member hash comparisons

16007343
equals	gethashcode
so unless you know for sure that your class caches result of gethashcode there is no practical reason to check hash-code in equals as you ll end up touching each twice and equals can short-circuit comparison if first fields are not equals unlike gethashcode that need to use all most fields to compute result

16007356
post	get
to use jsonp in this scenario you d have to change the service to return information via get as you can t post using jsonp

16007390
updatepanel	onclientclick
when i place a button in the updatepanel i expect a partial postback and i expect the button s onclientclick event to be fired

16007420
clutter	cairo
i m playing around with clutter cairo and i m trying to draw a rectangle

16007446
boost	eigen
since i wanted to be able to do some simple arithmetic operations on the data structures i decided to use eigen map rather than boost multi_array since it offers a wide range of operators as well as a clear documentation

16007446
boost	eigen
thus the higher-level loop is handled by boost fusion for_each and the lower-level loops are handled by eigen

16007464
spaces	delimiter
with fixed delimiter like spaces you can also use

16007494
pull	push
on the top right of the window you will see push a file and pull a file option

16007494
pull	push
push is push a file to your emulator and pull will pull a file to your computer form your emulator

16007503
coalesce	isnull
the problem is when i use coalesce or isnull it s possible to return incorrect results

16007511
int	chars
check the manual that corresponds to your mysql server version for the right syntax to use near id int unsigned not null auto_increment login chars 128 not null passw at line 3

16007535
folder	directory
i have made sure that all files folder are within the same directory as the file being debugged

16007540
post	get
what you have to do is read through the entire post body using file_get_contents php input to get the json-string

16007547
versioning	upgrade
i have successfully upgrade to vs2008 but any versioning after that doesn t have cr anymore so my company would have to pruchase cr separately and because the client and my company are both tight i m looking at alternatives.

16007550
portrait	landscape
so this helps somewhat except that the font size is now different for portrait and landscape and this causes the scaling to change each time orientation is changed

16007560
packets	multicast
i wish to send udp multicast packets to loopback address

16007569
button	checkbox
i thought i had a simple task of hiding 2 button unless a checkbox is checked

16007644
super	abstract
we know that the super is object since there s no explicit extension and that super.clone must return an instance of cloneclass it can t return an object instance since that s abstract and it s being downcast to cloneclass so it must be a cloneclass or descendant instance

16007646
jison	pegjs
you can write your own parser using jison or pegjs

16007688
implements	extends
also have 2 extends to abstractaccount.class basicclass.class premiumclass.class and abstractaccount.class implements account.interface

16007759

below is a simple expect script to supply openssh root admin password for remote ssh server and execute the unix linux bsd commands

16007763
width	height
check if your svg is missing height width declarations

16007792
int	boolean
specifically for you code it could look something like that you can use boolean instead of int and asign the value in the function

16007795
multiplying	add
if you have the same code but for a sign you could add a encode decode parameter to your function call and multiplying the thing you are adding by -1 if you have the encode version

16007797
ssl	https
most probably you should simply pass the password in plain text over ssl https

16007797
ssl	https
all communication in ssl https is encrypted so it s probably not a good idea to encrypt the password as well unless you need to ensure the web server technically the https terminator cannot see the password

16007797
ssl	https
if you want to use http basic auth this might be a ssl https end point to ensure the passwords are handled securely

hash	md5
when i try install a package with pip it complains about a bad md5 hash because what it is actually retrieving is the proxy server s denial page

16017399
margin	height
all margin and border elements are retained but the div has a height of 0

16017430
pull	push
zmq is clearly working because when i push messages to the pull socket it receives the message so pull and push seem to be working fine

16017462
width	height
your best bet here will be to set the width and height properties in the tag itself plus maybe the viewbox and preserveaspectratio i don t know if that s necessary then scale the tag using percentages

16017548
int	boolean
using gettype and strtotime the following function checks whether it s boolean int float or date

16017567
post	get
when your jquery adds a new row increment a counter variable in your form then in your perl code use that to loop through your vars this will work best as a post but you can use a get if you need to and read up each line you need

you can adjust the resolution with the height and width properties while adjusting the size s display trough the style

16017879
vim	emacs
i m a vim user trying to feel at home in emacs

16017893
children	parent
i m trying to create a parent div inside a list element that contains two children div for the left and right

16017940

your best option would probably be to use a or instead of an image style it to display inline-block with suitable width and height and then you can change the background-image property in your media queries

16017943
many-to-many	one-to-many
so rather than having this defined as a many-to-many between classa and classb i have two one-to-many relationships defined one on classa and on classb pointed at a third intermediary class we ll call it relationship

16017964

16018056
packets	multicast
it appears that zeromq will aggregate data on the server side when using the pgm and epgm protocols and send multiple updates in the same multicast packets

16018067
width	height
by this way setting parent reference in inflate width and height about cell will set

16018122

boost	stl	int	double
dgleich notebook 2006 03 sorting_two_arrays_simultaneou.html which uses boost stuff which i assume breaks the compliance with stl also honestly i don t understand all the template stuff used there i have a double and an int array and the size n of both so i don t think i need templates and finally this

16018312
int	chars
also these may sound like a stupid questions but is the unsigned part of the int pointer declaration necessary do i need to write inital_value+1 or can i just write inital_value+1 i dont think it matters here because sizeof chars is one so allocation size could be rewritten as 1 64+1 and do terminating null bytes need to be the same type size as the rest of the array

16018326
min	max
if datedem - date_ope 0 then i must select the operation with the max idoftheday else i must select the operation with the min idoftheday

maven	cargo
i can probably switch from using the tomcat maven plugin to using cargo to get coverage but i d prefer to stick with the tomcat plugin if possible

16018756
width	height
my next thought was to use the setrotation method of the relativelayout which is my root container to rotate it 90 degrees - that works great but the width height doesn t adapt itself to the size of the screen

16018756
width	height
what i end up with is the relativelayout rotated by 90 degrees but the width and height are still in landscape

16018756
width	height
i tried manually setting the width height of the relativelayout control by setting it s layoutparams and although that sorted out the width the height is incorrect as it only takes up half the screen

16021908
sse	avx
vector operations like sse avx would not help either - you are not doing any intensive calculations

16021908
ppl	tbb
increasing work amount per iteration is also useless - both ppl and tbb are smart enough to not create thread per iteration they would use some good partition which would additionaly try to preserve locality

16021968
doc	rtf
this causes word to process the rtf text and format it as a word doc with the fonts margins etc which i think is what you re looking for not to see the rtf text verbatim

16021988
post	get
all requests are http get post requests if that matters too

16023087
int	chars
in java chars is technically a 16-bit int so you can simply cast it to int and you ll get it s code

16023126
instances	transient
i thought that if you registered a view with the ioc container as singleton then the same instances would be reused each time you navigate to it while registering the view as transient would create a new instances each time you navigate to it

for-loop	arrays
you would probably not find it ugly to run through a single for-loop if you only had one arrays to parse through

16023628
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
now you have two arrays obviously so if the minimum amount of loops for one arrays is one for-loop then the minimum amount of loops that you need for two arrays have to be two

16023628
prepare	execute
and you can now easily prepare it execute your variables into the query without being vonurable to sql injections the difference is really the non-prepared queries run commands meanwhile the prepare ones are plain strings

16023829
maven-failsafe-plugin	maven-surefire-plugin

16024054
button	checkbox
from what i m seeing in addition to creating the forms for creating new list items and defining the list items you also set the url for each list item action namely when you click the checkbox next to a list item the ribbon bar has button for view and edit which in theory you re supposed to set to the form page url s for such as viewitem.aspx edititem.aspx etc

16041194
width	height
when using media print highcharts seems to ignore with width and height in the screen section and instead use the values from the display section

16041207

google-chrome	firefox
in cases like this you can use google-chrome s developer tools of firefox s firebug on the examples demo pages to find the actual files used and avoid issues.

16041653
width	height
you just need to divide everything by the width height of the parent view or layer

however t2.js finish-loading callback works only for google-chrome v26 firefox ï¼ˆv17 and ie10 but not for microsoft ie8 windows 7

16042126

dbcontext	objectcontext
i ve changed my dal codebase from objectcontext ef4 to dbcontext ef5

16042170
post	get
you should be executing a get request and not a post

16042170
post	get
to my astonishment the api call works even when a post call is made to get the resource

16042170
post	get
regardless of whether post works or not you should still use get for this call

16042198
width	height
the best you re probably going to be able to do is to use gltexsubimage checking for gl_invalid_value to search for the size â my reading of the gles man page is that width height 0 isn t an error condition so you can hunt for the greatest x y that s accepted without actually uploading any data

16042209
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
viewwillappear viewdidappear not being called not firing

16042217
hash	md5
gumbo - no md5 is not broken but the main purpose of hash like md5 now and in the past was for file checking as you know to check if the contents of the file can be trusted not password storage as hash are very quick to decipher since you wouldn t use bcrypt to check the contents of file since you wait for 30 - 45 seconds.

16042226
hash	md5
then the md5 hash are compared and everything works correctly

16042243

16042293
getter	setter
it then seems that if i have a getter and setter for count e.g

16042293
getter	setter
i.e i can seemingly access count through count or _count because i have a getter and setter

16042293
getter	setter
for something like the above is good oop practice to have the getter and setter or simply call _count++

i want to write these packets from this tunnel which is stored in a bytebuffer to a pcap file

16042404
packets	pcap	jpcap	jnetpcap
i ve looked at jpcap and jnetpcap but they seem to only support creating the pcap file from the packets that were captured by using these libraries to listen to the device s network interfaces in the first place

16042404
packets	pcap	tunnel	packets
if i were to create my own pcap writer how would i go about parsing this packets from the tunnel and put it into the pcap format

16042405

you could also use a getter setter

16042563
qbytearray	qtextstream
just do a readall into a qbytearray no atend check you ve already done isreadable then point a qtextstream at the byte array if you want to parse it the same way

16042618

16042894
super	implements
they re super easy to implements

16042928
width	height
i m not sure how you crop the image on the server side part of the script but what you could do is add an extra button called use full image in which the post data x y width height would be the full size of the image

16042928
width	height
the users chooses full image size so you send datas pretty much like this 0 0 1000 200 position 0 0 and width height 1000 200

note that strcmp is case-sensitive so if you want strings such as red or red to also return true use the case-insensitive strcmpi instead

16043048
implements	extends
i can t think of anything like the c++ option but you could extends implements your button listener and add a new method without the parameter and have that method called in the original event method

16043060
submit	submission
am currently stuck where most captcha have their own submit form but i need one that is submission to this one

16043287
inherited	subclassing
__subclassess__ just find the direct subclassing of a class not the inherited tree - so it won t be usefull in real life - maybe it is in the specifc case the op has in its hands

inherited	subclassing
if one needs to find things across a inherited tree one needs to recurse over the each subclassing as well

16043288
equals	gethashcode

pbkdf2	hash
relative to pbkdf2 the phpass algorithm uses hash where pbkdf2 uses hash_hmac

16044003
pbkdf2	hash
well for a given runtime pbkdf2 will run approximately 37.5 more hash than the phpass algorithm

16044003
pbkdf2	md5
so pbkdf2 is approximately 37.5 stronger than phpass when using the same primitive md5 in this case

16044003
pbkdf2	md5
so we can use pbkdf2 with sha512 to gain a very significant advantage over the phpass algorithm mainly because sha512 is a harder algorithm with more computation than md5

your get set functions look like the syntax as i d use in java - this does work in actionscript but they won t be recognized as get set by the mxml compiler

that process could be your actual custom tcp ip stack or it could be something that tunnel the packets to your bottom box

16047176
tax	shipping
when the customer clicks a final place order sort of button doec with the updated shipping and tax amounts

16047176

here is an example gtk 3 cairo skia

16047602

with that approach there is no way to know what group of images will belong to a fancybox gallery you would need more than one element sharing the same rel attribute because there is just a single pikachoose image every image is displayed toggling dynamically its href and src attributes and tags respectively inside the .pika-stage container

16048215

what you need is listview s capability to add a header view but unfortunately gridview doesn t offer that functionality

listview	gridview
what i have done in the past to solve this problem is to convert the gridview to a listview and then add the header to the listview

16049625
wordpress	vbulletin
a good way to get started is to download an open source project like magento wordpress or vbulletin and take a look at their schemas

16049625
entity-relationship	diagram
you can even introspect these schemas using mysql workbench and view their entity-relationship diagram erds which will visually demonstrate links between tables

16049629

16049783
verilog	vhdl
by the way did i say that having registers that are write only is a really bad idea because you can t read back to check if the software has set the register correctly which makes debugging really hard - and people writing drivers don t like debugging hard problems that could be made really easy by two lines of vhdl or verilog code

16049803
public	protected
p.s i used protected for my variables and public for my methods

16049827

1 set up the for-loop - do initializer check that we can perform the first loops

the image has to be the full width of the browser but still maintaining a certain fixed height

filtering	grouping
this grouping the list of kvps by key and then filtering it down to only those grouping of kvps with more than 1

16050080
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
because simply border-radius is not compatible with all old browsers and in new browser this must be used in many forms so that can be compatible with safari opera ie google-chrome mozilla so i think that using like this attribute in a website that may be access from old browsers is not very effictive

16050090
min	max
as you can see i have set the max font size to 18 and the min to 6 being .33 of the max size

16050098

google-chrome and firefox work fine

16050117

maven	pom.xml
if using maven make sure you add this to your pom.xml

16050302

onkeyup	onkeydown
try using the onkeyup event instead of onkeydown

16050385
post	get
the reason why this is secure and malicioussite.com cannot simply do a get steal the token and then do a post is that the request is done by the user s browser not by the server at malicioussite.com

16050385
post	put
the server at fakebank.com happily executes the requested post thus transferring funds using the parameters supplied in the post body which include a destination account belonging to the attacker that was put there by malicioussite.com

16050577
typedef	typename
the correct order is typedef typename and not the other way around

16050601

16050629
getter	setter
post is just an object that hold the individual post data url title publication date etc and postlist has an array that holds the post objects as well as some getter setter init functions

16050702
uiview	subviews
also any view-specific ui logic can be isolated into the individual uiview subviews

16050711
children	parent
some of the functors would operate on the data only then let the parent logic take over for children some would transform entire subtrees some would operate on the data and stop the parent logic from running over the children

16050711
int	double
we could even handle this must have exactly 3 children the first of which is an int the second is a bob and the third is a double if we went far enough down the rabbit hole

16054290
getter	setter

getter	setter
a nice point in python is that the day you will need getter or setter you will be able to do it totally transparently

hide	show
as to why it was happening the default behavior of jquery ui dialog is to show or hide the dialog div once the dialog has been attached to it

16062615
mongodb	bson
mongodb accepts input and responds with bson documents and that is in fact the return you are getting here

16062615
mongodb	bson
since mongodb requires a bson document return even if you could put the foreach into the query itself you would need an extra foreach on the return to iterate the bson document return

16062636
hide	show
i also want the buttons to show its div and hide the rest

16062682
post	get
so i have a form that collects some details in a panel the button forces a post back to the code behind where i create the video object and get the formuploadtoken

i d recommend using a graphics api for this opengl or direct3d but gdi would be the easiest option

16063058
super	extends
extends the notion if you write super it refers to constructor of the base class and if you write this it refers to the constructor of the very class where you are writing this code

16063072
nsmutablestring	nsstring
the common solution is having all instances immutable see nsnumber nsdecimalnumber etc. possibly having a second mutable class nsstring vs nsmutablestring or nsarray vs nsmutablearray

16063106
jobs	cron
i have two cron jobs first one should be executed every minutes and the second one should be done every two minutes

google-chrome	firefox
thanks to this article i was able to manually delete values by highlighting them and pressing shift+delete works in google-chrome and apparently firefox too

getter	setter
you can also create a wrapper class receiving entity as a constructor parameter and directly manipulating the data on the original object via getter and setter

16063355
for-loop	arrays
the nullpointerexception is most likely caused by the for-loop to insert strings into the wordsearch arrays

16063436
button	checkbox
i have a module where user will create some dynamic fields with his own choice like textfield textarea selectbox checkbox radio button then a form will generated on the basis of these selected fields

16063513
width	height
requirements are automatic vertical scrollbar and never horizontal scrollbar - minimal width which enlarges when the text is longer - maximum height and when there is more rows scrollbar should appear

16063589
getter	setter
i would test actual logic and not get carried away testing getter and setter

16063589
getter	setter
usually getter and setter get covered in the course of testing the interactions between the objects

16063711
children	parent
sometimes children need to extend parent functions

16063711
super	implements
most of the patterns i ve seen will either break when inheritance level is more than 2 levels child parent grandparent or use more resources by implements super through closures

16063711
implements	extends
not implements privates as closures would leak implementation and enable you or users extends your code to use members that are not part of your public api

16063721
queue	fifo
a queue is sometimes referred to as a fifo fifo or last-in-last-out lilo structure

16063955
hide	show
if i understand correctly what you re looking for is a way to specify the specific div to show hide for a given button

16063955
hide	show
on the show hide button add an attribute

16063955
hide	show
then inside the handler function you can get the name of the target div like this - and then show hide it directly like this - # # + target_id .show

16064054
min	max
each date field has a min max value set as a basic sanity check since my users like to type into the form rather than use date pickers and they often type dates like 4 17 0213

16064133
client-side	server-side
because dojob is a server-side function but onclick on that input element is a client-side event

team foundation server tfs keeps track of its local copy in a hidden directory called tf.when you issue the get latest version tfs looks into this folder and see weather i have the latest copy or not

16064468
folder	directory
in fact you might have deleted the entire folder as in my case and tfs won t fetch the latest copy because it does not look into the actual file but the hidden directory where it records changes

oncreate	ondestroy
android service oncreate is called multiple times without calling ondestroy and possibly service being re-created by alarmmanager

16064916
getter	setter
in .net libraries and also in many third-party libraries i can see that there is some convention in how to change the internal private member values they support properties .net properties or methods these are commonly used in java as setter and getter or both for programmers

16064916
hide	show
for example the visibility of a control can be changed using either visible property in windows forms or call to method show or hide

16064916
getter	setter
i know the advantage of properties over methods as getter and setter but if so why do we have to use methods in some cases they are presented to the programmers or even replace properties

16064936
folder	directory
windows will search several folder when looking for a .dll at run-time so you could put the dlls in the current directory a system directory definitely not recommended or another directory in your path environment variable

16064971
width	text-align
you could also use padding for the horizontal value instead of the width + text-align

16064973
getter	setter
i know the advantage of properties over methods as getter and setter but if so why do we have to use methods in some cases they are presented to the programmers or even replace properties

rss	feed
you should convert the value in the rss feed to a datetime object and use the comparitor then

all i need to do is resize and crop the image using php in such a way that it takes maximum possible height and width of the original size and also maintain the aspect ratio of the div that holds this image

16065864
width	height
i just need a logic to calculate a percentage that by how much div width and height should be multiplied so that the resulting size is closer to the image size but doesnot exceed the image size and also the aspect ratio will be same as that of div but not of image

16065921
folder	directory

since my database uses relational tables it looked like the best option to use innodb as opposed to myisam

16067523
inline	inlining
my guess is if you call a function defined in object file through ccall it can t be inline which makes sense since it is object-code not intermediate code - llvm approach seems more suitable for inlining through llvm ir

16067532

16067887
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
uinavigationcontroller presents uiviewcontroller and subclasses

16067887

16068229
superclass	subclassing
and now subclassing just needs to call the constructor of superclass

16068301

16068515
width	height
first in your main widget create two properties to hold the the minimum width and height

16068567
getter	setter
it s common practice to use a leading underscore for your instance variables so it s easy to recognize when you are accessing the instance variable directly versus the property which goes through the getter and setter to get to the backing instance variable

16068591
textview	imageview
i assume you are inflating a custom layout with imageview and textview

16068618

i m proxy-adverse because the graph will be serializable for caching purposes and deserialization croaks when working with fooproxy

16068643

16068658
folder	directory
this is happening in the array.xml file in the values folder in the res directory

16068685
mouseover	mousemove
this is done by using the mouse event mousemove which seems to be more what you want instead of using mouseover. mouseover requires you to move in and out of the shape to update the text value whereas mousemove will change the value even if your mouse moves along the line.

16068717
hash	salt
the smart way would be to store hash and salt but then it means that i would have to go like this

16068813
mouse	keyboard
take a look at mouse trap if you want to do keyboard shortcuts

16068871
width	height
the span element is an inline element and as such has no width or height

16068871
width	height
you must specify in the elements css that it should be displayed as either block or inline-block and then specify the width and height for the image

16068877
put	get
it says that .getjson is just shorthand for .ajax using a get request method so if you pass in an object with the key of what you are looking for then my guess is .getjson will put that into _get for you to grab

16068905
slideup	slidedown
the only way to add those content divs between table rows is to wrap them in tags which don t work with the slidedown and slideup effects

16069025
integer	fractions
integer threadcount is never going to have any fractions portion so it would be just as accurate to put the fractions zeros in the string and take the data as integer

16069050
width	height
additionally i d say lose your inline width and height declarations on #wrapper #mask and .item

16069053
beanstalk	amazon-web-services

16069236
textview	imageview
i have a relativelayout with an imageview and 8 textview s in it

16069236
put	get
i thought the best approach would be to rotate the image at 45 degree intervals and place a label at each position however the image relativelayout doesn t redraw even if invalidate is called until the next predetermind ondraw call and all the textviews get put in the message queue for positioning after that so all the textviews get positioned ontop of each other at the 315 degree mark

16069261
hide	show
on change of checkbox toggle show hide of element

16069285
post	get

google-chrome	firefox
but this doesn t work in ie i have implemnted the same thing for firefox and google-chrome using webkitfullscreenchange and mozfullscreenchange event

16069564
background-image	background-position
the idea is to have a single image with all the differents images states insides normal hover selected inactive etc you set the image as background-image and you just adjust the background-position value for the hover effect and others

16069568
superclass	subclassing
so create your own uiviewcontroller subclassing maybe oursuperviewcontroller that ll act as a superclass for your view controllers and add the logging there

16070883
fadein	hide
i want to make a fadein effect but i don t want to hide it because it screws with margins when the object is literally hidden from the document

16070884
writetofile	nsdata
you can use that to make the request yourself save the file to a a file url using nsdata writetofile atomically

16070985
versioning	upgrade
around 6 months ago the server had hardware problems and our former wordpress php expert rebuilt the site and upgrade it to versioning 3.3.1

16071005
min	max
âˆ 2â 10 9 â f k â 2â 10 9 k min i j n â max i j n

16071012
punctuation	words
it prints out the whole text passage words for words without any punctuation marks as desired but it wont print in ascending alphabetical order

16071015
folder	directory
you could go up to the root folder and scan all the directory and their subdirectories for .pdf files and store them in an array php scandir an array or a string with a caracter-delimiter between each filename

16071034
post	get
using post instead of send will let your background thread get back to its task immediately without waiting for the ui work to complete

16071041
client-side	server-side
you re breaking the flow of client-side code by issuing a postback the button click is calling a server-side event handler

16071059
folder	directory
if you have a folder data whith lost of pictures and copied to the android sdk-tools directory

16071117
post	get
is there a way to get score data for a user even when he marked app post as visible for only himself

16071122
put	get
when i put in the account number in the terminal window i get this error

16071171
google-chrome	firefox
as stated in the title this one-page site with minimal jquery is suffering from crazy lag on google-chrome and firefox but not on ie10

16071171
hide	fadeout	hide	show	fadein	hide	fadein	fadeout
i ve read that sometimes chrome is laggy with div hide s and show s but i m using fadein and fadeout and it seems like there s something i m missing

16071171
google-chrome	firefox
edit great responses but just to point out again - no lag in ie only in google-chrome and firefox

16071199
punctuation	words
you re printing the words twice once after you ve splitted the text on punctuation then again after you ve glued it back together splitted it again and finally sorted it

16071204
for-loop	loops
i will say that initially i had this code then changed the for-loop to a while loops

16071231
processors	hyperthreading
in an era of multi-core hyperthreading cpus processors is now an ambiguous term

16071231
processors	hyperthreading
does the processors refer to a threads from hyperthreading cores or sockets physical cpus

16071231
processors	hyperthreading
but the danger of this strategy is for example on a 4 core system with hyperthreading enabled then only one processors socket is used

16071231
processors	hyperthreading
since the first 8 lps 0..7 will be hyperthreading cores on the first processors

16071241
hide	show
i m a little new to extjs and i m trying to figure out the proper way to show hide elements

16071241
hide	show
now i want to show panel 2 and hide panel 1

16071286
hex	binary
it has to be in binary because due to my system i might be off by 1 bit or so which would throw everything off when converting to hex or ascii

16071306
width	height
for that i had to write a class named rectangularroom that takes in a width and a height and creates a grid

16071344
post	get
i have tried a variety of things but cant seem to get it to work and i dont want to use request.post.get because then that means i would have to send post variables

16071360
google-chrome	firefox
also i know that pdf files not produced with pdftk will render correctly on both google-chrome and firefox

16071437
post	get
first you should specify your method get or method post

16071437
post	get
edit actually get vs post isn t nitpicking

16071446
for-loop	loops
because the for-loop will start at 4 not 5 we need to do some basic arithmetics and increase the value of each item we loops through by one

16071554
post	get
you will need to create a html form with a post or get action that sends the data to a server then from there you can email the value to yourself

16071571
set	bag
it s a red-black tree that allows duplicates hence bag rather than set

16071579
move	drag
a click is simply considered a trival 0 pixels move drag but it is still a drag

16071579
google-chrome	firefox
anyway console.log with google-chrome or firefox js console open will fix you up nice

16071606
jlist	jeditorpane	jeditorpane	jsplitpane
i have a jlist and a jeditorpane sharing a jsplitpane

16071606
getter	setter
ok i have created getter setter

16071612
post	get
although the following blog post does not exactly cover your scenario you should get the idea from the code at the end of the text

16071621
for-loop	arrays
therefor we create a new arrays or does exactly the same and in the for-loop we add the rowdata arrays to this new array.

16071634
inherited	properties
you may as well just declare those properties as protected in the abstract class itself so the child inherited them

16071679
folder	directory
there are other parts of the script not shown that create and copy folder contents using the same source and destination directory and they work perfectly

16071705
portrait	landscape
if the screen orientation of the device is locked to portrait mode then my app still runs in landscape mode

16071711
coffeescript	haml
i m using coffeescript and haml

16071719
post	get
one more thing for logins you should use post not get so in your servlet change doget to dopost and in your login.jsp make the method post in your form tag

16071723
width	height
when a request for the image in various sizes comes through i get the filename by combining id - hash where hash is the hash of a combination of ids height width and some other information i need to get the image

16071747
button	checkbox
say we have an and we want to provide user with a message like dialog with only checkbox for each possible identifier value and ok button

16071764
unsigned	short
for larger numbers you may need unsigned short 2 bytes or unsigned int 4 bytes

16071850
post	get
but i don t want to use get because users will see the variables i want to use post so is a bit harder to hack

16071854
keyup	onblur
i d like to change it so it starts validating onblur and then after the first submit continues to validate on keyup as normal

16071863
google-chrome	firefox
i try and play the sound from inside a .click handler but although it plays in google-chrome it doesn t on ie and firefox

16071868
int	double
however my compiler still emits a warning because of a conversion from double to int which you should probably attend to by casting

16071911
uidatepicker	uipickerview
i don t believe this is possible with a uidatepicker but you could achieve this with your own uipickerview making sure to implement the uipickerviewdelegate method pickerview didselectrow incomponent in order to deal with bad dates like february 30th to mimick the behaviour of uidatepicker

16071925
required	placeholder
i could use a site master page and content placeholder but this also is not the same and required a different approach to developing my pages

16071937
pop-up	dialog
probably what i d do is pop-up a system confirm dialog on each platform

16071968
ant	maven
and a maven ant script that would timestamp the xml file during packaging of each module jar like this

16072003
integer	unsigned
however if you want a nice standardised way to ensure that the type is a 32 bit unsigned integer type i recommend using std uint32_t from the header

16072010
128bit	64bit
this header file actually comes with your compiler and assures you a minimum size but no maximum for bigger types 64bit 128bit

16072012
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested this in the latest versions of google-chrome firefox and ie

16072061
post	get
create a background job sidekick queue classic and have a simple job that does a get or a post or whatever on that second server

16072069
textchanged	keyup
use textchanged or keyup events to track changes and update

16072088
debian	linux
i would like to know what are the steps to make a vm i am using a debian linux machine act as a router forward traffic between two networks in virtualbox

16072089
button	checkbox
updated fiddle to account for radio button change along with selection of checkbox

16072123
onresume	onpause
also there s no way you can affect the behavior of the menu button in other apps so you wouldn t have to worry about the whole onpause onresume business

16072129
bash	subshell
when you run a subshell the part bash uses the fork system call which creates a copy of the calling process where your subshell commands will be executed

16072153
google-chrome	firefox
i m looking for a cross-browser solution with google-chrome + firefox + ie at a minimum

16072203
keydown	keyup
this process works on the keyup event but i have not managed to get it to recognise keydown events

16072254
versioning	upgrade
while you can upgrade across 1.8.7 to 1.9.3 i d recommend keeping 1.8.7 at its final release and install a separate versioning of 1.9.3 at its final release currently p392 allowing easy testing between the two for compatibility

16072254
versioning	upgrade
install ruby v2.0.0 also and as updates to it come out use rvm to upgrade those to the most recent deleting older versioning as you see fit

16072267
webkit	blink
blink first announced in april 2013 is a fork of webkit engine

16072267
opera	google-chrome
it is used in google-chrome 28+ opera 15+ qt webengine and some chromium-based browsers

16072268
webkit	blink
blink is an open source rendering engine forked from webkit

16072268
opera	google-chrome
it is included in google-chrome 28+ and opera 14+

16072272
getter	setter
in my research i have seen the following use static variables never use static variables use a getter and a setter getter s and setter s are evil global variables do not exist in java make it a public variable public variables should not be used and more

16072276
width	height
i have a div with height width of 15px

16072276
width	height
it has a background image also with height width of 15px

16072282
post	get
it s easy to get the simple login working with twitter and that s a big bonus but i was wondering whether it s possible to then take those authentication credentials and post a tweet get a list of people they re following generally use the full twitter 1.1 api

16072285
versioning	upgrade
i have that error when i try to open a project made in another versioning of avr studio or upgrade to another versioning by someone else

16072300
folder	directory
i would like to create a php script which reads the folder located in a specific directory and writes the names in a .html file the structure of the html should be

16072349
for-loop	loops
if you do try catch outside for-loop you ll stop processing the rest of loops

16072349
for-loop	arrays
try catch inside for-loop is probably closer as long as you don t mind the unassigned values left in the arrays

16072388
atoi	atof
i would strongly discourage you from using atoi and atof unless your implementation provides error checking atoi and atof update errno

16072396
portrait	landscape
- change the device landscape to portrait and vice versa with no issues

16072400
getter	setter
i can t speculate as to why your tutor did that but a common practice especially in jquery is to overload a function by having the same function be both a setter and getter based on what parameters are passed

16072410
put	get
i am writing a basic method to put get files from an amazon s3 bucket

16072415
hash	salt
you create a function which hash and stores the known password and typically salt it as well

16072418
min	max	range	max	range	min
also if i enter a max range of 100 and min range of 90 the program will still generate # s like 147 etc that are over the max range.

16072428
google-chrome	firefox
use either google-chrome or firefox s developer tools and you can easily locate the style that is overriding the one you are trying to set

16072436
min	max
edit to answer question from now deleted comment of why this does not produce values between min and max

16072436
min	max
so for example a min of 90 and max of 100 would generate numbers between and 90 and 190

16072436
min	max
to limit the values between the min and max you would need

16072439
width	height
using height width or css transforms

16072456
unsigned	short
note that if you don t cast it to an unsigned short before right-shifting the 1 s you thought you pushed off the left will still be there

16072467
free	malloc
otest 11105 0xb039f000 malloc error for object 0xa0f8000 pointer being free was not allocated

16072467
free	malloc
otest 11209 0xb0115000 malloc error for object 0x41dcc00 pointer being free was not allocated

16072474
getter	setter
i tend to use getter and setter simply because it s much easier to track method calls than it is a change of variable

16072474
getter	setter
if it s a class whose sole purpose is to hold values in variables then you might just want to use direct variable calls but if they are values in a more functional class you would probably use getter and setter

16072481
free	malloc
what you re doing here is technically valid c but you re creating a memory leak because you lose the address of the malloc ed memory which you must free when you re done with it

16072551
post	put
we did put a breakpoint before the post to make sure the serialization on the javascript was correct and the object was populated

16072557
ready	each
there s a separate template for each status state pending ready finished

16072565
post	get
use a post request to send the data and not a get request using url params

16072566
many-to-many	one-to-many
the preferred solution for modeling unowned one-to-many and many-to-many relationships in the app engine datastore see entity relationships in jdo seems to be list-of-keys

16072574
int	double
now i understand that this is probably an issue with 9 5 being interpreted as an int but what i don t understand is that using double or float it still gives the same incorrect output

16072586
int	double
you re still doing int math and then assigning the result to a double variable

16072616
int	double
since x is of type double the value is implicitly converted from int to double resulting in x holding the value 1.0

16072616
int	double
if a operator has two operands one of type int and one of type double the int operand is promoted to double so either of these will also set x to 1.8

16072616
int	double
which computes 9 5 as an int yielding 1 then promotes that result to double and divides it by 3.0 yielding 0.333333333

16072623
int	chars
one of your problems is that you are casting the entire array of chars to a single int

16072623
int	chars
this is very tough thing to do since the int cannot contain all 16 chars

16072651
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
also it was announced that jquery 2.0 now has more patches and shims for google-chrome safari and firefox than for internet explorer

16072713
google-chrome	firefox
2 this page works on firefox and google-chrome but not on ie

16072714
pop-up	dialog
for a signed applet running with all permissions to javascript call no security dialog with mixed code warning should pop-up

16072730
for-loop	loops
you assign this variable in your for-loop so the final value it keeps is the last value assigned in loops giftsidarr.getstring totalgifts

16072750
int	chars
found int to unsigned chars

16072764
bash	zsh
speaking of newer features if you are really using bash zsh ksh93+ then you can rewrite your sample code as

16072812
qstring	qdatastream
calling qdatastream writebytes when i just have a series of quoted strings and qstring makes for very ugly code

16072818
int	chars
and ctv is a function that converts each chars into its int value ie a to 1 and z to 26

16072843
put	get
if i put self join and put all the record where a is parent and i am only get a b c but not d and f

16072848
width	height
i m having a bit of trouble with a block of jquery code that sets the height of a menu bar based on the width of a logo contained therein

16072875
hide	show
on a navigation bar on rollover i want a little image to appear underneath using the show hide functions

16072904
int	chars
but the warning message implies that yields int and that bool is the same type as unsigned chars

16072917
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
you could try plain js though i would use form property access rather than getelementsbytagname or getelementbyid

16072919
profiler	aqtime
the best way to time your code is to use an external profiler like aqtime

16072936
hide	show
you cannot pass the element id class to show or hide

16072936
hide	show
besides will refer to #home hence it ll try to show hide the home element

16072971
width	height
however it seems to calculate the size before knowing the content goes below the height so doesn t factor the scroll bar width in

16072981
pull	push
i am using appsrc and appsink to push and pull buffer to and from the gstreamer pipeline

16073003
for-loop	loops
also it s worth noting that since you declared that variable inside the for-loop the variable will only be accessible until the next iteration of loops

16073019
prepare	pdostatement
please see pdo and pdostatement for prepare statements

16073037
for-loop	arrays
you ll have to declare something like an arrays or arraylist outside of your for-loop as shown below

16073047
put	get
one of the things i would do would be to put all of your data into a structure like an array list then when you get to the end of the input convert that structure into an array

16073056
put	get
as roman put it use system.time to get the info and calculate the timing yourself

16073061
addeventlistener	preventdefault
however it would be better to use standard event registration via addeventlistener and use the event object s preventdefault method to stop the default click behavior

16073092
ubuntu	debian
try this on debian ubuntu

16073097
width	height
use code above to get the height and width of your windows then use .resize of jquery to fire it.

16073144
put	get
in fact when i debug i can see the foo get put into the bundle and i can examine the bundle and see the instance of foo there but when retrieving it the cast fails

16073189
google-chrome	firefox
this works without issue in google-chrome but when i try in either firefox or ie the divs become a garbled mess and don t actually slide

16073232
min	max
i have a file that contains 4 numbers min max mean standard derivation and i would like to plot it with gnuplot

16073252
folder	directory
under web-inf classes check these folder org openfaces demo services and then check the class menuitem inside the last directory services

16073275
urllib	httplib
in fact httplib even says use urllib which uses http library

16073350
division	modulo
the modulo is the rest of the division meaning that it involves a division

16073379
width	height
using gdb when i get to the first line that the constructor is used universe width height wrap

16073384
maven	pom.xml
to launch selenium 2 from jenkins the best way would be is to wrap the test process in the pom.xml if you are using maven and then simply create a new job in maven using build a maven2 3 project in jenkins

16073390
width	height
meanwhile you should first assign values to width and height before using them with new

16073392
requestfactory	gwt
gwt 2.5 using requestfactory

16073397
rar	zip
download the java classes contained in the zip rar file from the downloads section

16073478
children	parent
for each row loop through all the other rows and find the children of that row ie those rows whose parent id equals the id of the row you are processing

16073489
put	get
what i am trying to do now is to get getsubmenu to return a string containing either a || a || b || b || c || c and then loop when the user does not put any of these as an input

16073489
int	boolean
i ve tried attempting to use compareto but i receive a type mismatch cannot convert from int to boolean error how can i improve on this

16073504
google-chrome	firefox
another way is open google-chrome browser content browser.xul then you will see a firefox browser window in tab open the parent window firebug the window object is what you want

16073519
post	get
during the first time i try to post to facebook i get this error after login and user authentication

16073520
for-loop	loops
the ++j in occurs at the end of the for-loop after the statements in loops are executed so there is no difference in a for construct between ++j and j++

16073527
width	height
however they seem to not resize the page if the height of the content is less than the height of the screen and then the width runs off screen

16073553
width	height
and then an error request for member width height in something not a structure or union

16073569
width	height
members width and height are used for member allocation sizing before they even contain definite values

16073569
width	height
you re width and height members can currently accept negative values which would make no sense to actually use and would wreak potential havoc with your allocation

16073585
i2c	spi
the status of spi should look the same as the status of i2c

16073592
tax	shipping

16073720
profiling	instrumentation
as soon as i plainly close instrumentation start another profiling from xcode and choose the time profiling it works if i go back to the performance counters it stops

16073755
opera	google-chrome
i loaded it up in ie google-chrome and opera but they all showed all 5

16073763
width	height
display block when not combined with a defined height width will try to fill it s parent

16073781
put	get
also you can make a get set function non-inline and put a breakpoint on it

16073798
folder	directory
i can see the exploded folder in the webapps directory of tomcat

16073864
chunked	transfer-encoding
transfer-encoding chunked

16073890
integer	unsigned
so i have implemented an entire unlimited unsigned integer class using a linked-list for a project euler problem i am working on

16073890
subtraction	modulo	division	subtraction	division	modulo
however subtraction and everything using it division and modulo doesn t work

16073891
addclass	removeclass
i have tried including removeclass .drag-element and addclass .animate-element and telling animate to act on that but it is still applying the animation to all .drag-element divs

16073899
public	protected
if you need some methods to be protected then append them without the action_ so that they can t be accessed by the public

16073899
switching	screens	post	get
alternatively you could switching to restful methods which is basically a way to respond to some input based on the type of query you get for instance when you receive a get request to the login page that means that the user needs to see the login screens when you receive a post request that would usually mean that the user is posting login data and accordingly you can respond which will help you cut down on the number of functions for more information on restful methods you can read this brilliant article by ryan tomayako at

16073899
post	get
and if you don t want certain methods to be accessed using restful methods then just don t include the action keyword get post ... in the function name

16073909
post	put
another thing put is not always supported try post - sometimes it ll work

16073916
openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	linux	freebsd	linux
i don t believe that either freebsd or linux exhibit the berkeley-derived behaviour any more although i m pretty sure i remember it happening on freebsd that could have been over a decade ago and i no longer have a freebsd box handy to test it on. openbsd seems to have been patched in 1999 to fix the problem see patch to 2.4

16073965
post	get
if we add another item to the studio field and post the same way we will get the same result

16073994
children	parent
i have three classes one parent and two children so to speak

16074005
notepad	scite
i usually copy the whole error into notepad or scite and edit it down to the actual command line with arguments

16074040
postgresql	mysql
this means you have to use database native auto-increment column mysql sqlite or database sequence postgresql mssql oracle to obtain next available id

16074049
puts	gets
even when i include puts review in the show method nothing gets returned in the rails console

16074052
post	get
i get more and more confused as i read through different post on this

16074062
range	infinity
how to query database about all events in range from now to infinity with limit 10

16074118
int	chars
1 is an int 1 is a string a chars array of length 2 containing the ascii chars 1 value 49 followed by a null byte terminator

16074118
int	chars
the function doesn t want an int it wants a chars pointer

16074129
getter	setter
getter and setter solve the issue of having to change all that code when you want do add a restriction to a value of a variable to do a validation or another functionality

16074129
getter	setter
but don t overuse get set functions getter and setter also break oo principles because they are still exposing implementation

you can also replace the outer while loops with a for-loop of n+1 iterations which will guarantee that the arrays is in order

16089150
profiling	debugging
if it does exist you need to figure out some difference between your debugging and ad-hoc provisioning profiling and look for that to determine which build you are in

16089152

i hope the answers are true for all the browsers ie google-chrome firefox

16089243
firefox	safari
even though this is adobe s fault for not sending the appropriate content-type safari could have fixed this problem in the fly as firefox does it detects binary files even if the content-type is not correct

edit if you really need to support older versions of ie the above works in 9 you can render the input twice and show hide it like this

16089671
entities	entitymanager
to be able to know which associated entities to remove the entitymanager can t rely on a detached entity since by definition this detached entity doesn t reflect the latest state of the entity and doesn t necessarily have all its cascaded associations recursively loaded

16089677
for-loop	arrays
i use a nested for-loop to check that the data points in the arrays are within certain x z bounds- and if they are i need to create a triangle out of that data

i had to create an app put in the settings into the plug-in and it s supposed to let me post blog post on my facebook fan page

16089788

all my view controllers are in portrait but iads always open in landscape mode

16089805

you can t because the width height editor lacks the fields to relate to another property or set the ratio

16089948
folder	directory
this works in that when a file within the top level of a directory changes the last write time of the folder is updated as well

16089976
google-chrome	firefox
use google-chrome s developer console or firefox and firebug and look at the response on the network tabs

16089983
getter	setter
i tried this to specialize the getter setter template

16089983
getter	setter
but that didn t work either because the getter setter template doesn t expect a typename as third and fourth arguments but pointers to member functions

16089983
getter	setter
which yielded template argument involves template parameter s for the getter and setter template arguments

16090022

16090157
src	attr
var src this attr href

16090178
serializable	deserialization
that s what the model binding is using and it s checking ignoredatamember for both serializable and deserialization making it useless for me since i want to only use it for serializable

16090178
serializable	deserialization
that allows deserialization to come in but blocks serializable from going out

16090230
floor	sqrt
first of all your example in ghci is not defining a special composition of floor and sqrt

16090230
floor	sqrt
instead it s defining an operator . which takes three arguments named floor sqrt and n and hides the existing standard function named .

16090230
floor	sqrt
you then apply your new function to the standard library functions floor and sqrt which become the parameters with the same names in your new . function

in order to prevent your form s submission you have to call preventdefault on event instance of a handler for submit javascript event of a form

16090658
hash	hmac
the utf-8 conversion is done automatically and it is very unlikely for the octet strings you need to hash in hmac to even be the valid utf-8 encoding of any unicode string

16090706
hide	show
i have been trying to create a placemark that i can hide and show like turning visibility on and off on demand on click .

16090733
portrait	landscape
if you were making a compass which displayed the direction of true north then you d need that to take account of whether your device was in portrait or landscape mode etc

16090733
portrait	landscape
however the measurements from the sensors don t depend on portrait landscape so if they re varying wildly then your problem lies elsewhere

16090745
getter	setter
it acts as both a getter and a setter so that calling myfunction 3.14 will set the closure and calling myfunction will get the closure s value

16090767
comparator	comparable
my contact class implements comparable and has a constructed comparator method that compares instance string variables

i am admittedly a novice when it comes to cdb adplus windbg but i know at least a few windbg sos commands to swim around a few crash dumps

16090889
for-loop	arrays
you should use a simple for-loop to iterate your arrays â it s a lot faster than using the jquery .each method anyway

16090891
cos	sin
this applies to all the other expressions in sin cos

16091009
put	get
you can also protect yourself against bitflips during transmission to and from s3 by providing an md5 checksum when you put the object we ll error if the data we received doesn t match the checksum and by validating the md5 when get an object

16091014
google-chrome	firefox
for an uknown reason a dash displays between the buttons in google-chrome firefox and ie

16091023
getter	setter
however i really don t see any advantages from using that pattern for a simple getter and setter

16091023
getter	setter
you closure variable is only accessible from inside the getter setter and the function does nothing more than simply setting its value without transforming it

16091050
width	height
i used the .svg format and the same height width they have links to corresponding pages via a href and are enclosed in list tags

16091077
google-chrome	firefox
in the developer console of firefox google-chrome it kicks out the slash

16091077
google-chrome	firefox
output in google-chrome same in firefox

16091079
equals	compareto
you also have a inconsistency here compareto 0 should be the same as equals especially since in both cases the only thing you seem to care about is name

16091090
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
the app i am building is a simple calculator that allows a user to add subtract multiplying and divide two numbers

16091110

16091173
implements	extends
the trick is to implements a robolectrictestmodule extends the abstractmodule

16091182
ready	each
there are known bugs before 3.2 so if you re on 2.x you may have to do some backporting. you will have to implement the code yourself and if you want it to be cross-platform you re going to have to do the whole mess that communicate does internally spawning reader and writer threads for the pipes etc. and of course add another thread to not block the main thread on each attempt to communicate and some kind of mechanism to message the main thread when the child is ready and so on

16091271
versioning	upgrade
that versioning of nservicebus is pretty old and i m fairly sure that we dealt with a problem around serialization of uris since then so i guess my recommendation would be to upgrade to a newer release and see if that resolves it

16091302
int	double
it would be more appropriate if c was a int array not double

16091312
stopwatch	dispatchertimer
to start i thought the startbutton_click should be transformed into a command which i generally put in the vm but if that were the case then just doing that alone would mean that i would have to put the declaration of the dispatchertimer and stopwatch into the vm as well which means that the rest of the code event hander its registration and so on would have to be in the vm

16091328
post	get
when you hit back on a page that used a post it resends a post rather than a get

16091328
post	get
the reason it doesn t reload post like that is because like you said it doesn t want to resend the information used to get that page to the server because it ll double post something or double buy something

16091353

i figured out how to inject non-ui-elements android into a testclass using robolectric and roboguice

16091543
recvfrom	datagram
actually this make sense for udp sockets because in winsock library which i guess is the underlying implementation of winrt sockets you always receive the whole datagram in one recvfrom call if you ve provided big enough buffer for it but i hope winrt handles this for us

16091546
fadein	fadeout
please note you have to let the fadein fadeout finish or the problem will not occur

16091787
apache	lighttpd
the php interpreter is generally invoked by a webserver like apache lighttpd ...

16091791
children	parent
is it because of the button element because if a child inside a div has a background color and the parent background color changes it basically overwrites the children s background color

16091794
button	checkbox
the code is for a checkbox form with a submit button that works like a price filter that when submitted it s supposed to echo the username product and price that matches the corresponding checkbox

16091794
button	checkbox
if a user selects a checkbox labeled 0-25 or 100 above and clicks the submit button it supposed to echo all users that have items in that specific price range

16091958
memcpy	memmove
in some cases compilers provide intrinsics for memmove and memcpy that are much faster than the code they would normally output due to normal optimizations

16091965
google-chrome	safari
i have tested by logging in with google-chrome and then with safari and the google-chrome session was killed

the best would probably be for you to upgrade to the lastest jquery versioning - 1.9 atm

16092021
toolbar	docking	toolbar	tabs
visual studio 2012 has the same window toolbar docking auto-hiding feature as 2010 but i noticed that the tabs don t stay in order anymore if you use the pin then unpin them

16092021
toolbar	docking
this kind of defeats the purpose of docking windows toolbar for me since i put them where i ll remember where they are

16092023
memcached	apc
if you decide to keep the similar_text function you can implement the pagination on the array with an array_slice preferably only creating the order once and saving the information in some cache memcached plain files apc cache... so the subsequent calls with this input can be served without recalculating the order thus being faster

16092032
button	checkbox
the events you get are text changed button clicked checkbox checked .

16092061
fadein	fadeout
this process of traversing up and down a list of jquery elements waiting for each animation to finish could be abstracted so that it could be used for other things besides fadein and fadeout

16092193
post	get
you can access your form elements from example.php by get and post variables

16092196
min	max
the simplest way is to just provide the same min max for each axis

16092196
min	max
it would be a pretty simple to determine a good min max based on the data before the plot call combine the arrays take the min max round down up to nearest int would be my approach

16092201
unsigned	short
i have trouble with figuring out how to put 9 char into an array of 4 unsigned short in c programming

width	height
as rockafella suggests using an absolute positioned span would work hence it appears not ideal for me since your span has 100 width and height

16093199
spaces	delimiter
it appears the words must be spaces delimiter before feeding them to the tagger

16093214

if i could make a suggestion about libraries i ve used tablesorter before and eventually switched over to datatables

16093954
sorting	filtering
excellent library with sorting filtering etc

16094215
recvfrom	datagram
the next time you do a normal recvfrom the datagram will be removed as normal

16094284
int	double
if you limit yourself to a few distinct possibilities you can of course write a function like object parse string which would convert the string to one of a few possible types which have non-overlapping string representations - int float double bool date with a particular format or fall back to string if nothing matches

16094292
short	base
sorry because i m not able to give you a short example program but the code base is very large and complex

16094321
google-chrome	firefox
tested with firefox 19 for windows and google-chrome 26 neither working

16094361
width	height
because in math if you define volume to be height width length and you modify any of those variables then the volume changes

16094361
width	height
initialize height length width etc

16094371
htmlspecialchars	domdocument
this is not fully true you can do that with domdocument by going through all childnodes and picking entity nodes next to character data but it s much more work as just outlined with htmlspecialchars above

16094392
ubuntu	linux
i am new to linux using terminal in ubuntu virual box environment

16094404
super	extends
if you want to create an activity then you must extends the activity as super class

16094416
.htaccess	httpd.conf
enable mod_proxy in httpd.conf then enable mod_rewrite and .htaccess through httpd.conf and then put this code in your .htaccess under document_root directory

16094506
solaris	aix
this gets either cygwin or linux â or darwin on mac os x and equivalent names on aix solaris hp-ux â and avoids the multiple arguments issue and only runs one command instead of two

16094507
entity-relationship	diagram
your entity-relationship diagram s wrong

16094510
textmate	sublimetext
this is a feature in both textmate and sublimetext 2 but i haven t found it rubymine yet

16094526
for-loop	arrays
then you can make simple for-loop to enumerate the items in the arrays returned by grid.jqgrid getgridparam data

16094575
google-chrome	firefox
the thing is it works ok in firefox and google-chrome but iexplore just says actlink is not defined translated from spanish actlink no esta definido and actlink its the function called when the combo box changes this is what i have

16094575
hide	show
the fnc1_0.js has a function to show hide elements and a named to substitute the getelementbyid notation here it is if you need it

16094603
google-chrome	safari
this is working beautifully in google-chrome and safari including mobile devices

16094658
debian	linux
the way i do is everything i work on gets saved to a network share on a debian linux machine

algebraic data types binary tree as trie keys

16094935
google-chrome	safari
however in google-chrome and safari when i do this the float right from the internal style sheet seems to be ignored

16094988
integer	unsigned
we ve been given some files in hdf5 that contain data sets tabular data in which each column is named and may be of a distinct data type author of type string count of type unsigned integer etc. the only pure-java non-jni library i can find for reading hdf5 is netcdf

16094991
postgresql	mysql
which is rather nasty as it implies mysql syntax i m using postgresql

16095035
post	put
so on my web based app i would have an html form to update a user profile this would then be sent as a post as html forms do not allow put requests

16095052
sudo	nohup
of course in your case you re actually spawning a command with a list of argumentsâ one of which is itself a command to spawn and a list of arguments sudo and so on a few steps down the line nohup bash and finally tcp_sender and obviously pexpect can only help with the first of those steps

16095063
post	get
i think you confused between http post and http get that s why you did get the product as null

16095063
post	get
you could have a look at what s the difference between get and post

16095078
put	get	post	get	post	put

16095121
implements	extends
public class typenewmessageactivity extends activity implements texttospeech.oninitlistener

16095131
disk	ram
this is typically sufficient for most tasks since you can leave shared_buffers fairly small even on a system with tons of ram and let the rest of the ram be used as operating system disk cache

16095152
factors	matrix
the first is a continuous variable that multiplies every term in the model matrix and the second is a factors -- it makes a different surface for each factors level

qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
i have a big scene successfully displayed in my window with the help of qgraphicsview qgraphicsscene with scroll bars for navigation

16095173
apache	nginx
although it is kind of natural to assume that the rewrite rules in apache would be mapped to the rewrite in nginx they aren t

16095208
factors	mean
looks like a gini mean difference apart from a scaling factors

16095276
allocator	stl
typically a shrunk-to-fit vector will have the lowest space overhead of any sequence container since other than a few pointers and or counters the only space overhead will be the space for the elements themselves and any space used by the allocator which will be unavoidable for the stl containers you describe

16095288
disk	ram
since i m planning to use ram for varnish storage should i have additional third varnish and use disk for storage for explicitly those archived pages

16095289
pull	push
i push from my notebook to the cloud repo and then i pull from the cloud repo to the bare repository

16095293

hide	show
the key is to toggle any show panes to hide them before toggling the new selected pane to show it

16095411
hide	show
i just wanted to hide first my dynamic object behind then when the user click a button it will show up

16095425
jscrollpane	jviewport
because grabbableviewport extends jviewport i d guess that you re supposed to use it in a jscrollpane as shown here

16095434
google-chrome	firefox
i can reproduce the results on both google-chrome 27 and firefox 20.0

16095443
comparator	comparable
the first thing to note is that we are coding to a contract - specifically the comparable interface which requires you to have a method comparator that takes one parameter call it arg and returns an int

16095450
centos	linux
can 15 million files 4t be stored in a single directory in linux centos

16095476
mouseup	mousedown	mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup
you can simply capture the mousedown mousemove and mouseup events to do this

16095486
hide	show
the following code hide currentimage and show the next one or in your case it ll navigate somewhere else when all the images have been show

16095486
hide	show
instaed of an image you could add several div elements in the div with the id imgcontainer then hide and show these instead of an image

16095536
portrait	landscape
if it is in portrait the viewport width is 320px and if it is in landscape the viewport width is 533px

16095560
google-chrome	firefox
this time both firefox and ie worked but google-chrome still had the same problem

16095562
postgresql	mysql
is completely nonsensical for both mysql and postgresql

16095603
nsstring	nsjsonserialization	nsstring	nsdata	nsdata	nsjsonserialization
to get the data out of json you would use the nsjsonserialization to extract the data from your json object -- the deserializer will probably return your literal data as an nsstring which you then would convert into an nsdata by decoding it

16095610
post	get
for a complex object in a get request you may consider using a post instead

16095648
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested this situation on ie firefox and google-chrome

16095685
bash	zsh
you can do this with coprocesses in ksh or zsh or by using fifos in bash

superclass validations apply to all subclassing

16095776
min	max
you re usually much better off phrasing such queries as select max ... or select min ... where possible

16095815
setinterval	settimeout
use jquery + settimeout or setinterval to hit the endpoint

16095817
libstdc++	libc++
another tip you have to build boost and your project with libstdc++ it does not work with libc++ i don t know why

16095819
hash	hmac
the non-oo hmac function exported by digest hmac assumes that the custom hash function passed to it will accept multiple parameters and concatenate them

16095836
for-loop	loops
i have a for-loop that is designed to take in a target number and loops through the stack until it finds the data at stack target and it is supposed to return that data

16095848
post	get
so far using large limits 5000 which is the max and timestamps to try and fetch post from the last two weeks using until and since for home and in the stream table but i only ever get the last 2 or 3 days of news feed post around 200-300 post

16095859
folder	directory
- add folder to root directory i18n

16095869
nsorderedset	nsset
if you now put it into an nsset or nsorderedset just the first object with the same name will be kept

16095870
public	protected
you will need to subclass the webview to promote the protected onscrollchanged to a public method

16095872
pull	push
i can connect push pull file to my device using the adb command

16095896
post	get
so it s taking the most recent 5 post from the comments row on 1_comments and sorting them by their most recent timestamp but i can t seem to get it working for 1_comments 2_comments and 3_comments all at once

16095914
width	height
also i checked the width and height vars by echo function and they are ok

16095942
ubuntu	linux
noticed that people on linux and ubuntu have this problem sometimes but i m on a mac os x 10.7.5 so the same solves for them didn t work through terminal

16095966
ubuntu	linux
when i run the program on linux ubuntu 2.6.32-24-generic i find that the cost too long printing shows 1 2 times in a minutes

16095994
memcpy	calloc
using calloc and memcpy should have caused strvv to maintain copies of strv at each iteration of the loop independent of the values in strv

16096027
sudo	passwd
so actually in this shell i can run sudo without passwd

16096030
width	height
as far as i could see on the website you have provided they are using simple one image which is 400px x 400px and the other which is 53px x 54px and it repeats both ways height and width

16096050
post	put
so my question is what should i do to take the variables inside the input text and password field to put as a post variable then to send it with the javascript

16096088
filtering	grouping
create a filtering that splits your array in grouping of three and nest the grouping

16096141
integer	unsigned
this makes php read the byte stream assuming it represents an unsigned big endian long and convert it into a php native integer

16096143
matplotlib	scipy
i also have scipy matplotlib and mayavi2 installed

16096175
post	get
first thing its not in good fashion to post coding assignment in a forum to get help with for a job

16096191
int	chars
this is because when you grab an int from the scanner it doesn t consume the n chars that gets put on the input stream when the user hits enter

16096217
client-side	server-side
since your session is a server-side event and your onchange event is a client-side event you ll need to use ajax in order to change your dropdown options without refreshing the page

16096239
next	except
the next iteration in the loop will overwrite the value anyway which means all threads would be likely to see the value count when they dereference the pointer if it hadn t been clobbered as above and except for rare cases where the launching thread is suspended during looping allowing a thread it spawned to read some earlier i value

16096264
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this is working fine in google-chrome firefox and opera but it does not work in internet explorer 9 10 unless i enable compatibility mode which then breaks my layout

16096320
cdr	cons
however the caveat to this assignment is i can only use cons car cdr cond if eq assoc and setf to complete the assignment.

16096320
cdr	cons
dr is there a way to implement the list procedure using only cons car cdr cond if eq assoc and setf

16096338
codeception	mink
i am trying to test my ajax scripts using codeception phpbrowser which uses mink with goutte driver

16096342
put	get
it has operations put and get

16096356
folder	directory
files in directory cheese folder veggie txt file meat doc file

16096370
folder	directory
then without doing an svn update first svn mv the parent directory of the file whose move rename was previously committed - and finally do an svn commit on the change of the directory name - or as accepted answer puts it you also need to update and commit a file contained in the folder but not update the folder itself

16096417
cdr	cons
a list is just a bunch of cons cells linked one to the next with nil as the last cdr

16096426
children	parent
note that i ve used for the text and for the parent below but if you want to do this with block level children like more elements then you should use as the parent instead

16096445
g++	gcc
you should be using the make variable cxx to build c++ code not cc and setting it to g++ not gcc

16096484
hide	show
for best results set a height to the outer wrapper or else you can get a oscillating show hide effect since the panel will resize itself due to the different amount of text which means that that the mouse may not be over the panel about to be displayed so the hover state will be instantly reverted to not-hover hence re-triggering the show hide effect

16096507
apache	nginx
i am using apache and nginx as a proxy server

16096518
put	get
i have managed to put together some code that will get one item using a class name by passing it through a loop i then pass it through another loop to get the text from the element

16096540
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome as the tutorial suggests but i get unable to connect errors from both

16096571
filesystems	hfs
i suspect that the mac s file creation time is a relic of the hfs filesystems and really doesn t point to a file creation time as much as the time the directory entry was first created

16096643
packets	multicast
when boot up a linux server some multicast packets are sent out

16096670
for-loop	arrays
your for-loop should also start at 0 not one the first element in an arrays is

16096678
put	get
the logs i put in the code below should get you started with what you want to do

16096706
folder	directory
i resolved it by adding one line in the asenv.bat file in the config directory of glassfish server folder

16096758
accessor	properties
it s a little unusual to see in objective-c code especially these days because properties and properties accessor are often preferred to direct instance variable access

16096781

16105354
scipy	sympy
first of all if it was not for the relative complexity of the expressions here scipy would have been definitely the better option over sympy

16105354
scipy	sympy
but the expression is rather complicated so we can first simplify it in sympy and only then feed it to scipy

16105354
scipy	sympy
now given that you are not interested in symbolics and that the simplification was not that good it would be useless to continue using sympy instead of scipy but if you insist you can do it

accessor	properties
in my opinion it s not best practices to raise an exception from the get accessor of a properties

16105627
content-disposition	content-type
you could of course adjust the response content-type if necessary and also append a content-disposition header if you want

16105693
accessor	properties
yes as properties are just a syntactic sugar for calling accessor methods you can set symbolic breakpoints to them

16105693

if you want to track both setter and getter calls you will need 2 breakpoints for -property and -setproperty methods

16105826
getter	setter
you should use property because that s the modern way to define properties on objective-c objects even if you implement the setter and getter yourself

16105866
getter	setter
implement getter and setter for the fields that exists for one type and doesn t exists for other much more simple to use

16105926
hide	show
i m creating a log in form and i am doing hide show states in javascript

16105930
children	parent
you should not rely on the constructor property of the prototype to call parent functions because normally that property should point to the children constructor

16105930
children	parent
another way of doing this would be to store a reference to the parent prototype in the children prototype

16105930
children	parent
another interesting approach i ve seen is to wrap every function of the children prototype in a function that dynamically sets a reference to the parent function on the object instance so that you can only use this.parent to call the function

16105940
width	height
i can change the width of the slider in the css under div.orbit-wrapper and the size of the image under .orbit img but when setting the width of the img to a percentage the image dissapears and on developer tolls says it has a width and height of 1px â

16106211
post	put
this means we should use the http put method to update the post with id 123 and trigger method add_current_author in postscontroller

16106211
post	put
as most browsers don t support the put method ruby on rails tricks that by sending the post parameter _method i got this from michael koper in his answer to ruby on rails - put method on update ajax

infobox	infowindow
you should just perform your own ajax request for the content and supply that to the infowindow infobox

16106636
integer	fractions
it was designed as an integer because well we re going over distinct positions in the data so there was no conception of a fractions move

using ng-hide and ng-show is better then doing it manually maybe something like this for the directive template

16106744
uiview	subviews
2 instead of using uinavigationbar use uiview and add subviews to make it exactly look like the uinavigationbar and use it

16106774
perceptron	sigmoid
the main two differences between a multi-layer perceptron and a rbfn are the fact that a rbfn usually implies just one layer and that the activation function is a gaussian instead of a sigmoid

16106775
portrait	landscape
it looks and works fine when rotated to landscape orientation but when rotated back to portrait although the content adjusts the viewport stays stuck at the landscape size

16106819

everything is working fine with get requests and post requests with text html data

16107206

you can set nearly everything width height font size color etc.

16107227
folder	directory
i currently have a program that connects to an ftp directory if it finds csv files runs a script then after the script has run on the files it creates a back up folder with the date and moves the csv files to this newly created back up folder in the ftp directory

16107227
folder	directory
however if there are no csv files in the root directory i do not want a backup folder to be created as there are no files to move

inherited	properties
if myvalue is in your viewmodel that inherited from your viewmodelbase then all you need to do is change the implementation of your properties to

16107252
getter	setter
my workaround is to add each property to myviewmodel and reference the property in the model in each getter and setter

16107270
filtering	grouping
one can do it in sql by grouping job_parameters by job_id and filtering the grouping accordingly

16107308

qmainwindow	qwidget	qgraphicsview	qwidget	qgraphicsview	qmainwindow
you reimplemented wheelevent for qwidget qmainwindow that contains your qgraphicsview however wheelevent of qgraphicsview remains intact

16107317
qmainwindow	qwidget	qgraphicsview	qwidget	qgraphicsview	qmainwindow
you can derive from qgraphicsview reimplement wheelevent for derived class and use derive class instead of qgraphicsview - this way you won t even need wheelevent in your qwidget qmainwindow and you can customize reimplemented wheelevent to do what you want

16107345
g++	gcc
if you are compiling c++ code use g++ instead of gcc

16107415
getter	setter
if you declare a property the compiler normally auto synthesizes an ivar and the getter and setter methods

16107415
getter	setter
but if you explicitly define your own getter and setter methods the compiler no longer auto generates an ivar

16107415
getter	setter
so if you define both setter and getter the compiler leaves it up to you to decided if the ivar is needed or not

16108045
width	height
you can stop this by giving it a fixed height and width along with display inline-block

16108045

what i am having problems with is i need another function called bounds1 which will take in just a list and return a min max pair

16108561
disk	ram
your server doesn t have enough ram and is swapping ram - disk process becomes extremely slow

16108594

what you can do is use what achintya used then starting from the min add dist to it and that is the max of your first interval

16108684
int	boolean
fixed the check on hasrows returns a boolean not an int

16108696

to build upon 6twenty s answer...i prefer panto latlng over setcenter latlng as panto animates for smoother transition to center if the change is less than both the width and height of the map

16108863
put	get
in this case you will need to put the table in a partial view that will get included by the main view and you will use ajax to call a controller action and pass the currently selected value of the dropdown which will be used to filter the results and return a partial

put	get
alos take notice to the fact the i include the in my string not in my parameter so rememer to only put just the name of the sheet you are trying to get

16109182
hide	show
you d need to replace with something like that would show hide a separate div which contains the contents of item.html that could be bound to

16109193
width	height
and use the dip unit for the height an width attributes

16109196
hide	show
this uses nothing more than jquery s show and hide methods

16109257
drawstring	paintcomponent
you can use drawstring in your paint method like they show here but you should probably override paintcomponent instead

16109281
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine using an actual mouse wheel on windows 7 under firefox google-chrome and ie but on a mac os x using track pad causes zooming to happen much too quickly

16109655
hash	salt
even with a unique salt attached to the hash hashing is bad on credit cards for example because there are only x billion or trillion or whatever possible card numbers so if you have a salt a hash and a decent processor you can reverse engineer the card number in a reasonably short time

16109667

instead of using the visible property and changing that during a postback high overhead use a style property to hide the hidden stuff then use jquery to show it

16109827
prepare	bindvalue
my question is how do i use the prepare and bindvalue methods of the pdo and pdo statement object respectively inside my foreach loop so that each newly inserted variable is both safe to use like they are when they are passed to the prepare method and than inserted into the statement using bindvalue

16109885

16110039
for-loop	loops
it s hard to tell from the very schematic code but if all you want to do is sync up every so many iterations it seems easiest to pull the iteration loops out of the parallel omp for-loop - which seems clearer anyway - and just do

16110054
width	height
this will erase the xmls original height and width setting

16110054
width	height
just because you are leaving the childparams width height blank in code doesn t mean a value is not set

16110054
width	height
the fix would be to first save the view s existing layoutparam s height width and use that when creating the new layoutparam dynamically

16110054
width	height
that will allow you to keep the width height in xml while applying the row col specs in code

16110058
google-chrome	firefox
this will work in google-chrome and firefox

16110076
width	height
i noticed when printing out the superview s frame s width and height after the orientation change that it s width and height don t change after the first rotation then is not what i would expect afterwards

16110076
width	height
by unexpected i mean when the device is in portrait mode width 480 and height 320

16110076
width	height
when the device is in landscape mode width 320 and height 480

16110076

one big difference between crc32 and md5 is that it is usually easy to pick a crc32 checksum and then come up with a message that hash to that checksum even if there are constraints imposed on the message whereas md5 is specifically designed to make this sort of thing difficult although it is showing its age - this is now possible in some situations

16122368
hash	md5
if you are in a situation where it is possible that an adversary might decide to sit down and create a load of messages with specified crc32 hash to mimic other messages or just to make a hash table perform very badly because everything hash to the same value then md5 would be a better option

i ve got a one-to-many parent-child relationship and i want to persist the entire thing only once

16125246
factors	mean
if by constant amount of memory overhead you mean that for n elements the space consumption should be n + o 1 then neither the balanced trees nor the hash tables have this property -- both will use memory where due to extra node pointers in the case of trees and the load factors in the case of hash tables

16125273
stdout	stderr
to get the time to print out you should print it to stderr since you are printing the ppm output to stdout

16125292
hide	show
we would create a function that would perform this evaluation and show or hide the submit button based upon the value of the first name field

16125361
uiview	subviews
this reference cannot shouldn t be obtained from uiview when added as a subviews

16125396
button	checkbox
unrelated to the concrete problem you correctly used click although you could safely omit it altogether but your question title mentions change and that is indeed the wrong event for a checkbox and radio button

16125406
google-chrome	firefox
it works on firefox google-chrome and ie9

16125504
spaces	delimiter
so for example if i paste special that as unformatted text with spaces delimiter and then convert 0.01 to a number which would then say 0.0001 if it did what i wanted it now says 0.01 in the cell

16125514
post	get
once you have the buffer read don t ty and consume it in the reading loop post to another thread and allocate another buffer but get them from a reuse queue dont keep using malloc

16125525
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
since you want to loops through 2 arrays simultaneously it is best to use a regular for-loop on the indices rather than a foreach loops

16125574
int	chars
usr include boost archive basic_xml_iarchive.hpp in member function â void boost archive basic_xml_iarchive load_override t int with t unsigned chars archive boost archive xml_iarchive â â

16125685
ubuntu	linux
i m on a ubuntu linux running this with root privileges

http happily post all the data as different elements of the same variable and you can get them back in django via request.post.getlist name

16125740
public	protected
to change an already constructed object you need to use it s public and protected in case of a derived class members

16125752
getter	setter
i came up with a simple python script that will implement whatever you leave out including the internal variable the getter the setter and the notify signal

16125794
mdpi	hdpi
ldpi mdpi hdpi etc

16125801
strcpy	strcmp
this means you need to check the pointer points somewhere valid before you can do this strcmp and strcpy

16125838
free	malloc
by default a pointer just points to some area in memory - you must allocate it by hand with malloc before using it and release it using free

16125872
put	get
one of the reason ng-bind put the variable in the watch list and only when there is a model change the data get pushed to view on the other hand will interpolate the expression every time i guess it is the angular cycle and push the value even if the value changed or not

16125877
for-loop	loops
in any case since you re not even using loops variable process you should consider if a for-loop is the right structure at all

16125892
folder	dir
you wil need to make a function that scans your dir like scandir and loop trough all the folder found by that function and rescan each folder again with scandir

other answers have noted jackson and gson - the popular add-on json libraries for android and json.org the bare-bones json package that is included in android

16126019
gson	jackson

int	chars
the conversion will stop at the first chars that could not be part of the second int unless there was an error earlier

16126335
hash	md5
if it s md5 hash then you won t be able to easily reverse them - but you can re-use them by getting your own forum software to compare the md5 hash of the user input with the hash in the database just like your old forum software did

16126335
hash	md5
both md5 hash and sha1 have set lengths so checking type is trivial

16126345
for-loop	loops
the inner for-loop isn t doing anything for you it s just continuing the iteration started by the outer loops

16126379
ready	each
because you are receiving interdependant data asynchronously and at each receiving point you assume that you have all the datasets ready in your hand which is not.

16126379
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout is better than setinterval here because setinterval will start at every 5 secs but settimeout will start once each time your job is done and wait for 5 seconds which will make your script adaptive to server response timings

16126384
spaces	linefeed
the text in raw text and rcdata elements must not contain any occurrences of the string u+003c less-than sign u+002f solidus followed by characters that case-insensitively match the tag name of the element followed by one of tab u+0009 linefeed u+000a ff u+000c cr u+000d u+0020 spaces u+003e or u+002f

16126388

you may want to store a hash password with salt

16126518

16126636
comparator	comparable
you are mixing up the interfaces comparator and comparable

16126636
comparator	comparable
a class that implements comparable s sort order can still be overriden by a comparator

16126636
comparator	comparable
on the other hand if the class is not comparable than also passing a comparator is mandatory for ordering to be possible.

16126681
comparator	comparable

the calls to malloc and free are intercept fine

here s an example of a subclassing that overrides part of its superclass s api to forbid its use

16126977

note that i m using getter and setter methods which is generally not very pythonic but easy to understand better is to use property s

16126977
getter	setter
the area method is inherited and still works as expected in the square class as will other code for rectangles that only calls an instance s getter methods not the setter methods

16126983

in that loop there is a table row that gets hidden by default with a class of scorers there is then a show hide button to say weather to show or hide that row

16129926

so far i have successfully created the desired layout in lastest versions of ie firefox google-chrome and opera

16130407
width	height
that s because the margin-top if set in a percentage it is proportional to the element s parent width and not height as one would normally expect

16130425
width	height
then you need bpp bits per pixel and width and height to create image

16130462

16131649
opera	google-chrome
because of the need for wrapping only google-chrome opera and ie10 can do this

16131658
std	ostream
this works actually quite well except if the statement does not start with an overload from std ostream but a custom type directly instead

16131658
ostream	ostringstream
however it now still breaks on the type conversion to the base class be it ostringstream or ostream

16131696

16131777
width	height
i do not want to actually cut down the size of an image i just want if the width of an image size is more than the width of webpage then the tool should set its width to my specific given width and the height accordingly

16131803
post	get
according to this post when run bundle get invalid byte sequence in us-ascii adding this at the top of your gemfile should fix it

16131817
ostringstream	std
the first problem is that std ostringstream is non-copyable and you are trying to create a copy of it while creating a copy of buffer

16131817
ostringstream	std
but you should be aware of the fact that some implementations of the standard library are not fully compliant and do not implement the move constructor of std ostringstream

16131877
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
eventually i need to either send an object from the server to the client or vice versa using objectinputstream objectoutputstream

16131891
implements	extends
an interface can t implements another interface but it can extends any amount of other interfaces

16131903
implements	extends
interface extends another interface but not implements it because interface won t contain the implementation

as far as i can see it does also connect to the iboutlet and ibaction in the controller

16132110
g++	gcc
displays a single lower-case l compiled with g++ -wall itsols.cc -o itsols both with gcc 4.7.2 and with gcc 4.8.0 and also with gcc 4.6.3

16132110
g++	gcc
take the habit to always pass -wall to g++ or gcc also passing -g while you debug your program with gdb later optimizing it with -o2 when there is no bugs and also check with g++ -v that you are running the compiler you believe and to get its version

16132157
button	checkbox
when i edit my datagridview s columns property i can see 1 a read-only checkbox in the add column dialog between the visible and frozen checkbox near the ok and cancel button and 2 a read only property for each added column in the behavior area if you re using categorized view

16132181
implements	extends
my custom listview com.foo.vieweditlistview extends listview implements android.widget.adapterview.onitemlongclicklistener

16132196
int	double
so the most practical approach is to double the number round to an int boundary then divide by 2

16132196
integer	fractions
another way to do it is to separate the integer and fractions parts and then use a simple if ladder to format the fractions part separately

16132226
screens	hdpi
when you provide hdpi assets the system scales them down by one half to properly fit ldpi screens

16132231

i managed to get the request post string gmail uses to fetch more images using

16132311
post	put
the overhead of creating a session is miniscule there s no real reason you d need to session_destroy though you could put the session_start in the block that detects post rather than at the top of the script if you only want to use the session when the user post

16132340
try-catch	exception-handling
i ve tried catching an exception-handling in a try-catch but nothing gets returned

16132353
width	height
i know the viewport which is set by directx scr_w scr_h the orthographic projection matrix was created by directx api with parameters view width view height near far

16132363

i m thinking about overload functions isn t it a faster way to perform in example addiction without define the function a lot of times with different arguments and outputs int float double ecc...

16132419
ubuntu	debian
if you are running debian ubuntu this should solve it

16132419
redhat	fedora
on centos redhat fedora probably this should work

16132441
ssl	https
however uploading whatever is entered in here when the user submits will send it plainly across the internet unless you re using https with a valid ssl certificate which will encrypt all communications between the user and your site and is recommended for anything with a login

16132472
versioning	upgrade
since i upgrade to the last versioning this behavior disappeared

16132490

16132581
width	height
you can use gdi library tools to find out the image height and width aswell as other information

16132647
width	height
to do things on a percentage basis set the width or height for horizontal or vertical linearlayouts respectively to be 0dp then assign android layout_weight to the desired percentage 20

16132671
jar	manifest.mf
while reading about why the jar didnt work i also read that you need a manifest.mf file so i created one and inside this manifest file i have the following text

16132737
system.in	system.out
following normal conventions is system.in and is system.out

16132753
createjs	easeljs
filters like createjs.alphamaskfilter are not included in the main package of createjs and easeljs

16132803
unix	bsd
assuming that you are talking about linux unix bsd .

16132803
system.in	system.out
by the time your java application is called the shell has already figured out what the pathnames resolve to opened them and connected them to the file descriptors used for system.in and system.out

16132803
system.in	system.out
so you just code your program to read from system.in and write to system.out

16132808
width	height
the image banner is supposed to be 2000px width by 400px height but i would like it to not effect the page size by adding the scroll bar

16132819
children	parent
i d first start by getting the children id s of the parent category storing them in a list and then passing them in as a parameter as an include

16132914
children	parent
in this case the parent element s width is shrink-to-fit the content and the children s with are also shrink-to-fit but each child is on a separate line because they are still block level elements

16132916
versioning	upgrade
for example if you have 42 sites that you want to upgrade from versioning 1.9.2 to versioning 2.0.0 do you hand edit 42 files or is there some tool that will do this for you

16132943
super	extends
super class extends or mixins with also assurance on instance methods not constructor

16132965
portrait	landscape
i have managed to get the view to stay in landscape when rotated manually but if the device is already portrait it stays portrait regardless of its supported orientation set using supportedinterfaceorientations method

16132972
children	parent
from the parent s view you can t access directly to the children s controller like that

16132975
google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly in google-chrome and firefox

16133010
queue	fifo
i have to write those methods for a template class which is a fifo queue whose maximum number of elements is declared at construction time

16133010
put	get
it seems to be working correctly whenever i leave the two std cout lines in get and put uncommented getting the following output as expected

16133048
portrait	landscape
this is a strange error to me because it only occurs when i switch from portrait to landscape on my emulator

16133048
portrait	landscape
my widget launches fine on portrait when clicked but switching to landscape by hitting 7 on my numpad and clicking the widget will open the mainactivity the first time but then on subsequent clicks the widget stops opening the mainactivity...and stops functioning altogether

16133064
pull	push
i would prefer to push the outer loop into an iterator that pull down blocks of data and keeps track of the index into the external api etc so i can write code more like this

16133070
treemap	linkedhashmap
it can use a map as its data nucleus but the map will need to be orderable in some fashion i think for this to work well perhaps a linkedhashmap or a treemap

16133125
mouse	keyboard
note i m aware of multiple cursor usage with the keyboard this question is specifically about mouse usage

16133130
implements	extends
it is possible from php 5.0 you need to use the php s class iterator interface and extends it implements in your apiiterator class

16133143
sudo	passwd	sudoers	passwd
the alternative is much simpler just tell sudo not to ask for the passwd for just this command by adding this to your etc sudoers file

16133165
for-loop	arrays
i am using a for-loop which iterates i time and every time it is checked whether the ith number of the arrays is greater than 1 or not

we are using emgucv opencv to process our stream

16133231
min	max
this one checks for a jquery line which expects a id or better the # sign and after that a slider function where the parameters min and max are inside

16133231
min	max
the first result is the id the second one the min value and the third one is the max value

16133236
heapsort	in-place	mergesort	in-place	mergesort	heapsort
memory is another factor to consider for example mergesort typically runs in the same time complexity albeit with a lower constant factor but in twice the space as heapsort i say typically because an in-place mergesort is usually o n 2

16133236
quicksort	mergesort	quicksort	heapsort	mergesort	heapsort
radix sort runs in o n as opposed to heapsort mergesort quicksort which run in o n log n but hardly anybody uses radix sort because it requires much more memory and has poor cache performance

16133254
put	get
because we cannot pop pc i assume because r1 and r3 would be out of order and r3 was chosen they could have chosen r2 and saved an instruction there are two pops one to get rid of the dummy value on the stack and the other to put the return value in a register so that they can bx to it to return

16133278
int	double
i think that what you want to do is to declare your zombie s x and y fields as double not int and thus the setx ... and sety ... methods would accept double and the getx and gety return double

16133318
post	get
i ve tried implementing the solutions in the answer to my previous post but i couldn t get these to work

16133328
folder	directory
create a directory called tmp in the folder where you have mediawiki installed

16133331
folder	directory
you must have a folder inside your res directory called res xml and inside it have your .xml file

16133354
min	max
defines macros for max and min which interfere with yours

16133354
min	max
this is the common solution recommended for using some stl headers which define min and max themselves

16133356
put	get
if i put this line inside the mainactivity there is no problem but the problem is that i dont get updated location i just get same location because its created only for one time

16133360
google-chrome	firefox
i tried opening it with google-chrome 26 and firefox 20

16133368
sorting	filtering
bind to sp using .tolist will resolve that error but it will loads all records from database first and the performance will be bad and the grid loading paging sorting and filtering would be very slow

short	base
for all the class that inherits this base it must implement this short operation first

16133451
post	get
in the case of get head and post requests it simple expects the access-control-allow-origin header to be sent with the request data and with a value of the hostname of the page requesting the resource

provided that your ellipses are always circles their width and height properties are set to the same value and they always have the canvas.left and canvas.top properties set the following helper method checks for a collision

16133713
interbase	firebird
as i know firebird and interbase keeps the stored procedures and triggers in blr tokenized format

16133777
ubuntu	linux
i tried it on linux ubuntu where it failed during configuring because the -rpath args were passed to gcc instead of ld

16133842
jmenubar	jmenuitem
you are better off using a jmenubar and then adding jmenus with jmenuitem there is no point on reinventing the wheel

16133881
hash	md5
i want to use messagedigest to get a md5 hash but i get an error

16133894

i cannot seem to make sure that the python modulo function is working properly i have tried various numbers and cannot seem to get a correct division

16133910
wxpython	textctrl
i have a wxpython application that display json in a textctrl

16133928
hash	salt
if it does recover the salt here d9c06f88 and the hash

16133928
hash	salt
if it does not set a bad flag and fetch a fixed salt and hash 12345678 0000000.

16133928

then concatenate the salt and the password and generate the hash of d9c06f88 mickeymouse

16133936
superclass	subclassing
gasaccount being the superclass and businessaccount being the subclassing

16133976
postgresql	mysql
i ll recommend postgresql but mysql is easily up to the task too

16134013
put	get
when i put in the path to the manifest.xml file which hasn t moved i get the following error

16134057
boost	stl
stl has deque implementation boost deque implementation

16134057
allocator	stl
but both of them uses the stl way of sequence containers dynamic allocator with allocator

16134057
allocator	stl
note1 i already have stl based solution using custom allocator which statically allocates data for vector and deque but i am searching for any better solution lower execution time

16134193
ienumerable	iqueryable
but this returns ienumerable and i want iqueryable so that i can do more filtering before fetching the data from db server

16134243
getter	setter
countryform.java is a plain object with a single string attribute country with its getter and setter

16134246
getter	setter
you could try a quick and dirty test with and see if you at least get some result but if you don t mind me saying i think it will be better if you would not expose a raw object like jsonnode to the jsp but some sort of user pojo with getter and setter for id name username and token instead

16134271
free	malloc
as i understood you can t free arrays malloc d in another function.

16134275
mpfr	mpc
i ve found that copying the source directories for gmp mpfr mpc isl cloog etc

16134292
put	get	post	get	post	put
get post put delete and an optional head

16134292
post	put
the same goes for post put and delete

16134327
width	margin
the only disadvantage is that you need the extra nested div because the table needs a width 100 and margin right won t work

16134367
width	height
i want to be able to put it somewhere in a corner...or anywhere really and to be able to set both width and height

16134372
put	get
i m trying to put together a simple game in javascript and i cant get the jumping to work

16134432
prepare	execute
prepare statements with bound parameters are not only more portable more convenient immune to sql injection but are often much faster to execute than interpolated queries as both the server and client side can cache a compiled form of the query.

16134503
prepare	execute
i m guessing your function is being execute through a callback from a background thread or it s being execute before the lifecycle of the activity has prepare its context

16134562
children	parent
i have a parent div which contains floating children

16134562
children	parent
to get the parent div to fit the children i set display table on the parent div

16134562
children	parent
the parent div becomes too wide and the children are no longer centered

16134578
getter	setter
notice how i ve left out all the getter and setter and other methods for the sake of shorter code but you d have to include those too

16134602
implements	extends
if in the future you will decide to merge emu and tiger by making them both implements the same interface or extends the same class and therefore merge the two methods using

16134656
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
let s say we want to implement a dummy math class in php the language doesn t matter with some basic methods like add subtract multiplying and divide

16134656
subtract	add
in the next step we implement both add and subtract four methods

16134656
subtract	add
but now we want to commit the implementation of the add and the subtract methods in separate commits

16134667
hide	show
i want to show the button follow when the user isn t following the forum and hide when the user is already following

16134668
padding	overlapping
a very elegant way to fix the overlapping problem is increasing the padding of the x- and y-tick labels the distance to the axis

16134717
keyevent	keyrelease
void keyrelease keyevent e

16134717
int	chars
public void keypressed int i chars c

16134717
int	chars
public void keyreleased int i chars c

16134734
oncreate	setcontentview
however you can have it point to an activity that is set up with theme.nodisplay where in the activity s oncreate you send your broadcast and call finish without calling setcontentview

16134745
width	height
i m going to assume that board is just some 2-d array of values with width and height and that you want to connect n where in your example n is 4

16134760
width	height
fix width and height to the image and convertview in the getview method

16134776
temp	tmp
currently i am using scp to download the files to the web server in a temp directory then redirect the client to the tmp url

16134867
ssl	https
so i want to access the app through https which heroku supports through ssl piggybacking

16134901
put	get
when trying to upload file using xhr put method as described in example i get cross domain error in the browser and xhr returns with status 0

16134940
int	double
the previous two function calls for the int array and double array work fine seems like i m just missing come detail for dealing with the string array and i can t figure out what it is

16134954
fadein	fadeout
i m trying to fadeout a div and then fadein the next div once the first one has gone to stop the next div from coming below the first div and then bouncing up once the previous one goes

16134981
hide	show
i followed google s fairly straightforward example here to create a custom marker class including its hide and show methods

16134981
hide	show
the problem comes when i want to hide or show any specific marker

16134998
getter	setter
schedule class i supressed getter and setter

16135011
neo4j	titan	orientdb	titan	orientdb	neo4j
fyi - the databases i m currently thinking of are orientdb neo4j and titan but i haven t decided for sure yet

16135041
put	get
you can store the data on your server and each page can get the data from the server or have the server put the data into each page when the page is constructed

16135073
powerpc	i386
i can t find out why crt0.o or crt1.o are not provided for i386 targets by newlib as it is the case for powerpc arm etc

16135152
put	get
you can do it like this dont put everything to cover .just in style tag put these two and you will get it

16135166
shadowing	named
but you use the shadowing in f# value shadowing occurs when a variable declared within a certain scope decision block method or inner class has the same named as a variable declared in an outer scope

16135183
width	height
in this case i d override getpreferredsize to return a dimension having equal width and height

16135193
move	drag
to set the constraints in code you can clear the constraints for the move view and re-add them or if you have a view in ib you can drag the constraints into code to create an outlet

16135201
post	get
you get all the rows from table post that the creator of that post has a line in your friendships table as user_b while user_a is set to be the logged in user

16135206
post	get
performing get and post requests using ajax

16135207
comparator	comparable
the assignment says that i have to use an interface on the item class i don t know whether or not to implement comparator or comparable and then what to write for either the comparator method or the compare method respectfully

16135216
width	height
5 minutes after posting the question i figured out the problem i m using auto layout and the uiimageview didn t have an explicit height constraint only width

16135257
comparator	comparable
if you need a new comparator and don t want to use the comparable you can create a new comparator and use it like collections.sort list new mycomparator

16135267
comparator	comparable
the single argument sort will expect your class to have implemented comparable and overridden the comparator method

16135278
put	get
set a key such as uniqid and put it as a get variable in the link

16135302
gentoo	linux
gentoo linux has an lddtree.sh

16135315
int	chars
in other words your trying to store a type int on my compiler into a chars

16135369
inherited	properties
from what i understand using functional inherited is preferred because it allows privacy for the properties and variables of an object while still allowing them to be called using methods outside of the object

16135388
ng-class	ng-hide	ng-show	ng-class	ng-show	ng-hide
the angular way of doing this is to use ng-show ng-hide or ng-class on or within your button

16135408
min	max
you should be able to use a simple triangle with min 180 max around 300 and mode around 200 as a bounding function g x and follow the algorithm described on wikipedia to get pretty good results

16135463
outputstream	inputstream
especially part about using raw input there are very few cases where real json data comes as string -- so make sure to use inputstream outputstream or byte arrays

16135463
outputstream	inputstream
as mentioned earlier always use most raw input output destinations if possible inputstream outputstream

16135474
versioning	upgrade
grab the latest versioning --which may be simplest if you go ahead and upgrade to r3.0 -- and this problem will disappear

16135501
ubuntu	linux
the server which is linux ubuntu should take the files and do some analysis and calculations and then print out the results on a file called results.txt

16135509
subtraction	addition
i don t like this addition b+1 in the example and subtraction a-1 in the example to reach the closed end of the range

16135525
for-loop	arrays
i m trying to populate an arrays by using a for-loop to access certain records in a database and then combine the contents of some db fields with text to create each arrays element

16135526
air	flashdevelop
i m compiling with flashdevelop 4 flex 4.5.1 and air 3.0 on windows 7

16135546
post	get
i want to get all the post in my stream without the post that come from pages

16135557
rss	feed
i am trying to build a xml rss feed using word pad in windows

16135564
typedef	struct
in general it s a good idea to put struct definitions typedef s and function declarations into a header file dvd.h and then #include that header in the various c source files that make use of the definitions and declarations

16135564
typedef	struct
that way the compiler can compare the function declarations against the function definitions and you need not repeat the contents of struct s and the names of typedef s in multiple .c files

16135580
subtraction	addition
as the floats are exact addition and subtraction will

16135606
width	height
i am hosting a flash application inside a webbrowser inside a window that has set width and height

16135635
stdout	stderr
you can also read the stdout and stderr streams of your linux script using

16135641
uiview	subviews
the main view has a subviews a blue uiview that should be displayed in the bottom 25 of the screen

16135699
width	height
in this particular case if the large element is guaranteed to have greater height and the small element to have fixed width you might be able to hack your way around the issue like this

16135726
printwriter	bufferedwriter	filewriter	bufferedwriter	filewriter	printwriter
i use printwriter bufferedwriter and filewriter as shown below

16135726
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
i tried to use inputstreamreader bufferedreader and fileinputstream but my netbeans shows me an error message

16135811
getter	setter
i instantiated personviewmodel by hand to confirm that it s not wpf specific behavior that calls into the extender class and i did get setter getter on target property firing

16135819
firefox	safari
my only problem is that on some web browsers apple safari mozilla firefox the text and images are shifted of way to far to the left

16135846
children	parent
i think this may now be the parent - that is the which means siblings won t work - you should use children

16135856
for-loop	arrays
the c-string is basically an arrays of characters so you d iterate over it with a for-loop like this

16135886
folder	directory
for instance while in a git repo folder you can call git notes get-ref to see what directory that will be

16135887
dropbox	skydrive
this could be a database but i also have multiple online hosting accounts mega dropbox skydrive google drive and if anybody knows any apis i could use to read write files to these services that would do as well

16135965
google-chrome	firefox
have tested in google-chrome and firefox with same results

16135984
width	height
another option i thought of is to use the image in a framelayout with match_parent in width and height as background.

16136060
put	get	post	get	post	put
as i mentioned earlier the remote service doesn t seem to respect the basic principles of rest - if you like you could ask them why read-only operations don t use get and saves don t use put their supplied class throws an exception if you don t use post

16136149
int	chars
those specify that the input is a chars so mysql is probably trying to insert a chars and refusing as it s an int column

16136188
put	get
the question sounds simple if i try and put some context into why and how i need this it will start to get confusing

16136222
getter	setter
you can actually have variables which can only be accessed through setter and getter in javascript

16136222
getter	setter
or if you want a generic getter setter

16136252
box-sizing	border-box
if you can support ie8+ using box-sizing border-box makes the dimension calculations easier

16136256
getter	setter
one least known feature of javascript is that it supports getter and setter natively

16136256
getter	setter
or you can define getter and setter using object.defineproperty and the reserved words get and set

16136256
getter	setter
a way of using such getter setter inside a class to get a private variable would be

16136256
getter	setter
so you have a truly private variable armed with a getter and a setter

16136256
getter	setter
obviously there is not much interest to use getter setter code unless you want to make bound-checking type-checking or have a another specific reason

16136282
for-loop	loops
a for-loop may be more suitable for this than a foreach loops

16136287
int	chars
each of the tuples in that list holds the name of the corresponding field and its dtype is a little endian 4 byte int a little endian 8 byte float and s19 a 19 chars long string

16136371
width	height
width height etc are managed in another class

16136387
getter	setter
i used to like the idea of getter and setter when i started using object-oriented javascript heavily but that is because i was coming from a java background

16136387
getter	setter
es5 supports getter and setter through a special syntax

16136387
getter	setter
my take is to think about why getter setter are useful

16136387
getter	setter
needing to catch all of these mutations requires changing variable scope adding a getter and setter and altering all calling code

16136387
getter	setter
therefore you can simply allow a property to be directly controlled and then if you need to intercept it to say add a console.log for debugging you can add a getter and setter and it will just work

16136387
getter	setter
the downside to the getter setter syntax is that it doesn t actually make your variable private it only hides it so that you can use some secret internal name unless you define it within the constructor as vincent indicated

16136410
shadowing	named
as already explained by arthur what you see is shadowing which means that the original variable named a is hidden by a new variable also named a i use variable in quotes because they are actually immutable values

16136423
eigenvalue	diagonal
also for regularization you you should add a small value like 0.001 to the diagonal of kernel matrix otherwise you would have negative eigenvalue which prevent your kernel matrix of not being positive definite

16136440
mouse	keyboard
next i want to bundle a keyboard and a mouse together i can easily do that with magento by creating a new product type called bundle product and associate the products to this newly created bundle product

16136454
post	get
that way when you delete a particular row from the threads table all the child rows in the post table will automatically get deleted as well

16136462
sidekiq	actionmailer
according to this blogpost sidekiq has built in support for actionmailer

16136488
ienumerable	ilist
this also makes it possible to use an ienumerable as a parameter instead of an ilist

16136493
filesystems	hfs+
also as others have already mentioned nsbundle s search method is case-sensitive even if the underlying hfs+ filesystems on os x is merely case-preserving

16136564
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
only caveat is it won t work with non-css3 browsers should work in any google-chrome firefox 3.6+ ie8+ and opera 10+

16136711
nswindow	nsapplication
so final suggestion override -postevent atstart on either nsapplication or nswindow and see if you can fish out the desired info there

16136721
mouseup	mouseenter
knowing that mousemoved mouseenter mouseexited mouseup are all called when needed

16136725
execvp	fork
i am trying to execute a file using fork and execvp however i am encountering some errors

16136735
bash	zsh
afaict those settings for mean that at least if invoked from zsh or bash perlbrew use .

16136780
width	height
the .setbounds layout is like this int x int y int width int height

16136819
ssl	https
i would like to intercept https connect so that i can inspect ssl traffic

16136864
domxpath	domdocument
you should indeed use domdocument and domxpath to access the nodes

16136871
pop-up	dialog
the email dialog will pop-up

16136902
ffmpeg	avisynth
write an avisynth script to add a watermark then use ffmpeg to reconvert the files

16136902
ffmpeg	avisynth
ffmpeg for win32 is capable of reading from avisynth frameserver

16136916
ssl	socks
not sure if socksipy is the best solution for this but i haven t been able to find any other way to proxify a raw socket or get pycurl urllib2 to use socks proxies and give ssl certs

16136937
post	get
get the python 3 version of oursql from here and compile it from source don t have enough reputation to post the link just go to oursql official site for installation instructions

16136943
spaces	delimiter
but the question is some values in the second column contain spaces s which happens to be the default delimiter for awk to separate the fields

16136954
google-chrome	safari
it is supported on ios safari google-chrome and some latest version of opera..

16136993
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
and for what it s worth on google-chrome 26.0.1410.65 firefox 19.0.2 and safari 6.0.3 at least if you have multiple elements with the same id jquery selectors at least will return the first element with that id

16137024
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
so i just went to google.com then tried this with firefox 19 google-chrome 26 and safari 6 on my mac os x 10.8

16137024
firefox	safari
safari alerted the cookies on paste but firefox would not allow pasting nor typing

16137072
width	height
just add width height to img tag

16137079
multiplying	add
i m trying to make a program to accept two 3x3 matrices then add or multiplying them

16137151
udp	tcp
so at the moment i do know how tcp- and udp-server -clients work and i have already coded the clients for tcp and udp

16137199
udp	tcp
the idea is to mix inside your server a tcp part and a udp part

16137315
post	get
i m looking for a framework that ll let me develop a desktop app in html css and javascript for the frontend but at the same also allow me to make http requests like get post etc

16137324
pascal	delphi
i m converting an application originally written in delphi xe3 - converted to pascal lazarus from windows to mac

16137327
min	max
min and max are two points that represent depending on your coordinate system upper left and lower right point which you can easily use to draw the rectangle

16137331
width	height
it looks like you just need to specify the new width height and it will do the scaling for you automatically

16137333
google-chrome	firefox
i m having a small problem with my project i have made a sliding wall with css it looks ok in google-chrome but i have no idea why it doesnt work with firefox as it gives me a large overflow to the side

16137375
flip	slide
basically i wanted to have the flip flipboard and slide flipboard android like slide in out old div scales down and fade out animations and is touch ready

16137462
ubuntu	linux
i therein tested it in ubuntu linux via wine and it runs better than it does in xp

16137465
stdout	fflush
java tries to fflush everything to stdout as soon as possible

16137465
disk	ram
it now finishes in 920 milliseconds on my pc writing to ram disk and i guess with a little more tunig there is still lots of redundant byte array copying it could finish in less than half of that

16137467
coffeescript	haml
i am building a rails 3.2.11 app with twitter bootstrap and flot also haml and coffeescript

16137467
width	height
adding width height css to the td does not fix the problem

16137668
children	parent
also you are filtering linearly since a node in this case can only have one parent in contrast to top-down which deals with multiple children

16137682
stdout	stderr
one advantage of using popen instead of call is that it s easy to get the command output with call you need to pass in a file-like object to get stdout stderr so you d need to use stringio if you need get them in string variables

16137682
stdout	stderr
if you don t need the stdout stderr text you can use subprocess.call

16137759
gridview	detailsview
i am trying to bind a gridview to a detailsview in asp.net using a sql server 2008 database

16137766
post	put
this has led me to the practice of always requiring every updatable property in put and post requests even if it means specifying null for those properties

16137794
implements	extends
along with it you should create a class that extends broadcastreceiver which will implements onreceive where you can get a list of scanresult there you ll get all info about your network including the signal strength

16137823
width	height
i was going to say that #headerbg doesn t need to exist but i see that you are using the image to maintain the height width ratio of the header as the page sizes down

16137842
put	get
this is just a guess but as i put in my comment above it looks like your first call to session isn t creating an error where you get the shoppingcart instance from session

16137844
autocomplete	typeahead
you could also use typeahead from twitter bootstrap or autocomplete from jquery ui which can be made to work together

16137857
put	get
you can put the contents of that datatemplate and the storyboard in their own usercontrol to get it to work

16137914
scheme	racket
i am learning scheme using racket r5rs

16137944
hash	md5
when using cassandra s recommended randompartitioner or murmur3partitioner it is not possible to do meaningful range queries on keys because the rows are distributed around the cluster using the md5 hash of the key

16137953
for-loop	arrays
i was only able to find implementation to copy an arrays by using for-loop pointers etc

16137964
getter	setter
i have a station class with appropriate getter setter so the url is already stored

16137964
getter	setter
i m parsing these into a station class with constructors getter setter

16137972
getter	setter
implementing getter and setter doesn t seem like a good idea to me

16138059
google-chrome	firefox
the box looks as it should in firefox but displays incorrectly in google-chrome including no padding in the text fields font color different in text field a 2px-ish padding that shouldn t be above and below the blue submit button

16138059
google-chrome	firefox
normally i don t see any difference between google-chrome and firefox only ie so i m stumped

16138075
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to a newer versioning of the db

16138102
free	malloc
i m trying to free memory that i allocated with malloc but free is giving the error

16138181
google-chrome	firefox
it s clean it s relatively easily understood it appears to work in ie 8+ google-chrome firefox safariâ but it also appears to be an enormous dirty no-good positioning hack one that could come apart at the seams at any time

16138274
google-chrome	firefox
probably simply due to the different rendering engines of google-chrome and firefox

16138289
google-chrome	firefox

ffmpeg	libav
actually vlc uses ffmpeg s libav library under the hood

16138470
int	chars
however even if uint8_t has the exact same size and representation as unsigned chars if the implementation made it a distinct non-character type the aliasing rules would not apply to it and the compiler could assume that objects of types uint8_t and int for example can never alias

16138489
firefox	safari
firefox and the ios safari are the only ones as of this writing known to have this issue

16138585

someone answered on my previous question how in the comments but i didn t get it to work i don t know how or where to put it in my code

16138599

as my app would not be active during the events i needed a service to handle this event i register in oncreate and unregister in ondestroy

16138880

16138897
hide	show
you could prevent the default dropdown show hide toggle and override it using .btn-group .show

16138897
mouseout	mousedown
then use .btn-group .hide on a custom mousedown event of yours as well as on a mouseout of the btn-group node to restore the default bootstrap behavior

16138903
post	get
ok so the process is load page - parse and get the form - post form data with cookies and headers

16138905

gridview	radgrid
i have a child window and there are a radgrid view and textboxes which show the radgridview items as i select a row of gridview

16139135
bmp	png
i have managed to piece this code together to generate the rgb565 data it generates it upside down and with some small artefacts i assume the first is due to different coordinate systems being used and the second possibly due to me going from png to bmp

16139135
bmp	png
i will do some more testing using a bmp to start and also a non-tranparent png

16139248
google-chrome	firefox
therefore event.originalevent.target can be used for both google-chrome and firefox

16139248
hide	show
you can work around it using the internal _find method which will perform a dom query by id and thus you can hide it right after the show animation would kick in while its live cycle is not affected - it will be there and removed on mouseleave as usual but will have display none along all this cycle

16139260
children	parent
so what i did was to extract data which are not parent i extracted those children whose isselected is 1 true and finally the above code worked

why not use positioning to get what you want or resize your inner image to be the exact height and width of what you want your button to be

16139921
goto	break
use goto rather than break

16144528

on the other hand when you declare the arrays in for-loop without using the new identifier the compiler assume that it is an int variable and create only 2 bytes of memory space and program gives error

try-catch	exception-handling
i m having issues finding out what s going on however as the exception-handling which i suspect is the cause of the problem is being thrown during the linking stage when a imports b and so cannot be caught by a try-catch block

16147170

16147723
post	get
given a category name i need to get an array of all categories that a wordpress post belongs to including all parent categories

16147751

16147925

normally that is not too much of a problem but sometimes the compiler does optimizations that replace my code with memcpy memset and i get linker errors saying that i have a unresolved reference to them

16153651
prng	random
alternately you could use boost s random uniform distribution components or from c++11 if that s available as these will provide a more sound prng than rand

16153760
memcpy	memset
if the compiler inserts memcpy and memset as a part of the optimization process then there s nothing you can achieve using macros

16153760

if the higher-level protocol that s running on top of udp rtp tftp etc. has some sort of identification number or sequence number or block number that is unique per packet and that changes in a predictable way then you could display that number in a custom column and manually look for missing numbers but there is no way in the udp protocol itself to identify missing packets

i m trying to upgrade facebook sdk to versioning 3.0.1 and encountered troubles while performing login

16154699
getter	setter
this is more or less what interfaces were designed to handle so you set up an interface named something like t with your common getter and setter and then have both t1 and t2 implement it

16154699
getter	setter
this will let you potentially implement custom code in the getter and setter of the individual instances if you want to do validation or something in a set method of t1 but not in t2 etc

16154699
getter	setter
this has the added benefits of not having to implement the same getter and setter in the same place

16154711

16155195
keydown	keyup
try using keydown or keyup

16155221
keydown	keyup
try using either the keydown or keyup event instead

16155222
keydown	keyup
you could use a timer since what you are experiencing is the behavior of keypress keyup and keydown could be used for counting the key presses but it will probably be rather tricky to track all edge cases on all browsers

16155247

16156943
getter	setter
the reason for my question is because i was under the impression that properties were mainly used to take advantage of the getter and setter you get for free when you use property but when you assign an nsarray to a property you know you will never use the getter and setter to access the objects in the array why use properties on this case

16157000
ember.js	backbone.js
if the behaviour your looking for is more advanced and app like you can also consider entire mvc javascript frameworks such as backbone.js or ember.js

for-loop	arrays
also notice that i m evaluating the length of the meatitems arrays in the for-loop conditional when i would want to be evaluating all items in the sharedobject

16157300

unless they use real browsers and just emulate keyboard and mouse

this is one of the reasons that objc unlike python etc. encourages you to use properties and or explicit accessor instead of directly accessing members

when i change the margins either on body or the parent div to a percentage amount i get a sliver of the parent s background color shining through on the edges indicating that the parent is somehow slightly larger than the child despite the fact that the child is 100 or more of the parent s width and height

also if you want to confirm frame settings it s better to defer looking at those values until after viewdidappear viewdidload is too early in the view construction process

16158411
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested on both firefox and internet explorer and both log out after the browser was closed but google-chrome remains logged in

16158449
uiswitch	uibutton
think of it this way look at the generic ios view library your new class should reside with other controls such as uibutton uiswitch uitableview if it does not need to contain complex logic doing computations interacting with other views or objects but it is enough to notify user s interaction to controller

this process can also be made less painful by installing server software packages ie wamp lamp mamp which include the basic software components your developers will need

16162323
super	extends
now with that out of the way i think it s a little clearer that for you to make this work in c++ grapes should actually extends fruit using standard c++ inheritance as that is the only way that you can do a correct super call

16162323
inherited	subclassing
and if you want to be be able to call the inherited template functions from fruit in c++ then it will need to be able to unwrap the grapes object as a fruit which means it needs to be a subclassing

16163376
post	get
because this controller method is the only one specified it s used for both get and post requests

post	get
mostly people use the same view for that and for processing the post for some reason you ve split them up into two which is fine if you really want to but you must use the render or requestcontext or whatever on the get view too because that s responsible for generating and outputting the token that s then checked in the post

16164225
int	chars
i think the problem is you re trying to subtract 64 from a chars - when i try your code i get a - operator is not defined for types chars and int

int	double
however 1 xeon phi does not support packed byte operations on int the minimum is double words aka 32-bit and 2 it does not implement the packed sum of absolute difference instruction like _mm_sad_epu8 in ssse3 thus the reduction add was performed by a combination of four groups of vpermf32x4 vpaddd and movslq

16166649
cpu	affinity
the explicit sharing of pages by shm_open may be used to programmatically define the same cpu affinity for both threads - perhaps by convention in both programs to associate the relevant threads with the first core or through a small handshake protocol established at some point through the shared memory object for instance the first byte of the memory segment could be set to the chosen cpu number + 1 by the first thread to access it 0 meaning no affinity yet

16166649

unfortunately the posix thread api doesn t provide a way to set cpu affinity for threads

however this would require instances of the fractions type class to declare information about their precision so that haskell can use that information to decide whether a given literal is valid for that type which it currently does not and which would be difficult or impossible to implement in a general efficient and user-friendly manner taking into account that the term precision can mean quite different things depending on whether we re talking about floating point numbers or fixed point numbers and whether they use base 2 or 10 or anything else to represent the numbers - either of which would be possible for instances of the fractions type class

daemons	systemd
so then i d advice to stop the systemd daemons and start it again in your user space then you can allow it to dump core

16169173
daemons	systemd
if it is really essential that it starts up as part of the systemd then see if the start-up of the daemons is confined to a single sub-shell and use ulimit -c in that sub-shell to set an appropriate maximum size for the core dump

the datatemplateselector by itself cannot affect the other properties of the contentcontrol however you could use a converter to determine the width height based on the same logic used to determine which template to use

i put question marks for the converterparameter because i m not clear on how you determine which case calls for which width height

16169998

google-chrome	firefox
well you can use the or in firefox but it won t work in google-chrome or in ie not cheked any other

16172909
profiling	debugging
also had this problem after a recent xcode update and my scheme for profiling was set to use the build configuration of release when it needed to be debugging - which allowed the analysis to complete

16172931
ubuntu	linux
the same project builds fine under linux ubuntu 12.04 using the linux binary for the same toolchain i recently reloaded both toolchains from the same directory at mentor to be sure see details below

16172936
chunked	transfer-encoding
technically speaking you can have a http response with no content-length specified which can be returned using either the chunked transfer-encoding or just a raw stream of bytes with a connection close indicating when the data is complete done being sent by a close of the underlying connection

16172939
csv	tsv
i ve used a plain text file csv or tsv both of which can be exported directly from excel

16173100
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
so you pass the id of your input button to that function and the function adds a click event handler this function works perfect in ie firefox safari opera but not in google-chrome

16173105
.htaccess	httpd.conf
this ini directive can be set in any number of places in each file in each folder using .htaccess or in httpd.conf or in the ini file as i just described

16173120
addition	multiplication
in addition to the answer by charlesbrunet there is a specialized class for mathematical matrices where is the standard matrix multiplication as opposed to element-wise

16173137
getter	setter
if you want this behaviour very often and you find property handling with setter and getter too unhandy you can go a step higher and build your own descriptor class

16173181
for-loop	loops
i need to take values that i find from inside a for-loop to use in a function that isn t inside loops and i can t figure out how to do this

16173199
knitr	latex
i am not an experienced brew knitr latex user so i am afraid i have overlooked something very basic

16173220
hide	show
set the button s commandargument property to the panel number to which it show or hide

16173265
move	drag
when you drag it let s say 3 times the draggable div seems to move away from the cursor

16173288
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
the previous code works perfectly when the data in the json is small and therefore the contents in the output variable is also small but when the data is large and the output variable has a large string defined with approximately 80 html tags that line takes almost 30 seconds to execute on the iphone it works perfectly on google-chrome firefox and safari

16173304
ienumerable	icollection
since badenumerable is a and also because the call to enumerable.where returns a generic ienumerable one that is not an icollection your specific case does not run into this situation and will iterate twice

16173352
for-loop	arrays
the images arrays doesn t need to be mutable and you shouldn t be reinitializing it inside the for-loop

16173354
width	height
what you probably want to do is calculate the label and textbox s width and height based on the panels dimensions

16173362
maven	pom.xml
a basic web application using opencv and deployed with maven on jboss-as works the opencv-245.jar is listed as dependency in pom.xml and thus packaged into the war

16173362
maven	pom.xml
i also reminds that i have put in my maven pom.xml

16173362
jar	war
i also noticed that with an ear application composed of one war and one jar even the procedure described in point 3 in preamble does not work and give the same exception as above

16173399
width	height
1.give all the height or width values in percentages.this way all elements will be re sized once the orientation changes automatically

16173466
post	get
there is a rest service for using the orbeon forms runner but it uses http get not http post

16173466
put	get
to get there you have to manually put the following url into your browser

16173508
spaces	linefeed
do note that since s is the equivalent of any of the following characters spaces tab cr carriage return linefeed linefeed and s is the inverse of s s also will not match a tab or newline character

16173526
move	drag
the problem is i also allow the user to move the canvas by translating it on drag

16173602
put	get
put it all together into php code and you get something like this

16173602
put	get
so when you put that together with the above code you get a something more like this

16173629
width	margin
use float on one of them and add margin to the other that equals the width of the floated in that direction

16173645
firefox	safari
the reason the ordering works in safari and firefox is that they use stable sorting algorithms preserving the order when your comparator returns 0

16173673
getter	setter
calendar works this way for better efficiency instead of recalculate everithing each time you call a setter it waits until you call a getter

16173685
pull	push
i thought i must have done something wrong but i can t figure out why so i tried to copy the cloned git repository from my desktop to my laptop and now i can modify push pull commit to that repository from my laptop

16173740
accessor	properties
i currently have a linq expression for a properties accessor that accesses a properties on an object

16173740
accessor	properties
i now need to build a linq expression that will evaluate a predicate to see if the result from the properties accessor is contained within a list

16173750
width	height
i have the ui with master pages css and i am using divs to get the elements in place i am using px in css width height

16173762
inherited	properties
my initial thought and the way i have implemented this was to use table per hierarchy inherited because it seemed that i could just inherited from basicstate and have my other states partake of those common properties

16173764
width	height
node width 1 height 1 shape circle style filled color skyblue

16173767
google-chrome	firefox
naturally everything looks great in google-chrome and firefox but total crap in ie

16173780
des	aes
pbe password based encryption is used to encrypt data with password and is based on underlying encryption algorithm aes des blowfish etc

16173795
express	node.js
here is a simple server using node.js and express

16173795
width	height
the server expects json width and height to recreate the canvas and a multiplier to scale the data url image

16173811
pop-up	dialog
i also want modal dialog to pop-up while tab is being refreshed

16173850
put	get
get value of custom field server side and put it as a variable attribute a class or id or whatever attribute of your background div

16173859
initializer	class-method
if i recall reimplementing class-method new and initializer should be avoided

16173884
folder	directory
in this information folder i have a file called aboutus.php which has includes to the header in the previous directory

16173892
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this works fine in firefox opera google-chrome safari ie9 but not in iexplorer 8 10

16173905
udp	tcp
today i would use tcp udp with a proper protocol instead

16173905
udp	tcp
also for tcp udp portability is much better

16173906
google-chrome	firefox
my issue is that i can only use it in google-chrome but i want to write a generic html5 css3 code that uses this feature and others shadow gradient in ie and firefox too

16173933
for-loop	arrays
after this you can use strcpy to copy the lines into each of the char arrays you ve allocated in the for-loop

16173934
button	checkbox
i have created a listview which is populated with an xmlparser and the user is allowed to select multiple values from the list using checkbox and then can go to the next activity by pressing a button

16174002
move	drag
i want when move drag button in map change value in other page form

16174070
inherited	properties
so aside from this.prototype just being an ordinary properties the inherited already took place when the assignment takes place

16174087
mouseup	mousedown
you can use the mousedown and mouseup events to keep track of whether the mouse is being used to pan the map

16174126
folder	directory
if the web root is above the domain name in a folder it can be confusing if you re using a single to access the root directory in html

16174126
folder	directory
another problem with previous directory notation is when you re making nested directory and including the same file it becomes a bit difficult to move a folder or follow the code

16174151
portrait	landscape
this working fine if the app is in the portrait view but if i test the same in landscape the tapping on the uialertview won t work although kif tells me the tapping was successful

16174183
width	height
within the window you can try and resizeto height and width triggered by the resize event handler like the following

16174217
width	height
the width and height of the three.effectcomposer.rendertarget must match that of the webglrenderer

16174278
width	height
edit i juste realized that i did not mention that i am placing my views inside their container manually by setting their x and y position and their width and height

16174287
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
the frame size will have the right values at viewdidappear and in viewwillappear the value will be set but they are still zero in that method

16174323
portrait	landscape
that is landscape for back camera and upside-down portrait for front camera

16174329
super	implements
a couple other things i see is that you will want to add the override annotation to the implements methods as well as super calls

16174336
width	height
the with width and height 100 winds up being 100 of nothing

16174336
width	height
the width of the elements defaults the width of the containing element and the viewport for the top-level element while the height of the elements depends on the height of their children

16174336
children	parent
a height of 100 when the parent don t have a height specified instead winds up just being treated as a height of auto which means base it on the height of its children

16174340
sorting	filtering
for the filtering and sorting to work properly using joins instead of subqueries is difficult if not impossible as far as i can tell

16174384
for-loop	arrays
it is unadvisable to use the nicer for-loop syntaxes on arrays in javascript because they will iterate through all key value pairs in the arrays not just the arrays numeric keys

16174398
versioning	upgrade
in any case then yes you should be able to simply move this file over to your server or upgrade your server to .net 4.5 if you determine you actually have mismatched versioning

16174417
fadein	fadeout
now you can use it the same way you would use jqueryâ s fadein or fadeout effect

16174442
google-chrome	safari
the app works fine with the google-chrome browser and on safari mobile browser

16174453
sorting	filtering
on that webpage we re using the jquery.history plugin to keep track of sorting and filtering options without users needing to reloading the page

16174490
for-loop	loops
however you will want to change your foreach loops to a for-loop

16174527
google-chrome	firefox
it works in ie but not in google-chrome or firefox

16174544
post	get
see this blog post for an example to get started

16174593
google-chrome	firefox
i also tried google-chrome canary same as google-chrome and firefox didn t ask for permission

16174689
getter	setter
suppose you have a user class strings fullname and username with setter and getter and userdao class that deals with database manipulation

16174690
superclass	subclassing
i have some subclassing which do not differ from the abstract superclass and so do not need a dedicated table in the database while others do differ from the superclass and so have a dedicated table

16174690
superclass	subclassing
create a subclassing which extends task and annotate as below note the table name task is actually the superclass table

16174690
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
would be interested to know the correct way to map this inherited situation when there is no need to differentiate the subclassing from abstract superclass

16174708
tiff	bmp
i digged it over the internet and so and found different suggestions including changing image format from bmp to tiff resizing image to have a size that is a power of 2 and some others none of which worked

16174747
width	height
this will cause the play button to be compact regardless of the width and height ratio of the iframe

16174828
width	height
one can add an empty hbox vbox to the corresponding gridpane column row and attach listeners to the hbox vbox widthproperty heightproperty still i am wondering if there is a way to directly get the width and height of a column row in a gridpane

16174829
subtract	addition
the alternative would be to simply split up the string and verify if it is an addition or a subtract and work from there

16174836
google-chrome	safari
in safari it works good but when i use google-chrome for ipad it does this weird thing

16174892
map	quadtree
the solution i came up with is to divide world map into some sort of hierarchical spatial tree let s say quadtree where each point in my db will be assigned with coordinates in that tree

16174900
children	parent
so then that container can be given an id and you can reference your array by the children property of the parent object

16174900
children	parent
you would reference the array of children as document.getelementbyid parent .children

16174901
width	height
my issue is the width and height of the innerplotposition are always zero unless i set them explicitly

16174903

16175082
google-chrome	firefox
need to know if it is possible to find a workaround for this issue on ie9 it does display perfectly on google-chrome firefox the value changes as it is expected but the div will not expand its height

16175095
stdout	stderr
when you start a process you have to manage the stdout stderr streams in their own threads so that the buffers will drain without the possibility of a deadlock between the two

16175155
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
i have an issue with my navigation - works great with this css in safari firefox but doesn t look right in google-chrome or ie10

16175196
try-catch	exception-handling
add some logging in your web service and dump to the logging framework the input parameters and the exception-handling details yes you should add a try-catch in the web service

16175230
vim	emacs
you could script a text editor vim or emacs for example to do it in place but that wouldn t really help you avoid using a temp file since text editors will internally use temp files

16175281
google-chrome	firefox
here s code that works in ie firefox google-chrome

16175316
google-chrome	firefox

16175654
folder	directory
the directory helper - directory_map lists out folder and files in an array

16175680
width	height
it also records the exact float value for the width and height of the image so that you can in fact use images that are any size you want

16175691
getter	setter
and this tells you about the registry getter and setter

16175739
stdout	stderr

16176061
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari

i m presuming you re using 10.x arcgis arcpy not gp

16176124
printwriter	bufferedwriter	filewriter	bufferedwriter	filewriter	printwriter

16177172
width	height
you ll possibly need to stablish paddings a width or a height for a better viewing

16177180
width	height
why it would only resize the width or height but it s not resizing either right now

16177197
getter	setter
firstly having a sleep async operation in a property getter setter is considered bad-practice

16177199
post	put
where 1000 is a post delay if you want delay for first time if you don t want than put it 0

16177246

the way it should work is to show current image in middle of a site defined width and height of image fixed for all images image centered vertically height of carousel slider doesnt change with browser width and partly or fully visible next image on right previous on left

16177255
super	implements
i have implements a custom array adapter and though the app works fine but i get this error when on super line

this is required as elements such as checkbox and radio button would be multiple elements but each set should only be counted once

16181555
direct3d	gdi
if you write a program that draws to a windows surface with gdi or even through opengl or direct3d you ll see it lags behind the real cursor by a few miliseconds and this is noticable to users very easily which is why modern rts games use this hardware cursor feature instead of reimplementing it themselves

16181555
implements	extends
there is no way to extends this feature that i m aware of - you will have to be a god of disassembly to modify windows and graphics drivers to implements the ability to draw multiple cursors

16181605

16181705
width	height

my application creates .txt file in the logs folder in the same directory with .exe

16181839
disk	ram
in order to do that you should basically look for 4 things cpu ram disk and network

16181908
getter	setter	mutators	getter	mutators	setter
getter and setter are usually called accessor and mutators in a class

getter	setter
meanwhile different class can have the same named getter or setter since those function names are in different class scope

the problem is you are storing height width elements in a one dimensional array - arraylist but retreiving only width number of elements

16187976

maven	m2e
we are using maven for manage multi-module projects and eclipse with m2e for development

16188038
m2e	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml	maven	m2e
unfortunately eclipse by itself does not understand the way maven works and even if m2e does a lot of work to make the a parent pom.xml with modules maven way look like the several logically independent projects eclipse way it breaks when i add a new module to the parent pom.xml

16188114
for-loop	loops
if it is indeed a access closure modified issue the way to fix this is simply to roll the for-loop into our linq statement or just use for loops all the way

integer	fractions
never cast an unknown fractions to integer as this can sometimes lead to unexpected results

16188358
super	implements
often the reason to have a class hierarchy is not to alter the behavior of the super class but to implements it

16188358
abstract-class	superclass	superclass	subclassing
more often than not the superclass will either be an interface and not a class or be an abstract-class following the template method pattern where some methods are kept abstract and multiple subclassing implements those but the general behavior is already fixed

16188358
superclass	subclassing
more concretely though if we assign a subclassing to a superclass instance variable like in your example we want to limit the impact on our code in the case we exchange the subclassing we only need to edit one single line

16188362
fixed-point	fractions
fixed-point representation saying the first 16 bits is the integral value the part before the . the second 16 bits is the fractions value significantly limits the range of numbers that can be represented since it reduces the maximum number to a 16-bit int and potentially wastes all the bits after the . which may not be needed

you can qtreeview is only a qtableview with some art for first

16188690
width	height
the border lines that continues after the end of the table are the borders of a tag with the same height and width as those defined for the table

this way i can set the width and height to whatever it needs to be and for any image and size of the container with a little absolute positioning and the full image is always displayed

16188835

basically for cgi s the interface between apache and your programm are the commandline args the environment variables and stdout and stderr

16188962

as for you current implementation youve added uibutton inside a uiimageview so probably you want every part of image to accept the click event in that case your x and y coords of uibutton would be 0 0 rather than red.x and red.y however width and height are correct

16188965

xslt	xquery
either xslt 2.0 or xquery 1.0 can handle this in principle but the performance depends on the actual volumes and on the complexity of the queries

16190637
xslt	xquery
generally i know it sounds banal xslt is better at transformation generating a new document from each source document while xquery is better at query extracting a small amount of information from each source document

16191649
sqlhelper	sqlparameter
in looking through the code of sqlhelper it looks like if you use the overload of executereader that takes sqlparameter instances instead of just the parameter values then you ll save the step where sqlhelper tries to figure out what parameter maps to what value - and thereby saving a second trip to the database and the second connection and the promotion of your transaction to the msdtc

16201360
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
you need to decide in touchesbegan which side they started on and then do something like this in touchesmoved

16201460
hide	show
and use browser scripts to show hide control the window

16201476
clang	llvm
while llvm tries to remain platform independent c is very much platform dependent in this respect and so clang does the abi-specific lowering of structs passed by value and structs returned by value so that the subsequent llvm ir -- native code lowering just works

16201535
gxt	smartgwt
neither gxt nor smartgwt require sticky sessions and neither suffers from the issue discussed on vaadin.com

16201545
width	height
however this works because you specified width and height

16201561
accessor	properties
now i interpret this as my object has a public properties called foo and both it s accessor s are public

16201561
accessor	properties
i interpret that as my object has a private properties called foo and both it s accessor s are private

16201561
accessor	properties
i interpret that my object has a private properties called foo and both s it s accessor s are public which is the behavior that i want

16201561
accessor	properties
i d like the private properties with public accessor

16201618
client-side	server-side
when you activate js and visit langleav.tumblr.com you get a server-side redirect to langleav.com and then a client-side redirect to langleav.com tagged popular

16201695
hash	salt
as you said changepassword doesn t work here are the methods used by membership provider to generate salt and hash password

16201760
put	get	flask	django
django is a big framework consider using flask microframework it shouldn t take your more than 4 hours to get the basics and put together simple application

16201766
google-chrome	firefox
i thought maybe it was google-chrome so i tried ie10 and firefox

16201766
google-chrome	firefox
ie10 can t load the paypal developer page at all and firefox gets exactly as far as google-chrome does

16201794
equals	gethashcode
you need to override gethashcode whenever you override equals which you should also do when you implement so that classes that rely on it such as can handle it correctly

16201822
post	get
i tried both get post methods but the result is the same

16201836
accessor	properties
if the properties is public then its method can have either public or private or any accessor

16201905
post	put
1 have isarchived as a property of every archive-able entity which must be included in put and post requests even if archiving isn t relevant to the request

16201960
versioning	upgrade
i got this error in airbrake at production i just uploaded a versioning with an upgrade of both rails and ruby to 1.9.3 and 3.2

16201971
getter	setter
the entity class should have getter and setter for the property

16202053
width	height
if no height or width is specific it will be empty this is not a problem if a width and height is specified but i like to cover my bases. my suggestion would be to simpyl add a paragraph with text

16202056
codeigniter	yii
but i am a big codeigniter fan not yii

nmatrix	sciruby
commenters rightly noted that not much work has been done on the sciruby gem but nmatrix is under extremely active development

16202090
nmatrix	sciruby
full disclosure i m one of the lead developers for nmatrix and a co-founder of the sciruby project

16202114
getter	setter
class filters it s important to use here getter setter and default xmlaccessortype

16202114
getter	setter
use getter setter pair and default accessor type

16202135
nmatrix	sciruby
we have a fork of it in sciruby s github account which supports nmatrix instead of narray

16202173
hide	show
you create an input field that is hidden call the datepicker on that input field call the show action on the datepicker and then add a little css to hide the small white arrow at the top of the datepicker div

16202180
matlab	simulink
any suggestions with regard to initializing the system states in fmu files in matlab simulink are much appreciated

16202209
getter	setter
if i remember correcly c#v1 did not support access modifiers for the getter and setter

16202209
getter	setter
there was no use to override both getter setter because in that would render the property-access modifier useless

16202209
getter	setter	implements	modifiers
why the access modifiers for the getter setter is more restrictive has in my opinion something to do with easier implements interfaces which always have implicitly public properties

16202211
post	put
but as to whether you should use put or post depends

16202236
nmatrix	sciruby
nmatrix and statsample are probably the most useful sciruby gems for linear algebra and statistics respectively though you might also find these useful distribution minimization and integration

16202236
nmatrix	sciruby
there s also a fork which supports nmatrix over in the sciruby github account

16202243
uiview	calayer
a programmatically constructed view that presents opengl es content is simply a uiview that uses a caeagllayer for its backing layer instead of a standard calayer

16202263
width	height
the code basically adds a sublayer of width height 1.0f

16202263
width	height
0 0 and so the sublayer added is not shown because it has width height 0.0f

16202393
pop-up	dialog
at the moment i have a word search and i want to display the solution completed word search in a pop-up dialog so the user can quickly switch bertween their puzzle and the answers

16202394
post	get
next you can perform ordinary javascript redirect using common window.location.href in case of get redirect or fill and submit some hidden form if post redirect is required

16202419
pop-up	dialog
i am using the code from this post how to implement a pop-up dialog box in ios

16202435
google-chrome	firefox
on firefox 20.0 and google-chrome 26.0.1410.65 this acts like i expect on the second load the browser sends if-modified-since and if-none-match in the request and receives a 304 not modified

16202445
ienumerable	iqueryable
exposing iqueryable vs ienumerable generic vs non-generic

16202446
getter	setter
this way you can return any variables that are inside the scope of your plugin similar in concept to normal getter setter

16202457
children	parent
i have a parent process and a child process children are created using fork some where in the parent process this code is defined

16202468
google-chrome	safari
update seems to work in google-chrome but not safari for windows

16202493
for-loop	loops
it seems like something is wrong with the for-loop in my __str__ self function in the class library the idea is that i want loops to iterate over ever book in the collection but i m not sure what the problem is

16202517
disk	ram
the implications of storing expired sessions is that you ll waste disk space or ram which is especially bad with redis

16202595
google-chrome	safari
it seems to work great in most of the popular newer browsers that i ve tried but for some reason google-chrome doesn t display it in the same way and my guess is that safari acts in the same way

16202617
post	get
the best way to secure variables which you don t want the user to see is to use post actions instead of get actions

16202617
post	get
post vs get comparison

16202634
post	get
keep in mind that even using post you re not really hiding anything from someone who wants to get at that data

16202634
post	get
be very careful of what kind of data you allow to be sent in get and post

16202646
children	parent
i tried using parent children closest but to no avail

16202663
post	get
in fact that s the same json that i ll pulled down from the get and i m just trying to post it back

16202708
persistent	transient
on both nodes remove the persistent nameid-format so both will have transient at the top of the list

16202722
post	get
make sure that all post and get values have been sent properly to your script

16202747
for-loop	arrays
note for..in does not garuntee order if you need to ensure order you will have to make your arrays indexed instead of and use a for-loop or while instead

16202763
public	protected
in java difference between default public protected and private

16202792
express	node.js
i m using node.js and express along with the request module

16202841
viewdidload	viewdidappear
you should add the code into your mainviewcontroller.m or other uiviewcontroller .m file and depending what behaviour you want the code should be added into - void viewdidload or - void viewdidappear methods

16202848
mouseup	mousedown
in my experience the mousedown mouseup dragstart dragend events work fine in place of touchstart touchmove touchend

16202894
int	chars
converts the chars to an int

16202908
integer	unsigned

16203020
fseek	fread
i am trying fseek and fread but it does not seem to be working properly

16203038
crossover	mutation
now the problem is with generation of illegal values greater than 2n during crossover and mutation

16203038
crossover	mutation
one way would be to replace the illegal value with a legal value during both crossover and mutation

16203038
crossover	mutation
so i am wondering if i can leave the checking and replacing at the time of crossover and mutation and instead do it at after both are done.so i after i have the new generation i will iterate through the chromosomes of each individual and replace illegal strings and calculate fitness

16203051
mouse	keyboard
the first approach would be to listen to every mouse and keyboard events

16203051
mouse	keyboard
a user having a mouse is likely to also have a keyboard

16203086
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter
using mouseenter and mouseleave instead of mouseover and mouseout

edit - updated to show fadein fadeout on image change

16203098
ssl	https
i can t use https ssl as my web host does not support it for free

16203104
inherited	properties
since ng-include creates a child scope all primitive properties were converted to object properties so that javascript prototypal inherited will work as expected when values are changed scope objects defined in the mainctrl get changed rather than new primitive properties being created on local scopes

16203107
put	get
you can put that into up down - and you should get one distinct connection that was used

16203115
rdf	owl
what i would like to do is to permit the author of an xml file to link the data types they define to semantics provided as a separate rdf owl document

16203145
width	height
i believe my comment suggestion of form.width will work as well since top left width and height all come from the bounds themselves

16203179
put	get
if i get 5 or more similar classes i ll create a folder and put them in the folder on that same level

16203193

i have a function to show and hide a utility bar on a page

16203339
shadowing	named
you are shadowing the class item with a local variable of the same named

16203361
mouse	keyboard
this gets really tricky with devices like the microsoft surface which come with a keyboard mouse and have a touch screen

16203361
mouse	keyboard
this can lead to design decisions to eliminate things which are completely touch-unfriendly even though that may mean compromising on mouse keyboard functionality

16203361
mouse	keyboard
this means ensuring that the custom control is at minimum touch keyboard mouse friendly

16203379
plm	plyr
i have thought of using the plm reshape or plyr package but i can t find an efficient to do it when i want to use lag and diff with my unbalanced panel

16203382
int	double
first the casting issue when you cast a double to an int the decimal portion is rounded down

16203382
int	double
math.random always returns a double between 0 and 1 so when cast to an int it s always truncated to zero as well

16203382
addition	multiplication
to fix this simply add parenthesis to force the multiplication and addition to happen before the casting like supericy said

16203382
for-loop	arrays
this suggests a way to make your code more clear you can remove the spawn arrays and the inner for-loop in order to call the zombie constructer with randomxspawn and randomyspawn directly

16203390
move	drag
i have a card a game in which the person chooses the card and drag done through translate animation and then when let go it move to the center of the screen where have an imageview place holder

16203440
move	drag
if i understand what you need please correct me if i m wrong you want to move some uiviews when a drag pan event is detected but you also add uiimageviews when the user touches the screen and this disables the touches

16203477
mef	prism
we are building a wpf application using prism and mef

16203639
pop-up	dialog
2. when you click click me it should pop-up the dialog box drag me #1 - then when you hit the enter key it goes to dialog box drag me #2 then when you hit enter again the dialog box drag me #3 did not show up

16203646
put	get	post	get	post	put
valid methods are get post put delete and jsonp

16203661
qsort	bsearch
here is some sample code using qsort and bsearch

16203664
apache-poi	excellibrary
you also should really look into getting an excellibrary for java apache-poi and using application msexcel rather than relying on application vnd.ms-excel to convert html to excel if this project is meant to have any real-world usefulness

16203672
folder	directory
the file is located in a folder names images which is in the same directory as header.php which is trying to load the image

16203689
inherited	properties
if you have a control hierarchy you can also set the containercontrol.autovalidate properties to inherited and simply set the outermost container to enableallowfocuschange

16203694

as long as the action supports a body message post but not get you can pass a data parameter to the action method of your resource which will be sent in the body of the request

16203740
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
maybe you could enclose the above code in a for-loop that loops through your arrays

16203745
getter	setter
getter and setter functions and other variables like offset

16203759
spaces	delimiter
assign the entire line into one string then split the string using a spaces as a delimiter and covert the second two into integers

16203765
pull	push
then the coders would push and pull to from remote coders push to but never pull from origin and also never push to resources

16203765
pull	push
resources would always pull push to and from origin but never to coders

16203780
realloc	malloc
you need to make sure the nrcolumns is initialized and you need to test both for a failed read file is shorter than expected and a failed memory allocation via malloc or realloc and handle the error conditions gracefully

16203799
google-chrome	firefox
therefore and because their code is bound to firefox internal apis you can t install firebug or any of its extensions within google-chrome

16203902
put	get
i will be getting data via an http get later but i just put these in her for testing

16203913

slider	caroufredsel
i m using caroufredsel to make the slider but i can t make it work with an undefined amount of slider i hope i m being clear enough

16203962
google-chrome	firefox
if it is essential to have the border images in ie10 then since a different approach would be needed for ie10 you may as well use the same approach for the google-chrome and firefox as well and not use the border-image style at all

16203986
portrait	landscape
and i have two galleries one for orientation portrait and the other for landscape

16203986

16204064
hide	show
just remove show and hide effects like this

16204067

because some of them are png some are jpg and some are gif

16204208
g++	gcc
compile with a version of g++ supporting c++11 in my case gcc 4.7.2

16204214
put	get
it does that however i get status failing0 status passing1 as a final out put .

16204242
google-chrome	firefox
i believe that ie will allow you to click drag whatever on the element if there s nothing else in front of it but google-chrome and firefox will consider it hidden by the content area even if there s nothing actually there

16204347
nfa	dfa
this observation should also let you design a dfa or nfa for the language but i ll leave that as an exercise

16204376
min	max	range	max	range	min
i have a datetime chart where i have a variable min max range and variable pointrange

16204376
min	max	range	max	range	min
the start and end points of the data may end up such that there is an overlap with the min max range

16204503
int	boolean
if you need to do anything fancy with bit strings you ll probably want to use a third-party module like bitarray or bitstring which let you create objects that can be treated as strings of 1s and 0s sequences of boolean int etc.

16204503
unsigned	short
the h means to pack it as an c unsigned short â that is two bytes

16204593

as an example following is my attempt to constrain the items to have show instances which fails with couldn t match type chars with int

16204745
post	get
i have a query to get a post in wordpress

16204759
margin	text-align
the default of an image is inline-block which makes it act as text that is why text-align center to the parent works on the other hand if you make it a block with a specific with and margin auto you assure that it is not treated as text and will be centered in all browsers

16204770
unsigned	short	integer	unsigned
to convert that into a string of bytes you can use the pack function in the struct mode and tell it the data argument it a short 2-byte unsigned integer by using a format string of h

16204802
width	height
i don t have the code i just want a portrait orientation and the images will actually resize depending on the sliders width and height

16204805
google-chrome	firefox
in i beleive the same day it effected both my production and dev site collections in ie8 firefox and google-chrome

16204861
g++	gcc
you mentioned libstdc++ in a comment which makes me suspect that the problem is that you re linking with g++ rather than with gcc

16204861
g++	gcc
and it turns out that the g++ command unlike the gcc command implicitly links the math library at least in the version on my system

16204909
centos	linux

16204995
unicorn	webrick
the problem occurs when i m using either unicorn or webrick

16205017
width	height
you set position relative on the parent container #overlay and set the width to 100 and the height to 100

16205073
try-catch	exception-handling
ecmascript 5 supports get and set declarations on known properties and in future revisions will support proxies which could listen for any changes to an object but if your application is going to support ie anything or any devices where users aren t opting into downloading developer browsers and enabling dev-switches you re going to have to either leave a lot of users behind for a few years consider contract-lengths for smartphones and that mobile browsers still aren t there or implement the old version and test compatibility inside try-catch clauses because using these features otherwise could cause hard exception-handling or just not work depending

16205184
put	get
if you get tired of doing that put usr local bin higher on your path that usr bin or create a shell alias or stick it in the environment variable cxx and write instead of g++

16205186
post	get
you can get the method get post etc. from the request object

16205191
width	height
so far the two images are sized the same height and width so if i can get the 3 lines to fit their height it would display nicely

16205200
jar	war
they might be still in the jar or war file

16205246
post	get
adding a single method with out post and get does not work

you can also consolidate your output streams stdout stderr to stdout and take the value

16205440
httprequest	httpresponse
i have httprequest requestline headers message and httpresponse statusline headers message types which are used in the chain

16205440
ready	each	httprequest	httpresponse
each function should receive httprequest objects from upstream and forward httpresponse objects to packrequest which simply packs up the httpresponse objects in a bytestring ready to be sent with socketwrites

16205442
ng-init	ngmodel
i couldn t make it work with the onload ng-init ngmodel etc.

16205465
ssl	https
yes any user can easily examine the data in a post request even over https ssl using software like burp suite webscarab or paros proxy

16205471
filesystems	hfs+
some systems such as the hfs+ filesystems on mac os x systems do provide a creation date but since it s not a standard feature there s no standard api to get it and you will likely have to take advantage of filesystem-specific or at least platform-specific code

16205502
width	height
when i drag a control such as a button to the grid in interface builder in xcode 4.6.2 i can specify numbers for the width and height in the size inspector but not for the origin which is grayed out

16205541
equals	tostring
you should be aware that in java all class inherits from object and the latter at the same time implements the tostring and equals methods so in any of your classes can redefine the behavior of these methods without having to declare as abstract in the parent class quad

16205553
screens	tablet
i m building something mainly for use on tablet where the user can tap an item on the screens and a class is applied to it

the the images width and height to 100

16210988
cpython	pypy
you should consider pypy cpython maybe even writing a python extension in c

16210988
cpython	pypy
so the best bet would be to use pypy or cpython when speed is really important

16210990
put	get
when a user accesses the menu page you can still get the id from the session and you will not need to put it into the url

16211024
post	get
this one localhost cakesite news slug-id is working but when i have the pointer over the link i get localhost cake post show 75 but once i click on it it redirects me on the right url which appears in my browser like localhost cake news slug-75

i have put the aboce codes to show what s connected with what but if you need anything alse let me know i will edit the post

16211118
google-chrome	firefox
the code in question works in google-chrome firefox and ie 6-10 so wouldn t need that much tweaking to make it work in an ipad

16211131
client-side	server-side
an ajax request don t do pagination in the server-side datatables will handle it for you in the client-side this means that you don t have to send the current page to the server you just return all the available rows if the number of rows is really high try to force the user to filter like search by name id or something else you can then send that filter in the ajax request

16211133
puts	gets
attempting to paste in puts ã ã ã¼ã ã ãœãÿ gets puts

16211143
put	get
any that aren t on the list get either discarded or put in a queue for administrator approval

16211148
width	height
never mind guys i solved it....it was due to the fact that i was positioning the div with a relative height and width so i just used margin-top instead

16211180
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk

16211215
int	chars
this will load your table into a structured array where time is saved as a string of 8 chars s8 values as unsigned int and the label as a string with max 33 chars s33 you may have to adjust this size

16211265
tablesorter	datatables
but with datatables or tablesorter i don t know if it is possible

integer	unsigned
yes unsigned integer can store large value

16211550
post	put
put the post back controls inside the update panel and have the file upload controls out

16211587
put	get
so you ll red data from a file in this case and store them in a list after tokenizing them just count them if you just want to get input from the console use the bufferedreader tokenize them separating with space put in list simple get size

16211588
integer	unsigned
assuming int type is 32-bit unsigned integer

16211588
division	multiplication
however the conversion will involve division and multiplication where integer overflow might happen when you convert from book code back to the keys

16211588
int	chars
if possible you may want to extend the set of chars to 64 chars 26 2 english alphabet in lower upper case 10 digits and 2 special chars possibly _ or - where you can play with bit shifting - which is safe from int overflow

16211617
jtable	jslider
wrong wrong everything is wrong you can t to determine any keyshortcuts that can be used as inputs chars to the jtextcomponents jslider jcombobox autocomplete too jtable with iscelleditable true

16211654
width	height
newlatlngbounds boundary width height padding at any time even

16211785
width	height
but otherwise i would suggest to do two rectangles so both just have the half of the height width depending on where you want do have the colors

16211808
cpython	pypy
run your code with pypy instead of cpython

16211819
oncreate	setcontentview
put this line in the oncreate function after setcontentview

16211824
setcontentview	findviewbyid
findviewbyid must be called after the setcontentview call otherwise you ll be getting nullpointerexceptions all the time

16211860
hide	show
i have this checkout page you will have to add an item which uses the javascript jquery seen in this jsfiddle to show hide some fields for a separate shipping address

16211860
submit	submission
when you submit the form you should be taken to the paypal login screen try filling out the form without toggling the different shipping address and submission but if you toggle the shipping address it just comes back to the same page

16211860
hide	show
if i comment out those bits and manually toggle visibility with dev tools or if i fill out the billing form and never show hide the shipping so .val is never called everything works fine

16211887
folder	directory
yes you can pass only the folder name to os.mkdir but then it ll create that folder in the current working directory

16211896
int	double
bool loadfromdata double data unsigned int columns unsigned int rows double minx double maxx double miny double maxy

16211930
range	max
when i select max datecolumn i get a value roughly half way across the range of dates

16212010
folder	directory
the advantage here is the script is independent of the number of fields so given any number of folder the file is always moved into the parent directory

16212017
width	height
myelement +myelementval mypopupname width 500 height 400 resizable yes top 100 left 200 scrollbars yes .......

16212050
noscript	meta
adding a noscript section with a html refresh meta tag in it is also a good solution

16212094
for-loop	loops
the last one is a for-loop practically the same as the first one but using fors instead of while loops

16212094
for-loop	loops
so in that case the for-loop is starting with value 0 loops will continue as i n and at the end of loops i++ will be called

16212138
hide	show
the problem is that when i check show obj-c only and hide system libraries flags all the lines in call tree list is hidden but the code in the project is written in obj-c

16212159
subtract	add
you can subtract or add two data.frame s together if they are the same dimensions

16212168

i ve also switched to using union all since the result sets produced are already distinct

16212186
maven-failsafe-plugin	maven-jetty-plugin
i am running integration test using maven-jetty-plugin and maven-failsafe-plugin

16212190
free	malloc
is it possible to add a dynamically allocated buffer using malloc to a nsmutabledictionary and then free it after the add directly

16212214
submit	submission
i suspect that you are using ajax to submit the form and in case of successful submission you are refreshing the contents and thus the date picker is no longer bound to the input field

16212343
folder	directory
because the tree directory in the ipad where it doesn t exist a resources folder we can t use resources.load and even so because how this feature must work the texture won t be available at the beginning so we can t put it initially in the resources folder

16212410
min	max
i should write a shell script that it will print the line with the max and min numbers

16212444

16212466
wordpress	joomla
i am working since more than 6+ month in different technologies like joomla wordpress php jquery

16212501
jar	war

16212525
noscript	meta
you should also add a html redirection meta tag in a noscript element to redirect javascript disabled browsers too

16212557
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

16212577
division	multiplication
this because 1 x is simpler than y x and multiplication is faster than division

16212577
cos	sin
as mentioned in the comments some floating point operations log sin cos etc will take more than one often more than ten operations to get the result

16212592

however when i added the following method and ran it via the deployjava.js as per my original post above i get the following output returned with the error appearing whether or not the jar is self signed

16212645
portrait	landscape
i would like to always display it in portrait and landscape

16212650

google-chrome	firefox
not every browser acts the same way with self-signed certificates google-chrome - firefox

16213055
stateless	stateful
to run stateless or stateful code shared across controllers â use angular services instead

16213073
min	max
you can try to use setminmax on your raster file to try and work out the min and max values and store them in the returned raster object

16213229
free	malloc
above that could be the standard malloc free that it uses and above those the operating system dealing with pages and actual memory allocation per process it is basically not concerned not only about multiple heaps but even user-level heaps in general

16213237
mouseup	mousedown
now the problem as long as the content of the splitcontainer is smaller than the actual viewport hence no scrollbars visible touch input is interpreted as left mousedown mouse move and left mouseup which is exactly what i d expect and love to see

16213269
division	modulo
bonus question i guess the modulo is based on division and since the

16213335
width	margin
then set width 3 width and margin -widthgrid of the first textblock

16213348
int	chars
you want ten million strings of typical length 7 and you have the ten million int also and on the jvm strings are two bytes per chars plus overhead so you are certain to need at least 180 mb to hold this

16213376
apache	nginx
as php.ini settings changes require apache nginx or whatever server to be reloaded

16213392
google-chrome	safari
you could use the browsers developertools firebug google-chrome devtools safari web inspector to measure the performance of the different apps

16213396

i want to parse a planet feed which has multiple rss that supports multiple languages like spanish german etc

16213445

it handles the ajax request including any filtering sorting and paging and returns the data in the format the grid requires

16213667
post	get
however with the code below i don t get any related post displayed

16213667
post	get
when i removed i get 3 related post display but with the current post being one of them

you may take a look at higher level image library such as imagemagick which has a c++ api called magick++ here is an example of writing an image in memory to a png file

16213852
google-chrome	firefox
this occurs in ie10 firefox google-chrome

16213897
post	get
otherwise a better practice is for both get and post methods to call a common function like processrequest ...

getter	setter
the above class has constructors as well as getter and setter

jar	war
while creating the war file of project1 i included all the jar files from project2

16214384
installation	upgrade
upgrade tycho to 0.17.0 but it turns out the issue indeed has nothing to do with tycho - i realized i ve tweaked the location properties on windows in an attempt to prepare to support installation into c program files post-xp with uac

16214477
getter	setter
the getter forwards the call to the base while the setter also calls collectionmodified presumably to notify whomever is watching for modifications in the collection

16214537
uilabel	uitextview
you can use different color different font and different size text in your control uilabel uitextfield or uitextview by using this class method

16214563
submit	submission
if my guess is correct first you are clicking on submit button then it is redirecting to form2.py form.html is submission value to form2.py so the value form firstname .value exists

16214571
width	height
when i play from sd card it shows correct width and height in full screen

16214704
nunit	mstest
notably nunit and i m pretty sure mstest do use private reflection and hence pick up tests in private classes which is probably why it never seemed an important thing for you to worry about before

16214719
d3.js	raphael
two months later a passerby comes by and ask some question about our project and i explained that we didn t use raphael instead we chose static svg and d3.js because raphael used canvas s and our project would have been greatly disadvantaged by using canvas s

16215322
hide	show
here s a reference to jquery s hide and show functions

16215450
mpfr	mpc
2 note if gcc links dynamically to the prerequisite libs gmp mpfr mpc then the shared libraries must be in the dynamic linker s path ld_library_path both when building gcc and when using the installed compiler

16215450
mpfr	mpc
simple example without dynamic link to gmp mpfr mpc

16215466
getter	setter
the downside of using the compiler is a lot of duplicate pre-compiled code but the benefit is that the majority of the places where your getter and setter are used will either be minified or just changed to inline references to the variables

16215466
getter	setter
also by putting in explicit getter setter and properly annotating them with jsdoc annotations

16215466
getter	setter
otherwise i would follow chris s suggestion and look into js getter setter other reference here

width	height
the images are all pretty much the same width but the height varies and i want to position on top and hide the bottom for anything larger then the square wrapper

16215733
width	height
unfortunately not all the images have the same height to width ratio

16215733
width	height
so was thinking of creating a wrapper around the image that would set the height by the current width of the image and the rest would be hidden

16215733
width	height
but i don t want to resize the images height wise just fill 100 width wise and overflow on the bottom

width	height
the only thing i d do in your case is to add the images with an tag inside the in your html and give them all the same class instead of putting them all in individually via css as then when you define the media queries for your responsive layouts you d only have to modify the width and height for that one class and your images would all scale accordingly

16226457

hide	show
what you can do is copy the .btn-group last-child and .btn-group first-child css and apply it dynamically when you show hide buttons

a simpler version of the + operation would be just union but that only makes sense when the two types have distinct values and so you can distinguish between without the labels

now i would like to have a submit update records button below this table which on clicking updates the corresponding records - against which the checkbox has been selected to update the value of checkbox column - accepted in this case

i would recommend instead using a named functor because the semantics of those input triples giving an x y coordinate of a cell with a count are subtly different from that of the output triples giving an x y coordinate of upper left corner and an extent height width of the square

16226772
width	height
well we could generate all possible squares possibly limiting ourselves to those that fit inside the height and width of our board and then check whether any have the required corner

ienumerable	ilist
i ve read in some of the threads here to choose ienumerable over ilist to pass data from controller to views

loops	while-loop
it is quite likely that having an if inside a while-loop will run slower but modern compilers are quite clever and i have certainly seen cases where the compiler hoists such a choice out of loops in cases where the conditions don t change

16251393
loops	while-loop
having two while-loops is harder for the compiler to make better because it most likely won t see that you are doing the same thing in both loops because the compiler works from the bottom of the parse-tree up and it will optimize the inside of the while-loop first then go out to the if-else side and at that point it s lost track of what s going on inside each loops

i am trying to write chars double and int back to my binary file base on my string arraylist

16255499
int	double
it uses double as the data type for multiplication which moves the decimal places into the int part and then makes the decimal place truncating long conversion

int	chars	int	double
now assuming that you always write data as chars int double into your file and that there are no chances where your data would be out of order or incomplete as chars int chars double you can simply read the data randomly by specifying the position in the file measured in bytes from where to fetch the data as

16255825
int	boolean
it will also return nil if it does exist and it is either an int or a boolean with a value of zero false or no for the boolean

16256857
post	get
for sending large payloads of data you should use post requests - not get requests

16256887
post	get
you should use post instead also your get variable title is vulnerable to sql injection you should escape it in the same fashion as you are with the variable context

16256903
width	height
the gridbagconstraints.both will stretch the component horizontally and vertically to fill the entire width and the entire height of its cell

16256912

you then have a uiview subclass you can place on another xib as a uiview which for which you set the class to adunewrowheaderview or instantiate in code and add as subviews

16256912
uiview	subviews
alternatively you could create the uiview and it s subviews buttons labels ... in code

16256913
for-loop	loops
i find that if i initialize an empty dictionary at the beginning and then adding elements to the dictionary in a for-loop about 110 000 keys the value for each key is a list also increasing in loops the speed goes down as for-loop goes

16256922
versioning	upgrade
once user upgrade his os versioning which is obviously bad - we would

16256967
deselect	multi-select
we can deselect everything and show the message to the user but also if selecting with shift-click multi-select somewhere close to the end of the list what should be done when some items appear in the middle of list upon loading some of the middle pages concurrent user added items

16256997
client-side	server-side
php is a server-side scripting language while javascript is client-side

the first table gigs entity looks like this i am leaving out the getter and setter

16257049
rss	feed
it seems you try to parse an rss feed

16257099
width	height
if you want the uibarbuttonitem to show exactly at position 0 0 you can create a uibutton sets its frame to -5 0 width height assuming that the offet of a left barbutton item is 5 0 and place that in a uiview that you set as leftbarbuttonitem

16257108
int	chars	int	double
let s say i want to read a binary file which contains three of data types chars int and double however this binary file can contain any number of these three data types in any order.

and then i want to store three of these data types to chars array list double array list and int array list

16257120
int	chars
there is no magic function that can distinguish between lets say 4 chars and 1 int

16257132
width	height
i have done a good bit of searching on this and it is possible to use padding to preserve the aspect ratio of a div by making its height relative to its width whenever the width of the screen is altered

16257132
width	height
rather than making the height relative to the width of the div i need the width of the div to change whenever the height of the browser window is altered

16257390
hash	salt
note that the output file is just a 20 byte sha1 hash with no salt

16257390
hash	salt
if there were salt the hash would have to include it probably prepended before the last 20 bytes that hold the sha1 hash

16257390
hash	salt
this tells us that signing the raw sha1 hash of a file with no salt is the same as using the openssl dgst -sha1 -sign command to sign the file so it must be that the openssl dgst -sha1 -sign command also did not use any salt when generating its sha1 hash for sig2

16257468
post	get
also you should use get rather than post for actions which consist in getting or reading things

16257488
hash	md5
this password is hash in database sha1 md5 etc but at login time i store the plain-text password in session or in a non-persistent at memory secure cookie

16257996
put	get
if not you could put one object in a hashset for instance and then later check to see if a separate instance is in the set and incorrectly get back false even though the equals method would have considered the objects equivalent

16258004
mouseleave	mouseenter
this function receives two functions as parameters the first function is triggered when the mouseenter the element and the second function executes when the mouseleave the element

what you need to do to encrypt values greater than that is to generate a key encrypt the data using a symmetric cipher aes is not a bad choice and encrypt the aes key using your private rsa key preferably along with some other random data

16260499
rsa	aes
the aes key is a maximum of 256 bits which will encrypt just fine with rsa and aes does not have a size limit

but as you guessed the fastest would be indeed to use the fts3 fts4 feature of sqlite3

16260884
fts4	fts3
in short you create a virtual fts3 fts4 table in your database then you insert in this table the whole text of your main records in the fts text field forcing the id field to be the one of the original data row

16268265
int	double
the rhs is returning a double while only works on int

16268270

16268760
post	get
this still may not work right away if you get errors edit your post and tell us what goes wrong

16268760
getter	setter
this isn t wrong but it is recommended to use getter and setter as you do and make the variables private

16268782
int	boolean
instead you can use resultant int value 0 or 1 as if it was boolean - it typically works great for all intents and purposes including using it in boolean expressions

the preferred size would need to take into account the x y position as well as the width height of the rectangle

16268879
for-loop	loops
the reason i have moved i to outside the for-loop is to state it can be any variable initialized before loops

16268916

it s against best practice to insert a post or get directly into your database without any form of mitigation against sql injection

16269632
cos	sin
the calculator is working fine but i m having troubles with my sin cos and tan formulas

16269634
google-chrome	safari
it s not a perfect solution but at least it will allow google-chrome to responds to keyboard commands and let safari use the fullscreen mode without key inputs as a fallback

16269647
getter	setter
because those do not use reflection-based getter setter access so there isn t much to optimize

16269666
gitolite	gitosis
i am having an external application control it which makes syncing admin git repos such as what gitosis and gitolite provide not practical

16269667
google-chrome	firefox
here is a demo that makes use of some of the html5 file api not as advanced as some of the stuff i ve been reading about but it seems security limitations make totally automating this a bit out of reach at the moment this demo works in firefox and google-chrome but i would guess only ie10 could stand a chance at supporting it

i have a form which onsubmit validates the form contents and hide the submit button and show an image while its processing

awt	swing
awt is the original ui toolkit and was replaced by swing although swing still utilizes it to perform it s work

16269962
google-chrome	safari
and paste the uri from the command line into a webkit google-chrome safari browser

16269991
width	height
you also do not need to respecify the width and height of the element as they have already been defined and should be retained even in the hover state

16270040

16270081
for-loop	arrays
your two dimensional arrays is going to go out of scope as soon as you iterate over the for-loop again

16270100
oncreate	onstart
if an activity needs to know a contentprovider s authority it would call a static method in your contract class and that call would be from one of the activity s onxyz methods like oncreate or onstart which would make sure that the context is initialized

16270139
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
also you have to set the body and html to padding 0 margin 0 width 100 and height 100 else this probably won t work in all browsers

16270173
hide	show
instead i wrote the code as if you have a panel control that you will hide show at the appropriate times and a label control within the panel

one css workaround is to nest your content divs in the navigation and display hide them on hover show them but in that case you need to specify the cursor for every element inside your content divs and as soon as your visitors mouse out of the content div it will disappear

16270281
awt	swing
that was used for awt but for swing is not appropriate

so for instance if the user is on a phone and turns from portrait to landscape the parent element must be able to resize and i d prefer to not have to use javascript for that

16270312
getter	setter
my preferences not that it matters is to use constructor injection as much as possible it allows me to have cleaner code without all the getter and setter that may break encapsulation logic

16270345
post	get
get or post

16270347
post	get
i get this exception intermitently when trying to post some data over https

16270349

16270674
stdout	fflush
the system call is made only when you fflush the buffer - either explicitly by calling fflush stdout or implicitly by printing n to a console

16270703
udp	tcp
udp is not a reliable protocol for file transfers but if you cannot do without it you better implement some controls that tcp already gives you for free like packet reordering data checksum etc

16270732
avr	microcontroller
in my case it s for an avr microcontroller using the avr-gcc suite but i imagine this problem would apply to gcc generally

16270775
int	chars
so it s not writing the int value you re sending to it instead its chars representation

16270787
free	realloc
also you should not call free string if realloc failed

16270842

if you are using a linux mac unix machine most of time i have had to either start from the root folder such as users .....to the source folder or when using a directory that is closer just use in front of it

16270842
folder	directory
you re using a directory named src with an img folder inside

16270850
folder	directory
you opened the src kilobolt path to show the locations of the source files but it you expand the bin folder and trace down you ll probably find the .class files in the bin kilobolt directory

16270867
button	checkbox
also many clickable ui elements menuitem button checkbox togglebutton already have a command property that you can bind to some icommand implementation in the viewmodel

16271222
maven	pom.xml
that is how you define a maven repository in your pom.xml file

16271230
inherited	properties
in these cases the properties are being inherited from a prototype rather than owned by the object node.style itself

16271230

if you want to test that the properties exists whether owned or inherited you can try the in operator

16271242

16271434
put	get
the problem i am having is when i try to pull out the id and put it back as an element i get the error

16271456
integer	unsigned
the problem isn t really with the max macro in particular but with a subtracting from an unsigned integer in a way that leads to an overflow and b as the warning suggests with how the compiler handles the comparison of signed and unsigned values in general

16271456
integer	unsigned
the first issue is pretty easy to explain when you subtract from an unsigned integer and the result would be negative the result overflows to a very large positive value because an unsigned integer cannot represent negative values

16271456
integer	unsigned
if the type of the operand with signed integer type can represent all of the values of the type of the operand with unsigned integer type the operand with unsigned integer type is converted to the type of the operand with signed integer type

16271456
integer	unsigned
otherwise both operands are converted to the unsigned integer type corresponding to the type of the operand with signed integer type

16271456

one simple approach would be to create two sets - one using a case-insensitive string comparer and one using a case-sensitive one

16271964

16281782
rss	feed
i am using nsxmlparser to parse data from the rss feed

16281796
int	boolean
because java is strongly typed a boolean and an int are two completely different data types and one can not be casted to the other - it can not be casted in fact

16281822
int	boolean
it doesn t allow this because the java designers correctly recognized that the boolean int overloading in c and c++ was a significant source of errors

16281822
int	boolean
java avoids this and other problems by making boolean and the int datatypes distinct types that cannot be converted from one to the other

16281822
int	boolean
now this doesn t explain why you cannot explicitly type cast a boolean to an int

16281822
int	boolean
and int - boolean is too

hide	show
as i understand there is a set of charts in the group footer and you want to hide and show some of them depending on the data

16286033

ant	ivyde
ant is happy with this but ivyde doesn t seem to resolve env.githome

16286336
interpolation	splines
use a cubic splines or other interpolation method between 0 or 255 and the value of the images edge pixel to come up with a substitute

16286371
allocator	stl
the idiomatic solution is to avoid direct heap allocator of c-arrays and to prefer an stl container like std vector which automatically handles resizing iteration and element access in an efficient portable manner

16286381
google-chrome	firefox
however it works well on google-chrome and firefox

16286491
getter	setter
i always thought i wont be able to modify the values of private variables without getter setter

16286491
getter	setter
is this expected behavior and pls explain where i am missing in my understanding in private variables and also getter setter

16286502
int	chars
i am trying to read a string of 9 chars into 9 int values to be stored in an array for now i store them in 9 separate int will put them in the array once they read in ok

16286502

16286529
int	chars
atoi is used for converting null-terminated strings chars and not chars into int

16286542
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
safari firefox google-chrome ie9+

16286562
factors	matrix
the fastest way to iterate over a matrix is in storage order doing it the wrong way round will increase the number of cache misses which if your matrix doesn t fit in l1 will dominate your computation time so read increase your computation time by a factors of cacheline elemsize probably 64 8 8

16286569
jsf	seam
the seam faces view scope is a little different in that it behaves just like the jsf view scope but allows cdi injection as well

16286579
put	get
disclaimer when you put no effort into the question -you get an abstract answer like this

16286615
equals	gethashcode
dictionary expects immutable object as a key with a stable gethashcode equals implementation

16286615
equals	gethashcode
implementation through overriding constructor gethashcode equals methods

put	get	post	get	post	put
i need to make a few synchronous requests using httpwebrequest some using each verb get put post delete and can t seem to get it to work

16286679
put	get
now i want to find a way to get the 500 best keypoints and put these in a new list

16286701
int	double
though you not mentioned whether you declared lbm as int or double i assume the first case and look below your code will be

16286701
int	double
but i suggest you need to use double instead of int to get the right result just like as

16286703
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
works fine for me in google-chrome safari firefox but it does not work in ie10

16286705
jtextfield	jlabel
so i have a greeting program with 3 jtextfields and 3 jlabel next to them and i want to add mnemonics which i believe is the little underline underneath one of the letters in the jlabel next to the jtextfield

16286728

after that i try html5 video tag mp4 ogg and webm but it only works in google-chrome and firefox and never in ie 9 10

16286739
screens	tablet
i want them aligned but the problem is that they don t fit in width if the screens is small on tablet looks perfect but on mobile it doesn t look good at all

16286751
bufferedoutputstream	bufferedinputstream
i have an upload with a bufferedinputstream and a bufferedoutputstream and now i want to get a progress in percent of this upload

16286763
jtextfield	jlabel
if your jlabel is called label and your jtextfield is called textfield

16286767
google-chrome	firefox
but the problem is i am able to display the searching ... text on button click only in firefox not in google-chrome or ie

16286773
put	get
now the problem is when i search for john doe instead of getting the user with that particular name i get all users named john and doe and the funny thing is that it does not even put john doe at the top meaning.

16286777
post	put
so i put an is running type variable in but that s not working either and it still fetches the data more than once and duplicates the post

16286778
width	height
i understand it s in planes and that the y data is basically black white luma and should be width height pixels in length

16286778
width	height
the u and v planes i believe to be width height 4 in size for each plane

16286828
background-image	background-color
update i removed the background-image for cote-droit-top and used a background-color instead

16286830
int	double
i do not see any problem with double for-each-loops but i see a big problem with operator which you are using for comparing int objects

16286894
portrait	landscape
with my sdk the app goes into portrait and landscape modes even though only landscape modes are specified in unity s build player settings

16286919
width	height
as you can see i have a click function that pulls the width and height in the title but need to apply the sizing to the inner div outer div and iframe at the same time as well as update the background image to match

16286933
strsplit	substr
see documentation for substr and strsplit

16286942
fink	macports
when installed it warns me that i have either macports or fink installed even though i ve removed both

16286952
pdfbox	itext
itext uses the bottom left as origin per iso standard but the pdfbox code and the program that gives me the coordinates to scrape from the pdf both use the upper left as the origin

16286952
pdfbox	itext
pdfbox s writer keeps corrupting the pdf so we have decided to go with itext to do the injection

16286952
pdfbox	itext
the trick is that the coordinates i used with pdfbox and the ones we get from the system generating the pdf don t seem to match up with itext s

16286992
put	get
i have a set 1 2 3 and i need to get all possible subsets of set with different sequences with repeating elements .the out put look

16287054
google-chrome	firefox
it all works fine in firefox and ie but in google-chrome it doesn t most times

16287057
mdpi	hdpi
i mean without extending hdpi mdpi etc

16287075
put	get
if you take any sequence that fills a tank with a high value of ui while there is a tank with a lower value of ui that has space then you can get a better sequence by filling the better tank first and using the extra water when you would use the water you would otherwise put into the worse tank

16287086
gson	jackson	org.json	gson	org.json	jackson
if you want to parse the elements more jsonobject s within the jsonarray you can do so by using the classes provided by the org.json package that is being distributed with android or use another json library like gson or jackson

16287132
folder	directory
to use it create a file in your app s directory called libs and download the file able.jar into the libs folder

16287134
google-chrome	firefox
my code works in google-chrome and firefox but in ie10 i get the error that window.indexeddb is undefined

16287141
folder	directory
but now i want to download the files from my assets folder and read the json file in my assets directory i m using file android_assets

16287163
integer	fractions
actually when i transform my coordinates into gui-coordinates they become fractions so i don t know how to paint them because drawline functions has integer argument int x1 int y1 int x2 int y2

16287163
qpainter	qimage
qpainter can be used in a thread to paint onto qimage qprinter and qpicture paint devices

16287176
hide	show
this will hide it by default allowing your js to show it later

16287196
int	double
so i was able to get this to run when everything was int but for some reason changing it to double i can only input the first value and it errors

16287240
width	height
first i have a single div that is height 100 and width 130px i have a 130x5px image that i want to repeat vertically until i get to 75 of the screen height

16287246
hide	show
even simple things like a visible binding could see use of over 4 or 5 values to show or hide

16287246
d3.js	raphael
whether use jquery to do it d3.js or raphael to manage canvas animations or the thousands thats already out there is totally up to you

16287254
gif	png
also in case you have more than one of these images instead of holding a var outside of the hover definition just swap either way between png and gif

16287290
min	max
you can also replace the having comparison with but i think the min max comparison would generally perform better

16287335
int	double
well the reason is expects an int and you are passing it a string that contains double which will result in a numberformatexception being thrown

16287378
mouse	trackpad
then you can move it simply scrolling on mac two fingers on the trackpad or using the mouse wheel

16287442
org-mode	font-lock
that last part is critical so note it wellâ org-mode reads the value of org-emphasis-alist when it is loaded and uses that value to generate a regular expression for highlighting font-lock purposes

16287473
qpainter	qimage
use a qpainter to paint into the qimage object

16287488
ubuntu	debian
if you are on ubuntu or debian install libgtk2.0-dev and pkg-config then re-run cmake or configure script in cvnamedwindow file home om opencv-2.4.4 modules highgui src window.cpp line 652

16287488
ubuntu	debian
if you are on ubuntu or debian install libgtk2.0-dev and pkg-config then re-run cmake or configure script in function cvnamedwindow

16287543
width	height
eventually i had to wrap everything in a div an put height and width to 100

16287548
rar	zip
i want to change my android application behave from reading a text file inside the apk to read it directly from a rar or zip file with password protection i think that it may be the same protection as when it is coded inside my apk

16287569
gson	jackson
if you work a lot with json data i would really recommend that you use gson or jackson

16287585
getter	setter
initialize them at appropriate times and make sure they have all the necessary getter not setter and utility methods so your other classes can work with the socket streams

16287595
submit	submission
if you don t want to submit your form you can override a button on the form to invoke a process that simulates a submission

16287624
nstextview	nsbutton
i have a nstextview and i add my custom nsbutton using

16287624
nsbutton	nstrackingarea
then inside my nsbutton subclass i have along with the nstrackingarea stuff

16287720
folder	directory
i would like the copy to search the source directory for the given filename and then recreate the folder structure in the destination as well as copy the file

16287732
put	get
note that if i don t put the kset.insert i don t get the error

16287771
for-loop	arrays
im cant really use the classic for-loop solution i don t think because some of the arrays elements are skipped out and displayed

16287773
getter	setter
so you can think about the getter setter functions as a declaration on the json of what you want out of it

16287786
hash	salt
create a hash of the file together with a salt

16287817
min	max
i have insert these procedures in the rolledback procedure but something is wrong now rolledback2 returns 0 is like the procedures for max and min returns anything

16287830
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
css3 animation support has only come recently to firefox safari internet explorer and opera desktop mobile and mini

16287839
children	parent
you can only traverse down the relationship graph as you describe it but not back up because all object relations in this context are unidirectional associations a commit knows only its parent but not its children

16287884
put	get
you can t select data like that from a stored procedure - you d have to put the resultant data into a temp table to get at it

16287909
puts	gets
that s a fancy little piece of code that gets the information row by row and puts it into the array

16287913
serializable	deserialization
you can use serializable deserialization and save in text-type field for array

16287928
versioning	upgrade
i ve installed all the dependencies through homebrew upgrade my xcode versioning and installed the xcode command line tools

16287970
gson	jackson
another option similar to jackson above is to use the gson library

16287980
min	max	for-loop	loops
the for-loop returns in a non list format loops twice and returns max1024m ideally i d like to have both min and max saved to different variables but one bridge at a time..

16288102
post	put
at the same time a post and a put

16288102
post	put
does this by default queuing up post put and delete ajax requests so they re sent one

16288103
button	checkbox
i have created programmatically a new form that has a combobox a list of checkbox and a button that will allow the form to return the needed information back to the calling routine

16288108
uiview	subviews
but anyway every time you would load up a uiview check all of its subviews in the viewdidload method i would think and for each subviews check for its class type in your case it would be uitextfield

16288119
post	get
this would allow get post requests to any user having the dude role

16288119
post	get
including this element for get and post means that the security constrain applies only to these two methods

16288162
getter	setter
under the hood it declares a private field and exposes the getter setter functions for it

16288162
getter	setter
here s one approach that uses object-oriented instance of the property other approaches allow defining setter getter on the object itself

16288179
implements	extends
public class receivecom extends asynctask implements layers

16288210
multiplying	add
to say that the effects of backtracking add up quickly would be an understatement they multiplying in geometric progression eventually consuming a lot of your cpu

16288223
width	height
topic you can gets width height of screen and w h of view

16288223
int	double
if you have content 1260x720 0.02 1260 24 6 px you can use also int 24.6 to convert double to int

16288247
pull	push
if this gets rejected because my local branch is not up to date git pull --rebase to redo my work on top of the most recent changes and git push again

16288257
sudo	passwd
sudo echo update mysql.user set passwd passwd mynewpass where user root

16288264
google-chrome	firefox
also i noticed it works properly with google-chrome but not firefox

16288288
width	height
and then you look at the properties on chrome s inspect element and the wrapper div shows up as 0px height and 0px width

16288316
namedtuple	dictionary
i later tested the namedtuple i can t modify it but to create the 10000 samples or something like that it took 1.4 seconds so the dictionary is indeed the fastest

16288327
google-chrome	safari
the fact that it affects webkit as a whole means that it should show up in google-chrome safari and any other webkit browser

16288333
children	parent
the css tag float does not allow the parent to see where the children actually end

16288368
hide	show
this is simple hide show event when user click on the checkbox

16288398
width	height
the columns height and width must adapt to the amount of text inside them when resizing the browser window but the three separators must have the same height

16288422
getter	setter
create a model that matches a system i use getter and setter some just use public fields to each his own

16288433
jar	manifest.mf
the file must be called manifest.mf and must be placed to meta-inf folder within your jar file

16288436
ubuntu	linux
i updated my linux distro to ubuntu 13.04 today and installed all my python packages

16288444
opera	firefox
opera handles it gracefully but firefox and ie10 refuses to do so.

16288446
public	protected
to check if the fault is in the function declaration i turned all the protected members public and i removed the friendship so mergesort can have access to all memebers and then the program compiled successfully

16288462
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
all that said i do have a potential solution which doesn t require extensive changes to your code and works in ie9 10 firefox pc mac google-chrome pc mac and safari mac

16288487
javadoc	scaladoc
this doesn t answer the question exactly as asked but is a solution that may actually be preferred for mixed java scala projects until scaladoc is capable of parsing javadoc comments

16288542
mouseup	mousedown
2 use mousedown - especially for firefox because it views click as both mousedown and mouseup

16288558
prepare	execute
i m currently working on a mysql trigger this is important because this rules out prepare execute combos that gets a pokã mon s type and looks up its affinity with another given type

16288634
put	get
i get the classes in a vector and i would like to put these classes at the original indexes

16288737
box-sizing	border-box
this works but it causes a shift in firefox i suspect it is because of the border but using box-sizing border-box doesn t stop it

16288737
width	height
i also tried adding width and height but it still shifts

16288773
chunked	transfer-encoding
transfer-encoding chunked

16288773
post	get
really all that should be happening here is i talk to the server to load some info it sees that i m not logged in whether it is a get or post and i should receive a redirect to the login page which doesn t happen

16288783
filesystems	hfs+
one notable exception is mac os x which is unix-based but uses a default filesystems type hfs+ that is not case sensitive.

16288837
width	height
the first view only uses a small part of the space and the rest is trasparent but it only works when its width and height is at match_parent so the other view is displayed under it but it is being blocked from receiving any touch events

16288839
pull	push
you may want to consider using a push pull connection instead

16288839
pull	push
replace your pub with a push and your sub with a pull

16288839
pull	push
see zmq push pull

16288916
folder	directory
my problem is that if i set liker- general- additional library directory to their individual debug folder and input- additional dependencies to the .lib files visual studio will give some random linker error 1104 cant open .lib file but it is now the same lib file every time sometimes is library1 sometimes is library2

16288943
oncreate	setcontentview
the problem being that you can t call things like requestwindowfeature after setcontentview is called example which is a problem since it is typically called in oncreate

16288980
spaces	linefeed
the newline character n should be included between the double however html does not allow for linefeed but thomas hunter suggested an hack which consists in using a bunch of white spaces like so

16289000
public	protected
this example assumes that myusercontrol_tabchangerequested is a public or protected method of your page

16289049
punctuation	words
isn t gaining you much since punctuation is going to cause a words boundary unless it s followed by other punctuation

16289051
google-chrome	firefox
see this link for an example of something that works elegantly in google-chrome but not in firefox

16289075
width	height
you need to try and clear the div with the float so try these adding a after the second div and adding to the div i just said to create as the style or you can simply specify the exact height width of the wrapper div let me know what happens please

16289129
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
but it is working on firefox opera and google-chrome but not for ie and safari i tried to include but it is still not working

16289133
folder	directory
on the first load you are in the folder containing the sub-folder destaque after you click on it your reference directory is destaque so clicking on it again would try and resolve destaque destaque destaque.html

16289159
mouseover	mousemove
the below is the js which is handling the mouseover and mousemove

16289186
put	get
there is a .clearmessages in mqmessage object but i can access that only when i call a get method i am looking for a way to clear the existing messages in the queue before i can put a new message into the queue

16289207
client-side	server-side
but imo the simpler solution would be to make the client-side code sync up with the server-side code instead of the other way around

16289207
client-side	server-side
pass your server-side generated uid to the client-side code and have your client-side code use that uid

16289209
awt	swing
take a look at performing custom painting and painting in awt and swing for more details

16289236
factors	matrix
the major difference i see is that the testid variable in the first version is a matrix rather than factors a vector

16289247
cout	cin
this disables the allegedly quite slow synchronization between cin cout and scanf printf i have never tried this myself but have often seen the recommendation such as here

16289273
apache	nginx
i am in the middle of setting up a 3 node web server cluster running nginx apache 2 and mysql

16289276
for-loop	loops
the second code fragment in a for-loop here is a boolean expression that if true lets loops run again

16289281
width	height
where left bottom width and height define the size and position of the axes

16289335
post	get
the problem was that the categories doesn t had any post reference so if you ask for post you get the post with categories but the categories themselves knows nothing about post

16289335
post	get
and it will work but the result json will be huge because when you request post you get every post + every comment and inside them every post that have that category.

16289335
post	get
for every post you get the categories_ids and for every category you reference you only get its attributes and the ids not the entire objects of the post that belongs to that category

16289335
post	get
well since your categoryserializer doesn t serialize any post you won t get anything

16289360
initializer	class-method
personcontroller.getperson fires but quickly hits an error when ravensession has no value it s supposed to be initializer in the abstract class-method mentioned above

16289368
rss	feed
i m playing with angularjs unit testing when developing feed rss application

16289368
rss	feed
the feed can fetch remote rss data parse it and save parsed items

16289368
rss	feed
but i need to make the feed can actualize it s state by fetching updated rss data and appending new items

16289408
prepare	execute
this seems easy to fix you just need to execute the prepare query before you can fetch anything from the result set

16289450
public	protected
also make sure you know the meaning of accessor keywords private protected friendly public

16289477
google-chrome	firefox
i m writing a web app that lives locally on a desktop computer and can be run in either firefox or google-chrome

to solve this issue i just hide the facebook after the app request has been sent and show it whenever i need it

16289562
versioning	upgrade
given your current 1.6.1 driver is just over six months old i would suggest testing an upgrade to the latest versioning

16289562
versioning	upgrade
there have been significant improvements and it can be easier to upgrade incrementally rather than trying to figure out the diffs between many major versioning

16289574
folder	directory
right click on the project add sharepoint images mapped folder this creates a system directory within the project where you can import your image resources

mobile safari and other ios web browsers google-chrome sometimes remove tabs from memory in order to make room for new tabs

16289727
hide	show
i am adding a click event to a checkbox which will show hide additional fields depending on its checked status

16289744
awt	swing
consider using swing which has much better performance over the old heavyweight awt

16289747
uniq	comm
sort | uniq is good but comm might be even better

16289753
range	minimum
i am trying to extract the row location of a cell with the minimum value in a range which consists of 2 different columns that are not adjacent

16289806

now for testing i simply have 2 directory in the folder named dir1 and dir2

16289887
metaclass	abc
inside the definition of metaclass self refers to the current instance in this example the string abc

16290421
mergesort	insertion-sort
for example insertion-sort is o n 2 but has a small constant factor while mergesort is o n lg n with a larger constant factor so when mergesort has split its sub-arrays into small enough chunks it will then use an insertion-sort on them

16290433
try-catch	exception-handling
while i would highly recommend a language more suited to this sort of local scripting task perl ruby python and many more it is possible for you to wrap your file.copy call in a try-catch block catch the exception-handling for files in use and proceed without having the entire thing crash

i know the container width w and height h

16290799
width	height
another thought i m having by setting the point size of the text to 42pt the width of the containing span becomes 45px now 50 of that would be 22.5px maybe it would work if you made the point size of the text a bit bigger or just set the width and the height of the containing span to 46px then 50 would be 23px which might make the difference with the current movement

16290799
width	height	google-chrome	firefox
i was able to get it to be centered perfectly in google-chrome and in firefox by using a mono-space font courier manually setting the line-height height and width of the span to center the character and then forcing the character to look more like a circle by moving it over by 0.5px using -webkit-transform translate

i ve looked at using webkit gecko and either for licensing reasons or sheer bulk of dependencies have mostly ruled out using them

16290837
webkit	gecko
i did spend some time reading the webkit gecko source code and came to the conclusion that what i want is spread out over a lot of code and would take weeks to extract a usable description of the actual layout algorithm

16290838
for-loop	loops
so instead of having a nested for-loop for the openlist you d just have the while loops and then each time you d pop off the node with the best heuristic value the one you expect to get you closest to the goal based on your heuristic

int	boolean
you can t use an int as a boolean expression if it is not 0 or 1

16291251
margin	height
when you float any element to left then other elements go in the same line of layout if you haven t cleared the floats and that s why marginfix is set exactly after the float left even if you haven t set a margin value to marginfix and the remaining of the elements go toward the left edge from line when one height is achieved and likely to two if your one and two is not enough height as marginfix but here you have set marginfix a margin value so it remains in the same pillar

if you need to use such large amounts of memory use malloc or calloc for allocating memory from the heap

16296318

children	parent
you have a bidirectional relationship set up between parent and child but when you are adding a child to the children collection on parent you are not setting the parent property on each child

16297349
children	parent
one way is to define add and remove methods that add a child to the children collection and sets the parent property on each child and to remove the ability to add a child directly to the collection by making it an or or similar for example with an backing field

i have implemented a restful web service in java which inserts data into mysql db i have tested this using poster in mozila firefox and also in google-chrome

16298436
inherited	properties
if you are using this method with entities that inherited from a base class called for example baseentity which has that properties you can change the method declaration like this

16298436
inherited	properties
this limits you to pass to call this method only with entities that inherited from baseentity but will give you access to the public properties and methods defined in baseentity

16298438
int	double
but i have no idea how i can order the program to run commands depending on what time of day it is regardless of date. and using datetime.now to get the time then playing around with the string until it gives me a double or int for what time it is seems like a rather uncool way of doing it

16298515
post	get
i am trying to post message to topic of message broker but everytime i access my proxy server and try to send message from esb proxy i get this error

16298542
getter	setter
it depends on whether you want your setter getter to be just that or have some additional functionality as well

16298542
getter	setter
making the members private and providing getter and setter is no better than making them public in the first place okay it s a bitter better for debugging purposes but conceptually it s the same

16298551
int	double
there is a sizable difference between int and double however generally double are also very fast

16298551
int	double
the difference is that int are still faster than double because it takes very few clock cycles to do arithmetic operations on int

16298551
int	double
having said this the cpu will usually spend quite a bit of time on housekeeping like loops and function calls so if it is fast enough with int most of the time perhaps even 99 of the time it will be fast enough with double

16298551
int	double
32-bit platforms have a greater disparity between double and int

16298569

16298590
getter	setter
for example when the setter or getter function is more complicated than just the trivial

16298590
getter	setter
or when you want to subclass c and overload the getter setter or add functions

width	height
we can get the graph which is 6 inches width 26 inches height but the tick unit in the x-axis or y-axis is not 1 inch

16298601
int	double
if you are going to change the type int to double in your program you must also have to rewrite those lines of code that comparing two int

16298601
int	double
like a and b are two int and you campare if a b so after changing a b type to double you also have to change this line and have to use compare method of the double

16298627
hash	salt
you better go with any hash functions but combine it with salt with your personal keys

16298677
box-sizing	border-box
you should either remove paddings from the block or you could try using box-sizing border-box on your #searcharea

16298732

the ui automation framework handles anything that uses or maps to native windows controls this is the case of java s swt most of c++ s widget toolkits and delphi s vcl forms it also works with other toolkits that render their own controls but expose their interface for accessibility purposes i think java s swing is such a case

16301885
getter	setter
in leu of having all the getter and setter it was switched to more constructor based so you should find the ability to pass in the thread pool there

so while for the integral part you divide by base to move the more significant digits towards the decimal point for the fractions part you have to multiply by base to move the less significant digits towards the decimal

16304791
base	fractions
of course unless base is a power of 2 you may get rounding errors so only so many digits are correct and the fractions part will never become zero unless due to rounding for odd base so the loop condition cannot be

example 3.827 in base 3 the fractions part

16311847
outputstream	inputstream
it seems to me that probably outputstream inputstream is not meant for purpose like this

16311890
outputstream	inputstream
you could create a general module which implements the outputstream to inputstream conversion and place one instance of the module between each of your other modules

16311951

16313948

method hiding means subclassing has defined a class method with the same signature as a class method in the superclass

16313948
superclass	subclassing
in that case the method of superclass is hidden by the subclassing

16313948
superclass	subclassing
method overriding means subclassing had defined an instance method with the same signature and return type including covariant type as the instance method in superclass

normally when launchd a daemons setsid is called from the child process after calling fork to dissociate the daemons from its controlling terminal

16317668
daemons	systemd
also on some systemd it may not be necessary even if the daemons does open a terminal device file since that behavior is implementation-defined

make sure you dont have img src your_source alt this will make ie think that it has 0 height and width

16318398
min	max
the issue here is that you are attempting to apply an aggregate sum over the aggregates max min but in fact the two levels operate on different groups

16318419
min	max
you can just keep it the way it is if you minimize the window you ll see a horizontal scroll bar so if you think that using min-width will only show element with a width of 400 px than you are wrong it is min and not max
