division	multiplication
most microprocessors implement multiplication and division with shift-and-add algorithm or a similar algorithm

13440322
integer	unsigned
unsigned integer values interchangeably it is much less efficient algorithm and that s likely why it wasn t used

13440346
public	protected
notice the useful reflectionobject getproperties method - it allows you to get all properties set in a class and you can filter by public protected private etc.

13440381

the browser already knows the width of it as it stays constant throughout and probably has already rendered at least part of the image but not the total height

13440534
.htaccess	httpd.conf

13441077
scalaz	shapeless
with a little type-level magic via scalaz 7 s typelevel or more easily with shapeless you could have the compiler generate equal instances for any case class with equal instances for its members but it s not too hard to write them out yourself

fadein	fadeout
since the position of the p element is static and you call both fadeout and fadein there is an overlap as two p elements are inevitably shown together

they would just be properties accessor on the cached object

13441337
gtk	pygobject

13441358
ubuntu	debian
i ve never tried to install redmine using ubuntu debian repositories

13441366
integer	fractions
another consideration is that the graphics system uses anti-aliasing to draw fractions width paths so when the line width is not an integer value they will look slightly soft

13441423
int	double
except for the fact that though i ve declared a pointer to an array of type double it always stores int and i don t know why

13441443
int	boolean	addition	multiplication
you can use during the multiplication boolean addition - not sure how it plays with the advanced matrix multiplication algorithms then you only get the existence of such a path but you avoid int overflow at the same time

13441901
wordpress	joomla
i must connect to it and keep data inside database as for example using a cms like wordpress joomla or drupal

13441919
getter	setter
i say this in part through familiarity with that api and in part because the expression compiler in the c# compiler still uses reflection when it refers to a propertyinfo but uses more direct methods ldtoken etc when referring to types and methods for example a getter setter

13441919
getter	setter
use methodbase to get the getter or setter methods can be fetched by token and infer the property by name not 100 robust but should usually work

perforce	svn
if you want to share your project with someone probably through source control like perforce git or svn you should use relative paths instead of absolute paths

13442262
versioning	upgrade
it makes sure that everybody is using the library versioning that corresponds with the code for example if you upgrade to a newer versioning of the library and the interface changed if you only change the code on source control you will have to warn your other team members to manually upgrade to the new library as if it was on your source control a sync would make them up to date with both the project s code and the external libraries

13442619
innodb	myisam
this also affects how it is stored which leads to myisam being slower than innodb on insert due to myisam requiring a full index re-write on every insertion

13442619
innodb	myisam
consider innodb myisam or archive if your data is not indexed

13442619
innodb	myisam
this will create significantly higher first-creation times due to the fact that unlike memory both myisam innodb and archive have to write to disk and regenerate indices but it ll at least mean that your tables will not miraculously disappear the moment you shut the server down

width	height
to fit a 4 3 image into a 3 2 space you can either match the height or match the width

13442675

comparator	comparable
either use instances of a class that implements comparable to represent rows or use a comparator

13442781
comparator	comparable
that said using a standard sort with either comparable rows or a comparator is much better than mixing up the sort logic and the comparison logic

13442793
mouse	trackpad
unfortunately the trackpad s scrolling deltas are orders of magnitude higher than a mouse s so the scroll speed is psychotically high

pull	push
you ll also need a command to temporarily pop all the local commits do some other git command pull push fetch merge whatever and then reapply the local commits

13443232
pull	push
now assuming you call the script git-local use git local new to create a new local-only commit from the index or git local new -a to create on from modified files in the workdir git local commit the name is imperfect sadly to create a new real commit git local push to push git local pull to pull etc

i should say this result of this script it comes to the version of bash or sh or freebsd sh vs linux sh

13445228

13445516
int	boolean
nsstrings nsarrays int boolean

one of the principles of md5 and this kind of hash is that you don t know what inputs give you a given output - they re not reversible

13445529
hash	md5
the only viable option is to brute-force it or you can try using one of the load of sites available that offer you md5 reverse lookup - surely they have databases with hash but they shouldn t be able to store all of them the space needed is really giant

13446273
spaces	delimiter
-d use a single spaces as the delimiter cut uses tab by default

13446286

13446673

13446687
hide	show
if is hide or else show

getter	setter
is there any advantage instead setting up the typical setter getter for that fields

i see the same issue in firefox 16.02 and the latest safari and google-chrome

13464558
for-loop	loops
switch the for-loop to a while to avoid pre-decrementing i just to have it incremented again and avoid stopping loops

13464658
width	height
as mentioned in the comments above the values of height and width are unchanged since they are based on the dom element without styling

13464658
google-chrome	firefox
however i noticed that the offset method returns the correct value from a transformed element google-chrome 23 and firefox 16 osx

13464658
width	height
to give you a solution - for 2d-transforms such as skew and rotate i did the basic math for the transformation and the following function returns the width and height value based on an elements transformation matrix

13464658
google-chrome	firefox
this worked for all the 2d-transformations i tried rotation skew and combinations of the two again on google-chrome 23 and firefox 16 osx

13464709
getter	setter
this would give you the opportunity to supply control methods that could be used change the enabled state of the whole component as well as provide getter and setter that could be used to retrieve the values of the sliders as you need

13464745
integer	unsigned
i have two numbers a and b unsigned long long s on the order of magnitude 10 10 or so at most but even when doing i get integer overflow

13464773
hide	show
details you could just use jquery to show the label when the button is pressed and hide it when page loads

13464836
google-chrome	firefox
just open up web inspector in google-chrome or firebug in firefox and select the svg copy it paste it into a text editor and save with the svg extension map.svg

13464853
min	max
i have already tried removing the min max heights for just a single set height however this doesn t sort the problem

13464875
hide	show
i think the problem is that when you move the mouse over the plus icon that triggers your project-thumbnail mouse leave handler which hide the plus icon which in turn triggers the project-thumbnail mouse enter handler again which show the plus icon - but your mouse is already over the plus so that triggers the mouse leave handler again etc. etc. etc

13464921
post	get
i am able to make a get or post request from hackst.com and it works fine

13464946
google-chrome	firefox
in my case using google-chrome version 23.0.1271.64 and firefox 16.0.2 the img tag isn t parsed correctly

13464975
gson	jackson
i wrote a parser for a file format called asn.1 that uses guiceâ s typeliteral.getfieldtype field to convert generic fields into specific java types so i can construct the correct type similar to jackson or gson databinding

13464990
post	put
i tried to put nsstring containing simply my xml request into body of post request but it doesn t work as planned

13465017
post	get
the type of data obtained in the post response is a typical web resources the same you would get browsing outside the servlet cobrowsing - html asp php etc.

13465017
post	get
i separated the action of post which updates the session cobrowsing by get instead asynchronously retrieves the resource session and should show iframe

13465017
put	get
the strange thing is that in some cases it works fine but in other cases the entire contents of a get containing the remote resource is printed raw on the screen it is not put into #document nested in iframe but between

getter	setter
my getter and setter look like this for each property

13465149
versioning	upgrade
since it s not documented the details could change from one versioning to the next so you ll have to either re-run your tests or re-read the code each time you upgrade if you need to be 100 sure

13465166
move	drag
i did my research on all the options at the time like a month ago and this is most like facebooks because you can drag anywhere on the screen to move it

13465187
std	ostream
also i noticed that you re using ostream without std implying that you re using using namespace std

13465211
post	get
more details on how to do this and get the cookie value can be found on a similar post here

13465220
post	get
many people may come across this post since you may get a similar gemloaderror when migrating from the gem to the toolbelt

13465256
int	chars
if i type in any chars instead of an int scanf would store it in the variable in some manner

13465275
width	height
the width and height of the total graph 250x300 respectively

13465280
atoi	strcmp	fgets	atoi	fgets	strcmp
if you specifically want to check for e the best bet is to fgets a whole line of input check for your special cases using strcmp then use atoi to get an integer

13465284
children	parent
in parent now gets printed out several times even before all the children are dead

13465329
qlineedit	qlabel
each element consists of a qlabel and a qlineedit

qlineedit	qlabel
when i click on qlabel region i can get mouse events but when i click on the qlineedit region i can t

13465351
punctuation	words
the only problem i m having is that i am unable to do this when there is punctuation beside the words i am to replace

13465363
children	parent
since those grandchildren are not children of the original parent and the first generation children are never waiting for them the order of output is unspecified

13465400
appfog	heroku
most of current cloud paas platforms such as appfog and heroku provides flask hosting

13465447
post	get
i tried pretty much everything in the linked post but i cannot get the datatables to fill their container

13465510
width	height
you could use displaymetrics to get the screen size in pixels and the dpi of the screen and then divide the width and height by the dpi to get the number of inches wide and high and use that to convert the pixel distance to real world units.

13465523
serializable	deserialization
3 is there any framework to handle the mapping serializable and deserialization

13465524
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
this works in google-chrome firefox and safari but ie8 ignores the selected selected attribute

13465525
rss	feed
if google still supported rss feed i would probably use that but the current api seems to need to rely on url requests

13465538
int	boolean
write a function that accepts an int as an argument and returns a boolean

13465538
int	boolean
the returned boolean is true if the int is an exponential power of two false otherwise

floating-point	fractions	floating-point	integer	integer	fractions
for this purpose and supposing a binary floating-point format â œsimpleâ values are those representable with just a few bits in the fractions portion of the floating-point format those that are sums of a few integer powers of two that are close to each other such as .625 which is 2 -1 +2 -3 .

13465548
punctuation	words
capture the character after the words then substitute the words with the new words and append the captured punctuation using a backreference

13465558
post	get
i know the common answer for this question but for some reason i get the error when using the right syntax on code blocks i ll post a sample to show i m not bluffing

13465574
int	double
my guess is that in your code you are using int instead of double in calculations

13465583
for-loop	loops
i am just stumped of where to put the for-loop or what part of the ajax call goes inside loops

13465584
google-chrome	safari
jsfiddle apparently does not make the ajax requests but you can quickly test that it works by entering these four lines into google-chrome console or safari developer console

13465618
versioning	upgrade
we have done that but we removed it again cause producing such a .war has some disadvantages and it is easier to upgrade to latest red5 versioning if you run the standalone versioning

13465639
width	height
from the docs for qimage qimage int width int height format format

13465644
width	height
it s better to change the width and height attributes of the canvas tag directly and not in css

13465661
min	max
there are several max min functions

13465769
post	get
i ve read the other post on this but i m still unable to get may page jumping to the top when a tab is clicked

13465774
urdu	arabic
although i have tested with arabic script languages only arabic urdu persian etc but i guess this problem will come up when dealing with any non-latin-script language

13465778
getter	setter
please note my goal is to have default values of soem of the class variable and if i want to override it then i can do it by calling getter setter method

13465801
sorting	grouping
but i am thinking this can be done directly by sorting the data according to population and then divide this sorted data in to grouping

13465802
min	max
there is a max time background processes are allowed to run 10 min which would make your approach difficult

13465805
hide	show
i m trying to show or hide divs based on user settings in a windows 8 app

13465813
cpu	irq
what matters most is the time it takes for the cpu to come out of its waiting state whenever whatever it is waiting for an irq for hlt or either an irq or a memory write for mwait occurs

13465840
jython	pypy
this is the kind of thing you might expect the compiler to do for you in say c then again try dealing with without math libraries in câ but in python at least cpythonâ it s probably worth trying pypy and maybe jython and ironpython you have to do it manually

13465848
hide	show
add them one by one from the result and you can show hide them all

13465858
hide	show
i ve come back here to share with you a very simple way to create a dynamic hide show list based on the user input

google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested your webpage with both google-chrome canary and firefox

13465910
tstringgrid	tdbgrid
i was using a tstringgrid and am converting to a tdbgrid - which is quite new to me

13465942
min	max
then depending on your use case you could even step up a level by using a custom intedittext or custom inputfilter so that you can specify a min and max and re-use the code across apps

13465986
google-chrome	firefox
i found the canvasoverlay example don t show in google-chrome but in firefox and ie is fine

gif	png
the supported image formats are xpm jpeg png and gif

13466164
for-loop	arrays
if you replace the x and y coordinates with variables or iterate through an arrays in a for-loop it becomes very easy to draw hundreds or thousands of shapes in either 2d or 3d with minimal effort and minimal rewriting of the code

13466170
inline	inlining
this is appropriate for a header-only library although the compiler is likely to behave exactly the same for a function declared inline static as for one declared static only in both cases inlining where it feels it would be beneficial so in practice there is probably little to be gained over static only

13466252

i would like to pack int and perhaps floats and double as well into byte arrays

13466357

my current setup takes way too much effort to get into the native video player currently i have a webview with an embedded html5 video such as a youtube or vimeo html5 not flash embed

13466458
google-chrome	safari
yup google-chrome and safari does this to img tags without hrefs.

13466465
.when	each
part of the problem is that in the done handler for .when the arguments that are passed to the callback are the array of arguments for each request not simply the data that you want to use

13466473
versioning	upgrade
i recently tried to upgrade my log4net to the new 2.0.0 versioning

13466482
ant	emma
ant emma install debug test

13466492
pull	push
to achieve this you can git pull in order to merge both branches and then push the result or you can do a git fetch and then a git rebase origin master or whatever names you put to your remote and head branch so your commits are applied on top of the remote branch

13466499
button	checkbox
i m trying to get it so that the checkbox is left aligned and the button is right aligned on the same line

13466511
int	double
this makes no sense to me because i thought the compiler sees addvertex vertex bool and addvertex unsigned int unsigned int double bool as two completely different symbols

13466525
put	get
also i have to setup tomcat server on remotely.here i have upload my war file and get the wsdl file.now i have to put these wsdl url means am getting blank screen on both my emulator and android device

13466534
recvfrom	datagram
should that buffer fill if your application stops calling recvfrom the kernel will start dropping datagram

13466561
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
he also stated that even if i wrap the sqlconnection and sqldatareader in a using statement the connection doesn t get released right away because the using statement is just doing a try catch finally and calling the connection.close and dispose anyway which is bad because we have to wait for the garbage collector to run and who knows how long that will take

i have scoured the web for any information on this but can t find any except for stuff on specific formulas sin cos inv e.t.c

13466718
terminate	timeout
this is a side effect of the idletimeoutmillis behavior -- the pool has a settimeout call registered that is in the event loop queue so node won t terminate until all resources have timeout and the pool stops trying to manage them

13466718
terminate	timeout
if you know would like to terminate all the resources in your pool before their timeout have been reached you can use destroyallnow in conjunction with drain

13466729
division	multiplication
as far as division goes there are some well-known methods for converting division by a constant to multiplication by the inverse and these methods are quite productive

13466801
versioning	upgrade
an alternative would be to upgrade to orchard versioning 1.6 which uses mvc4 but this was not an option yet in my case as it requires .net framework 4.5

post	get
what you want to do is get a listing of every single blog post using the post method

13466902
post	get
you want it to be as general as possible to get a complete listing of all your post

13466902
post	get
after you get a listing of post you ll want to iterate over it and modify the tags parameter provided in the response for each post

13466902
explode	implode
you ll also need to look at explode implode str_replace for the dashes and foreach for iterating over the result

13466909
post	put
due to lack of consistent client implementations for put or delete methods standard practice is to send a post request and either a use a query string parameter or b send an x-method-override header

13466960
httpconnection	downloading
i use httpconnection to downloading content auto downloading every 15 mins

13466982

getter	setter
now there will be a complicated way to get all the attributes of an element in the code while programming because you don t have getter or setter for the attributes

13467133
width	height
override onmeasure function and there calculate screen width and screen height and then calculate the scale

13467137

multiplying	multiplication
then i also premultiply in the sense that it s done by the time we reach the engine not in the sense of post or pre in terms of matrix multiplication order the mesh matrix m so that i don t need to multiplying it again once per draw call in the engine

13467405
google-chrome	firefox
i would also start using google-chrome or firefox w firebug both have their advantages and disadvantages but both will give you a network monitor and debugging facilities

pop-up	dialog
the dialog box behaves like a pop-up and without closing it it will disable on clicking on the background layout

13467497
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
first add an optional autoresetevent or manualresetevent to your view model constructor and make sure that you set this autoresetevent instance when your background worker finishes the runworkercompleted handler

13467497
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
this is precisely what the autoresetevent and manualresetevent classes were designed for

13467547
setinterval	settimeout
so simply change setinterval to settimeout which does not repeat and only calls the function provided once

13467547
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout can emulate setinterval by calling a function that sets a new timeout recursively

13467573
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval begins a repeating function - as it is right now settime does it s loop and logic then calls settimeout every second each settimeout call then starts another repeated call to itself every second

13467573
setinterval	settimeout
if you use settimeout instead it will be called once only but my suggestion would be that instead you simply run setinterval outside your function declaration like

13467584
hide	show
pieces should be a part of hide and show

13467742
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition	division	multiplication	addition	multiplication
the input file should specify a single algebraic expression in postfix order supporting positive and negative floating point values and the following operations addition + subtraction - multiplication division

13467839
getter	setter
while with getter and setter it is usually

width	height
note width and height values you can change as you want

13468271
outputstream	inputstream
always use the following pattern when you open an outputstream or inputstream for that matter

13468273
post	get
then you have to check the query api documentation if which operation uses get and post in case of an insert statement use post

13468310

for the circles you need to set border-radius to a value big enough usually more than half of the biggest of width and height

13468331
hide	show
i am writing a program that show hide the window of some target application

13468352
client-side	server-side
the most common case to mix server-side and client-side is like this

13468352
client-side	server-side
assuming that the vast majority of your users have javascript enabled and you do not bother providing a great ux to those who don t too you could simplify things by providing detailed error messages involving highlighting of the erroneous fields in your client-side validation logic while just displaying a generic error message if something fails the server-side validation

13468352
client-side	server-side	submit	submission
if the user does not submit anything huge such as file uploads and you have some clean way to re-fill all form fields in case of an invalid submission the easiest solution would be doing only server-side validation as this would avoid creating validation logic twice assuming you do not have some way to specify it in an abstract way that can be accessed by both server-side and client-side code

13468352
submit	submission
another possibility - especially a good idea when password fields are involved for good ux you want to preserve what the user entered even after a bad submission but from a security point of view you should not send the user s password back to avoid it from being cached somewhere - would be using ajax to submit the whole form and send back a json payload containing the url where the user should be redirected in case of success or a list of errors in case of failure

13468365
folder	dir
i m not familiar with how gh pages work but i suspect you could make the dist folder your git repository and not the parent dir that would allow you to push directly

13468396
datamapper	activerecord
for importing the data use an existing orm activerecord sequel datamapper to handle database interaction logic in your controller

13468405
fadein	fadeout

post	get
when i write print video in views.py i get an error in the console saying post edit_favorites http 1.1 500 10113

13473681
post	get
so you would use action names such as get post patch and delete and based on the http verb used by the client the routing engine will automatically dispatch to the corresponding action

13473694
strdup	malloc
you might be able to get around this using c99 s automatic arrays but it s maybe easier and cleaner to just use a dynamically allocated array using malloc or strdup if you have it

13473717
redhat	fedora
to find the packages rpmfind is your friend find the adequate package for your operating system fedora redhat or whatever download and check the dependencies

13473741

google-chrome	firefox
this page is working fine in firefox and google-chrome

13473774
integer	fractions
i had my glortho glviewport etc dimensions all set correctly then i realized the problem was i was scaling the view before translating the camera which meant that even though i was snapping to integer pixels pre-zoom after the zoom it would align to a fractions of a pixel and introduce the texel problem

13473788
mktime	strtotime
you can create a timestamp with mktime and then use strtotime for example to loop

i can not get view width and height since it s a remoteview

13474122
daemons	systemd
the operating systemd will handle interrupts run various daemons in the background and do various maintenance tasks and potentially move your running process to a different cpu etc

13474122
median	minimum
a typical way to measure things realistically is to run it enough times and take an average or minimum or maximum or median depending on what you want to prove

13474183
width	height
inside the class savings_green try and set the width and the height width 540px

13474204
factors	mean
they may not mean anything related to real wall-clock time but only be an indication of the number of cpu cycles which may still be useful for benchmarking so long as relative times are always used and the user is aware that execution time may vary depending on external factors

13474208
put	get
put these together and you d get something like this to try

13474210
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
my example below works in safari google-chrome and firefox but not ie10

13474238
width	height
ok the problem was that since the width of the tableview was flexible after the rotation the width of the cells which is actual the height were increased too

13474287
google-chrome	firefox
it works with firefox google-chrome

13474304
noexcept	throw
the second thing you broke is that you didn t make the move constructor declare that it does not throw by adding noexcept to it

13474326
google-chrome	firefox
everything just work fine for all browsers i ve tried google-chrome maxthon firefox but in ie9 i get a http 403 refused

13474326
apache	nginx
this problem seems to arise only when the cookie comes from the nginx server at pythonanywhere.com when i test from an apache server of my own cookie is sent back ok

13474329
websphere	ibm
i am using ibm websphere server hibernate spring mvc

13474349

13474373

they don t usually work in opera and firefox

13474386
qtcore	qtgui
actually this did not change anything however i found a solution to my problem if i add from pyside import qtcore qtgui then the executable with pyinstaller does work

13474445
textview	imageview
i recommend you to set the imageview weight to 3 and the textview to 1 so you don t need decimal numbers

13474490
coalesce	nvl	coalesce	isnull	isnull	nvl
you can also use functions ifnull coalesce nvl isnull to check null value

13474496
interpolation	splines
the problem is in combination of the surface modifier and the splines the modifier interpolation the curves you should check out the bezier handles on the splines i bet some off them are not aligned properly with the surface

13474562
width	height
device width greater than device height

13474562
width	height
device height greater than device width

13474602
width	height
but the easyway would be to output some div s with a bit of css specifiying it s background color and width height

13474607
put	get
if i put in an extra re-declaration the compiler will find the methods but i get segmentation faults

13474612
width	height
now i want to change its width and height in code and can t do it

13474622
addclass	removeclass
or use a css class declaration and use the removeclass and addclass functions to add remove that class as appropriate

13474648
for-loop	loops
finally i d suggest using a for-loop instead of a while loops - you want to perform a given number of iterations and the idiomatic way of writing that in java is

13474654
children	parent
parent has m_children vector which can have multiple children in it but a child can only have one parent object as it s m_parent attribute

13474667
pull	push
even if you can declare several remotes you cannot pull from all of them in one step see pull push from multiple remote locations

13474669
swt	swing
lars vogel has a tutorial on those and kai tã dter even did a brief article on different renderers in javafx 2.0 swing swt renderers for the eclipse 4.x application platform

13474681
for-loop	arrays
an iterator is often used to cycle through the elements of a standard-library container much like you would do with an arrays index in a for-loop

13474710

1 - i have to declare add properties to my prototype after calling inherited

13474732
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
surprisingly firefox allows it whereas anything else ie google-chrome opera don t

13474735
client-side	server-side
there are very few cases where it makes sense to use the user s timezone instead of utc on the server-side but indeed printing datetime values inside reports is one of them because the client-side will have no chance to convert the contents of the resulting report

13474752
width	height
use the code below which check the height and width of a device to calculate its orientation

13474764
ant	maven
use ant or maven to build your project

13474766
uitextfield	uitoolbar
my program has a uitoolbar which contains a uitextfield and a uibutton

the server is returning the response as xml that i then parse in my oncomplete function this works in google-chrome safari and firefox but not in internet explorer

13474848
post	get
i have googled and found mentions of using iframe.document.xmldocument to get the raw xml from the iframe but it didn t work for me and the post mentioning it was realy old

13474865
children	parent
i removed cascade from the parent object and explicitly called saveorupdate on parent and then on the children

13474883
portrait	landscape
portrait has an aspect ratio greater than 1 1 and landscape is less

13474883
portrait	landscape
to verify i made a jsfiddle that changes color when you switch from landscape to portrait

13474907
children	parent
you could merge the prototypes of two separate parent classes into a single prototype but you will then lose the inheritance to their parent and you will lose the ability to change the parent prototype and have all children see the change

13474915
istream	getline
there is no getline member of istream that takes a std string so this is invalid

13474962
folder	directory
what worked was creating a windows enviroment variable called tns_admin with the path to my admin folder on the oracle directory

13474993
post	get
use post redirect get

13475039
min	max
for every month in the interval between min and max in the extreme file is an row created

13475044
cgfloat	uiedgeinsets
sadly uiedgeinsets is not directly available as a type there but since cgrect also consists of a struct with four cgfloat it works flawlessly by choosing rect and filling in the values like this

13475049
width	height
this would result x y of bottom left of the rectangle also w is width and h is height of rectangle

13475050
uiview	subviews
i have a scrollview that has a uiview as subviews

13475050
uiview	subviews
this has as uiview subviews a uibutton

13475110
button	checkbox
your button which is created on stack in initialization list of checkbox s constructor is being copied to m_button field

13475143
sudo	passwd
my system is setup to allow for a certain user to run sudo commands without passwd prompting

13475143
sudo	passwd
now i come across a very unusual problem where certain commands are prompting for a sudo passwd

13475143
sudo	passwd
it is probably thinking that a sudo in the output means passwd is needed

13475174
width	height
i want all items in the listview to display at the same size height and width

13475252
stdout	stderr
however i ve found that daemon simple init closes stdout and stderr and it seems as a result of this the python scripts break just exit when they write to stdout and stderr

13475252
stdout	stderr
reopening stdout and stderr and redirecting them to a file before the exec does not help

13475252
stdout	stderr
if i then again open stdout and stderr and redirect them to real files after calling daemon simple init like before this time it works

13475252
stdout	stderr
it seems that closing stdout and stderr and reopening somehow breaks them post exec but opening them to dev null and reopening them works fine

13475301
maven	pom.xml
currently we use a custom maven plugin that as part of each release searches our scm for pom.xml s that depend on the project being released and updates it

13475312
portrait	landscape
when the device is in portrait mode the form s scroll works fine but when i change the orientation to landscape i find that the scroll makes bigger than the info in the page

13475355
istream	getline
getline is a method of std istream class see here

13475447
rss	feed
an rss 2.0 feed i need to process returns date entries which rome s dateparser cannot parse delivering null for all dates

13475459
uicollectionviewcell	uitableview	inherited	subclassing
uitableview doesn t inherited from that class so to make use a table in a collection view you d need to create a uicollectionviewcell subclassing that contains a uitableview

13475513
minimum	max
note that this will return the minimum pih.pid for each distinct piv.tsv if you want the max just use order by pih.pid desc instead

13475544
setlocale	strftime
use setlocale and strftime for non-english dates

13475564
hide	show
you can show status bar or hide it when you want

13475586
getter	setter
due to some internal manipulations i need to set get such variables in a thread safe way so i used some wrapping getter setter and used a scoped mutex

13475593
libxml2	xerces
yes i m aware this is a very complex task and that using an existing product such as libxml2 or xerces would be the saner choice

13475642
persistent	transient
you can also define a transient field for the sorted map and use your own get set methods to lazy initialize from the persistent one

13475676
maven	pom.xml
then add the cglib library to your calsspath or add it to your pom.xml if you are using maven this is necessary for spring make transactions

13475678
getter	setter
if you move your thread security synchronization code outside the getter setter and bloat your code with boilerplate code locking mutexes everywhere yes it s possible not to use getter and setter but it would be really counter-productive

13475697
int	chars
if the dll boundary is using primitive c types like chars and int

13475709
width	height
this includes file name extension original width and height and a new width and height to scale the image to fit my 344x270 preview cropbox area

13475709
width	height
to find this new width and height i use the following code written in vb.net

13475709
portrait	landscape
basically i m trying to determine if its portrait or landscape then find the aspect ratio to scale it down to fit my preview cropbox area

13475709
width	height
once this is determined i add them to my object serialize it and send it back to the upload page fancybox iframe set the image path of the preview cropbox area set it s height and width from the returned object store the original height and width and then initiate jcrop

13475715
folder	directory
i m running wamp on my win7 box and trying to configure an htaccess folder to restrict my guests from browsing the directory structure

13475734
migrate	upgrade
i used that several times to migrate upgrade tfs2008 projects into tfs2010 to use the new templates

13475741
ubuntu	linux
i ve never worked with a microsoft access database but i do regularly connect to db2 on ibm as 400 s and ms sql servers from linux ubuntu servers

13475756
getter	setter
however you probably should still stay with getter setter so your decisions on how you manage your data the choice between atomics and mutexes won t affect the class users even if that s only you

13475769
versioning	upgrade
edit we upgrade to the latest versioning of ninject just to check if the exception still occurs but we got the same exception after stress testing the application

13475791
convertview	spinner
if convertview is null which it will be the first time through your list your spinner will not be found

13475804
glut	glew
it s a linux application hence the glxswap not using glut or glew and using glm for maths

13475808
jobs	cron
since you mention you re on ubuntu the cron jobs probably execute under bin sh and you re manually running them under bin bash if you haven t changed anything

13475808
jobs	cron
to debug there are several ways to figure out what shell your cron jobs are using

13475815
portrait	landscape
all the view controllers of that tabbed application must show the content in portrait orientation but there s only one viewcontroller which is showing a video that i want to be in landscape mode

13475815
portrait	landscape
i m unable to have all the app only in portrait orientation and the viewcontroller mentioned capable to rotate in landscape mode

13475815
portrait	landscape
i believe that in summary iphone ipod deployment info supported interface orientations there i ve to check portrait landscape left and right and then via methods enable or disable the rotations

13475818
google-chrome	firefox
i see the same jittering in firefox and google-chrome mac

13475835
int	chars
int countletters chars password int upper int lower int symbol

13475837
iprincipal	iidentity
i have developed a simple iidentity and iprincipal for my mvc project and i would like to override the user and user.identity to return the value with the right type

13475847
hash	md5
when the user registers he gives a password say pass123 that is then hash by any of the available hashing algorithms sha1 sha256 etc on this case md5 to the value 32250170a0dca92d53ec9624f336ca24 and that value is stored on database

13475847
hash	salt
as you can see the exact same passwords given different values of salt generate completely different hash

13475847
hash	salt
notice that on table you will only store the hash and the salt

13475851
maven	pom.xml
due to that fact you should define a maven project just containing this bom pom.xml with all the dependency management for thirdparty software x y and z

13475940
packets	multicast
i need to multicast a packets through all the interfaces that have multicast capabilities in my machine

13475940
packets	multicast
by setting ip_multicast_if with setsockopt i can choose through which interface i d like to multicast my packets

13475940
packets	multicast
a possible solution would be to set ip_multicast_if multicast the packets through that interface reset ip_multicast_if send another packets and so on

13475955
versioning	upgrade
it started after upgrade from versioning 1.482

13476080
post	get
i think you need to re-post not re-load as in http post rather than http get

13476081
post	get
window.location.reload issues a get so yes the post data will be lost

13476081
post	get
use ajax to post the data back get the new page and replace your body element with it or

13476088
dbcontext	objectcontext
even the memory consumption is horribly with objectcontext the application working set raises about 200mb with dbcontext the working set raises about 10 times higher

13476106
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome the image came but in internet explorer image not showing

13476113
width	height
in the css if i put a width auto and height auto

13476124
width	height
why is it setting the height width of the dialog window arbitrarily

13476138
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
going by a recent tutorial on setting up amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk for ruby deployment using git i just set up a elastic beanstalk environment from my ci server

13476138
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk ruby container supports custom configuration through custom .config files placed under .ebextensions

13476154
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari

13476223
sse	avx
i am then trying to force the use of sse considering that avx instructions will reinforce this aspect in the near future

13476223
int	double
it is easy to interface it with c and c routines can be call directly from fortran types are the sames int double long etc

13476274
width	height
each of these buttons is able to expand its height depending on the connected jlabel the labels will be displayed once the user clicked on the related button - in short all the components should be stretched to the same fixed width but with a variable height depending on their content

13476288
int	boolean
i have test to create an int property wrapped by the boolean one as we can see in this code

13476288
int	boolean
in this last case i ignored the boolean and mapped the int

13476303
inject	interceptor
action filter attributes enable you to inject code interceptor into the request of a mvc controller that can execute before and after a controller or its action methods execute

13476304
division	addition
for small numbers the addition and division works fine you only add or divide the mantissas

13476307
width	height
another thing to notice is that the width and height of the rotated image are reversed from the orignal image

13476314
packets	multicast
the simplest solution is to have a socket per interface but i would question your network setup where you need to multicast a packets through all the interfaces - that usually is a sign of bad design

13476325
google-chrome	firefox
after some research i ve found that the xhr.abort behaviour differs in google-chrome and firefox

13476325
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome the xhr.status remains unchanged 200 whereas the status in firefox is set to 0 after calling xhr.abort

13476338
uilabel	uitextview
instead use uilabel or uitextview depends on your needs with text in it and set font property on them

13476351
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly in firefox mostly works in google-chrome and does not work at all in internet explorer

13476369
xpages	lotus
sidebar widget in lotus notes client opens xpages from url configured by widget wizard

13476375
stdout	stderr
if the name was fixed i could just compare it with the known names for stdout and stderr

13476381
ready	each
any number of instances should be able to connect with any number of instances like if double click 5 times the program there would now be 5 instances ready to communicate with each other

13476485
many-to-many	many-to-one
with such structure the many-to-many between users and articles becomes two many-to-one relationships

13476557
post	get
i did many get requests for getting json files and they work nicely but when i try to do the same but with a post request i have no callback and in the server i get error 400 i don t even send anything to the server

13476561
google-chrome	safari

13476613
submit	submission
user submit an email id and on successful submission a lightbox will load

13476637
pull	push
the first approach passes the same ssh credentials you use locally to push pull and so on from the remote github repo -- you uploaded your public key for your personal account and that s what github uses

13476645
width	height
you may want to set them to any value that is double the height and width of your images to ensure they will always be rounded when hovered

13476701
prepare	execute
you need to make a call to sqlite3_open_v2 before you attempt to prepare the statement or execute the query

13476713

x_rotated x cos alpha - y sin alpha

13476713
cos	sin
y_rotated x sin alpha + y cos alpha

13476740

if i understand the question correctly you can set the height and the width of these non-image based on the screen size and then bind them

13476780
post	get
i ve been stalking here for longer than i can remember this is my first post so i hope i get this right

13476780

13478025
capistrano	bundler	capistrano	rvm	rvm	bundler
i had just checked the code of bundler capistrano and i know code of rvm capistrano the only way that could make that happen is when capistrano s namespace is overwritten broken and does not give a proper scope to task definitions make sure you do not redefine namespace or there is no other gem library code that would do that

13478029
portrait	landscape
the real + here is that if you only display an alert when the user tries to open in portrait it s still possible that the user begins in landscape but rotates to portrait while he is taking the photo

13478032
width	height
so it needs to downsize the image so that both the width and height are larger than the width and height of the target maintaining aspect ratio

13478577
rtp	sdp
before passing your sdp in just replace all instances of rtp savp with rtp savpf

13478577
rtp	rtcp
the f indicates an rtp profile where the timing of rtcp feedback is more relaxed

13478577
rtp	rtcp
since most rtp endpoints don t check rtcp feedback timing strictly an rtp savp endpoint will usually interoperate with an rtp savpf endpoint

13478660
hide	show
the hide show on options behaves inconsistently across browsers

13478660
hide	show
an easy workaround is to use detach append instead of hide show

13478708
post	get
when you post the values you are going to get an array so would not exist as a string in the first instance it would be

13478984
jasmine	mocha
it looks like you re using mocha instead of jasmine

13479007
pull	push
if we are in detached head make changes then later switch to master so our unstaged files stay in the working directory stage and commit those changes then try to push git says that we must pull because we are behind

13479029
folder	directory
so i did a little research on that and found out that i had to copy the file into the ruby bin folder under the railsinstaller directory

13479076
rspec	capybara
capybara rspec is capybara1 old and this is not simple

13479099
getter	setter
neither of these are the delombok directory so it s fair enough that it can t find all the getter and setter when it tries to compile

13479108
google-chrome	firefox

13479273
post	get

switching	screens
what i am struggling on is switching to a specific tab in the tabbar view which match the icon in the main screens image 1 and 2 will explain more hopefully

13479335

13479353
onmouseover	onclick
i want to display the infowindow with an onmouseover event instead of onclick event

13479369
folder	directory
i used guvnor to generate a new repository.xml and placed this into bin folder of the jboss directory

13479370
getter	setter
it is actually probably best practice to actually explicitly define your getter and setter

13479370
getter	setter
again it is really best practice imo to make all class properties inaccessible from outside the class and explicitly make setter getter as need to provide access

13479375
min	max
min and max has to be given

13479459
width	height
i would suggest playing around with your width properties and your height properties to force the menu to look right

13479459
google-chrome	firefox
another suggestion is to use firebug for firefox or for google-chrome to help debug css issues

13479479
intersect	contains
model.personattributes does not contains a definition for union or intersect and the best overload blah blah...

13479557
width	height
so a real quick fix would be to apply an overflow of hidden to your html body you ll also need to define the height and width like this

13479679
ubuntu	linux
i have my own program with plugins dynamic shared libraries on a linux ubuntu system

13479706
width	height
your class model or view model where width and height properties are defined needs to implement inotifypropertychanged interface

13479706
width	height
you also need two way binding since you wanted to set width height from code as well as capture it from the user

13479712
apache	nginx
note the domain that runs on nginx posts data successfully while the other on apache doesn t if at all it has got something to do with servers

13479738

what you have there should correctly update your width and height member variables when you resize whatever element the xaml is pointing to

if you are going to override equals and compareto carefully rtfm

it seems that calling show immediately after hide does not give the window manager enough time to calculate the correct window position

13481375
put	get
you can put your custom code within onauthorization to check whether or not the user has permission and since you can get the httpcontext from filtercontext there s really no need for authorizecore

13481437
disk	ram
i wouldn t recommend using a ram disk unless you back it up very often or the data on it are unimportant

13481437
disk	ram
if your files are cached in ram then working with them is quite similar as if they were on a ram disk

13481453
int	chars
i am trying to create a string in mips then change each chars from the string into an int

13481496
folder	directory
i think you could perhaps make a model of the var project outside the foreach loop and then map the properties based on your folder directory to property variables and try calling the model from within the foreach so that you can access the model s properties which will include project

13481535
mvp	presenter

photoshop	fireworks
i made a test of about 10 images exports gif exact jpeg png24 png8 gif adaptive etc and did the same in both fireworks and photoshop cs6

13481719
google-chrome	safari	photoshop	fireworks

i managed it that i can pull and push from and to it

13481862

13482366
realloc	malloc
note the example was updated so that realloc is called on memory that was obtained with malloc

realloc	malloc
it is outright undefined behaviour to call realloc on a pointer that was not obtained with malloc etc

13482399

appfog	heroku
appfog and heroku give your app a single arbitrary port to listen on which is port mapped from port 80

13482476
express	node.js
port 80 is more than adequate for this and node.js and express make a superb combo for creating apis on paas

13482476
appfog	heroku
edit as mentioned by indexzero appfog and heroku support http s only and close long held connections

13482537
spaces	delimiter

13482785
ioexception	bufferedwriter
it appears that you can t read before you write that s why i initialised the bufferedwriter before i initialised the scanner because if i didn t it would tell me that i can t write after reading and throw an ioexception basically if you look at the page source for the site you ll see an id called sessionid and it changes each time you open a new connection

13482794
versioning	upgrade

width	height
on my iphone 5 it reports 320 width and 548 height which is its resolution in a non-retina form

13483019
width	height
it looks like the problem is that your x and y coordinates in your drawstring method are the same as the height and width of your applet so the text is not allowed to appear when rendered in a browser

13483019
width	height
in your html change the height and width to for example 400 each and you should see the text

13483516

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
in firefox and google-chrome that setting set the origin of the y-axis to the center of the screen the center of #wrapper since #wrapper is the width of the screen. however safari does not take that property into its calculations of 3d transforms possibly 2d transforms as well though i won t definitively say. all i had to do was remove that property- and presto

free	malloc
my short answer is put the malloc inside the function and the free outside

13485829
strdup	malloc
well it turns out that in cases 1 and 3 above you ll be making a call to either malloc or strdup inside the function

13485829
free	malloc
in the case of number 2 there will be no calls to malloc or free because you re just modifying the buffer and returning a pointer to some part of it

13485829
free	malloc
in all cases i ve assumed that you already know where to call malloc and free for the input buffer itself

13485841
int	chars	int	double
well what i want is to implement functions that works like the macros signal and slot but with my own implementation so the goal is that the function or my own macro if i can create it receive a parameter like an string mycustomsignal and he return a const chars 2mycustomsignal double int so i do that using a qmap for store this asociation qmap signal name signal signature i fill it in another function

13485841
qobject	qmap
in this case my qmap is so i search the signature mycustomsignal something with the key mycustomsignal and prepend the code that qobject connect recognize for signals and i get 2mycustomsignal something so i convert it in const char because qobject connect have this parameters in this format and i want to use also in conjuntion with signal and slot macros like this

13485868
google-chrome	firefox
another possible reason would be that the http viewer curl wget may just be reading socket faster than how google-chrome or firefox reads etc

13486616
getter	setter
before properties a developer would have to hand write the setter and getter for each of their instance variables

13486616
getter	setter
a fortunate side-effect of properties was that they took care of a lot of the memory management code needed to write setter getter for object-based instance variables

13486635
google-chrome	firefox
it doesn t get stuck in firefox or google-chrome

13486650

13486981
charindex	substr
see substr charindex patindex

13487036
width	height
width - optional but might come in handy because storing height width is quicker than calculating it upon retrieval

13487036
width	height
height - same deal as width

13487036
width	height
of course this seems a bit useless because we already know the filename to begin with because we are storing it in imgname and using it to search the database for the entry but you could search based on id category width or height all the same way

mouse	keyboard
i want to check the mouse event or keyboard event in all tabs for a url which is open in more then 1 tabs in a browser

basically you have to loop through the results to reorder them into a flattened version of the tree before you can run through it in reverse appending children to parent

13487195
put	get
this function is supposed to get a parameter as the pointer of a file and put all file into the struct anagram then write it to another file

13487218

according to google s statistics the majority of ldpi displays are small screens and the majority of mdpi hdpi xhdpi and xxhdpi displays are normal sized screens

13487265

public	protected
but had the case been there for protected or public then this is valid

13487513
free	malloc
see the definitions of free and malloc

13487629
free	malloc
the reason is that malloc which is a library call creates metadata that is used to determine which parts of memory are free and which ones are taken

13487629
free	malloc
when you call free you are actually only modifying this metadata such that subsequent calls to malloc know that this memory can be re-used note that most implementations will not zero the existing data

13487637
domxpath	domdocument
so since you have created domdocument you can use domxpath

13487650
width	height
but this code may not work everytime as atual width and height are not available until ui is rendered

width	height
or you may create the dependency property in vm and bind it with width and height with mode oneway

13494484
fflush	gets
also calling fclose will fflush the output buffer so no data gets lost

int	boolean
if first need to parse it as an int like you were doing then do the comparison so that the if can test a boolean condition

13495332
qbytearray	qlist
if you really want to return char pointer then you have to keep the qbytearray around for example by adding it to a qlist member variable of the same object so it will get destructed when the instance gets destructed

13495399
profiling	debugging
in some cases i have found that running a build under the debugging profiling will leave behind detritus in the debugging folder under the project in question

13495399

the solution that works for me here is to delete the entire debug folder that the prior build s created under the project directory

13495417

my worries comes from the setup that i currently use on the laptop - i have there installed and configured ruby php postgresql mysql heroku-data etc

13495609
inherited	subclassing
now if you are asking about using a nib or a subclassing it s the same that choose between composition and inherited

13495609
uiview	subviews
if you need to have a special view subclass uiview but if you want to have a view with controls as subviews use composition and it s easier to use interface builder to compose your view

13495609
uiview	subviews
the only reason i see to have a subclass of uiview only for subviews is for a better encapsulation but because your controller is written especially for the view there is no need to have this encapsulation

13495615
stdout	stderr
as of 1.3 i think sinatra ships with a logger like you described but it writes by default to stdout and stderr if you want to hit it to a file add this to your config.ru

13495929

httpconnection	downloading
i am trying to downloading two apks from my application server consequently one after another with in different activities using httpconnection but second time i am getting an empty inputstream

13496338
put	get	post	get	post	put
the method not allowed http status code 405 message means the server is receiving a request from a client using an http method get post put etc. that is not allowed by the server iis

13496338
post	get
i think by default iis only supports get and post

13496373
svg	vml
in older versions of ie it will use vml so node will likely refer to a vml element not an svg element

13496439
width	height
to be more specific i want my initial screen which width is 360 and height is 70 in blue and my second screen is green which starts after 360 px

13496520
uicontrol	uibutton
usually i place uibutton on a uicontrol view

width	height
in your case you want to check that the parameter is of type imagefilteroptions and that both the width and the height are set to 256

13496557
dbcontext	objectcontext
however using entity framework 5 i am not using an objectcontext - rather i am using a dbcontext

it also works fine if i use get instead of post but stage2.php is a search results page and potentially has to pass a large number of variables to stage3.php

13496599

i am running quantile regression package quantreg and using texreg to create a latex output of my models

13496665
cvs	svn
i want to configure two svn repositories and checkout from them via intelij idea cvs svn plugin

13496677
width	height
if you don t know your sizes then a resize script that serves all your images to a new size would fix that and you would simply move the width height css properties to the div#product-image css declaration

13496712
bmp	png
update it seems to be a problem with png and jpeg format because the line works while saving in bmp format

13496722

i am writing an application with java ee using jsf 1.2 and the seam framework

13496723
geany	gedit	emacs	gedit	vim	emacs	vim	geany	vim	gedit

gif	png
i ve got a smartgwt application which create a link with a jpg gif png pdf files

13496880
ready	each
each time the consumer is ready to process a request the producer has to stop what it s doing copy a request to the buffer and let the consumer know it can proceed

13496917
ant	maven
the problem is that ant and maven have two completely different build philosophies

13496917
maven	pom.xml
in maven you describe your project via a pom.xml file and maven does all the build processing for you

13496917
ant	maven
this isn t an issue of whether or not whether ant or maven is the force of all that s good in the world and the other is only for luzers apple fanboys

13496917
maven	pom.xml
then you need to convert this over to a maven pom.xml file

13496917
maven	pom.xml
even worse red5 isn t setup like a maven project so you ll either have to move all the files around or go into archaic pom.xml configuration hell trying to override how maven assumes the build is suppose to take place

13496917
ant	maven
trust me i did this before for another job where the system architect decided that maven was better than ant and all of our projects must be converted from ant to maven

13496917
maven	pom.xml
if you just need that red5.jar file in your other maven project you can simply use the task to generate a pom.xml file for you

13496917
maven	pom.xml
if you really really want to get fancy you can embed the generated pom.xml file into the jar itself so it is self referential just like maven jars are

13496917
ant	maven	ant	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml
or if your jar doesn t have to have the pom.xml embedded in it a separate ant file that just builds the pom.xml you need and maybe even deploys it into your maven repository for you

13496944
multiplying	add
the program takes a number divides it by 2 if not possible to divide multiplying by 3 and add 1 divide again and so on until reaching 1

13496961

pluggable engine support for pillow imagemagick pil wand and pgmagick

13497001
ember.js	backbone.js
i think you should definitely look into angular knockout backbone.js ember.js and choose the one you feel makes the most sense to you

13497001
put	get	post	get	post	put
backbone is more tied in to put post get which is awesome for updating inserting getting items than some of the other libraries like knockout that are more targeting a rich binding mvvm and you need to handle posting the json by yourself

13497116
public	protected
and they would be able to access the general public parts of the site but not the other protected user pages that contain other clients drawings

13497155
.htaccess	httpd.conf
for the last method it depends if you want to use the httpd.conf file or .htaccess

13497155
.htaccess	httpd.conf
the best way will be to use httpd.conf even if .htaccess seems easier

13497203
free	calloc
but i only want to use the array once so i want to be able to use it dynamically and be able to free it after using it in the program so im more looking for a fast way like calloc but instead of zeros -1 of course

13497205
hide	show
the link initially displays the text show + and then when the div is revealed this text changes to hide -

13497205
hide	show
this is all working fine but then i decided rather then an immediate show hide it would be nice to gradually reveal the text by adding a speed to the toggle

13497214
uiview	subviews
so by subclassing the uiview i was able to abstract the ugly details of all of the subviews that composed by calendar view

13497274
free	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	calloc	malloc	realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc
to do this dynamically you will have to allocate using malloc then you only free the memory otherwise freeing the memory which is not allocated by malloc calloc or realloc is undefined behavior

13497293
interbase	firebird
first of all according to the interbase 6.0 language reference available from the documentation section of the firebird site section alter table page 28 the correct syntax is

13497318
post	get
i have used jquery with ajax successfully before but only for form elements using get and post

13497323
ant	maven
that said you can fairly easily automate this using a combination of and the maven ant tasks

13497335
width	height
it looks like bootstrap less css forces an automatic height to avoid stretching the image when the width has to change to be responsive

13497335
width	height
i switched it around to make the width auto and fix the height

13497343
google-chrome	firefox
on flash players firefox google-chrome the controls are always shown

13497347
google-chrome	firefox
first to get ajaxform to work cross browser ie 7+ google-chrome firefox u got to make sure u re using the submit method of ajaxform something like this

13497357
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox support this by default thats why it works there no problem

13497365
put	get
when i put the following line in the sql command line i get an error

13497372
google-chrome	safari
safari nightly and google-chrome support it exclusively at the moment because of webkit

13497377
ssl	https
run the entire webpage over ssl https

13497384
google-chrome	firefox
i have been testing my mvc application in ie 8 latest firefox and google-chrome and everything was working fine

13497409
int	chars
when i simply changed the datatype of arr from chars to int it displayed the garbage values as expected

13497420
getdate	dateadd
datetime dateadd d -1 getdate at line 1

13497465
post	get
i don t have time to post a full code sample but js supports xpath and you can get the comments with this qpath query

13497473
getdate	dateadd
dateadd and getdate are t-sql functions used in sql server

13497547
.htaccess	httpd.conf
so i found the issue the apache error_log file explained i needed to add this into my .htaccess and the httpd.conf file - options +followsymlinks +symlinksifownermatch and it worked

13497556
portrait	landscape
it works in landscape and in portrait as long as you do not navigate anything but do not never anytime navigate a website and it breaks the zooming

13497577
int	chars
any chars type just convert the variable to int before

13497607
hash	md5
so making a md5 hash of all its content comparing it with the hash of what i m searching isn t a good idea

13497620
folder	directory
now i use iis and i have a virtual folder that is mapped to a different directory

13497637
min	max
for an axis right click on the axis select edit axis and you ll see a modal dialog panel that lets you set the min and max for the axis along with the step sizes for major and minor tabs

13497639
google-chrome	firefox
ideally it should work in most browsers specifically google-chrome ie 8 and firefox 4 as they are the most used browsers in malaysia source gs statcounter

13497661
width	margin
this is because width when provided a doesn t account for padding margin s

13497668
minimum	max	min	max
the function takes one string input filename which is the name of the csv file and returns one output a 1â 2 structure array s both of whose two entries contain four fields mean std d ev max and min which are the mean standard deviation maximum value and minimum value of the electronic and paper based midterm scores

13497668
min	max
and i know why i get the error but i don t know how to fix it because as stated above my variables need to be named mean min max

13497678
put	get
i get objects put in cache just fine and can take them out of the cache while the app is running no problem

13497759
int	boolean
but if i try to transfer a primitive like string int boolean etc.

13497771

openam	simplesamlphp
i have setup openam and simplesamlphp

13497773
openam	simplesamlphp
i can auth via the openam test fed and the auth page in simplesamlphp so i believe its all working correctly

13497865
agda	idris
there is an idris tutorial an agda tutorial and many other tutorial style papers and introductory material with never ending references to things yet to learn

13497865
agda	idris
but i can t start agda or idris with their books

13497865
agda	idris
agda requires a huge math background and idris well let s leave that for now

13497896
width	height
i generate a gray overlay image to hide the image but because i want to handle dynamic size of pictures i cannot set fixed width and height values for the mask

13497930
translation	localization
the enums are now being translation via resource files but a localization table also exists for each of the look-up tables

13497941
draggable	droppable
it seems like the draggable element including the margin is bigger than the droppable element and therefore the dropped status is set although the element does not seems to touch the upper droppable yet

13497992
nsurl	nsstring
now you have an nsstring path and a nsurl path to the file

13498023
width	height
first i ve tried specifying width and height for body and html in the print.css file

13498050
try-catch	exception-handling
it is probably because netbeans adds code to log exception-handling when you have the ide make try-catch blocks

13498054
uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
so i have a custom uiwindow a custom uiviewcontroller and a custom uiimageview

13498145
post	put

13498195
post	get
to get around this i found another post on this site that explained how to cancel the default postback but still execute client side javascript

13498200
equals	gethashcode
you can use the constructor that pstrjds links to below or here to define the equality operator or you ll need to implement the equality methods in remotedevice gethashcode equals

13498229
folder	directory
here s the source code of object.tostring method that you can find in the installation directory of your jdk under src folder -

13498238

getter	setter
while a class property technically consists of a getter and a setter method in c# those details are abstracted away requiring you to wrap a class property in a lambda function

13504789
ienumerator	idisposable
ienumerator implementes idisposable and the logic used in creating the iterator blocks is actually smart enough to execute all un-executed finally blocks when it is disposed

13504789
ienumerator	idisposable	ienumerable	ienumerator
so as long as the ienumerator objects created from this ienumerable are either iterated fully in which case the final movenext call will reach the end of the using block and dispose of the resource or disposed the idisposable client will be disposed

13504818
.when	each

you re making a common thinking error that a lot of beginners make in that you seem to think that a client-side language like javascript can interact with a server-side language such as php in this fashion

13506099
client-side	server-side
php cannot be executed on the client-side save for the client-side version php-gtk which we are not discussing here and javascript cannot be executed on the server-side save for server-side versions of javascript which we are not discussing here

width	height
if html5 takes the similar approach it would mean that attribute height and width are the actual height and width of the component and the style is just the way to display it

13506475
width	height
also in primefaces when you specify height and width as attribute- you can not use percentages

13506475
width	height
this could be the key- an additional measure of enforcing specific width and height rathen than percentages

margin	font-size
if p has font-size 0.875em then to set a margin to a value that its the font size of the parent calculating 1 0.875 you would use the inverse value margin-bottom 1.143em

i never worked on android yet but what i can say is that jzy3d uses jogl that has a nice design that bundle platform dependent binaries into jars

13520387

so i guess you need to look for machine level profiling hopefully they support the debugging format of your compiler so you see source code context

13520394

for-loop	arrays
another problem of your code is the for-loop the arrays start on 0 so if you do the for until the lenght s position you will be out of the arrays

13520458
for-loop	arrays
if you want to test the whole arrays you must go through a for-loop

13520482

13520681
setinterval	clearinterval
i am using setinterval and clearinterval for setting an interval for hiding the bar

13520681

13520740
hide	show
if it s is visible then hide if not visible then show

13520762
mouseup	mousedown
the flags are what commands you want to send into the mouse_input function in that example you can see that he is sending both mousedown and mouseup in the same line this is fine because the mouse_event function will split those flags up and execute them consecutively

13520825
super	implements
i made the accessors private defined them and implements both by calling super

13520829
innodb	myisam
fulltext indexes for myisam tables or innodb in mysql 5.6

13520901
inherited	properties
edit i m not sure why you want those properties inherited by b

13520901

google-chrome	firefox
first step should be to use dev tools in google-chrome ie or firebug in firefox to identify components that did not format correctly

13521031
put	get
as far as i can tell the only solution is to put all these relationships in the user model but something feels wrong about this and the user model could get bloated as roles increases and associations mount and it also seems unintuitive because a user only has many assistants if he is a manager

13521082
live	netstream
i m sending a live stream packaged as an flv file to a flash player via a netstream and when the browser window is hidden minimized a delay begins to accumulate such that the player is always some number of seconds behind what s happening live

13521082

this works well on firefox and ie but has no effect and does not neutralize the delay in google-chrome

13521097
rss	feed
am developing an rss feed app for iphone in that i have a tableview where all feed titles will show when user click on title a detail view will show with title description and image but am facing problem with performance since the application taking time to load image in uiimageview since the image is coming from image url below is my code

fflush	gets
output buffering gets fflush implicitly when reaching the end of your script

13521319

the images aren t square - they are rectangular and all different sizes so i can t set the width and height to 150px because the images will be all squashed and distorted

13521331
put	get
once i put the web application onto a live server and i access the page that has the above script the get for that script returns status aborted

13521365

13521367
int	double
i have a map mapping from int to vectors of double

13521427
apache	nginx
just stopped nginx started apache and the timezone was set correctly

13521454
getter	setter
in my understanding it should be done like this getter setter add remove operations omitted

13521463
pop-up	dialog
feed dialog is more intrusive in the sense that it has a facebook pop-up window

13521466
width	height
i m pretty sure this is with loading the font because my debug text prints that it couldn t find it and it also can t use the width and height of the face so it returns an error

13521498
put	get
the only way to get around that is to put the text to a variable outtext in stead of printing it

13521548
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to a new versioning

13521629
fgets	fgetc
i know that this question sounds stupid but in my function for reading line i use fgetc because i need to check some letters if to use fgets then it will stop on first nl which function to use

13521717
ubuntu	debian
bash as bin sh works as in posix mode and a posix shell like dash does not drop privilege neither bash with -p or bash symlinked as bin sh in debian ubuntu

13521727
width	height
where 150 is the width height of your container and 15 is the size of your cursor

13521737
versioning	upgrade
you can either get an upgrade or free versioning

13521782
folder	directory
what i basically want to accomplish is to move my .git directory which currently resides besides my project folder down into the project folder

13521785
comparator	comparable
i think you can use interface the same way like comparable or comparator interface or use annotation to mark some functions and then use reflection to invoke them

13521796
hide	show
set up your preloader content as markup and make the css hide it by default but get it to show when a class is added

13521868
implements	extends
however the concept may be achieved through the use of anonymous classes which are on the fly implementation declarations that typically implements an interface but can also extends a class

13521913
onfocus	onblur	hide	show
in case you want to have it open while selecting dates and then close it you will have to show hide it programatically probably using onfocus and onblur js events or jquery

13521931
min	max
i have a following program where in i am trying to set wrong positions and i am getting garbage values in average min max

13521933
jobs	cron
basically the cron jobs operate in a limited environment so in start service the start command is not found

13521970
move	drag
now when the drag is move i can see its position update but points 0 doesn t change

13521971
post	get
you could use instead of a submit since javascript doesn t care about form submits that only matters on the server which receives post and get data

13521976
min	max
this is especially important when you initialize your min and max value with maximum or special values which will get overwritten when the first real value appreas

13522004
free	malloc
the objects in my window s xib file contain a number of large c arrays allocated with malloc so i ve also tried freeing them by sending a call to the notification center inside the windowcontroller s windowwillclose method where the notification calls a method inside the relevant objects to free the c arrays before the window closes

13522007
post	put
i saw in some other post that the django documentation is wrong and i should put the custom hook in the models directory but i don t know if that s right

13522014
implements	extends
if you think freshingredients will be the same with other models you can implements a base model and extends it to your new models

13522036
post	get
i m trying to get wordpress to add a sidebar for each post of a custom post type

13522036
post	get
update i added the global post in the code and now i do get the sidebars then i changed the_title to get_the_title

13522064
portrait	landscape
by default this is no for landscape which is why you see both views and yes for portrait which is why you don t see the master

13522064
hide	show
saying that the more elegant solution would probably be to hide the master view and then put a button at the top of the navigation bar after clicking on which you will be show the master in portait mode

13522068
pop-up	dialog
when i login my app with my account native login dialog pop-up even though web based auth

13522085
post	get
related so post how to hash the password and get it back

13522090
fadein	fadeout
i didn t put the fadeout and fadein into the example because it complicates it a bit

13522090
fadein	fadeout
you could do fadeout to all those elements before calling getjson and the fadein as the results pouring in

13522097
post	get
you can check more information regarding post and get here

13522165
folder	directory
not sure if preferences folder is writeable i don t think it is only documents and caches directory

13522173
min	max
you can add a check for the case when you have wrong positions and then use a flag or store a distinct flag value in average min and max

13522199
versioning	upgrade
this is the default setting for xcode on a fresh new install if you upgrade from older versioning of xcode you might have a legacy preference in there that you need to update

13522208
for-loop	loops
the easiest would be to change your foreach loops to a simple for-loop and grab the next value and use that to form your fraction

13522258
ubuntu	linux
i want to develop java app which i want to deploy on windows auzre bu i m using linux ubuntu now

13522264
firefox	safari
the following code works in firefox but i would like it work on safari too

13522309
direct3d	directdraw
when i execute this code normally with java fluidmovement it runs smooth as silk besides the occasional tearing because the jvm makes use of the direct3d directdraw pipeline

13522328
pop-up	dialog
on hover with these markers i need to show a label view details using the pop-up framed dialog

13522331
move	drag
even storing the address of the copy of drag that s being created by the vector when you push_back won t help in this case since it will also become invalid once the vector grows in physical size and has to move all of its stuff to a different place in memory

13522334
width	height
the map is flat with width of 43 200 000m x goes from -21 600 000 to 21 600 000 and height of 21 600 000m y goes from -10 800 000 to 10 800 000

13522434
submit	submission
avoid using hacks like in answers here submission a form by pressing enter without a submit button to make a hidden submit button

13522436
margin	height
it manages the height including setting the margin such that the text should be centered correctly vertically

13522436
width	height
this uses the same function to get the width as it seems to work the best but it uses a different function to get the height as the height isn t provided anywhere

13522437
width	margin
i am not sure exactly what your margins are going to be if enclose divs are going to be inside a wrapper or what the full code will look like so you will have to play with the enclose1 2 width and .float width and margin to get the fit you are looking for

13522437
width	margin
note i might also be a little confused because you said you want them to take up all horizontal space available but have a fixed 100px width on the floats and don t want to set the enclose to 100 width - which i have done in the example but the principle works with a fixed width and margin on enclose as well like so

13522465
post	get
the problem is that i want to set all the pages with authentication control but i cannot get the sessionid cookie from the parent web page of the applet so it cannot do get and neither post to obtain or save data

13522465
post	get
has i wrote downstairs i found out that the sessionid cookie is marked as httponly so the problem now is which is the most safe way to allow the applet to do post and get request

13522477
post	get
get i can visit it in the browser and gain access but when i post with the iphone code i get denied...so that works backwards

express	nowjs
i am attempting to combine express 3.x with nowjs which is largely a wrapper around socket.io to create a real-time application that first requires that you log in

13522649
express	nowjs
however accessing express session information from nowjs is giving me fits

13522680
web.py	cherrypy
this is my test about the performance of web.py cherrypy and tornado

13522689
put	get

13522802
folder	directory
here i ve one user- control in wpf which basically a shows folder tree in one pane and another pane listview shows files in that directory

13522826
folder	directory
also when all the code is under one top-level folder the trunk src folder you can notice that all the other folder bin lib include doc and maybe some test folder at the top level in addition to the build directory for an out-of-source build are all folder that contain nothing more than files that are generated in the build process

13522826
folder	directory
first the sub-directories of your src directory should mirror the sub-directories of your include directory this is just to keep things intuitive also try to keep your sub-directory structure reasonably flat shallow because deep nesting of folder is often more of a hassle than anything else

13522846

13522890
google-chrome	firefox
in both google-chrome and firefox this works as expected giving a result like this

13522893
for-loop	loops
like emartel showed you can dynamically determine how many times the inner for-loop will run by basing the inner for-loop s test expression upon the current i value of the outer loops line number multiplied by 2 number of single asterisks to print

13522893
for-loop	loops
most problems like these will come down to having the inner for-loop use the outer for loops counter value in some clever way to print the desired output pattern

13522909
google-chrome	firefox
firefox has a simple feature for viewing all the cookies set by various hostnames and google-chrome appears to as well although i m less familiar with the developer tools in google-chrome

folder	directory
my solution was to loop through the current directory s fplders that being the directory that houses all the project files and then through each project folder to find each management folder

13523119
width	height
the default size looks fine but when increasing its size the panel itself isn t locked to the current size and instead extends in both width and height respectively

now the catch is that this proxy is what will be injected into all your classes that is the reason why you are seeing only 1 instance of the proxy essentially the proxy knows how to manage the scope though - as long as you go through the methods of your class so in your case if you go through getter and setter calls to get to the properties of your user class you should see values appropriate to the session reflected

ubuntu	linux
spent the morning looking for a good sqlite database manager browser and have settled on sqlitestudio currently v2.20.28 which i m running on ubuntu linux 10.04

13533487
pop-up	dialog
oauth only works from the frontend as the user has to confirm pop-up dialog grant access etc

13533487
gmail	hotmail
hotmail and gmail

13533624
bonjour	avahi
this in its mdns dns-sd incarnation is available through apple s bonjour library on os x and windows and avahi on unices and possibly on os x and windows too not sure

13533649
versioning	upgrade
i am using drupal 7 and running organic groups 7.x-1.4 and wanted to upgrade the organic groups versioning to 7.x-2.0

13533652
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
everything works as advertised on firefox google-chrome and safari

13533767
google-chrome	firefox
of course with firefox and google-chrome the code is browseable

13533770
xslt	schematron
other alternatives may include schematron which should be reasonable to integrate assuming your runtime has access to an xslt processor

13533861
superclass	subclassing
thats not possible you can reference only superclass s variables from a subclassing using super keyword but not vice-versa

13533861
superclass	subclassing
the superclass never knows anything about its subclassing

13533877
getter	setter
in scala a variable declaration var x t is equivalent to declarations of a getter function x and a setter function x_ defined as follows

13533910
selecteditem	selectedindex
i had the same question a time ago and i checked i make a datagrid with several items i set the and i make a binding to both selecteditem and selectedindex properties

13533910
selecteditem	selectedindex
the result was this when you select a single item and then you select other items and make a multiselect the selecteditem and selectedindex properties will be the first one item that you have selected

13533914
implements	extends
i have implements a simple gwt app that uses 1 place and 1 activity which i have implements as a presenter which extends an abstractactivity and which contains a composite view subclass

13533928
maven	pom.xml
what i do is build pom.xml with each of my jars then use mvn deploy deploy-file to deploy my jars to the maven repository

13533963
put	get	post	get	post	put
will return you getparam if it is send with get post not sure about delete put ... request

13533974
button	checkbox
when the user checks any of these boxes and then clicks the continue button to post the selection to another page - and then clicks the back button - the checkbox that were checked by the user - have now been forgotten by the browser no longer checked

13533974
button	checkbox
if i use php to write the checkbox or simply have static checkbox - when the user checks any of these boxes and then clicks the continue button to post the selection to another page - and then clicks the back button - the selected checkbox are remembered still checked

13533976
slider	slidesjs
i tried to use multiple soundcloud html5 widgets iframes in a javascript slider using slidesjs

13533990
multiplying	add
but say i want to be able to add or multiplying by different numbers

13533990
multiplying	add
i could try writing one function for each number that you wanted to add or multiplying by but then you would run into a problem if the number wasn t fixed in the code but was based on input

13534013
put	get	post	get	post	put
however calling will give you access to both get and post delete and put are not included here - see code below

13534042
inherited	subclassing
a base class never knows what is inside the subclassing mainly because it does not know where it has been inherited

13534043
getter	setter
as bean i mean a simple data object where each attributes has a getter and setter or is public

13534097
google-chrome	firefox
the following works fantastic in google-chrome but falls short in ie and firefox

13534105
put	get
now in template.php i use the preprocess_page hook to get the image to put into a sort of banner above the page content but

13534126
hide	show
then from the view i can hide show different parts of the page depending if they are in a specific group user.isinrole

13534147
jobs	cron
ok so i have read everything under the sun about magento cron jobs and it appears as though it setup correctly

13534210
submit	submission
since is executed asynchronously if you don t stop the form submission the browser will still submit it hence redirecting the page

13534219
setcontentview	findviewbyid
this means that before the setcontentview int layoutresid method is called the findviewbyid int resid method will return null for any view references in the layout causing some potential nullpointerexceptions

13534219
oncreate	setcontentview
to avoid these errors it s a good habit to place the setcontentview int layoutresid method call at the very top of the oncreate method

13534251
simplexmlrpcserver	xmlrpclib
i have a client script which uses xmlrpclib to call a function on a simplexmlrpcserver

13534264
xmltype	clob
try to insert first clob into xmltype

13534264
xmltype	clob
try to insert second clob into xmltype

13534269
public	protected
say we have a class with several protected and or public methods

13534283
folder	directory
i want my script to check the target directory and see if my source directory contains the same folder

13534283
folder	dir
if it does it should copy and overwrite if needed my source folder to the target dir preserving the structure

13534283
folder	dir
the content of the target dir changes often that s why i need the check before it copies the folder files over

13534283
folder	dir
btw the folder in both source and target dir are named like folder1.apk - it has an extension so it looks like a file

13534369
wordpress	joomla
use a similar architecture to wordpress joomla which have plugins or extensions

13534377
put	get	folder	directory
if you have to get an inputstream form a file in resources you should consider creating a raw folder inside res directory and put your file in it and then call getresources .openrawresource resourcename from your activity or widget.for example

13534377
outputstream	inputstream
finally if you want to create an output file from your resource get an inputstream from it and write it s content to an outputstream you can see a good example here

13534385
inherited	properties
i got this when my class that inherited from dbcontext did not declare the model as a properties

13534421
post	get
i found many post about sending appwidgetid in field of intent but i can t understand where i have to get it before sending

13534432
let	curry
if you want to invoke curry you must let your explicit companion implements function2

13534444
post	get
change the ajax type to head instead of get or post and it should pull the response headers

13534490
post	get
however when logging in using firefox and debugging the request with firebug i find that after the post request it automatically do some get requests while using my code only do the post request

13534546
versioning	upgrade
you must recompile all your scala file and their dependencies when you upgrade to any new scala versioning before scala 2.10 releases

13534555
width	height
i have two functions sending the context and gettin height and width in pixels

13534569
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome opera and firefox it never occurs

13534572
int	chars
to convert a chars to an int you can do num1 - 0

13534575
int	chars
if you want to retrieve int value from a chars containing single digit you can use 0 chars

13534586
int	chars
i would guess that you want to convert a chars representing a digit to an int 0 to 0 1 to 1 etc

13534586
int	chars
this works because chars convert to int automatically when you do arithmetic on them and also because the chars 0 to 9 are guaranteed to be in sequence so all you need to do to convert a digit to an int is subtract 0 from it

13534595
google-chrome	firefox
also you should use firebug for mozilla firefox their console or google-chrome developer tools to see if you ve made any javascript typos or mistakes

13534638
margin	height
as in the first div i change only the margin it pretty sure has something to do with the changing of the height

13534656
google-chrome	firefox
the above code showing status 200 in ie but in firefox and google-chrome got the status 0 due cross domain functionality

13534679
put	get
i am not able to find what is wrong in the above code if i remove the var itemvalue itemlabel converter part then it works fine but once i put the var itemvalue itemlabel converter code as given in prime showcase i get the above error

13534691
uiview	subviews
for example i m adding three subviews using my myview class which is a uiview subclass whose interface is defined in a nib myview.xib

13534726
jar	war
i haven t gotten this far yet but was planning on packaging this jar under the web-inf lib directory inside the app war which should make it available to the server classpath

13534753
ssl	https
we can also observe this behavior in other ssl impls https requests from web browsers

13534767
acs	adfs
adfs and acs are examples of stss

13534768
google-chrome	firefox
this only happens in google-chrome firefox and ie are ok

13534783
ssl	https
you can usually switch this to just https by setting the require ssl property on the ssl page in iis manager

13534804
post	get
i can send get and post for granular elements this that kind of stuff but a web service call i need to send data too takes a raw json block with no key

13534804
post	get
ok so the way this thing works is that it automatically sets whether the request is post or get depending on the data provided in the getdata postdata and payload vars

13534804
post	get
the request is get by default but turns into post if postdata or payload have anything in them

13534829
ilist	icollection
i have also tried ilist and icollection to no avail

13534849
int	chars
as many people are saying you can just use chars - 0 to convert a chars to an int

13534879
folder	directory
i have a default sbt directory layout with an additional it scala folder

13534900
folder	directory
i have struggled with the same problem and learned that the the command must be run in the parent folder and that the ignored directory can not be a sub directory

13534987
stdout	stderr
an alternative is to tee stdout to stderr within your program

13534987
stdout	stderr
the stdout will go to the logfile and the stderr same data will show on the console

13535026
decoder	encoder
you ll find the encoder much more of a problem than the decoder as all decoders are mostly free

13535032
websphere	ibm
if everything is working fine on tomcat it sounds like a librairy conflict with ibm websphere

13535058
mouseover	mouseenter
this will take a selected div and add a hover mouseover mouseenter function

13535069
touchesmoved	touchesended
then tap touchesstarted and touchesended not touchesmoved on every single edge point in your polygon

13535072
button	checkbox
the bind of these controls is made by the name attribute on your view and the value is made by depending of what control we are talking about text checkbox radio select button etc...

13535138
getter	setter
the only way to use name and city would be either to add a ctor to class1 that takes name and city as arguments and then to provide public methods getter setter to get those values and to set those values

13535139
public	protected
try protected if you are using inheritance public the easy way out or best yet

13535139
getter	setter
create setter and getter functions and make those functions public

13535139
getter	setter
each variable needs a setter and getter function if it is private and you want to call it outside the class

13535149
ubuntu	linux
btw i m using linux ubuntu if that helps

13535181
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome do not have this issue

13535202
vmware	virtualbox
depending on which virtualization product you are using kvm virtualbox vmware etc. there should be a suitable interface you can use

13535226
accessor	properties
i m trying to write a function that adds an accessor for each nested properties in an object

13535226
accessor	properties
what i would like to be able to do is add an accessor that retrieves the value from the appropriate properties so that it is live

13535255
int	chars
i want it to store chars or int values

13535255
int	chars
1 normally this is possible int value chars r.next 33 127

13535287
public	protected
to make them available to your derived class you need to make them either protected or public - the former being preferred

13535334
stdout	stderr
during the processing it prints some results to stdout or stderr

13535344
folder	directory
that s moving up a directory for each iteration of the list instead of staying in the correct folder where the files are

13535380
required	placeholder
strange requirement required strange solution what if you ll use placeholder for this

13535386
stdout	stderr
your program probably prints results to standard error stream stderr rather than standard output stream stdout

13535386
stdout	stderr
if you want to redirect both stdout and stderr you should redirect them to different files like

13535394
xwpf	hwpf
hwpf reference .doc poi trunk doesn t have examples as xwpf do however poi scratchpad has testcases around it please find

13535402
x86	64bit
so i ve considered this issue myself for a very similar unpublished project and trying to use this 64bit approach or indeed any sort of big-endian memory space on x86

13535483
stdout	stderr
one thing to keep in mind is that operator reirects stdout to the output screen not the stderr for redirecting stderr you need to write 2 res.txt too so it should be 1 res.txt 2 res.txt

13535489
oncreate	onnewintent
with singletask a new intent is delivered via onnewintent instead of oncreate

13535492
many-to-many	one-to-many
after clearing my head and keeping apart many-to-many one-to-many lazy non-lazy i could fully reproduce your issue

13535527
put	get
what i want to happen is to be able to put in something like 555-get-food and get 555-438-3663

13535527
for-loop	loops
i know i have it running in a for-loop but i want the changes made to the previous loops to stay with the current loops

13535529
width	height
note that padding is in additional to the specified height and width

13535533
folder	directory
then published it to a folder in wwwroot then in iis 7.5 manager created a virtual directory pointing to that folder and converted it to an application using a separate 4.0 integrated pool

13535553
width	height
ok so now i want to change cell s height and width

13535581
stdout	stderr
of course this only works with output written to the standard c++ stream objects it won t redirect output sent to stdout or stderr

13535586
stdout	stderr
send your arguments correctly if you want to send both stdout and stderr to file use

13535586
stdout	stderr
when we use the file descriptor two stderr is redirected to file descriptor one which make stderr output result shown as the stdout

13535597
google-chrome	safari
a note this is purely a google-chrome safari issue

13535597
opera	firefox
i am not having this issue in firefox or opera or even ie9

13535692
superclass	subclassing
this also makes the following trick possible create an empty subclassing customizedviewcontroller of uiviewcontroller that does nothing else than being a subclassing - and then subclassing from there throughout your code instead from uiviewcontroller basically replace all occurences of uiviewcontroller with customizedviewcontroller - except where customizedviewcontroller actually declared uiviewcontroller as its superclass

13535700
kerberos	ntlm
besides that this extension is crap your client sends you a ntlm token instead of a kerberos one

13535710
stdout	stdio
this is rarely important when your output is interactive or purely informative but for programs that are processing text from stdio or a file and writing the result to stdout it s important to know whether an error such as disk full closed pipe or dropped network connection prevented the entire output from being written

13535735
textview	imageview
i have the gridview with imageview and textview in every cell

13535739
width	height
solved my own problem you have to set a height and a width on the image

13535782
onclicklistener	ontouchevent
setonclicklistener not working is that ratingbar overrides ontouchevent and never let view take care of it so view#performclick is never called which would have called the onclicklistener

13535853
put	get
here is the list that you need to implement get head lock options propfind proppatch put unlock

13535861
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it works in firefox google-chrome safari opera

13535879
stackmob	kinvey
stackmob parse kinvey but there are a number of others

13535950
post	get
is going to create a form which sends information back to the browser as a get rather than a post

13535966
pull	push
you can pull from a non-bare repository and pull into a non-bare repository but you cannot push into one

13535966
pull	push
it s recommended to use a bare repo as your central repo that you push to and pull from use a non-bare repo for your working tree

13535988
int	chars
your reasoning would be correct in c or other languages when using types as unsigned int or unsigned chars

13536014
min	max
i want to totalize the price so i defined an aggregate for price and what i m going to do is sum you can also min max average and count

13536032
jobs	cron
worst case scenario i thought about setting up multiple cron jobs that would run every ten minutes once a day and keep opening appending to the file and just add to it in chunks but that s obviously not an optimal solution

13536081
put	get
try and get in the habit of xss cleaning the form output just put true after the field name

13536099
put	get
i don t have any beans another question would be if i have to put any anotations the the maped beans if i manage to get pretty faces going

13536119
jruby	mri
i want to make a gem and when someone else tries to use it with mri it will use c code and when they use it from jruby it will use java code

13536154
folder	directory
i ve seen this in video tutorials where the only thing on the screen is the name of the folder or directory the person is in without all the extra info

13536156
google-chrome	firefox
use google-chrome w dev tools firefox w firebug or fiddler to look at the request url when you hit the download button

13536175
width	height
add some css rules or give parent element width and height

13536256
client-side	server-side
i think this is conceptually accurate as parse is the appropriate place for transforming the server-side representation into a client-side one

13536277
profiling	instrumentation
profiling your app using instrumentation and choose the zombies instrumentation

13536290
fflush	gets
then the output buffer is fflush and head gets an eof and exits before it gets more input

13536297
getter	setter
this is what i plan on trying i will set the color id property of my profile to be a 0 1 relationship so it is not required then i will add a partial profile class with a getter setter for color name in the getter if the color object is not null i will return the name of the color if it is null i will return my custom property value

13536305
int	chars
in my case the data is a two digit int or a single chars string basically small data

13536331
folder	directory
2- added lib folder to the additional lib directory

13536355
folder	directory
the problem is that i have to add all the directory and child-directories to keep the original folder structure before saving the photo

13536400
hide	show
jquery s hide and show will do exactly that they don t have any accordion effect they just appear and dissapear with no ornaments

13536400
hide	show
additionally you get toggle to hide if show and show if hidden

13536400
hide	show
and the div to hide show is

13536430
calloc	malloc	realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc
what you are doing when calling malloc calloc realloc is reserving some addresses inside the virtual address space of a process via syscalls brk mmap etc

13536444
heroku	engineyard
fog gem actively developed by guys at heroku and engineyard

13536461
debian-based	linux
on a debian-based linux system you can install parallel using

13536503
width	height
however when i substitue with another which is styled as box set height and width it doesn t float around anymore but disappears behind the floating div

13536504
crypt	salt
crypt takes two paramaters and second is so called salt see wiki

13536504
crypt	salt
salt is used in the whole alghorithm therefore to compare you want to crypt user provided password with the same salt you did before otherwise result will be different

13536504
crypt	salt
to make this possible salt is added to crypt result at the begining so providing previous result for comparion purposes simply feeds crypt with old salt it is either 2 or 12 chars depending on alghoritm used

13536557
hide	show
then to hide do a mouse leave event on the subnav .removeclass show

13536571
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
put the uinavigationcontroller s inside the uitabbarcontroller s instead of the other way around

13536590
hide	show
to hide elements with class myclasstohide as a class attribute and show elements with class myclasstoshow as a class attribute

13536590
hide	show
my worry here is that my elements show and hide only for few seconds the time my mouse click on the link

13536715
inherited	properties
if it is a windows forms application you could create your own class that inherited from windows.forms.form set some properties and then use that

13536723
int	double
it works fine for int data types but not for double

13536743
integer	fractions	modulus	fractions
the operator also requires integer operands you can use fmod to get a fractions modulus but i doubt that s what you want

13536753
postgresql	mysql
the data is in csv files at the moment i could use sqlite mysql postgresql any other dbms

13536764
listview	gridview
the same for gridview or listview

13536783
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the centering works in ie even in compatibility mode firefox and opera but fails in google-chrome and safari

13536783
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome and safari the image stays on the top of the div and does not center

13536854
client-side	server-side
i think the basic issue is that i want to rather seamlessly combine client-side and server-side coding

13536908
joptionpane	jdialog
instead do your user s a favor and swap views with a cardlayout and for the instance where you occasionally need to get information modally use a modal dialog such as a jdialog set to modal or a joptionpane

13536921
google-chrome	firefox
i have been trying to get moonlight to work with a particular web service and after some research i got moonlight working in both google-chrome and firefox

13536953
pubnub	pusher
essentially combining parse with pubnub pusher or similar instead of building a custom backend from scratch

13536958
width	height
hint it s very important that you set the width and height attribute before inflate adds the view to the root element the parent element

13537003
folder	directory
in my wamp root directory i have a codeigniter project folder mysite .here is the directory structure of mysite

13537003

13537288
hash	md5
theoretically yes an md5 hash when converted to a hexadecimal string could contain only decimal digits or only letters

13537288
hash	md5
in practice also yes the string ximaz yields an md5 hash of 61529519452809720693702583126814

13537319
src	attr
i suspect you really only want to replace the src of the button and simultaneously disable it which can be done with attr and prop methods

13537320
google-chrome	firefox
such a simple example works for me in firefox and google-chrome

13537373
centos	linux	versioning	upgrade
the problem resides in that python versioning from uwsgi is 2.4.3 which is the default versioning in linux centos and i have installed django webpy and other python distributions in versioning 2.7.3 will upgrade sooner

13537399
aggregate-functions	sum
you can replace sum with any aggregate-functions

some of the elements nested deeper in that fb share element have a width and height of 0 so they are not visible even though they are showing up in the dom if you inspect with firebug

13537739

i solved this by giving a width and height to the first span element and the iframe element via css

13537739
width	height
those are the elements but you ll have to change the width and height to what you want

13537808
for-loop	loops
my original thinking was to simply shift this over to nested for loops but my cse prof maintains that a for-loop with a string iterator inside is more efficient in some special cases so i should stick with that

per the winning answer to this question and per everything else i ve read on the interwebs you re most likely going to put django templates for mysubappx in a folder outside of mysubappx - most commonly myproject templates mysubappx where templates is a directory sibling to the actual mysubappx directory where the app is stored

13538083
pull	push
i think your branch is not up-to-date so you need to pull recent change then push your changes to remote

13538093
free	malloc
since you try to deal with dynamic string content by reading input from user it s a better idea to use dynamic allocation i.e malloc free than using fix arrays

in that method loops through the arrays of rooms with a for-loop and print the string returned by calling tostring for each room object held in the arrays since this is what it looks like your method should do

13538111
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
edit 2 although you will have to use a standard for-loop not a for-each loops since you won t be looping through the entire arrays but rather will quit when roomsrented count is reached

13538116
public	protected
the reason being is that when specifying private public protected you re still opening up default package private access to obfuscation

13538149
hide	show
the easiest way that i have found to show hide elements based off of radio values is to serve up an onchange event based on the id of the element which you already have

13538149
hide	show
where we state when #checkbox-1a is changed if the element is checked selected then do something in your case hide something otherwise do something else in your case show something

here is a nice article for managing your cron jobs from php

13538482
put	get
so i m not sure i d put too much energy into trying to get access modifiers to work with groovy but if you keep down that path i think you may have to write some initialization code for classes to do something like you ve done above or call initialize or a bad property as i ve noted above

13538485
int	chars
if you want to increase the length of your chars array by 3 to retail all old chars then you need to redefine a a chars array of size as encoded.length+3 and copy the element using system.arraycopy object src int srcpos object dest int destpos int length and then insert the three chars in between

13538839
bids	ssis
just now i have started learning ssis using bids

13538857
post	get
you can send a get or post in json format to a server and get a json response back but you need something other than html to process that json message

13538864
put	get
once you find those ranges you should be able to get the font sizes and then put them into a nsinteger via something like which you can then increment and put back into the mutable string object

13538874
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
i write a web plugin on mac10.8 with xcode4.5 it can work on safari firefox but it can t work on opera the question is opera can t load my plugin the easy question is it can n execute the

if the key of your treemap implements equals hashcode and then the treemap will use the key class compareto method

13538968
post	get
if you use the below code to post on fb wall you will get an option to tag friends there

13539006
cakephp	fuelphp
even better still would be to use a framework like codeignighter cakephp or fuelphp to give you a foundation to build on

13539012
rss	feed
for example you could write a file system where the files are really rss feed

13539043
hashchange	popstate
in an effort to be all-inclusive i m avoiding adding listeners to links and similarly don t want to use popstate hashchange etc

13539050

entity classes are as follows getter and setter are not included

13539132
post	get
i read a so post but could not get the answers there

13539167
try-catch	exception-handling
now the problem is that when getenumerator is called using foreach it returns instantly without executing getfromfiles call first but then it does comeback to getfromfiles method but now try-catch is already not in play so if tryopen throws exception-handling is not handled

13539272

put	get
i want to keep track of users who assign emails as spam then remove them from the mailing list or just put notification to 0 for them so they don t get emails anymore

13539632
width	height
you should pass coordinates to tex2d which are normalised by dividing through by the image width and height

13539673
width	height
you need to do the same for origin y and x + width and y + height to do constraints from all sides

13539681
stdout	stderr
furthermore i don t actually want to redirect stdout or stderr to dev null since i want to redirect them to a log file

13539709
stdout	stderr
i thought sshd create new session leader bash for it s connection so if you put your programmer at background and redirect your stdout stderr log 2 1 then even if you lose the connection the running bash will control your program

13539711
width	height
and some css to set the width height of the containing div as appropriate

13539723
stdout	stderr
screen takes care of keeping stdin stdout stderr connected and it also protects the program from the hup signal

13539732
button	checkbox
it s not too bad with plain fields it s really annoying with radio button and checkbox though or maybe i m just being super picky.

13539768
inherited	properties
and decorate your properties with it and even inherited from allowhtmlattribute if you wish

13539775
post	get
you don t seem to returning to a post method only a get so it is not obvious how the method with the redirect is getting called unless you are send the barcode as a query string parameter in a get call through an actionlink or link tag

13539775
post	get
the get method which you already have loads the view and the post method that you are missing processes the postback

13539811
put	get
i have a json and i need to get this json and put in the html as a ul li list

13539821
google-chrome	firefox
this is only happening in google-chrome not ie or firefox

13539835
writetofile	nsdata
you just use datawithcontentsofurl to load it into a nsdata and then you do a writetofile to save it to a file

13539838
inherited	properties
at any mvc application that works with ef you may have different models to create tables in db or conceptual model for view that doesn t create any tables.table creation depends on what properties of which model classes you ll define in class that inherited from dbcontext

13539848
preorder	inorder
e a c k from inorder and same letters a e k c from preorder

13539889
int	double
in your original code would divide the int size by 1024 truncate the result to an int and only then convert it to double

13539963
udp	tcp
i can t find my reference and i think it varies depending on tcp vs udp packets but applications i am familiar with send a keep-alive packet every 60 seconds or less to ensure the router doesn t drop the mapping

13539986
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
edit i ve done a little more testing on this and it appears in firefox 16 and ie 7 8 9 only the x and y get sent whereas in google-chrome 23 and safari 5.1 it also send the name too along with x and y

13540001
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
in your case a uinavigationcontroller would make the presentation instead of the uitabbarcontroller

13540003
hide	show
i don t get why you need to clone it just move it around and show hide as needed

13540020
integer	fractions
therefore 17 digits would be required 16 digits for fractions and 1 digit for integer part

13540036
rss	feed
xml makes a fantastic data-snippet rss feed configuration file etc

13540068
aggregate-functions	sum
you need to use an aggregate-functions sum to calculate the total cost for each expense_id

13540129
profiler	xperf
use the low level built in os profiler called xperf from the performance toolkit

13540131
versioning	upgrade
instead of using custom solutions just upgrade your junit versioning and annotate test class with fixmethodorder methodsorters.name_ascending

13540185
post	get
use either post or get method

13540242
width	height
the post thumbnails will have the height 103 correct and width 100 wrong

13540256
clang	llvm
i ve extended a bash script to compile the latest versions of llvm and clang on ubuntu it can found be as a github gist here

13540281
post	get
you need to use post instead of get while posting form data

13540351
post	get
so you must consult to back-end developer of the service and more possibly check at service side the data hit using post or get and if back-end is of php so for a moment advised him to use request instead of get or post just to test

13540351
post	get
also this fact is obvious as you mentioned that as you tried the url from browser you get the required json but in the case of post you never able to do that

13540383
int	chars
logcat says invalid int 192000 and after this number there are a lot of special chars like diamonds

13540423
listadapter	simpleadapter
change from listadapter simpleadapter

13540427
int	chars
before converting that numbrer to int remove all non numeric chars using something like this

where min and max are the range you want to have 0 to 6

13540478
post	get
after hours of trying to get this to work i have decided it s time to post

13540480
associativity	operator-precedence
for c and later c++ operator-precedence and associativity have always been precisely defined

13540492
post	get
maybe try creating a viewmodel with the properties you need for the get and post then using them in both the view and the controller methods

13540526
post	get
salewithalliwant is not a context so iâ d have to do some sort of post butchering to get everything from sale into salewithalliwant

13540535

i have tried to register recursively all the children of the parent figure to mousemotionlistener events and although it solved my issue exitaction was fired but i manage to caught it in the button s enteraction and handled it - another issue occurred the button s actionperformed event i have added the button an actionlistener is not fired or it is but handled somewhere i cannot find...

13540553
junit	mockito
however there are several test-only dependencies junit mockito arquillian hamcrest etc. that i do not want to pacakge in the product war

13540588
stdout	stderr
if you also want to get stderr then throw stderr into stdout first like this

13540624
for-loop	loops
the problems in this for-loop are that i need to change a variable that is used outside loops too and increment a value

13540722
hide	show
depending on the hashtag i want to show hide other content

13540804
typedef	struct
as an aside the typedef syntax for declaring a struct looks pretty strange in c++

13540846
ienumerable	iqueryable
i ve already tried casting to an ienumerable iqueryable datatable etc

13540881
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
better try to make run your app on firefox safari opera and co

13540906
implements	extends
i know that there are some data structures also in java which already implements this but my question is if it is possible to extends the treeset class in a way that this attribute is stored and updated whenever i modify the data structure

13540909
for-loop	loops
the for-loop goes through elements of the vector creating a copy for use inside loops body

13540941
width	height
on server i generate a image that has the width and height of the div

13540951
google-chrome	firefox
so on a recent browser like firefox or google-chrome underscore.js use the native functions of the browser

13540976

i am building the ray based on the height and width of the div containing the webgl renderer

13541030
post	get
can you post your some of html because its very difficult to get idea

13541032
int	chars
so first of all console.read only reads one chars and returns int representing this chars

13541043
textview	imageview
as you can see i show the three data at 2 textview esodatextview + amounttextview and at one imageview

13541052
width	height
first you should try to see the image handler has its width and height

13541056
google-chrome	firefox
but not working with new mozilla firefox version 17 or google-chrome

13541060
opera	firefox
it s not available everywhere opera firefox but it s a start

13541128
mp3	wav
be forewarned - converting from mp3 to wav is going from a lossy compression to a lossless one and won t sound that great

13541151
children	parent
so does the parent which has a collection of leaf children

13541151
children	parent
any parent in the collection will recursively call its children all the way to leaf nodes in the tree

13541152
comparator	comparable
but as far as i understand treeset uses comparable comparator to determine if e1 and e2 are duplicates

13541176
express	node.js
i am using express 3x node.js and redis

13541177
width	height
if you want to update the textview size its width height then instead of setting the text like in my answer simply retrieve the layoutparams from the textview and update as desired

13541179
width	height
images in the slider are of the same height and width

13541179
min	max
as you can see i have tried adding in slidewidth and max min slides as suggested on there website

13541202
width	height
or you can set anchor width and height to 100

13541206
prepare	execute
if you want to execute the same statement multiple times with different parameters then you prepare it once and execute the prepare statement multiple times

13541206
prepare	execute
some rdbms will compile the statement when you prepare it and this saves time when you execute it

13541238
put	get	post	get	post	put
for example using a post on a read-only get resource or put on a write resource that only accepts post s

13541241
equals	compareto
if compareto is consistent with equals which it should it doesn t matter whether a treeset uses compareto or equals to determine equality

13541241
comparator	comparable
see comparable or comparator

13541241
equals	compareto
compareto or compare method so two elements that are deemed equals

13541241
equals	compareto
but the bug would be in the fact the compareto and equals are inconsistent for a and is not a bug in treeset

13541259
children	parent
when connect by is used without start with clause and prior operator there is no restriction on joining children row to a parent row

13541328
width	height
you can directly create a ggplot image in your file to knit and set your figure width and height in your input file

13541328
width	height
the figure width and height have been set with the relevant arguments

13541404
width	height
in that case after removing the constraints setup by xcode you could add constraints to the view that specify its width its height and its space from the top and left of the superview

13541404
width	height
then the action handler for your pan gesture recognizer would just update the constant parameter of the pacer gesture recognizer and your pinch gesture recognizer could just update the constant parameter of the height and width constraints

13541418
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
my webpage can scrolling smooth like silk on my macbook pro tested on firefox google-chrome and safari but on my ipad it is stuttering like hell it s almost like skipped the animations even the pinch zooming is laggy

13541475
public	protected
constructors are the same as methods in this respect - if you don t give an explicit public private or protected then the constructor gets the default package private visibility

13541486
comparator	comparable
treeset doesn t use comparable comparator to determine if e1 is equal to e2

13541486
comparator	comparable
but comparable comparator interface is used to decide if an element is greater than equal or less than other element

13541486
equals	compareto
so only thing you need to ensure is that equals and compareto methods are consistent

13541486
comparator	comparable
so to compare two objects equals method is used and comparator comparable is used during sorting

13541495
textview	imageview
this will put textview left side imageview left side and textview right side imageview right side so the content from textview will be inside your imageview

13541497
put	get
but then i get an error because where is put before left join

13541498
comparator	comparable
if we add our own object in to treeset must pass comparator when initializing treeset or object must be implemented by comparable

13541498
comparator	comparable
here is java sorting comparator vs comparable a tutorial

13541548
sorting	filtering
because of separation of the data and the visualization of the data one can get correct sorting and searching filtering

13541556
google-chrome	firefox
not working in firefox 16.0.2 but it is working in google-chrome

i want to combine two images of arbitrary width and the same height in a layout filling the device s width

13541671
getter	setter
i ve three models representation of database table which basically has setter and getter methods

13541676
public	protected
because your class basketball inherits from player which inherits from person basketball will indeed have access to everything defined in person that is marked public or protected

13541701
for-loop	loops
and the current element of loops is already declared in the for-loop

13541738

i have developed a node.js program using the express framework on my computer where it runs fine with no complaints

13541949
int	double
either you change to double or you stick with int and inaccurate values.

13541952
implements	extends
they have a class that extends actionlistener and implements the actionperformed method

13541995
int	double
depending on whether v is equal int void or double you get different results

13542022
post	put
when performing rest post and put you can include form field values as part of the request

13542025
inherited	properties
the solution that worked is to create a custom panel a class that inherited from the control panel and in making the necessary code to lock the redraw with the api call lockwindowupdate and optimizeddoublebuffer properties that is used to prevent flickering the scrolling

13542025
inherited	properties
is like a common panel of visual basic it inherited all the properties of the panel unless you program in to do what you want

13542027
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
and in main you are freeing a pointer which is not pointing to memory allocated by malloc calloc so free p is undefined behaviour in this case and it s not freeing that memory which you have allocated in func so it s memory leak

13542046
post	get
i was able to get the desired result by forcing to all the attributes in the post

13542064
jquery	touchswipe
my experience with touchswipe jquery plugin was not successful it works good with desktop browsers but for mobile browsers it s too buggy

13542074

i want to implements listview without extends listactivity and i dont know how to implements it

13542098
implements	extends
i want to implements listview without extends listactivity

13542121
post	get
also the particular user should get notifications regarding any activity on their post

13542175
width	height
as soon as i add another div with fixed height and width above the target div ray.intersectobjects returns null

13542178
post	put
first thing when you put or post data you may support representations other than application x-www-form-urlencoded form data

13542189
int	boolean
it looks like it s reading something as a boolean into an int which it s not happy with in the dictreader function whereas in the reader function it is not getting that cast as such

13542250
for-loop	loops
never use in the for-loop it leads to a very difficult to find errors when your loops variable never reaches the value you expect

13542348
mouse	keyboard
examples are the transformer prime which has a keyboard with a mouse

13542386
google-chrome	firefox
this happens in ie firefox google-chrome .

13542415
put	get
what i m trying to do is to get some stats from a sourceforge project and put it into a div tag

13542420
youtube	vimeo
this method is more versatile because you re not limited to youtube you can add helpers for any host easily including vimeo and god knows what as needs pop up

13542467
min	max
lowering your min and max idle instances to smaller numbers should also help

13542467
min	max
for comparision on a non-production appspot having the min and max set to 1 works fine

13542469
width	height
by default view.transform is just the cgaffinetransformidentity and in this configuration the frame is a rectangle oriented identically to the superview with the same width and height as the view s bounds

13542469
width	height
for instance if your transform is a 20 degree rotation then the frame will no longer have the same width and height as bounds

13542482
accessor	properties
try referring to the properties via their accessor

13542523
listview	gridview
i have done this with a couple of converters which create a gridview for a listview

13542571
memset	memcmp	memcpy	memset	memcpy	memcmp
c and c++ are two different languages in c sequence of continues character means string and you can treat it as a memory part which can set get its values using memcpy memset memcmp

13542580
width	height
you still get the view s current width and height by inspecting view.bounds.size.width and view.bounds.size.height or the frame which is equivalent unless you re playing with the view.transform

13542580
width	height
if what you want is the width and height implied by your existing constraints the answer is not to inspect the constraints manually since that would require you to re-implement the entire constraint-solving logic of the auto layout system

13542581
subtract	add	subtract	addition
if the only check is addition my form 1 will only perform addition or if add subtract my form 1 will only perform add and subtract

13542622

if you ever get behavior that looks like some line of code isn t getting called it s always good to put a breakpoint there or a nslog and confirm that it does

13542631
oncreate	setcontentview
you have to define textview view and button next after setcontentview method in oncreate of your activity

13542670

it is an unsigned integer type

13542711
public	protected
size is a private method of cardpile but you could it if suits the design make it public or protected

13542711
public	protected
this will allow you to call size either everywhere public or from derived classes protected

13542739
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
it wouldn t surprise me if you are building it 64 bit and opera may not support 64 bit plugins but both firefox and safari do

13542774
capistrano	rvm
you will need to use rvm capistrano gem

13542774

cos	sin
b xi yi xi sin theta + yi cos theta

13542865
express	everyauth
my guess is you have installed express 3.x and the everyauth example is still using app.dynamichelpers from express 2.x

13542865
express	everyauth
specificaly this line of code in everyauth calls app.dynamichelpers which is an express 2.x api that does not exist in express 3.x

13542865
express	everyauth
and this line in the everyauth package.json further supports the notion that this example hasn t been updated for express 3.0

13542865
express	everyauth
long term the everyauth example needs to be updated for the express 3.x api

13542874
int	chars
for the comparison the chars i is converted to int resulting in a value between -128 and 127 usually with signed two s complement 8-bit chars s or between 0 and 255 inclusive if chars is an unsigned 8-bit type

13542874
int	chars
once the maximal value a chars can hold is reached a further increment will lead to a wrap-around to 0 if chars is unsigned and to an implementation-defined conversion of the int value 128 that the increment produced to chars when it is stored back usually the result is -128 when chars is signed

13542897
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
safari opera or google-chrome will send path s cookie to path or vice

13542910
public	protected
there is more discussion of private protected vs public inheritence here

13542913
oncreate	onstart	onresume	onpause
you should implement activity lifecycle properly when you open new activity oncreate onstart and onresume are called and when you go to next activity onpause of previous activity is called and then oncreate of second activity is called onresume onstart and then onstop is called from precious activity

13542913
oncreate	onstart
whats the different when you come back oncreate is not called you can implement your webservice on oncreate so when you will come back onstart will call not oncreate so you webservice wont be call

however when i run the automatic wordpress updates on this local copy the updates overwrite the .svn folder in the respective subfolders resulting in a directory .svn containing working copy admin area is missing error when i try to commit the update

13545765
cos	inverse
this will get you a scalar a value cos theta but you want the inverse of it acos which is the angle you re looking for

13545859
getter	setter
i have the following variable and getter setter defined in my data model

13545859
getter	setter
and there is this generic class that requires a getter setter function pointer

13545903
freebsd	linux
apparently gnuflex on macos linux requires the -r option or option reentrant to generate a reentrant scanner but on freebsd it generates a reentrant scanner by default and throws an error if the -r or option reentrant are provided

13545924
slideup	slidedown
not sure if you want to move left or when you say slide you mean as in slideup and slidedown

13545953
comparator	comparable
a comparator class is better since use of comparable would mean using

13545953
comparator	comparable
regardless of whether you go with comparable or comparator it is wise

13545985
superclass	subclassing
i have a superclass and a subclassing

13545985
superclass	subclassing
the superclass contains a constructor holding some attributes and the subclassing too should have a constructor which initializes some attributes

13545985
superclass	subclassing
the problem is however that when i make an __init__ method in my subclassing it overrides the constructor of the superclass

13546003
post	put
if i put additional keys in postparams such as link picture source to make it of type link video photo instead of status then the post show up fan page and feed as expected

13546011
children	parent
if you really had to achieve this affect while keeping the children as position absolute you could do so with javascript by finding the height of the absolutely positioned children after they have rendered and using that to set the height of the parent

13546011
children	parent
alternatively just use float left float right and margins to get the same positioning effect while keeping the children in the document flow you can then use overflow hidden on the parent or any other clearfix technique to cause its height to expand to that of its children

13546013
superclass	subclassing
make the subclassing call the superclass __init__ method

13546082
division	addition	division	multiplication	division	logarithm	addition	multiplication
i m writing a paper on cpu design and implementation of different mathematical operations such as addition multiplication division square roots and logarithm

13546082
division	logarithm
i was under the impression newton s method was used for square roots and sometimes division and that a taylor series was used for logarithm

13546082
cpu	processors
i realize it might depend on the cpu architecture so answers for a common cpu like one of the newer intel i7 processors x86 architecture in general would be appreciated

13546089
post	put
if that confused you another way to put it is that i d like for each user to create their own post that other users can t see

mocha	node.js
i have a project on github that has extensive unit tests using mocha for node.js

13546177

rather than referencing the elements with cv_16u makes reference to the unsigned short data type

13546222
free	malloc
malloc always comes with two things a check for return value and a corresponding free

13546233
addclass	removeclass
sounds like you want to use the addclass and removeclass funcitons

13546239
addclass	removeclass
if you can t use media queries you should use addclass and removeclass

13546247
int	chars
your prio field is an int and although in php you can do many operations transparently across int and strings the notice indicates that sortby has implemented string sort by accessing each chars individually

13546249
express	node.js
we will be using node.js the express framework including jade templates and ldap for authentication

13546272
spweb	spsite
i also tried to play around with the allowunsafeupdates on the spsite and the spweb

13546305
folder	directory
in project properties i ve added .h folder to additional include directory and lib folder to additional library directory and also lib file to additional dependencies

13546325
put	get
what i m trying to do is to put listview in my app which uses internal sqlite database to get data

13546325
implements	extends
i ve implements custom view for listview item which extends linearlayout and implements checkable interface

13546351
put	get
the cons of this api would be that every time you put or get a product you have to send the image over the wire even if you don t specifically need to read or change the image

13546351
put	get
as of my understanding it would not be restful to not put or get a complete representation of a resource

13546358
filewriter	printwriter
so i am creating a filewriter with append true and a printwriter with autoflush true

13546369
dropbox	skydrive
the portfolio template is supposed to be linked with a program like dropbox skydrive .

it helps to avoid situation when mouseleave or mouseout are not triggered

13546498
portrait	landscape
i have a simple slideshow list items but a combination of portrait and landscape images

13546502
min	max
one could consider that to be too expensive to do at runtime though but it can work for any value not just the min max values of any integer type

13546518
min	max
probably can be implemented by a similar approach to merge-sort break the array in half and calculate min max for each half

13546520
int	chars
i am just trying to change the chars to int and return the int

13546521
width	height
stored in simple string of length width height thus let s call it arr

13546558
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
my target audience is mozilla firefox opera google-chrome and safari.

13546564
int	chars
so my question is why to do it i mean when you cast you dont compare the chars size to int

13546601
int	chars
if you do this with a pointer your program will place the byte of chars as the most significant byte of int

13546602
ant	maven
its not directly an eclipse tool but you could have a look at maven ant or a different build system

13546642
ant	maven
i m not using ant or maven

13546646
google-chrome	firefox
i d prefer to write it on google-chrome or firefox

13546650
free	realloc
other errors after that are adress is 0 bytes inside a block of size 453 free invalid write of size 4 invalid free delete or realloc

13546686
printf	strncpy
unfortunately the details vary from function to function printf does it right but strncpy is dangerously different and you should read each function s manual very carefully to understand who takes care of the null terminator and how

13546709
put	get	post	get	post	put
use the verbs that are part of rest get put post delete and so on

13546740
width	height
in general if you want a component to fill the empty space set the width or height to 0dp and add a weight

13546743
qbytearray	qvector
i d prefer to stay away from boost but i m already using qt so if qvector or qbytearray would help me somehow i could use these

13546790
folder	directory
i ended up going into my android-sdks directory on my computer and took all the folder i downloaded from the .zip and just dragged and dropped them over and it ended up working

13546800
dropbox	skydrive
skydrive and dropbox both support uploads and downloads from windows phone and are available on ios and android as well

13546830
min	max
you can use std min and std max instead

13546840
int	chars
one thing to remember when iterating through the file is that the newline chars is included and when you try to cast that using int you will receive the error you are referencing because python doesn t know how to convert it into an int

13546856
button	checkbox
button and the pictures get copied into subfolders depending on the selected checkbox

13546972
opentype	woff
different web browsers support different font file formats eot ttf opentype svg and woff and slightly different syntaxes for the css older versions of ie are based on an older draft so it can be a bit tricky to make a page that is compatible with all browsers

13547014
google-chrome	safari
tested on ie7 ie8 ie9 ie10 google-chrome 23.0.1271.64 google-chrome for ipad 21.0.1180.80 and ipad safari

13547017
mouse	keyboard
the mouse and keyboard events can be handled from the document body of the webbrowser control

13547043
libs	buildpath
if you are adding libs the correct way to do it is by copying them to the lib folder and not the buildpath

13547058
post	get
fyi if you are sending data cross-domain via post you will always get an error because the browser discards the response although it exists

13547068
post	get
a friend has started helping me with a form that will post a status update to app.net but i can t get it to work

13547078
udp	tcp
tcp ports and udp ports are not related to each other at all

13547083
glassfish	weblogic
if you need also to deploy it on your server glassfish weblogic or whatever you want

13547098
google-chrome	firefox
i am interested in writing a single code-base for an application that will work across iphone android and blackberry mobile devices as well as on desktop browsers like firefox ie and google-chrome

13547101
put	get
i ve put a uibutton inside a custom uiview and the button is not receiving any touch events it doesn t get into the highlighted state so my problem is not about being unable to wire up a touch inside up handler

13547104
hide	show
what i noticed when trying to solve this is that i cant use hide because the google maps widget that i get thru dreamweaver get errors and show grey bars instead of the map

13547155
google-chrome	firefox
tested on ie7-10 google-chrome firefox

13547174
put	get
also double-check your logging configuration make sure your threshold is correct and whatnot see if you are able to get other log statements at debug level perhaps put a log statement at debug level prior to account.somefunction

13547253
daemons	launchd
i have multiple apps that consist of one normal uiapplication and then a background launchd daemons that runs all the time

13547253
daemons	launchd
the launchd daemons will read this file and the ui can write it

13547255
pop-up	dialog
i donâ t want it to pop-up any dialog as if it did that i might as well use tools â options

13547316
serializable	deserialization
i m new to serializable deserialization and using visual studio 11

13547347
post	get
in the cart page loads fine but does not receive the post from the book page so i get nope echoed on cart.php within #contentmainpane div

13547367
post	get
from what i ve read i need to use a ajax get post procedure to pass this javascript client side variable to php server side

13547383
hide	show
i imagine you could use the same concept to show the appropriate map for each office but using hide and .show or setting visibility or whatever rather than setting opacity

13547388
post	get
all you have to do is remember that while get and post aren t dangerous they cannot be trusted to be what you expect them to be therefore you should make sure that they are on the server side where it can be trusted

13547401
mouseleave	mouseenter
edit as far as the google map goes you can bind data to a map marker object that can be retrieved using marker mouseenter mouseleave events

13547403
switching	screens
as i switching screens i keep a reference to the previous screens in a static variable

13547403
switching	screens
the way i am switching screens is i am keeping a reference to he various screens and calling a common method to show the screens

13547478
bufferedreader	filechannel
i would recommend that for each thread open a bufferedreader on the file then get the respective filechannel object via bufferedreader.getchannel and lock the portion that that thread intends to process see filechannel.lock

13547491
updatepanel	scriptmanager
i suggest to use updatepanel and scriptmanager - both are available to use in asp.net and meets your requirements

13547563
getter	setter
if you ve a domain class in a grails project you can also use getter and setter to write or read them

13547563
getter	setter
this works with direct access to the attribute or with getter and setter methods although they aren t in the class

13547569
rss	feed
that right there is correctly showing one entry in the rss feed

13547625
int	chars
you would find strange numbers printed because you used chars instead of int

13547633
int	chars
use actual int i m not sure if your usage of chars was intentional

13547641
sequence	permutation
i d like to bruteforce the encrypted sequence by checking every permutation for the keyword morning

13547655
int	chars
you use chars s instead of int s at the array init block this is immediately converted to int s to fit in the array but don t use its actual value but the unicode value where 2 52 and 8 56

13547680
int	chars
8 is chars literal not an int

13547680
unsigned	short	int	chars
the integral types are byte short int and long ... and chars whose values are 16-bit unsigned int representing utf-16 code units

13547680
int	chars
if you use a chars where an int is expected the chars is implicitly converted to int

13547692
pull	push
submodule repo changes require that you first make changes to the external repo push those changes pull them to your main repo submodule and then commit them in the main repo to track the changed commit

13547703
rss	feed
this is the current code for my rss feed

13547755
getter	setter
when you have an unscoped field like string author the groovy compiler makes the field private and creates a getter and setter for it

13547755
getter	setter
is groovy syntactic sugar for calling the setter just like is syntactic sugar for calling the getter

13547755
getter	setter
to see this edit the class and add in a setter or getter and add a println

13547766
versioning	upgrade
visual studio 2010 and visual studio 2012 share a format for solution and project file which makes it very easy for teams who don t all use the same browser versioning or for you to upgrade transparently

13547785
width	height
i think you can just change the color slightly and increment decrement x y width and height slightly to get them to be within the older circle

13547819
integer	fractions	mpfr	mpir	mpfr	mpc
the gmpy2 library provides access to the gmp or mpir library for multiple-precision integer and fractions arithmetic the mpfr library for multiple-precision floating point arithmetic and the mpc library for multiple-precision complex arithmetic

13547825
udp	tcp
sysread is stream tcp oriented it doesn t care about where one send ends and another begins and recv is datagram udp oriented it does care

13547856
width	height
when i load up my app either stand-alone or inside facebook canvas theres an iframe with a inline height and width property that s basically blocking all app links and functions because it s somehow sitting on top of everything

13547886
unsigned	short
format specifies type unsigned short but the argument has type int

13547924
int	double
the fastest way to do it coding wise is to create an array of 100 int and then have a function which starts from the ones place and double every digit

13547933
min	max
i am setting up a wholesale store using woocommerce with the min max quantity and wholesale store plugins

13547933
minimum	max	min	max
the min max plugin allows me to set a minimum order quantity say 12 items but when i click on the - + minus and plus quantity selector to add another carton another 12 items it only adds one number single item at a time.

13547962
awt	swing
painting in awt and swing

13547982
ssms	sqlcmd
why would ssms and linqpad both take a big dump while sqlcmd still works

13547986
filewriter	bufferedwriter
i can write into the file created using bufferedwriter but not using filewriter

13547989
g++	gcc
if you are using gcc g++ as your compiler here you can download the source code from

13548001
multiplying	addition
when i multiplying as usual i came across having to do the addition below i encounter having to carry the 1 with the three 1 s which would mean 4 in binary with 2 bits

13548068
width	height
set height and width of html and body to 100 and these options for the background

13548108
.htaccess	httpd.conf
enable mod_rewrite and .htaccess through httpd.conf and then put this code in your .htaccess under document_root directory

13548135
min	max
bias - the tendency of the mode to approach the min max or midpoint value

13548135
min	max
positive values bias toward max negative values toward min

13548161
int	chars
also i need to write int to the text file so 12 has to be one byte also not 2 bytes even though two chars

13548240
jar	war
unzip your war and jar and check your manifest file for the build-jdk line

13548262
thin	webrick
i m running my rails webrick server with thin gem for minimal logging in development mode

13548277
jar	war
the export operation jar or war or anything has nothing to do with the build process

13548277
jar	war
once the build is done the export handler performs the actual export of files from your workbench which now includes the .class files for each built project into an archive jar war and so forth

13548312
ready	each
i have like ten sections on my webpage each sections height is set to the user window height when document is ready by javascript

13548338
unsigned	short
so they don t match the c format specifier which expects a unichar which is an unsigned short

13548351
range	max	range	min	min	max
but i think it is a better idea to store range instead of min and max in the first place

13548358
width	height
the width of the div is a of its parent element and the height is defined by padding however tall the center text is

13548391
src	attr
jquery object has no src property thats a dom object property which is why getelementbyid works use attr or .prop to set matched elements attributes or properties

13548398
int	chars
also i need to write int to the text file so 12 has to be one byte also not 2 bytes even though two chars

13548398
int	chars
it will contain both chars data your chars buffers and binary data your int

13548398
int	chars
bottom line if you don t know the difference between asci chars and int bytes explaining how pwrite works will do little good but to confuse you more

13548416
audiotrack	audiorecord
you can youse audiorecord to record audio and audiotrack to play

13548442
cpu	processors
it would only be possible if the cpu were capable of executing java bytecode see java processors

13548515
portrait	landscape
type enum portrait landscape sport

13548515
portrait	landscape
type enum portrait landscape sport

13548515
portrait	landscape
portrait portrait landscape landscape sport sport

13548558
ready	each
each file is separate they do not know any of them exist so they would each file would need the document.ready if the script requires the document to be ready

13548563
width	height
â width â 34px height â 34px â

13548576
int	chars
many databases including mysql will attempt to coerce that value into an int by simply dropping everything after the first non-numeric chars

13548576
subtract	add
i always recommend using a varchar field for storing phone numbers because the numbers don t really have a numeric meaning ie you re never going to add subtract

13548586
post	get
after you get the data which is a post object from pageid feed in the iphone you can store them into core data

13548634
flask	cherrypy
you need to have some web framework setup like flask or cherrypy

13548635
maven	pom.xml
maven builds and runs resteasy jetty and a bunch of other dependencies that are stated in the pom.xml file

13548638
width	height
however anns are universal approximators with only guessing to be done is the width approximation accuracy and height approximation efficiency

13548641
google-chrome	firefox
when i use the web developer extension for google-chrome of firefox and preview the print style sheet it seems ok

13548660
width	height
i need to generate a random maze with given width and height

13548698
getter	setter
and your bean has getter and setter methods for name property and you define the variable name as below

13548704
fadein	fadeout
by using the css2 clip property adding one extra container div to make the clip work and by slightly modifying your fiddle code to rely on animate instead of fadein and fadeout this effect is possible

13548753
hide	show
so keep all the contents in divs and hide the ones you don t want to show

13548837
rss	feed
i ve been working on getting an rss feed setup and with the help of some people here i got it done

13548852
mp4	webm
then i added the videos in mp4 .ogg and webm format as this should cover all the browsers and also iphone ipad

13548852
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
however it worked on iphone ipad and also google-chrome opera firefox and ie but just wont work on safari

13548877
int	double
since int operation always result in int and plain number without decimal point is parsed by c# as int if you want double result the numbers must be explicitly set as such in your equation at least one of 52 6 or 12 must be written with a decimal point eg 52.0

13548889
int	chars
the cout with operator is overloaded only for the built in data types as int chars float etc

13548890
google-chrome	firefox
the case against them when you use google-chrome is that as of google-chrome 21 installing them got ridiculously messy you need to right click the installation link save it to disk open the extensions page and drag the saved script in there yes or install tampermonkey from the google-chrome web store it is free and does for google-chrome essentially what greasemonkey does for firefox gives user script installation and maintenance a bearable user interface

13548901
versioning	upgrade
as an added bonus you can overload a hypothetical has been opened sharedpreference with the versioning number of the app lastopenedversion to be able to present the user with a change log the next time they open your home activity after an upgrade

13548915
mouse	keyboard
i m writing an ie add-on toolbar with winform and i need to get the mouse position and keyboard key press

13548936
unsigned	short
format specifies type unsigned short but the argument has type int

13548936
unsigned	short
it is definitely safe to ignore this warning because unsigned short arguments are always promoted to int before they are passed to vararg functions anyway

13548942
google-chrome	safari
so i have a background i want to animate on a scroll event works fine in google-chrome and safari

13548942
opera	firefox
apparently though firefox doesn t support this properly and neither does opera

13548943
google-chrome	firefox
i am trying to put custom 404 error page ....it works fine with google-chrome and firefox but with ie it is displaying its own error page

13548959
mvp	presenter
for a gwtp based mvp a typical main presenter will be revealed with this code

13549007
int	chars
a chars in int stream is undefined behavior

13549045
folder	directory
the module directory are set up with the same folder structure as the master repo when i clone them on top of the master repo clone they should merge replace existing files

13549046
jar	manifest.mf
jar manifest.mf class-path referencing a directory

13549081
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
as for mobile browsers i ve tested android browser opera mobile safari and finally google-chrome mobile

13549093
put	get
if you set the input to a monospace font you could conceivably put a listener on the keyup event get the length in characters of the input then calculate how small the font size should be in order for the value to fit on one line

13549111
direct3d	directx
if you look at the hardware support for direct3d 10level9 formats windows page you will see that dxgi_format_r8g8b8a8_unorm as well as dxgi_format_b8g8r8a8_unorm are supported on directx 9 hardware

13549172
bluetooth	usb
of course that doesn t help during dev so once you know the bluetooth connection works it probably makes sense to use the usb cable except when testing the connection for regressions

13549263
google-chrome	firefox
at first i could get google-chrome to work but not firefox or internet explorer

13549294
udp	tcp
eg ether ip udp dns or ether ip tcp http

13549302
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it looks fine in the most common browsers google-chrome firefox safari ie and in google-chrome on a gn gs3 and an ipad it looks fine but the main content text is oddly left-floating on the default android browser except for that one float-right image

13549303
istream	getline
if you look at the parameter list of the istream getline function you will notice that it takes your variable student.name as a pointer

13549349
subtract	add
when you add or subtract combine or remove delegates the original instances are unchanged immutability and a new instance is created

13549383
put	get
also note that if you put the actual variable in the header file you will get a different linking error

13549395
children	parent
order matters if you query from parent to children pk should be parent_id child_id

13549395
children	parent
primary key acts as a clustering key so the extra data is naturally covered when querying from a parent to the children

13549395
children	parent
1 in other words do you only need to get children of given parent or you might also need to get parent of given child

13549411
int	chars
it s like each chars int is an array

13549483
post	get
i make an aspx page render it then get and make an html with the render page and just change the method from post to get

13549483
post	get
and yes the request.httpmethod can show more accurate if is get or post command

13549490
box-sizing	border-box	width	border-box
he s said that it s because padding stretches the width of an element to which i responded with box-sizing border-box

13549530
margin	border-box	box-sizing	border-box	box-sizing	margin
compared to the potential issues caused by margin collapse i honestly find your suggestion of using box-sizing border-box a good case against using margins to simulate padding while preserving the exact widths that you need because it s designed to solve that problem

13549531
udp	tcp
note that recv is usually used on sockets which are set up non-connection oriented a udp socket but it may be also be used on connection oriented tcp sockets

13549552
innodb	myisam
check yor tables if teyh use innodb or myisam the later is in my experience very slow with insert and is the default for new dbs

13549597
octal	binary
this doesn t work with the prefix 0 for binary and for octal with the prefix 0

13549599
try-catch	exception-handling
i do have a try-catch exception-handling pe around the main code that is busy during that time but it doesn t seem to catch the exception-handling

13549605
post	get

when displaying anamorphic widescreen in a window video players usually just keep the same height and stretch the width to obtain the correct display aspect ratio

13551083
width	height
if fullscreen both width and height may be stretched but not by the same factor so that the display aspect ratio comes correct and the video fits exactly within the screen resolution

13551083

ctime	strftime
the best thing to do is to convert that call to std ctime to a call to std strftime

for the other map with int keys and double values you should use a specialized map implementation which stores primitives instead of objects

13552018
for-loop	arrays
you are treating this like a normal arrays so i would prefer using for-loop

13552451
uiview	subviews
to do so you need a uiview that acts as the sole top-level subviews of the scrollview and in code you must set it to not use autolayout enabling its autoresizingmask and removing its other external constraints

csv	tsv
you can use mysql s select into outfile syntax to give you a native mysql way to generate csv or tsv files

13552751
implements	extends
extends the thread class is just a convenient slightly simpler way but implements the runnable interface is best because it gives you the method run in which you can call your function and also allows you to extends other classes instead of thread

hmac	md5
i was trying to generate md5 hmac with openssl most of the code is borrowed

13555993
fast-forward	merge
that s probably because your merge was a fast-forward merge which means that there weren t any commits made to master in between the time when codetidy was created and when it was merge back in - so git helpfully just moves master to point to the same commit because it already has the exact same file contents as what a merge would look like rather than creating an unnecessary merge commit

13555994

it s been working fine in ie google-chrome and firefox for months but now i get an error before the xml file is able to load...only in google-chrome and ff...ie8 works fine

again you don t put the clear ignore sequence at random but only after you get an input error from a formatted input operation which sets the failbit of the stream

13557098
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
in code behind you will have to use actualwidth and actualheight if you have not explicitly set the width height

13557098

13557296
flask	django
so i would suggest to start with django and learn flask later if you want something that is more flexible

13557296
flask	django
again there are packages for flask that provide you with the same functionality but because they cannot make the same assumptions that django can make due to everything fitting together so nicely they will be a little bit harder to get running

13557296
postgresql	mysql
in my opinion it doesn t matter that much if you choose mysql or postgresql the orm will handle both just fine

i believe this happens because you re trying to set the width and height of the canvas with css

13557539
width	height
the width and height attributes indicate the size of the drawing surface which by default is 300x150

13557539
width	height
setting the css width and height of the canvas will expand or shrink the drawing surface but will not change the number of pixels in the surface

13562501
qtimer	qthread
this is quite strange for me because i never use qtimer in my code or qthread

13562501
qfilesystemwatcher	qfilesystemmodel
perhaps it could be something related to qfilesystemwatcher used by qfilesystemmodel i guess...maybe it uses some qtimer features

13562747

but you can set the opacity width and height to zero and then call the click event when the other button is clicked

13563369
put	get	post	get	post	put
but now i would like to make it even better to let the http service starting to be transparent to the client asking for a get a put or a post and to immediately reply correctly with the correct service response even at the first http request

13563375
qtreewidget	qtreeview
i recommend you to use qtreewidget instead of qtreeview because your tasks are pretty simple

13563375
qtreeview	qstandarditemmodel
qtreeview with custom model for example qstandarditemmodel is for difficult events

13563435

use createelement createtextnode appendchild and friends instead of document.write

13564126
appkit	nsresponder
the delegating object is often a responder objectâ that is an object inheriting from nsresponder in appkit or uiresponder in uikitâ that is responding to a user event

13564137
for-loop	arrays
if x is in the arrays then it adds it to an arraylist that returns at the end of the for-loop

13564141
titlebar	window
you can also create custom window chrome and add a custom titlebar to handle events on it yourself

13564147
post	get
its description makes more sense for a post than for a get

13564161
rss	feed
i fetch the list of rss feed from the database

13564211
tostring	gethashcode
the system.valuetype class simply provides more appropriate overloads of tostring gethashcode etc

13564236
stdout	stderr
a naive use of process substitution seems to allow filtering of stderr separately from stdout

13564236
stdout	stderr
note that stderr comes out on stderr and stdout on stdout which we can see by wrapping the whole thing in another subshell and redirecting to files o and e

13564346
post	put
essentially it seems like rails convention is to wrap attributes inside the name of a resource on post and put calls

13564351
width	height
additionally whats with the and height and width attributes

13564351
width	height
replace the height width properties with their css equivalent

13564355
ceil	floor
another approach is to use ceil and floor as needed

13564369
postgresql	mysql
recently we have changed from mysql to postgresql

13564369

beanstalk	amazon-web-services
all this can be bundled and deployed with autoscaling using amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk

13564481
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk still has it s own limitations but is a very cool way to manage your infrastructure with the least hassle for monitoring scaling and load balancing

13564540
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
otherwise alternative solution of your requirement is you can use uitextfield the subclassing of uicontrol which inherited uicontrol s the contentverticalalignment properties

13564557
width	height
but i don t think that will provide you correct result because before adjusting width other cells in same row which may not have large texts also have same height so their width property will also be changed using this which is not correct for your situation i guess

13564617
box-sizing	border-box
the problem is in padding that increases box size unless you set box-sizing to border-box

13564655
try-catch	exception-handling
a try-catch block is something used in java to handle exception-handling

13564717
distance	polygons
z-buffer precision falling with distance so far objects have more flickers gpu can t figure out which polygons is on top because tail of the z-buffer value isn t precise enough to distinguish 2 almost equal values

13564737
x86	64bit
linux for 64bit x86 cpus is an example of such a unix-like system which is lp64

13564753
onmouseover	onclick
from example i am able to display it onclick or onmouseover but box disapears when i move my mouse pointer

13564776
ubuntu	linux
as i know there is no such problem on linux at least on ubuntu

13564920
daemon	cron
you can do this by putting the fetching and crunching part by setting up a script that is executed in a cron job or that exists as a daemon runs continuously.

13564925
post	get
in this i want to parse json in both the get and post methods and i want to check the internet availability

13564951
int	chars
if i remove the chars parameter from the method and call it from the native only with the int parameter it s work

13564987
ssl	https
however if i load a url for which ssl is set but ssl_enabled is false in settings.py the page still tries to load over https and fails because i m doing this on . mange.py runserver and i get no log message

13565000
width	height
a scaling or rotation transform would make the frame bigger so we d need to update any width or height constraints etc

13565016
mouse	keyboard
in my case since i dont use keyboard or mouse inputs through qws i solved the issue by running the application as

13565028
hide	show
you need to show hide the input fields using jsf in the server side instead

13565041
width	height
but if the window is opened in â œwindows 7â then height of the window is not okay however the width is normal

13565059
express	node.js
i m using node.js + express 3 + passport to create a simple authentication local just to play around

13565073
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
view this jsfiddle in a webkit-based browser like google-chrome or safari and then compare it to what you see when you view it in a non-webkit based browser like firefox or internet explorer

13565073
google-chrome	firefox
below is google-chrome on the left and firefox on the right

13565073
width	height
more exactly webkit interprets 36.1 not as 36.1 of the page width but rather 36.1 of the element width or height

13565073
opera	firefox
but there s a huge ugly triangle in the middle of the content on a windows phone or if the user uses opera or firefox

13565112
width	height
the default behaviour with no css set is that if the height attribute is set to half the natural height then the width will automatically be half the natural width as well

13565123
int	double
edit since your intent is to check for an int value and you make the explicit assumption that the values are small enough to be represented precisely in a double with no loss of precision then i think your comparison is fine

13565165
button	checkbox
the file is containing answers for questions mcq radio button mcq multi answer checkbox and simple text fields

13565178
width	margin
the negative margin matches the border width of your arrow ensuring it will always be in the exact centre whatever else happens with your layout

13565200
equals	tostring
my rule of thumb is that the tostring should reveal if two objects are equals or not

13565210
equals	tostring	equals	gethashcode	tostring	gethashcode
as far as i know the conventions for tostring are intrinsicly linked ot the conventions for the other 2 overridable methods on object - gethashcode and equals

13565210
equals	gethashcode
that is to say that when equals returns true then the same hash code should be generated by gethashcode

13565210
equals	tostring
to add to this i would say that when equals returns true tostring should return the same string

13565238
uitextfield	uistepper
in the delegate of uitextfield add the following code which will make the uistepper s step value be changing according to what you enter in uitextfield

13565279
equals	gethashcode
it should be in sync with equals and gethashcode

13565391
client-side	server-side
wait wait wait a second php is server-side javascript is client-side

13565404
client-side	server-side
also you can t mix php server-side with javascript client-side

13565443
put	get
to get this work you have to put the serversocket.accept in a loop

13565446

when i change my emulator orientation from portrait to landscape header and footer of page are getting changes in width but the block is having same width width as it is portrait mode

13565476
pull	push
i have a side panel that has a uiimageview to which i attached a uipangesturerecognizer so that you could push pull the sidebar

13565479
versioning	upgrade
i have done a similar set up with promo codes to unlock the full versioning of my applications so i could create my own promotions without making the upgrade free for everyone by removing altering the iap

13565489
implements	extends
i m extends gridviewdatacolumn and i want to implements some custom sorting for it

13565556
sorting	filtering
in my application sorting filtering and paging are enabled

13565632
int	chars
anyway presumably line is a chars array and currchar is an int

13565663
move	drag
i ve set up a jquery draggable which can be move around the entire document it s not contained by anything and this is acceptable as when the user drag i want them to be able to drag as far down the page or left or right as they wish

13565674
bionic	libc
i do not think you did anything wrong - the message seems to indicate that a critical libc function is not implemented in bionic the c library used by android

13565685
google-chrome	firefox
i realize that there are packages like get you can download to do most of the work but since i am pretty new to web design about 5 months experience i have more fun reverse engineering stuff using the built-in inspectors in google-chrome and firefox

13565685
width	height
right now i am creating classes for the width and height individually and also classes for each color and then i have a border for hovers and focuses for all color selectors

13565690
hash	salt
generate a salt hash and store that

13565713
fadein	fadeout
you can use jquery carousel or you can use jquery apis like slidein slideout fadein fadeout to create your own animation effect

13565734
jar	manifest.mf
your ejb jar file manifest.mf should contain the classpath it needs

13565748
post	get
when opening the details page you should send a get request not a post request

13565780
children	parent
problems with this approach wrt to op s question is that the parent div s size is the constraining factor and we re forced to restrict the maximum size of the children

13565780
children	parent
but provided that the children do fit in the parent the above css should provide the desired outcome

13565816
screens	tablet
and vice versa for scaling up to tablet size screens

13565825
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
in google-chrome safari and firefox this works very well the div gets rounded corners so it is transparent in the corners

13565870
google-chrome	firefox
i ve used something similar before for rounded corners on div s and it worked in ie9 google-chrome firefox not ie8 though

13565986
gnupg	gpgme
gpgme gnupg made easy

13566001
google-chrome	firefox
if i execute in google-chrome or firefox i get the alert-dialog printing hey

13566002
subclass	abstract-class
so we re going to have to subclass its parent abstract-class

13566022
google-chrome	firefox
it works in the latest firefox v17 but not in google-chrome v23 strangely enough google-chrome displays scrollbars for a moment and hides after that

13566038
int	double
i don t get why anyone would use int when they could use floats or double

13566038
int	double
seems like floats or double will take care of anything that an int can do with the bonus of being able to handle

13566070
int	double
for example when working with big databases an int or float may double up the required size

13566079
int	double
typically an int will use less memory than a double that is why one doesn t just use the largest possible datatype

13566100
width	height
i m trying to use flexslider with text-based content on each slide which means that the vertical height of the slides and viewport need to alter dynamically depending on the width of the window

13566113
margin	font-size	width	margin	width	font-size
i would try to group some of those attributes into clases that describe boxes of certain sizes a certain width heght padding margin font-size etc

13566127
integer	fractions
the main reason is the same reason we often prefer to use integer fractions instead of fixed-precision decimals

13566127
integer	fractions
because integer fractions are exact just like integers are exact

13566146
fseek	ftell
you can use fseek using seek_end and then ftell to get the size of a file in bytes

13566176
filtering	grouping
well i managed to perform a search within the log messages cvs term for the commit commentaries filtering by the content of the text in the log message and grouping the files changed on that commit

13566205
int	double
first off like people have already said double stores 64-bit numeric values while int only requires 32-bit

if you decide to create events in httpserver class and subscribe to them don t forget that code of event handlers will execute in another thread so check invokerequired and use invoke begininvoke methods of form

13566606

it all depends on what is really your content but simpliest would be to alter div height to match your requirements or use two div s one for shortened version other for full and show hide them accordingly

13566662

while learning compiler optimisation i write codes in c under linux with gcc version gcc version 4.4.5 ubuntu linaro 4.4.4-14ubuntu5.1

put	get
basically you put the number you want where n is and it will get that element

13567090
min	max
this function has access to the min max and spaceperunit values in the parent function which makes it very efficient because it doesn t do the calculations in every iteration

13567121
profiling	debugging
alternatively if you want to do this for debugging purposes it s not the worst idea to use a profiling tool for this

13567121

qstring	qabstractitemview
your problem is qabstractitemview and friends expect displayrole data to be a qstring and nothing else

your best bet will be using qlistwidget which does have a way to use qwidget for items

13567267
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
qgraphicsview is a really complicated widget and qgraphicsscene it needs is even more complicated

13567271

while it s not necessary to use the .each method on this to iterate through every matched item it would be the correct way to use if you ever expanded this plugin to do more and needed to apply things to each element outside of jquery methods the prop and css parts

then i decided to try to upload both yii framework folder and my application and include an index.php file that includes the myapplication index.php file which seemed to be a nice try but some assest and other classes in yii are configured to look for yii framework in the root directory causing my application to crash with yii error but not php error

13567491
min	max
as correctly noticed by paul_r the sign comes simply from the sum of the min and max values

13567491
min	max
but the idea can be exploited more the sum of min max is the same as the sum of all the elements minus the middle one which can be found by max 3 comparisons

13567494

when in the last 50 post there are 47 lang en and 3 lang nl i now get a skewed list

13568371
jobs	cron
cron jobs - is not really good programmer s way because your code will store in your repo and in system crontab

13568371
eventlet	gevent
other way is using something like eventlet or gevent

13568407
pull	push
rather than push from remote you need to pull to local

13568435
stdout	fflush
there s nothing wrong with the code but note that in many cases the output of printf is buffered meaning that the output appears on the console only if you explicitly call fflush stdout you print a newline or the buffer becomes full

13568435
stdout	fflush
so the bottom line is either call fflush stdout before you call sleep to ensure that nothing stays in the output buffer or wait for 40 seconds and you will get the output in a single batch in the end

13568478
pop-up	dialog
i would like to add custom markers on the html5 player video.js progress bar that automatically pop-up a js dialog box when playing the video sort of like soundcloud.com comments system it won t be edited from the from the frontend only hardcoded comments added once sort of chapters but with pop-up functionality

just check the width and height and compare them to get orientation

13568544
width	height
here max size is the one i initialized to something like 120px for both height and width

13568544
portrait	landscape
this works for me which is irrespective of landscape or portrait orientation and can be applied generally

13568580
subtract	add
while the answer is or add or subtract 360 as appropriate

13568599
stdout	fflush
the stdout stream is buffered and is only going to display when it hits a newline n or if you want to view it real time as your call printf you need to force it to fflush the buffer one way or another

13568599
stdout	fflush
a call to fflush stdout will do this

13568607
profiling	debugging
i have the developer debugging profiling turned on and it gives me this additional information

13568649
google-chrome	firefox
i have the following jquery code that works great inside my .aspx page using firefox or google-chrome

13568930
n-gram	words
the problem with naive checking against n-gram data is there is a lot of noise in the lower frequency words

13568930
n-gram	words
the easiest thing to do which should give you the correct answer in the overwhelming majority of cases is to truncate a list of frequency counted words from somewhere suitably large google n-gram wikipedia etc at the top 50 000 or 100 000 words

13569041

oncreate	onstart
now if i start the application again the oncreate onstart and onresume callbacks are invoked

13569163
unsigned	short
if you use utf16 then you get fixed-size encodings 2-byte encodings which actually map a character to an unsigned short 0-65535

13569163
unsigned	short
the char type in c# is a two-byte type so it is actually an unsigned short

13569173
hide	show
i found that the hide show the show part creates another instance of the same form so i better dispose the current one create a new instance of it and show it

13569209
post	get
i am guessing that what you need to implement is the post redirect get pattern which is the recommended way in grails applications

13569237
put	get
also keep in mind that even if it works with a screenreader it may be annoying blind users rarely read top-to bottom make sure you put in solid structure with headings and aria lankmarks or it may not be giving a blind user the same amount of information that a sighted user might get

13569260

google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox - the code and alerts work as expected however ie still throws the error

13571180

accelerometer	gyroscope
i do not want to use the gps but only the gyroscope and the accelerometer

13572039
accelerometer	gyroscope
what i have thought so far is to get the angles by which the device has rotated along its three axes from the gyroscope and accelerometer data periodically and then use this info to figure out the magnitude of movement along the axis in which the user is moving using the accelerometer

13572039
accelerometer	gyroscope
also are the in-built gyroscope and accelerometer accurate enough for this

...that relies on the values of strcmp being something other than -1 0 and 1 it uses the return value in qsort

13572074
qsort	strcmp
if you take a look at the man for qsort the example there is pretty much the same as the bell code you posted using strcmp reason being the compairator function that qsort requires is actually a great fit for the return from strcmp

13572089
free	malloc
i know that some memory debuggers work by replacing malloc free and keeping track of what is pending to be free and who allocated it

13572089

13572232
factors	mean
for comparison attacking pbkdf2-hmac-sha512 using an asic has a factors closer to 46 -- larger numbers mean more bang for the attacker s buck and less security per round for you though script kiddies generally won t have that kind of budget

13572245
division	logarithm
a good number for the percentage depends entirely on the size of the project so maybe instead of dividing only by the number of methods you can put less weight on the method count in the division by making it grow slowly for large numbers such as a square root or logarithm to try and make it more stable as the project grows

kerberos	ntlm
assuming the web application is federated with the adfs2 the web browser control will automatically follow the flow - it will redirect to adfs and stop there to show the prompt for user credentials adfs2 in forms authentication mode or just authenticate using ntlm kerberos adfs2 in windows authentication mode

13584347
ws-trust	ws-federation
the downside of this approach is in my opinion that if your identity provider adfs is further federated with yet another identity provider which does not necessarily implement ws-trust ws-federation then the active authentication will probably fail because the other identity provider does not implement it while the passive scenario will still work a bunch of redirects will sooner ot later end with a page which requires user to provide the credentials but the flow of authentication protocols between consecutive identity providers does not matter

i m just wondering if following is the right way to convert int to display it as a chars

13595641
allocator	stl
most stl users misuse the components in one form or another and some proper uses only became really supported with c++ 2011 using local custom allocator

13595678
cout	cin
in the function loop through the data and get all three fields from the user using cin cin.getline and cout statements

13595713
stdout	stderr
when i start in console mode using . activemq console the stdout stderr messages are displayed as expected

13595718
folder	directory
the main differences with the original prompt is the removal of the stars except for the folder that contains the jar files and the shortening of the base classpath paths to capture only the base directory

13595727
apache	nginx
the procedure is simple nginx pass- 8080 to apache

13595778
firefox	safari
use firebug with firefox or dev tools in safari or ie to look at the javascript errors you re getting

13595789
allocator	stl
it is all custom synchronization classes that only synchronize when empty custom allocator custom lock free queues and lists occasional stl with custom allocator but more often custom intrusive collections of which i have a significant library

13595789
boost	stl
if the author truly has written custom lock free queues and lists it is likely to give a fairly hefty performance boost over pure stl with locks

13595838
put	get
i happen to prefer the eclipse ide and in eclipse you d copy your file to the src folder in your project in which case it ll automatically get put in the right place when you export your .jar

13595851
easeljs	fabricjs
libraries like easeljs fabricjs and kinectjs look good

13595863
int	chars
using hhd in your first example forces a c99-compliant printf to convert the int it is passed to a chars before printing it

13595910
post	put
and manually put belongs_to user in post model

13595922
gif	bmp	gif	png	bmp	png
this code supports encoders for bmp gif png and jpeg formats but it can be easily extended to the other formats for the rest of the native encoder clsids look at the remarks section of the iwicbitmapencoder interface reference

in x86-64 there are 8-bit 16-bit 32-bit and 64bit general registers to hold your numbers

13596207
division	multiplication
there are signed and unsigned operations though such as signed multiplication imul signed division idiv unsigned multiplication mul unsigned division div

13596237
spaces	delimiter
if you wanted to stick with spaces delimiter you could do something like this

13596243
free	malloc
malloc will give you back a chunk of memory from the heap which lives on between functions but must be free

13596263
portrait	landscape
regardless of whether the simulator iphone retina screen is in portrait mode or rotated to landscape

13596263
portrait	landscape
the result is thus the graphic that i draw in portrait mode is centred on the screen correctly but offset to the left in landscape

13596270
mp3	aiff	mp3	wav	wav	aiff
foremost since you mentioned that they were mp3 files and not wav or some other uncompressed pcm format such as raw or aiff you ll first need to transform a and b into an uncompressed form such as s16_le pcm cd audio format-- signed 16-bit integer samples little endian which means you ll be working with an array of sample values-- with left and right channels interleaved if stereo audio-- for a and b and therefore c the last of which may later be optionally re-encoded to mp3 when you re done mixing

13596270
mp3	flac	mp3	wav	mp3	ogg	wav	flac	wav	ogg	flac	ogg
for general development the ubiquitous libsndfile c library is useful for taking care of all of this for you for 47 file formats including ogg vorbis and flac but no direct mp3 support in addition to the wav variants upon which you should probably be focusing

13596289
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
this works great in google-chrome but firefox and safari remove spaces from the href value which renders the copied message unusable

i d like some help tweaking this little accordion menu and replace the hover effect with a click effect that means show hide whenever i click on it instead of just hovering over it

13596491
hide	show
i ve looked into other options such as target but i don t think you can use it to show and hide at the same time

13596513
maven	pom.xml
if you are using maven add a dependency to jstl in your pom.xml using the snippet provided here

13596524
jstl	taglib
this way the taglib declaration must not give any errors anymore and the jstl tags and functions should just work

13596560

edit workaround thanks to look for helping me troubleshoot this problem and by looking at this post about a similar problem i came up with the following temporary workaround which i put inside the router code

13596739
margin	font-size
4. font-size must be matched within a ua-dependent margin of tolerance

13596774
width	height
i set the width and height of the using jquery to detect the width and height of the mobile screen so it fits different version of blackberry phone

13596774
width	height
jquery is also used to detect width for div#title div#tabs and div#container.finally the height of div#container is calculated by subtracting the screen height with div#title and div#tabs height

13596774
width	height
the contents inside div#container will always be bigger than the div#container height or width

13596774
width	height
even though i set div#container overflow auto when i use trackpad or trackball to scroll the contents inside div#container it will never get past the div#container width or height even though the inner container is bigger than div#container

13596823
public	protected
the reason it won t compile if you make compare a member of a is probably that you are not making it public or protected

13596841
folder	directory
that is in my app views directory i have a shared folder where i put all shared templates and i would like to have a shared folder intended to be used the same sharing way but for helper files also in the app helpers directory

13596863
umask	chmod
either you strip the permission from the executable say using chmod 600 mazeio or your umask is weird

13596870
post	get
with the web service you accept http post or get request then your server s logic code will parse the parameters or variables inside the post or get

13596895

13596942
express	node.js
proxy request in node.js express

13596967
hash	salt
which is similar to the first hash first 3 characters always match where the only difference in the generation is the key the semi-randomised timestamp which leads me to the conclusion that they re using some basic hashing that uses the randomised timestamp as the salt

13596967
hash	salt
final note i know nothing of encryption or hashing or security beyond the basic ideas input value and salt get hash

13596969

13597029
udp	tcp
tcp and udp are just types of packets datagrams

13597029
udp	tcp
the main difference is that tcp packets include extra protocol information whereas udp are simpler packets with just a destination the data itself and a checksum

13597029
udp	tcp
so when you create your system you have a choice - either tcp or udp packets depending on what you are trying to achieve and how you want to go about it

13597035
fadein	fadeout
that s because you re applying the fadein and fadeout to the parent container of all the the .circle elements

13597035
hide	fadeout	fadein	fadeout	fadein	hide
use fadeto instead of fadein fadeout - fadeto animates the opacity only while fadein fadeout will also hide the elements resulting in element position jitter

13597492
integer	unsigned
the correct way to split a signed 32-bit integer into two 16-bit integers is as a signed 16-bit upper half and an unsigned 16-bit lower half â and you need to make an adjustment for negative numbers by subtracting one from the upper half and adding 2 16 to the lower half so as to make it positive

13597492
integer	unsigned
the upper half of the result will be a signed 32-bit integer because it s the sum of products some of which are signed and the lower half will be an unsigned 32-bit integer

13597537
cdr	cons
you need to differentiate the case where a cons starts a proper list vs where it s the cdr of a list

13598054
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox underline hyperlinks by default as you re probably aware

but i did not find the correct constraint settings to make the buttons space themselves evenly for any view width for portrait ipad or landscape orientations

13598602
hide	show
1.either you can keep both buttons outside or above both tables.so that if you click on button1 you hide first table show second when click on second hide second table show first table

13598602
hide	show
2.in first table add two button at first row as you did.when you click on button1 then instead of hiding first table return 1 for table1 data source in numberofrows method reload table1 so that buttons will be there then show second table below first table.when user click on second button then hide second table return new data source for first table reload table1

i am trying to port my c gnu linux code to freebsd

13599151
free	malloc	freebsd	linux

13599151
freebsd	linux
im at a lost at why this is working gnu linux and seg faulting on my freebsd test machine

13599192
ceil	sqrt
you will need to use mpf_class to get a floating point result from sqrt and then ceil should work but return an mpf_class

opening a file system folder directory from web browser

13599318
public	protected
now since methods defined in an interface is by default - public yes you don t need to write it explicitly so you cannot make your method protected in implementing class

13599321

while run the program first it shows the view in portrait mode only.it doesn t prompt the view to rotate in landscape but after when i rotate the device once it works fine.can anyone please help me to solve this

13599494
width	height
pass in the width and height as captured from the textbox and this should help you set the form height width

13599568
int	double
i agree with your analysis that there must be a conversion to float instead of double when both terms of the complex number are expressed as int

13599568
int	double
this clearly indicates that you should be able to write int expressions and obtain a valid double complex though examples are non-normative

13599568
int	double
however it does not address whether the int value should be converted to float before being converted to double but there s nowhere else in the language that would do that automatically obviously you can force it so it is unlikely to be the intended interpretation

13599580
hide	show
if you use asynctask you got the progress report method safe to ui thread and the completed method also ui thread safe you just need to override them for you simple case show a progress before task starts and hide it on complete

int	double
now x and y could hold either a string double int datetime in any possible combination

13599614

if you are using derby as your metastore i would suggest you to migrated it to mysql or postgresql as derby is not suitable for production

13599803
crossover	mutation
you would also need models that predict the expected quality of your crossover and mutation operator in order to estimate the fitness distribution in the next generation

13599851
cos	sin
that being said the principle for moving an image inside a canvas or an image tag would be to calculate the position with sin cos + distance from the top left corner of the canvas window

13599910
portrait	landscape
top is portrait picture bottom is landscape

13599912
uipangesturerecognizer	uipinchgesturerecognizer

autodesk	3ds	3ds	lighting
obj format is also widespread but suffers from the same problems as collada.it is still good if you want to write your own parser as its structure is very simple.but instead i would suggest 3ds which is binary.it doesn t support animations though.the most popular format today which supports both static mesh and animation is fbx.you can download for free fbx sdk from autodesk and connect it to your engine.the reason i would choose fbx is because both sdk and the format are really robust.for example in fbx you can embed not just geometry and animation but also scene objects as lighting cameras etc.autodesk docs are very nice too

do not give the image a width and height in the html or css or the aspect ratio will change

13602882
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
remember you will have to use the base64 method to get the image to be displayed in the image tag i don t know whether it is supported in ie or not but it is the html5 facility available in google-chrome firefox opera

13602884
stdout	stderr
redirect stderr to stdout before redirecting stdout to dev null

in c you can only release memory with free that was explicitly obtained with malloc or calloc or realloc

13603307
free	malloc
and free is finicky in that it needt to receive the exact same pointer value that was returned by malloc

13603307
free	malloc
to avoid problems it is generally recommended to keep allocation and release of memory in the same function or in a pair of related functions so you can easily verify that the memory passed to free was obtained from malloc or its kin

13604077
inherited	properties
when you create jquery objects they have those properties because of javascript s prototypical inherited

13604127
versioning	upgrade
or you upgrade to a more recent versioning which would be a very good idea in general

13604135

the point of a salt is to add a unique element to each password so two identical passwords won t hash to the same hash value

13604327
hash	salt
he ll have to attack every other password foobar separately since they all hash to a different value thanks to the unique salt

13604327
hash	salt
if you need to have access to the hash and salt then an attacker who has access to the hash likely also has the same access to the salt

13604384
uiactivityindicatorview	viewdidload
you have declared the uiactivityindicatorview activityindicator in viewdidload method so it is local object only visible to this function you need to declare it in the header file or in class category in .m

i m looking for simple ones like strcpy atoi strstr that are not too complicated i m only a beginner but still require some thinking

13604743
min	max
you have the login times but i would take it and get the last login id too to simplify a re-join to the login activities table vs trying to do a join on user and date time field since i would expect a key on the primary key of id and not necessarily on member login_time -- however for this query using the min max on date grouped by member i would definitely have an index on member login_time for optimization

13604744
portrait	landscape
- the default project will support portrait and both landscape options but not upside down

13604753

13612186
width	height
one thing i noticed though is you re missing the width and height attributes on the rectangle which will cause them not to show

one clunky way to do it is to record the min max of x y axes for each plot and then iterate through each subplot once they re plotted and just their axes after they re plotted but there must be a better way in matplotlib

13612743

instead you simply download your preferred versions of the jars on artifactory nexus

13612983

the file post data is put into a urlrequest which is sent to the html page through a urlloader

13613607
teamcity	nant
your best bet is to research nant and make a simple task that will copy the teamcity artifact installer out to the specified location

13613607
teamcity	nant
all you would need to do is have teamcity execute the specified nant task after the installer has been built

13613617

13613693
hide	show
i am working on a spreadsheet table has collapsible rows so that you can hide show data by clicking on a small image

13613693
hide	show
i understand i could do this via ajax writing to the database every time a user clicks a button to show hide rows but not sure this is the best approach

13613693
hide	show
each hidden field corresponds to one of the show hide buttons

13613706
button	checkbox
even if it would be possible checkbox can t be styled freely on most browsers so they wouldn t look like button

13613878
getter	setter
i would really hate to create a 100 getter and setter

13613883

13613933
google-chrome	firefox
everything works well in google-chrome but in ie and firefox there are still some display errors

13613948

another option entirely is perhaps that the small-form for posting in that finduserinputviewmodel should have its own get action as well as post and then the user view can just call into it using html.action

13613975
children	parent
i used get_categories which eliminated the links and created my taxonomy hierarchy by only displaying the parent in the first loop and in the nested loop pulling out the children of that parent by retrieving the parent id

13614032
getter	setter	inherited	properties
what i ve thought of is to implement a class at the client that inherited from the data contract with collection properties overriden so the setter and getter methods call the service and get the actual collection items

13614033
int	boolean
using true as a value is a problem cause false boolean or an int is expected from your init function

my only guess is that the int w and int h are rounded off and they do not protray the actual width and height

13615865
width	height
when you specify or better yet so that you don t get messed up if t is changed to something besides true is a scaling such that the entire area of the histogram bars add to 1 since the width of your bars is quite a bit less than 1 the height need to be greater than 1 so that the areas all add to 1

13615867
free	malloc
more specifically if you change the size of the brk area from outside the malloc implementation you are very likely to corrupt malloc s internal data structures which will cause your program to crash the next time it uses malloc or free

13616035
width	margin
i must set this and i have to consider different monitors width when content is fixed to 900px and center margin auto

13616052
width	height
the result is a self-sizing label - it automatically changes its height to accommodate its contents no matter how its width changes assuming its width is changed by constraints layout

13616056
width	height
i used fill_parent on the height so it would scale and wrap_content on the width

13616056

13616211
pull	push
ability to smoothly work on a single plugin without being conflicted from peoples commits to other plugins don t need to pull changes in a separate plugin to push changes to the current plugin. ideally this would be more stringent such that developer of plugina cannot break anything in pluginb

13616245
getter	setter
otherwise you could also simply add the accounttype variable with getter and setter and simply create a new account and call a set method but i recommend using a constructor that accepts those values as parameters

accessor	properties
from what i understand you define an accessor properties on the number or string prototype before returning a number string

13616314
accessor	properties
arbitrarily changing accessor properties on the prototype of primitives are costly

13616314
accessor	properties
it should reduce collisions not sure how your code handled them does not change the accessor properties ones they re defined and is therefore more persistent though it might leak then

13617067

i have a feeling that i m missing something simple as to why it would work on firefox and not google-chrome but i can t figure out what it is

13617089
superclass	subclassing
the constructor in the subclassing is supposed to invoke the corresponding constructor in the superclass but such a constructor is not found in your code

maya	blender
a sphere is a complex enough object that you re probably not going to want to generate the vertices in code as you may have drawn the circle -- you ll want to use a program like blender or maya or houdini whatever you like to use to build a 3d object and then export it

13617240
vbo	normals

portrait	landscape
but when the parent allows e.g portrait and landscape then the next viewcontroller called by the navigation controller can limit to e.g portrait only

13617750

factors	matrix
another solution is to apply a scaling factors to your projection matrix which will produce the desired effect

google-chrome	firefox
right now it works perfectly with ie but i lose formatting when i open in in firefox or google-chrome

13631241
getter	setter
in design pattern terms separating your model objects into simple objects with getter and setter and process objects with process logic would be turning your domain model into an anemic domain model with transaction scripts

13631241
getter	setter
that kind of coupling is preferable to the kind of coupling you get from using getter and setter

13631241
getter	setter
once you expose implementation details getter and setter expose object internals which are implementation specific you can t change the implementation without side effects

for reference we are testing this kind of approach because we currently have an mvc3 site that is secured via forms authentication over https ssl and as per another one of my questions accessing a non-secure self-hosted signalr hub non https ssl from an mvc site under http ssl doesn t seem to work

13631409
width	height
this part works fine if i trace the width height values of the object but when you actually see the object it looks as it has been cropped instead of resized

when calling the web service the javascript in getwidgets uses the nonce as the key to hash some random data i d probably use the time formatted as a string and the data the user s id 12345 as the salt

13633288
hash	salt
i d then ensure the time that was sent was recent last 20 seconds limiting replay attacks and that when the server hash the time with the user id as salt with the nonce that it knows because it set it that it gets the same result

13633288
hash	hmac
so we ve used a shared key set by the server and sent to the client to act as the key for producing a hash message authorization code mac or hmac but also prevented replay attacks the mac will be different for each request and has a very short replay window and preventing session hijacking by not transferring any session information in cookies

13633288

when you are using width height in the element measures the dimension depending on it s parent element

13633726
width	height
if you apply some width and height to your parent element div

13647430
hide	show
the problem is that the immediate hide event doesn t seem to cancel the delayed show event if it happens to occur first

13647430
hide	show
in other words if the user points at the button and clicks it in less than 500ms the hide event triggers doing nothing and then the show event triggers at 500ms causing the tooltip to display even thought the button is no longer there and in the wrong position to boot since it can t position itself correctly without the button being visible

13648053
textview	imageview
i saw some codes regarding creating tablelayout with imageview in each cell dynamically but i can t find something about combining imageview and textview in each cell

13648089

you should use listview with custom adapter having imageview and textview in each row

13648098

13648533
hash	salt
the system adds a salt encrypts the password and stores the resulting password hash in the database

13648533
hash	salt
the system adds a salt encrypts the password and compares the generated password hash with the stored password hash

13648533
hash	md5
so if one system uses sha1 and another uses old expired md5 the only way you can get the password back into the system is to have the customer reenter the password so the new hash algorithm gets invoked and the new hash gets stored

13648553
folder	directory
on the contrary in arm ecosystem arm company itself just being an ip provider every vendor has slight to great differences between each other just check the sub directory names in arch folder starting with mach - that s for machine or plat - that s for platform

13648853
post	get
i get a your post does not have much context to explain the code sections

13648855
google-chrome	firefox
ive got a small script im using at firefox and google-chrome

13648887
invokerequired	begininvoke
you didn t post that code but it is basically the same idea -- test that invokerequired on the form then call begininvoke for the event handler itself

13648915
accessor	properties
the example you posted would require you to define an accessor for those properties - and that only works with modern js engines

13648920
msdeploy	webdeploy
if you do webdeploy package option from vs you ll get a zip with 4.5 in the archive.xml and if you try to manually import that vs outputted zip into iis directly you ll get the error popup with 4.0 vs 4.5 app pool error same as the one you get from running msbuild t package and msdeploy sync from command line

13648920
msdeploy	webdeploy
by the way re api docs yes they are practically nonexistent but i find the command line docs tolerable called webdeploy not msdeploy eg and others and mentally mapping those to dotpeek output helps a little

13648921
rss	feed
i m using this method to read rss feed from url

13648966
put	get
it s the largest datatype at 128 bits but it has the best precision of a floating type meaning you can expect to put any integer value in it divide by 10 7 and get the right answer

13648994
width	height
original height original width x new width new height

13649011
width	height
this is very effective at closing the gap with range media features like width and height since it essentially turns this into an either-or scenario

acs	adfs
i have an asp.net app that uses azure acs and indirectly adfs for authentication - which all works fine

13649055
hash	salt
thus it s so important to generate random salt for each password and store hash password and salt in user table or attached to user profile

when you want to validate user password it s enough to hash entered password with stored salt and compare with stored hash value

13649068
width	height
the view named wrapper should have clipping enabled and needs to have a value set for width and height

13649076

13649198
int	double
your int store1 and store2 will be automatically converted up to a double but you need to tell the compiler to cast the result back down to an int

fflush	gets
it should be the stream that gets fflush not the csvwriter

post	get
if i rename the create.vbhtml to index.vbhtml and commented the original index routing and rename both post and get create routing to index ajax works fine

13649269
jpql	hql
they are both very similar and in fact i think jpql has been heavily inspired by hql

jpql	hql
try activating this feature and play around with either jpql or hql and see what actually happends at the sql level

13649321

it would be possible to support this sort of structure in the python-cql driver in the plain execute call wherein the query interpolation is done on the python side but you wouldn t get any of the benefits of prepare queries and it wouldn t be much more than just

free	malloc
one trick is on device bootup to determine heap size by using malloc free with increasingly larger memory blocks until you find the limit

13650802
free	malloc
all bets are off if you allocate deallocate odd or large chunks of memory as malloc will fail if you happen to have enough free bytes of memory but not in a contiguous block

vim	emacs
i know there is already a plethora of vim emacs and solarized questions so i am a bit hesitant to add yet another but i can t seem to find any that address this exact issue

13651914
vim	emacs
the problem is that the same file looks very different in vim than it does in emacs when both editors are setup to use the solarized-dark theme

13651914
vim	emacs
and what i can t figure out is whether this is an issue with solarized or just a fundamental difference between vim and emacs

13651914
vim	emacs
here is a screenshot with vim on the left and emacs on the right

onfocus	onblur
the two events that you need are onfocus elemant has focus and can accept input and onblur which gets fired when leaving the element say a text box

13652086
hide	show
instead of tackling around with the initial problem my approach would be not to add a mouseout function to the .hover but rather to hide all show flyouts other then the one currently hovered on hover

qtreewidget	qdate
my app has a has a qtreewidget that takes a qdate in one of its columns

13652411
qstring	qdate
i ve found that the treewidget must use the actual qdate objects instead of qstring for the column sorting functionality to work correctly

13652411
qtreewidget	qdate
it is essential to keep everything in qdate format so i don t break the column sort function in the qtreewidget

13652411
qstring	qdate
here s my code that converts the qstring to a qdate nextitem is a qstringlist

13652425

btw i am not completely sure if this is a specific xjc feature or cxf wsdl2java feature

13652495
for-loop	loops
rather than a while loops i would just use a for-loop but you could do a with if you prefer while over for

13652510
width	height
another solution is to fit a box around the contour points there is a function to do this and check the width height ratio

the following type designates an unsigned integer type with the property that any valid pointer to void can be converted to this type then converted back to pointer to void and the result will compare equal to the original pointer

13652675
for-loop	loops
this script deletes everything but i can t figure out how to check the text file for the current folder in loops and skip to the next folder in the for-loop if the file is found in the text file

13652682
qtreeview	qabstractitemmodel
if you re set on using qtreeview in this way you will need to treat the line numbers as column data associated with each item in your data model presumably derived from qabstractitemmodel

13652759

this is within the method - mkannotationview mapview mkmapview mview viewforannotation id annotation

13652796
integer	unsigned
thus for example with 32-bit int the value -7 is represented as bitpattern number -7+2 32 2 32 -7 so that if you display the number that the bitpattern stands for as unsigned integer you get a pretty large number

try-catch	exception-handling
so from whichever method you call this method from you would either need to enclose the invocation in a try-catch block to handle this exception-handling or declare this exception-handling in the throws clause of that method also

13653398
try-catch	exception-handling
in general an exception-handling raised inside a method is - either handled there using try-catch block or is propagated up the stack trace to the immediate caller method but not both

the script takes the image does some checks max file size must be of image gif image png image jpg

13654142
min	max	width	height
max min width height checks

13654142
gif	png
if it implies that the image is indeed of type png jpg or gif the script downloads the file in case of a submitted url or moves the file in case of an uploaded image to the final image folder

13654142
width	height
combined with information 2 i could simply take the submitted image get the width height info create a new blank image with new_image_width submitted_image_width new_image_height submitted_image_height + watermark_height and store the submitted image with the watermark below it

13654142
gif	png

margin	height	width	margin	width	height
the canvas is styled to width and height of 100 and the body has a margin of 0

multiplying	transpose
i read in few tutorials the way you transform normals is you multiplying them with the transpose of the inverse of the modelview matrix

13654403
margin	height
or if you can t do that or it doesn t work try setting the height of the to more than is needed and set it s margin such that it will extend below the thereby covering the little bit that is peeking through

13654423
min	max
if s is small you can solve it with knapsack look for min sum c_i s and max sum c_i s

13654428
width	height
the img takes a width 100 so its height will be greater than browser window

13654430
hash	md5
you can t decrypt password in mysql because password is hash by using md5 hash algorithm which is not an encoding algorithm

13654467
width	height
the problem is you set the width and height of the style for the canvas

13654467
width	height
you need to set the width and height attributes not the css style

you must also set the width and height to a small enough size so all will fit with a space depending on your screen resolution

13655000
std	ostream
the reason that your example don t give you your desired answer is std ostream do not send every single output to the output instead it will cache data and only send it to output when its internal cache is full or when you call flush also std endl will call flush for you

google-chrome	firefox
personally i would suggest firefox - i find firebug invaluable i ve never been able to get along well with google-chrome s dev tools and it commands a reasonably high market share

13655127
google-chrome	safari
that said if you find google-chrome s dev tools good it may be better to use google-chrome as has already been said this covers you for google-chrome + safari which is about 35-40 browser share

it s important to understand that javascript is a client-side language meaning it runs in the user s browser and php is a server-side language meaning that it runs on your server

13655511
put	get
i tried get_line but from some reason it wouldn t actually wait for input before outputting the get put command and i also think it will just leave whatever was in the string before there and not fill it with white space

13655535
uiview	caanimation
i d suggest moving your views using uiview block animation uiview animatewithduration completion and it s relatives instead of using caanimation objects

on my system i noticed that google-chrome wrapped but ie and firefox did not

13655850
google-chrome	firefox
it throws an error access is denied and it happens only in ie i am using ie8 and works fine in firefox google-chrome

13655888
width	height
i think the issue stems from the css value of height 100 this menas that the width is calculated and not fixed to the actual image size hence the non integer value for width in pixels so in order to keep using this method of placing images you will have to use math.ceil or something of that nature when adding up the total width of the parent div

folder	directory
in my new yarn setup just running on single computer i have the logs directory but no logs userlogs folder

13656168

uilabel	uitextview
starting with ios 6 you can use a uilabel or a uitextfield or a uitextview to display an attributed string

13656570
width	height
2 instead of hardcoding the item sizes in -collectionview layout sizeforitematindexpath just divide the height or width of the collectionview s bounds by the number of cells you want to fit on screen

13656570
width	height
use the height if your collectionview scrolls horizontally or the width if it scrolls vertically

13656687
width	height
if you re styling multiple images within a list or table so that they lay out correctly then put the width height in your css to avoid the need to add another set of tags to every image in the list

13656748
children	parent
there can be any number of parent and any number of children

13656768
int	chars
remember these examples im giving are not correct because you dont pass the string representation of the number just the number so it would be a long int 1 long int 4 and then chars or unicode either way 4 chars

13656790
hbase	impala	hive	oozie

13656884
width	height
an img tag doesn t require the height and width parameters

13656884
width	height
if all the img tags on the page have their height and width specified you could pick the one that has the largest values

13656909
move	drag
the #pane shouldn t move when i touch it until i drag around it

13656927
int	chars
you are using this enum method to do something that can be done by simply converting the chars s numeric value to an int and then subtracting from the smallest chars a and adding one

13656927
int	chars
to convert a chars to an int you can use the following

13656927
int	chars
you can save these in an array you should create an array of the appropriate length that is the length of the input string and then when looping through each chars of the source string you save the int result in the right slot of the array

actually i am creating uitextfield programmatically and if user want then they can increase and decrease uitextfield s height and width by dragging its edges

13656981
width	height
i do not want to change its height and width proportionally

13656981
width	height
if user want height then only height changes and if width then only width

13656998
width	height
now as far as the problem you re getting that s because you re not being specific enough in your css with how you want things to be you have now width or height set you only have floats set to te student element so it s easy for it to do weird stuff

13656998
width	margin
the classroom is 308 pixels wide then student is 100 pixels wide with a left margin of 2 pixels so the 3 student frames each 100 pixels wide with 2 pixels margin on each totals up to a width of 306 pixels leaving 2 pixels to the right of the last student frame so it all adds up

13657020
nsnull	nsstring
what this will do for you is use return an nsdictionary which encodes the root object in the json and then each value in the dictionary will be of the type nsstring nsnumber nsarray nsdictionary or nsnull

cos	sin
your example meets neither qualification because you depend on sin and cos which are not constexpr functions and you require a loop which is not of the form return expression

13657611
width	height
the class used to flip the div doesn t work when attached to the actual div so i tried a p element inside the div with height and width set 100 and adding the flip class to that but now i can t nest headings inside there

for-loop	arrays
so i m pretty sure that there is an error occurring in the line above the for-loop and this is causing the arrays to try to take nil as a value

cpu	processors
remember that almost all instructions on the cpu executes as atomic if they not share data with another processors

13658118
cpu	processors
cpu usually supports some sort of methods to disable interrupts for example x86 processors provide two special instructions - cli disable interrupts and sti enable interrups

13658118
cpu	processors
if cpu doesn t provide such facilities interrupts usually can be disabled on side of interrupt controller too i belive that it is a case for different risc processors

13658170
explode	implode
you explode the string remove the elements and implode it back together

13658194
width	height
if you keep all of them the same with same left top width and height then you would achieve what you require

13658197
google-chrome	firefox
expire time set in firefox and google-chrome are different

for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
this is how you iterate on the elements of an arrays using a for-loop do not use a for...in loops on arrays if you ever get tempted

13658626
for-loop	loops
probably you dont have an element with that id and thats why it breaks the for-loop go try in the html part of your code where you initialize the names of the where you don t increment or decrement if you do it correctly in while of for or foreach loops maybe you are using the same i variable for 2 different loops or changing its value other than i++ or i--

a rss atom feed would probably be nice for this task as well

13658667
int	double
t can be int double string and i write one as below

13658778
equals	compareto
if you don t want them to be considered equals you need to make your compareto method differentiate between them by using name as a secondary sort order

13658778
equals	compareto
the documentation for treemap explains that if your compareto method is not consistent with your equals method which it s not you won t get normal map behaviour

13658778
comparator	comparable
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the map interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a sorted map performs all key comparisons using its comparator or compare method so two keys that are deemed equals by this method are from the standpoint of the sorted map equals

13658794
equals	compareto
your compareto method is not consistent with equals

13658796
equals	compareto
when the two weights are equals compareto need to examine the names

13658796
equals	compareto
this will make compareto consistent with equals the latter can now be rewritten in terms of the former

children	parent
parent should not know about their children

13659638

i think it would work if you change the width and height to wrap content instead of match_parent

13660988
width	height
the only somewhat portable way seems to be to use absolute values for the svg width height as in this example

13660988
width	height
using percentage width and height instead this is not working correctly in chrome which is probably another bug

13661006

uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i ve done this by using a regular uiviewcontroller with a tab bar at the bottom rather than using a uitabbarcontroller

13661356
int	double
this is required because currently its performing operations on int and resulting an int which is getting assigned to double

13661382
int	double
in your case the result is casted to double after the operation is performed so the int result is converted to double

13661382
int	double
it wouldn t work because the division is performed between int variables and then added with a double variable

13661409
comparator	comparable
along with that you must implement comparable interface and override comparator method in the class

13661416
put	get
i put an alert in the function and it does get called but the changes never show in the window

13661451

but i don t want to use mysql and trying to replace it with postgresql

13661672
division	modulo
the division and modulo operations are compile time operations not run time operations

13661672
integer	unsigned
one advantage of this approach over using a larger than 32-bit unsigned integer for the calculation is that it can be extended to work with bigger integersâ â â with 64-bit integers and uintmax_t integers â â by changing the constant from uint32_max to uint64_max or uintmax_max

13661676
innodb	myisam
i have problem between choosing mysql engine from this post i understood the difference between myisam and innodb

13661676
innodb	myisam
in my project there will be more reads than writes as shop goods will be viewed more than added so i need myisam but in the above script i have used innodb because it supports foreign key

vbo	vao
interleave in one vbo and access via vao

13661928
int	chars
however when i then convert the chars into an unsigned int

13661992
jobs	cron
this is better and preferable to cron jobs because if you setup a cron job to run every minute the lowest possible interval and the work you have to do takes longer than a minute another cron process will start working on the same queue and you could end up with quite a lot of duplicated task work that could cause a lot of issues that are hard to debug and troubleshoot

13661997
next	except
this would be fine except if i then type bn to get to the next buffer the bar stops being accurate

bufferedreader	printwriter
i have a socket program which is sending text data via printwriter out.write string str on the other side bufferedreader in.readline is receiving this

in theory md5 hash or uuids being 128 bits should stay within that range until about 820 billion documents

13662098
getter	setter
in java you have to use getter and setter because you cannot change your mind and change the public fields to getter and setter later on

13662098
getter	setter
in python you can so don t use getter and setter until you have an actual need to

13662121
move	drag
i have this class the plots a xylinechart and a line by left mouse click and drag chart move left right

13662167
width	height
the important part is really to make sure you don t write outside of your pixel buffer so watch out with negative offsets or offsets that would bring you out of the width or height

13662168
getter	setter
otherwise you can use setter getter but only if your design justifies it

13662183
hide	show
and you can see the step 1 content show but the step 3 content will not hide

13662183
hide	show
i have no idea how to make it work in both way mean show hide with button is clicked and the heading also

google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome the animation is an appropriate speed however in firefox it move very fast

if i change the to something smaller like then in firefox it looks correct however in google-chrome it animates very slow

13662253
geocoding	geocode
the geolocation data which you get is an address so bounds are very small you have to extract city with reverse geocoding results 6 .formatted_address and then you geocode that reverse geocode so confused though geocoding - reverse - again geocode and then it works

uitableview	uisearchbar
make the uisearchbar the header for the uitableview not a section

however when i try to put the user_id through a for-loop that iterates through json i get an error keyerror at 17800013 for the line

13662434
implements	extends
means that you can define spring beans dependencies without actually having to specify a bunch of elements in xml or implements an interface or extends a base class

13662434
implements	extends
similarly controller tells spring that the class specified contains methods that will handle http requests without you having to implements the controller interface or extends a subclass that implements the controller

13662440
getter	setter
it has a custom array adapter as another java file and a setter and getter class as another java file

13662580
printf	strcpy	strcpy	malloc
at some point you learn the c library calls printf strcpy malloc etc

post	get
i think the best way to get advice is to post sample code from my previous assignment to see how i handled things and how i need to handle things instead

13662639
int	chars
you re reading a string into an int you should use chars array instead

13662683

post	get
i want to get the latest post of every each user

13662773
getter	setter
having or not having getter and setter is your choice if other people are going to use your classes then encapsulation maybe a good thing because of information hiding principle

13662773
getter	setter
since we re talking about c++ don t forget the friend directive that allows fine grain encapsulation without the bother of having setter and getter even if it encourages coupling so there are two different schools of thinking here

13662781
jqgrid	jquery-ui-autocomplete
jqgrid edit for in form editing mode contains jquery-ui-autocomplete

13662786
getter	setter
i can t speak to the c++ syntax burden but in general object oriented terms you should supply getter and setter because other classes have no business knowing how you store your internal state including which properties are directly stored which are computed based on other state and which are devolved further to other objects

width	height
without knowing it s width height

scrypt	kdf
you re correct - the scrypt functions those two links are playing with are the scrypt file encryption utility not the underlying kdf

13663335
scrypt	salt
it then generates a 32 byte salt and then calls scrypt n r p salt pwd to create a 64 bytes key

13663335
scrypt	kdf
all in all what is needed is a nice hash format that can store scrypt and an implementation that exposes the underlying kdf and parameter-choosing algorithm

filepicker.convert fpfile width 200 height 200

13663409
google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to use ajax authentication in my app and i seem to have gotten it working except firefox does not seem to be sending the correct jessionid to the server in the cookie request header for subsequent requests whereas google-chrome does so just fine

when the user attempts to add data beyond this point i popup an alert with a nice reminder that the free versioning a limit and offer them the chance to upgrade

13663633
client-side	server-side
as javascript developers i think we are predominantly use to doing stuff client-side then we think of php asp as server-side tools

13663633
client-side	server-side
my understanding so far is that our gas code is actually running both client and server side at the very least it s calling server side functionality but it sure seems like there s more going on server-side than we realize and on the client-side this seems to result in somewhat compiled code

13663633
client-side	server-side
to specifically address your second question i personally think of the handler function onbtnclick as running on the server-side whereas the tags you refer to and most of the doget would be in the browser s engine on the client-side

13663633
client-side	server-side
from a programming perspective there is a lot of stuff available in the scope of your client-side doget function that you probably would never want to pass to the server or there may be functions in the scope of the server-side doclick with the same name as functions on the client-side but they may actually be calls to totally different library functions maybe even on totally different hardware even though from the developer s perspective they work the same way

13663677
google-chrome	firefox
this is the method by which firefox and google-chrome do webgl on windows

13663711
width	height
for example if the user is saving 10 images taken with the camera i d like them to come to a smaller file size while keeping most of the quality and the same width and height of the original image

13663720
post	get
considering the changes you made on the post you would get

13663723
int	double
because this is an int divided by a double the compiler handles this by converting the int into a double

13663723
int	double
this is an int added to a double so it converts the int to a double and adds resulting in a double

13663723
int	double
this is an int plus a double so c++ converts the int to a double and the result is a double

13663723
int	double
usually integer-like numbers short int long are promoted to floating-point equivalents float double

13663761
jboss	glassfish
jboss and glassfish are open source application servers and solve exactly the problems that you are looking at

key to bug catcher s suggestion about creating a zombie is fork a process without cleaning up after it exits failing to call waitpid

13664227
ansible	puppet
the biggest advantage of ansible over technologies like puppet is that this is agent-less

13664252
mouse	keyboard
i have added a mouse listener to show it up and i have also registed a keyboard action with the key event keyevent.vk_context_menu that brings it up as well

13664252
mouse	keyboard
in fact it can be operated only with the mouse which takes the stinger from my wish to operate my system using the keyboard only...

13664404
getter	setter
generate getter and setter

13664404
getter	setter
i guess groovy would give me a resolution to number 3 - as it will generate automatic getter and setter but i don t want to add anything new to my learning curve for a quick project

13664466
post	get
but then it doesn t get post for any other categories

13664474
pull	push
so when i do a push pull the repo would be backed up with all my comments but only what is in the active directory tree within the flash drive would be saved in the git repository

13664478
int	chars
my other try was to use an struct with explicit layout and same fieldoffset for int and chars but it doesn t work either

13664544
post	get
this is my first post to so so i ll get right to it

13664561
portrait	landscape
when programming for flex mobile landscape and portrait orientation often need to be states in order to easily define whether a control component element is in visible dis en abled or shaded with certain colors

13664561
hide	show
but you also need to show hide color other controls when you change your phone s orientation

13664561
portrait	landscape
in real life your credit state really is sufficientcredit but your app is now in either the portrait or landscape state

freebsd	solaris
if you have dtrace available solaris os x freebsd this simple dtrace script would easily detect the mystery process

13664748
for-loop	loops
note i can do it easily using a foreach loops but i want it without using a foreach or for-loop

13664778
int	chars
i ve used esi before without problem but for whatever reason when the program gets to the point where the contents of esi or the address of the string are to be evaluated and converted to an int debugger is showing that the contents of esi are not the first chars in the string

13664778
int	chars
split each chars off the string and subtract by 48d to get the int

13664821
folder	directory
wanted a female voice so i grabbed us1 and put the whole folder into the same directory as

13664877
background-position	background-size
make all background images 1 or 2 px bigger cut them so they contain a 1 px duplicate of the graphics above below and use css background-size and background-position to ensure that the extra unwanted pixel is not shown - it will then only be used if the browser needs that extra pixel to cover the rendering gap

13664926
for-loop	arrays
while debugging the for-loop inside the thread it appears the current item is always the same so the iterator is not advancing and or being reset by a subsequent request so i always 0 or if use a for game g _games then g is always the 1st item in the arrays

13665175
prepare	execute
you need to execute the prepare statement

13665222
std	ostream
the important thing is that it is possible to create a custom destination or source for iostreams and that it does not involve any attempt to inherit from std ostream

13665222
ostream	istream	std	ostream
the only reason to inherit from std ostream or std istream is to make the initialization of a stream with a custom stream buffer easier

13665242
pull	push
i changed it to two requests with different urls - push and pull

13665246

hide	show
startanimation sets an interval timer that hide the old frame increases the frame by one and show the new frame every 50ms

13665312
jobs	cron
i ve been reading about cron jobs but my concern is that since they are scheduled jobs there are no convenient times to schedule the jobs so that they get processed efficiently

13665341
jobs	cron
you should reconsider using cron scheduling you can run jobs at very fast intervals

13665348
hide	show
if you decide not to use ajax just pre-load the comments and other things show and hide them according to which slide you are on

13665386
ssl	https
ok the overhead for https is not trivial but if its really important to have ssl for some things i suggest just making it all ssl

13665418
packets	multicast
when i host a lan game on a computer win7 for aoe2 wireshark shows my computer sending a couple packets via ssdp protocol to the multicast address 239.255.255.250

13665418
packets	multicast
i think i need to get the application windows7 to send the packets as something like a broadcast or i need to get the router to broadcast packets going to that multicast address

13665500
folder	directory
now this code does not throw any errors but it does not create the folder either unless i provide a physical directory starting from the letter of the drive.example

13665533
hide	show
i have an ordered list which when each item is clicked it will toggle show hide a corresponding div however i am really unsure of how to do this in a mannor that works best

13665563
int	chars
the comparison operator is the operator but this will compare either primitive types int chars float etc either references to objects that is not the usual behavior you need

13665600
min	max
then from your description it sounds like you just want the min and max along each coordinate axis

13665606
getter	setter	equals	tostring	tostring	getter
in the drop-down below you can see the code generation options for the default constructor equals hashcode tostring and the two getter setter pairs

google-chrome	firefox
the login works fine in google-chrome and firefox but not for ie9

13665623
google-chrome	firefox
the same set-cookie is being sent to google-chrome or firefox and as expected they send the workgroup_session_id on the next request and everyone s happy

13665656
width	height
the uistepper control itself has a 97 point width and 27 point height

13665666
tabcontrol	tabitem
then in the ontabfocused event handler we need to bring the bottom-most tabcontrol to the front when the user clicks a tabitem

13665669
strlen	strtok
i am required to allocate their size during runtime by using strlen with the strtok pointer.

13665669
strlen	strtok
the issue is that if i use strtok with strlen to find out the name s length the original data_line is already broken up

13665679
min	max
i ve used the manual page on mt_rand but i just don t get how the example makes any sense i guess this is two parts what defines the min and max if mt_rand 5 15 can return 1604716014 i suppose its not limited between 5-15

13665690
hide	show
the activity starts off with the listview hidden and the progress indicator show and i hide one and show the other when necessary

13665709
uiview	subviews
suppose you ve a mkmapview called mapview and a mapfilterview subclassed from uiview called mapfilterview both of them are subviews of mainview except the layer mapfilterview is on mapview

13665744
domxpath	domdocument
it would be trivial to run through a nodelist of anchors using domxpath and domdocument

13665790
strlen	strtok
using strlen is still appropriate as is using strtok with multiple separator characters

13665790
strdup	malloc	strcpy	strdup	strcpy	malloc
edit 2 rather than using malloc and strcpy strdup accomplishes both and would be preferable

13665819

i assume i could try adding to python s cp437.py figured that from the error but i m not sure how do get the hexidecimal decimal whatever for each symbol and where to put it

13665827
mouse	keyboard
this library allows you to tap keyboard and mouse and to detect and

13665842
uiview	subviews
suppose i have a uiview parentview and a subviews childview that is rotated at some unknown angle relative to parentview

13665845
int	chars
you can use chr from the module chars to convert the int values to chars

13665846
int	double
for example if a library contains a function f that takes a double as argument and the source file contains the code f 7 the compiler needs to know that there is a function called f and that it expects a double as argument so the compiler can generate code that converts the int 7 to a double before actually calling the function f

13665847
int	chars
you can combine map that applies a function to each element of a list and the chr function that convert an int value to its chars equivalent

13665850
int	chars
you can convert an int code point to a chars using

13665891
notepad++	sublimetext
if you do not have an editor that allows that get one such as sublimetext or notepad++

13665901
for-loop	loops
as i mentioned earlier i am not getting the real reason of using the for-loop as it s not going to loops at all because of the return statement inside

13665909
put	get	post	get	post	put
currently i support put and get but not post

13665929
post	put
for example allow post or if there are multiple choices allow post put

13665932
width	height
i have been using these equations to calculate the width and height of the far plane

13665932
width	height
hfar being the height of the far plane wfar being the width and ratio being the ratio of the view port width divided by the height

13665962
typhoeus	vcr
vcr can hook directly into typhoeus since it provides good public apis for doing so if you configure it

13666027
doc	rtf
as you can see i also need the app to be able to export to doc html and rtf

13666032
openmpi	mpich
both mpich and openmpi show the same problems

13666084
width	height
your image is 674x194 make your width and height attributes match respectively and it will not stretch the image

w and h stand for width and height

13666113
hide	show
i m trying to show hide a div depending upon the open close state of one of my accordion divs

13666146
stdout	fflush
you ll either need to explicitly fflush stdout or put an newline character at the end of your first printf statement in order to force the buffer to fflush

13666153
int	chars
split each chars off the string and subtract by 48d to get the int

13666154
int	chars
if mysql is allowing a set of chars go into the database that is not an int like a phone number even though i would never use an int for a phone number then your column is set up wrong

13666204
folder	directory
the same location might be for instance a folder on your computer a directory on a web server or inside a .jar file

13666215
folder	directory
but putting .nomedia file in folder and .foldername usage will hide all media files in a directory

13666256
versioning	upgrade
you ll have to use older versioning of libcudart.so or upgrade your system

13666261
children	parent	quicksort	mergesort
i m trying to create a mergesort an array of 800 ints using a system of recursive forks so that each of the bottom-most children 8 total quicksort 100 each then pass the array back up to their respective parent processes to be merge sorted and passed up again

13666261
children	parent
for some reason the function hangs after the first set of bottom-most children finish writing to their parent process

width	height
you are incrementing only one in x and y coordinates for each picturebox and its should be greater or equal to width and height of pictureobx

13666439
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
because of the cross browser issues i was able to rebuild the page to support various features i was looking for to work using javascript html and jquery that works across google-chrome ie safari and firefox

13666454
for-loop	arrays
i need to basically write a for-loop that can go across this arrays and give me an arrays that contains all the distinct words

13666464
int	double
however in java you can add double or int with string easily and in c++ you cannot i ve tried multiple things for the query in c++ but it isn t working like i think it should

13666470
division	modulo
when you get to the end of the key go back to index 0 this is done by using the remainder of the division by the size of the key aka modulo

13666482
printf	getchar
the solution i was able to find to somehow get away with this issue was to add a getchar right after the first printf call

13666506
quicksort	shellsort
i also tried using shellsort besides this quicksort but it doesn t seems to help

13666637
google-chrome	safari
here s the problem which i am facing - while running the animation on the google-chrome and safari i am getting double sound which is annoying

13666637
mp3	wav	mp3	ogg	wav	ogg
i have discovered on internet that google chrome supports mp3 ogg wav formats for the audio

13666637
mp3	ogg
i have connected the two formats with animation using j-query which are mp3 and ogg format

13666687
post	get
i ended up resolving the issue by changing the get request to post and everything functions as desired

13666687
post	get
post the problem i described only occurs with get requests

13666688
google-chrome	safari
with google-chrome 23.0.1271.95 m and ios6.0 safari the items present on the right and the bottom part of this div do not appear after scaling

in my current situation i was hoping to have a canvas that is set via css to be 100 width and height of its parent

13666758
width	height
i want a script to adjust the canvas s width and height properties when its offsetwidth or clientwidth changed this is for webgl where the width and height properties affect the framebuffer resolution

this is because calling e may yield an infinite recursion there are other issues such as operator-precedence as well as associativity .

13666921
post	get
your form action is set to post and your checked.php is looking for get values

13666960
valgrind	glibc
malloc_check_ is internal to glibc and like most other memory debug instrumentation tools that aren t valgrind it can only catch certain types of relatively common errors and detect heap corruption in some cases

13666960
free	malloc
there are a host of other tools like malloc_check_ out there such as electric fence but the former is already built into your c library and the others will at best require that their library which contains malloc and free overrides mainly be dynamically linked ahead of the c library with the use of ld_preload

13666965
spaces	linefeed
cr linefeed and various amounts of spaces are all treated identically as

13666965
spaces	linefeed
one spaces three spaces 2 linefeed a tab - no

mousemove	mouseenter
i came across this jquery example of animating a div to the left or right depending on position of the mouse on mouseenter or mousemove

13675658
outputstream	inputstream
i test your code i find that in your startserver function you don t create an outputstream and inputstream

13675658
bufferedreader	bufferedwriter
modify your startclient function like this create two global variables bufferedwriter bw and bufferedreader br because we need it in your actionperformed function

free	malloc
no malloc without a matching free

public	protected
i know it has to do with protection levels somewhere and i keep switching things from public to protected or private but it isn t fixing anything

13675798
public	protected
pretty sure it is because you are changing a public method to protected in the subclass

13675802
post	put
well to know which file has been uploaded to the server you need either to add field in your ajax post request of your jquery uploader with the filename you want on your server side when it registers it or you can identify files by their user id and you can use _session vars to recognise the file on the other side according that the script knows what picture type it should receive and put it into the right folders

13675830
public	protected
you have declared speak method as a public method and then you are inheriting it and making in protected

if you design your site using best practices css sprites apache versus nginx will not make a considerable difference in load times if you utilize a cdn and best practices caching gzip etc

13676075
children	parent
the goal is to remove the 3rd entry 3 apple ... and then update and merge the parent and children references in the other remaining elements

13676114
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
instead you could store the first line of the file as an integer and then enter a for-loop where you loops over the rest of the lines of the file storing them in arrays

13676121
google-chrome	firefox
this works great in google-chrome firefox and provides a linear gradient for the entire table row

13676209
google-chrome	firefox
seems to work look good in ie7 and google-chrome not tested in firefox

13676235
google-chrome	firefox
when if comes to js we all know that ie is very picky and firefox can be the same way - google-chrome tends to be forgiving with the small stuff but it s always worth a good look at your code in a js linter of some sort just to be safe

13676260
children	parent
as far as i understood you only need to group all elements by the name then choose the lowest id and join children and parent

13676263
post	get
i got the answer from this post jquery get mouse position within an element

coming from a struts2 background i can reuse the same action for both methods but have a get point to a input method whereas a post would point to a execute method

13676895

13677304
hash	md5
i have 7 files that i m generating md5 hash for

13677304
hash	md5

13677323
listview	gridview
baseadapter is a great choice for simply using listview or gridview

13677323
listview	gridview
so a simplecursoradapter would be the other type you d use if you want both listview and gridview usage when pertaining to showing data you get from a database

13677388
listview	gridview
it tells listview gridview or etc that how many items to display

13677411

from a performance perspective you may want to test if bufferedinputstream outputstream offer any advantage here

13677461
flask	web.py	flask	django	django	web.py	bottle	flask	web.py	bottle
for python web development as a starter you should pick a web development framework django flask bottle if you are scared of django i suggest you try to look at web.py bottle they are very simiple and easy to catch up and you will learn basic web develpment skills know the workflow interacting etc

13677503
bugsense	acra
alternatively post an event to an error logging service bugsense acra etc

13677538

you can use attr to change the src like this

13677549
hide	show
overlap the buttons and hide reset button and toggle to show the other button when one is clicked

13677567

13677641
google-chrome	firefox
it only happened when i clicked four icons home sql question mark and other sql icon from left side of phpmyadmin btw it totally fine in google-chrome browser version 17.0.963.2 but not ok in firefox 16.0.2 and phpmyadmin version is 3.3.9

13677828
mouseup	mousedown
but you will have to handle click with mousedown or mouseup as textblock does not have click event

13677834
qiodevice	qdatastream
i guess one solution would be to make a custom qiodevice that uses libuv internally which can then be used with qdatastream but not sure where to start

13677836
width	height
reading between the lines i think your issue is that debug.print height and debug.print width is printing the size of your form

13677836
width	height
this will happen if your declarations are in a module rather than the form class because height and width are keywords applicable to the form so the local versions are used in preference

13677836
width	height
btw using dim height width i as integer declares declares height and width as the default type which is variant

13677848
hash	md5
generate the 7 md5 hash which is what you are doing now and then

13677848
hash	md5
combine these 7 hash outputs into a larger byte array and md5 hash that to produce an overall hash

13677848
hash	md5
each md5 hash is 16 bytes so you will end up with a 112 byte array which you will hash to get the overall hash

13677850
jtable	jinternalframe
i am using a jinternalframe in that i have added jtable

13677911
versioning	upgrade
jquery 1.8.2 might be incompatible with jquery mobile 1.0b2.so you might have to upgrade to the latest versioning of jquery mobile.here is your fiddle with jquery mobile 1.2 used instead of 1.0b2

13677955
getter	setter
unrelated to the concrete problem it is more preferable to use getter setter methods when pointing to a value in your backing bean

13677955
getter	setter
in general an appropriate getter setter should looks like in your case

13677995
put	get
i got it working and can drag the boxes around and reorder and resize them...my issue now is how to get it to expand horizontal instead of vertically..the more stuff i put into it they all go to the bottom

waitpid	fork
you could also directly use low-level process related syscalls like fork 2 pipe 2 dup2 2 execve 2 poll 2 waitpid 2 etc..

13678530
width	height
so the default window size is 250px height and 350px width

13678530
width	height
increase height decrease height increase width and decrease width

13678596
getter	setter
and generate getter and setter of that customer class

13678626
for-loop	arrays
the window arrays is defined as an attribute while for the first one the window arrays is defined inside the method and the for-loop

13678644
width	height
you cannot change the width height of the window object but you can change the width and height of the body element

13678653
inherited	properties
you should use inherited here defining a event class with only the base properties

13678717
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari fail silently leaving you no feedback and no way to end invalid objects

13678717
google-chrome	safari
this allows google-chrome and safari to eliminate closed connections when no messages are being processed and allows the control tab to change

13678717
setinterval	settimeout
so as you can see a combination of callbacks for delivery confirmation settimeout and setinterval must be used from both ends to maintain knowledge of connectivity

13678718
int	chars
the values in bar with a length of exactly 4 chars are int

13678731
pull	push
pushing all branches back again seems the easiest solution as in set up git to pull and push all branches

13678822
google-chrome	firefox
it works at firefox but not at google-chrome

13678822
button	checkbox
when submit button is enter a list of dates checkbox and a select all checkbox is shown

13678822
google-chrome	firefox
firefox definitely can work but not at google-chrome

13678853
hash	md5
hash is your custom md5 hasher instance

13678853
hash	md5
what you want to do is to have your md5 hasher calculate the hash and then compare it to the result value you can extract form the resultset

13678882
hide	show
try this on click of minus hide the closest row and keep one td to show hidden messages

13678882
hide	show
and on click of undo hide message td and show the row

13678931
versioning	upgrade
i have a power builder - 11.5 versioning installed and i can t upgrade to 12.0

13678946
google-chrome	safari
the reason for this is because the google-chrome developers aim to keep google-chrome inline with safari the other major webkit user

13678952
folder	directory
in my proj3 directory i have a folder gui and a folder foo

13678958
pull	push
i prefer git pull --rebase to linearaize the changes before running git push

13678965
pop-up	dialog
on successful pop-up window using jquery dialog or any other moal dialog plugin

13678969
button	checkbox
when i am going to click a button like lucky dip it has to select 6 random checkbox automatically

13678971
min	max
i suppose that in case i have enough time to proccess each number the easiest solution is to simply keep min and max values in a separate variables but what is the best approach if i m unable to proccess every single one of them

13678972
google-chrome	firefox
i m using knockout on a relatively simple portfolio site and while it s working like a charm in google-chrome firefox etc it s not working correctly in ie or rather i ve checked it in ie9 and it s not working there

13678975
rbac	acl
provide acl or rbac functionality

13678986
for-loop	loops
at that point the 2nd for-loop will count and your condition will be which equals 235 which satisfies the condition in loops and you re saying filearray.get s which means filearray.get 235 and you re getting a indexoutofboundsexception

13678994
put	get
if you get the text from some web source you might have to encode it to utf-8 and then put it in the textview

13679048
min	max
depending on your input data a probabilistic min max may be accurate enough

13679048
min	max
so if you only look at every number with 50 chance then you probably have only a 50 of having the exact min or max

13679048
min	max
however computing the random number to do an unbiased sampling is already more expensive than looking at all numbers for min max

13679087
goto	break
however unlike a c++ guard class it is very error-prone because unlock_something will not trigger if the block is exited with return goto or break

13679100
post	put
don t put data straight from post to db

13679151
google-chrome	firefox
i ve removed this error by using google-chrome instead of firefox and used curb protocol

13679224
int	double
when exporting dll functions it s best if they accept only integral data types int or pointers not sure about float and double

13679226
for-loop	loops
you can put this concept to action with multiple loops by modifying and filtering query vars by altering loops or by checking for-loop status inside loops or even with get_posts - all that with any condition that you want

13679287
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops

i ve a design for application which contains buttons similar in style but different in width and height

13679863
box-sizing	border-box
i have a form with a text-input i gave that text-input the css-property box-sizing border-box

13679863
box-sizing	border-box	width	border-box
according to all documentation i can find about border-box ie8 is supposed to support this value for box-sizing and is in fact the way ie8 renders box-model in quirks-mode and should always keep this input at 100 width despite it having a padding on the left

13679866
width	height
an alternative would be to check image width and height on client side using a tool like plupload or a similar one

13679932
vbscript	vba
the idea of adapting vba code to vbscript wouldn t work because vba itself doesn t even work

but when you pass an object to it behaves exactly like a for...in iterating over inherited properties as well

13688366

when you use containskey in dictionary the indexer or one of a number of other methods for finding a key you first hash the key using gethashcode and then it only uses equals to find which of the hopefully very few objects are identical within that bucket

13689609
equals	gethashcode
it s very important that when using objects as keys in a dictionary any two objects for which equals returns true must also return the same integer for gethashcode

13689634
hide	show
the show hide of fields is more complicated you will need to show hide the items using

13689671
portrait	landscape
i succeed to launch the application in landscape mode but splash is still appearing in portrait mode

13689688
equals	gethashcode
to use your type as a dictionary key you should override two methods gethashcode and equals

13689688
equals	gethashcode
consider following two types mytype1 that not overrides gethashcode and equals and mytype2 that do

13689708
free	malloc
the result of free -ing a pointer more than once is up to the underlying implementation of malloc

13689708
free	malloc
the result could be a crash and core dump or it could corrupt the malloc arena fouling up future allocations deallocations or it could ignore the double free entirely

13689722
portrait	landscape
just because you perceive it as landscape doesn t mean it s actually not rotated portrait

13689804
post	get
i feel like this has something to do with the form submissions that initially call this controller being done via post action whereas it seems to work fine with the get on page refresh

13689804
post	get
i just can t figure out how to either get the content to respond properly when the controller is called via post or how to submit the form without posting the data

i also tried changing from a string to a double but then realized that if i put any int or double into where 2 but i get the same error

13690005
post	get
i m not sure i fully understand your question but generally speaking you should not use the same action for post and get

13690005
post	get
see the following post for more information and examples of how to perform ajax get requests using jquery

13690005
post	get
regardless of what you are trying to do it is very good practice that post calls perform some action and then redirect to a get action which returns to the user

13690017
int	double
-it ll always be a int within double brackets

13690065
modifiers	sealed
structs are implicitly sealed so you can t create descendants any way and protected modifiers means that only instance of this type and all instances of derived types has access to it

13690072

n-gram	words
while an n-gram model makes sense for dictionary words it doesn t work as well for names the people bob ruzatoxg and joe ruzatoxg have a lot of rare trigrams in common since they have the same rare last name

13690219
stdout	stderr
one possibility would be to spawn the child process with popen so its output will come back to the parent to be processed displayed if desired or else completely ignored create your popen object with stdout pipe and stderr pipe to be able to retrieve the output from the child

13690233

multicastdelegate	delegation
while it s possible to decompose a multicastdelegate into a list of method pointers and targets it would be easier to use some other data type like an to hold the event list and not bother making any multicast delegation

13691121
single-quotes	double-quotes
single-quotes and double-quotes mean different things in shell strong quoting vs

13691188
int	double
also note that your output array is a double array but you will lose precision in your data as the arguments are int arrays and int division works very differently to floating point division - the result of an int divided by an int is another int not a double

13691188
int	double
to get the behaviour you want you should cast the numerator or denominator to a double not the result as this simply casts the int result after the int division has taken place

13691188
int	double
or you could casting denominator to double instead - or even both in order to prevent errors with int division

13691210
width	height
you might want to alter the and calls to use a containing div if you ve set a static width or height for your document

13691251

for-loop	loops
instead you can wrap a while loops inside a for-loop inside a nice neat function

13691254
for-loop	loops
utilizing other programing langues such as python you could create a for-loop and loops through the variables

13691787
nsstring	nsxmlparser
i get the nsstring from nsxmlparser

13691800
loops	if-statement
using the above if-statement you are not letting the inner loops to get terminated because everytime the column value reaches the dead-end you are resetting it to 0 and hence the terminating condition of inner loops will always be true and also you are increasing the row value continuously which will gradually result arrayindexoutofbounds

13691801

13691830
post	get
i think the best and most apple-like way to get that info is to use system configuration framework - the links in the post above in this thread pointed me in that direction but didn t really give much detail as to how to use it and i didn t find the apple documentation on it very useful at least taking into consideration my skill level

13691831
int	boolean	int	double
i have implicit wrappers for type int double string boolean and date

can be used interchangeably on row or column groups just set height to 0 instead of width

13692100
dictionary	map
in that case make it a separate identity class or so and use a dictionary to map identity instances to peer ids

13692110
rss	feed
maybe the full article should be read from its own link not from the abridged rss feed

13692110

you can also use the debug log logcat to check the before after of html-parsing your rss feed content.

13692124
getter	setter
some argue that if you have getter setter accessors you might as well make the member public

13692124
getter	setter
others argue it s better to have getter setter accessors because it allows you to enforce invariants constraints or change various implementation details

i have a library of md5 hash of public keys used to sign various jars and a mapping to their respective keystores which we use to sign different apks

13692917

you could even create your own custom getter and setter for it for more easy uses

13693732
hide	show
i have written a piece of jquery that hide show a specified element when a drop down option s is selected

13693734
put	get
so to me it seems that even the collection literals won t make it into jdk 8 let alone the get set put operators

13693816
ord	chr
the only slightly relevant parts are chr and ord and the trick of ord end -ord begin abs ord end -ord begin to get -1 if begin end though.

13693828
post	get
so just switch your code to use post instead of get

13693854
min	max
the size of the data is large so i can t do something like getting all and using min and max for display

13693890
gridview	rowdatabound

13693987
versioning	upgrade
however the generator will use the newest versioning of the client library so if that s upgrade in the background the dependencies might need to be upgrade as well

13693995
folder	directory
i m thinking that if you are creating a batch script that relies on the current directory being set to the folder that contains the batch file that you are setting yourself up for trouble when you try to execute the batch file using a fully qualified path as you would from a scheduler

int	chars
i am currently trying to determine which int i am at using the space chars as a guide but i am having problems

13694091
int	double
if we restrict consideration to the traditional ieee-754-style representation of floating-point types then you can expect this conversion to be value-preserving if and only if the mantissa of the type double has as many bits as there are non-sign bits in type int

13694091
int	double
mantissa of a classic ieee-754 double type is 53-bit wide including the implied leading bit which means that you can represent int in range precisely

13694091
int	double
so it all depends on how wide your int is compared to your double

13694091
int	double
with 32-bit int and ieee-754 double the equality should hold

13694111
queue	fifo
stacks and queue are both types of lists that provide specific often limited behavior for adding and removing elements stacks being lifo queue being fifo

13694111
lisp	scheme
this naming scheme holds true for all programming languages that i know of including python c++ java c# and lisp in which lists not keeping their order would be particularly catastrophic

13694116
queue	fifo
i know how to do that i m only interested to know whether there s a unix api that would grant an exclusive lock while at the same time putting the requesting processes in a queue that is processed in a fifo manner

13694133
google-chrome	firefox
i tested on google-chrome firefox by changing the language to french

13694148

maven	pom.xml
edit for example maven configuration is as simple as ok i m not including some of the other boiler plate pom.xml decalarations..

13694439
put	get
the fact that you did try to put together a minimal reproducible example suggests that you are keen to get it right but probably need to do a bit more thinking before posting

13694450
int	chars
the return value from getc and its relatives is an int not a chars

13694450
int	chars
the reason that getc et al return an int is that they have to return every possible value that can fit in a chars and also a distinct value eof

13694450
int	chars
next chars is present the fgetc function obtains that chars as an unsigned chars converted to an int .

13694450
getchar	fgetc
similar wording applies to the getc function and the getchar function they are defined to behave like the fgetc function except that if getc is implemented as a macro it may take liberties with the file stream argument that are not normally granted to standard macros â specifically the stream argument expression may be evaluated more than once so calling getc with side-effects getc fp++ is very silly but change to fgetc and it would be safe but still eccentric

13694450
fgets	fread
you should be checking the other calls to fgets getc fread to make sure you are getting what you expect as input

13694483
mouse	keyboard
swing is an event driven environment this includes but is not limited to keyboard mouse and paint events

13694498

13694499
dlsym	dlopen
incorporating dlopen dlsym gets your something like

13694512
int	chars
that s why getc returns int rather than chars because a 257th distinct value for eof wouldn t fit into a chars

13694547
subtract	add
let s add a and subtract 1 from b until

13694556

put	get	post	get	post	put
for example if you had a wadl that specifies post put get delete operations resources will be created for these calls

13696229
nsxmlparser	nsurlconnection
the foundcharacters method of nsxmlparserdelegate protocol seems so analogous to the nsurlconnectiondelegate method didreceivedata that i was sure that nsxmlparser was going to handle the stream just like nsurlconnection does namely returning information as the download was in progress

13697095
disk	ram
they take significant time to compile c++ code to optimized binary so you should generate to some file foo.cc perhaps in a ram file system like some tmpfs but that would give a minor gain since most of the time is spent inside g++ or clang++ optimization passes not reading from disk then compile that foo.cc to foo.so using perhaps make or at least forking g++ -wall -shared -o2 foo.cc -o foo.so perhaps with additional libraries

jradiobutton	jmenuitem
the thing is that java does not support multiple inheritance otherwise you could have considered having jradiobuttonmenuitem extending both jmenuitem and jradiobutton although it is not clear if it would have been a good implementation choice

13703825
jradiobutton	jmenuitem
now if you take a look you see that jmenuitem and jradiobutton have a common ancestor which is abstractbutton which actually encapsulates a buttonmodel where everything related to the current state of a button is stored armed selected etc...

13704257
helpers	actioncontroller
the real problem was that testcontroller was subclassed from actioncontroller base before actioncontroller base is extended with the route helpers methods

13704261
children	parent
in that case you may also implement it with inherited styles - you call setstyle credit insufficient in parent component and all children that know about those styles will change their representation accordingly

13704306

i m not 100 sure that the margin is what is causing the line height issues you may want to try changing height padding etc

consider an example with a server-side template generating a client-side web-page view which should be aware of server-side model parameters so that they can be send back to server

13704569
width	height
what you have to consider is the height and the width of the object

13704569
width	height
if you can set the height and width 100px in this example then you need to push it 50 in from the left of the screen border and from the top 50

13704569
width	height
when you do this it sets the box s top left corner on that 50 50 point so you then need to pull it up and left a little half the height and width of the box

13704569
width	height
the padding and border all add to the width and height of the object

13704576

13704859
width	height
the width of each div can be 200px with no limit on height

13704882
width	height
if you want something like a view with some image that you want to control in sense of changing the position and rotation you might want to create a square vertex buffer with values from -1 to 1 in both dimensions or -width 2 -height 2 to width 2 height 2

13704882
width	height
as for the whole process of drawing in this case if you want the origin to be at x y z with a width height and rotated by angle here is the sequence

13704882
width	height
so another way is to construct a matrix directly from base vectors with little math you can compute all 4 points of your square view based on parameters such as origin width height and rotation

13704948
mouseleave	mouseenter
i tried with setinterval mouseenter mouseleave hover function cleartimeout and many other options and functions but nothing

i like the geolocation code i have for both pages and the autofill but i don t know how to work the directions service and the custom infowindow like i have on new13 you have to accept geolocation at this point to see how the infowindow looks

13705177
directions	infowindow
at the end of the day what i need is a watchposition type of geolocation that updates as the user moves a custom infowindow that allows you to get directions from the users current position to the fusion table marker and an auto filter for the fusion table that will filter only the requested marker on the table

accessor	properties
note that this requires a getter called faceitemeyesfrightened to be defined which is usually this case if you re using properties and didn t change the name of the accessor

13705651
put	get
then instead of using lots of variables like faceitemeyesfrightened or faceitemeyeshappy you could put all of them in a simple array and then get one of them like this

13705655
for-loop	arrays
the for-loop is to take each string in that arrays and check it

13706258
put	get
but i want to pass the exact same syntax that i would put in the square brackets that would get used with __getitem__

scrollable	panels
buttons work as long as the datagrid fits in the screen but as soon as it becomes scrollable it would seem that the scroll panels is absorbing all the inputs and the click event never reaches the button

13706491
scrollable	panels
i m guessing it might be because those tablets are handling the scroll as a make the full panels scrollable by finger swiping while the browsers are displaying the scrollbar on the right which doesn t cover the panels

width	height
for instance given a 5x5 pixel window i would like to generate a subwindow in a given location in x y with a given width and height

13706806

currently it s ok to assume that the width and height of the subwindow will always be equal to each other

13706806
width	height
currently i m just generating a random width height for the subwindow that i know fits inside of the original window

13706806

the concept of superclass and subclassing in terms of an entity-relationship diagram is correct but be careful while you refer that entity-relationship diagram in terms of a database

entity-relationship	diagram
the only object that probably best fits your entity-relationship diagram in terms of an entity is a table or a view

13707009
entity-relationship	diagram	entity-relationship	entities
so considering that almost all the entities in your entity-relationship diagram are table db objects the correct term would be parent table and child table

it sounds more like a get because post should create something at least this is the convention in ruby on rails

13707029
post	get

javascript thus expects that the desired html element which you d like to show hide is always present in the html dom tree

comparator	comparable
a comparable object can determine its order by comparing itself with another object natural ordering while a comparator is an object that knows how to compare two objects and determine their particular order

13707825
comparator	comparable
here is where comparator comes in handy since you can sort a collection based on different comparations that can be switched dynamically by issuing a new comparator instead of some nasty logic where you should tell the comparable object hey now you order according to name instead of age

13707825
comparator	comparable
if your comparation logic is stable and won t be changed in the future you might want to have comparable objects but should you need to sort a collection based on different criteria you should go for comparator s

comparator	comparable
you can have as many comparator s for a single type as opposed to exactly one comparable

13708114
comparator	comparable
it s also easy to write a comparator that sorts instances of different types - this is hard to do with comparable because all involved instances would have to know about each other any instance could get any other instance as argument in comparator and they would have to implement some common interface etc

client-side	server-side
since there s currently no good solution in stock ember-data i made my own solution by adding an apierrors property to ds.model and then in my restadapter subclass i already needed my own i added error callbacks to the ajax calls for createrecord and updaterecord that save the errors and put the model in the invalid state which is supposed to mean client-side or server-side validations failed

13709126

you could then declare that foreign key constraint to automatically delete the children when the parent row is deleted

google-chrome	firefox
in previous versions of ie you could simply deliberately use css2.1 selectors to hide styles from ie5 quirks and older versions like the good ol hack but you can t do this with google-chrome and firefox or the new interoperable quirks mode introduced in ie10 because they support the same advanced selectors in quirks and standards mode

13727258
cpu	processors
i d even believe it conceivable that between the same os version running on different models of device different processors the results could be not bit-equal if there were multiple versions of the jpg decoder each heavily optimized for a specific cpu although that would not explain the difference between 2 devices of the same model with the same os

headerarea is full body width centertopnav is centered using margin 0px auto and

13728012
interbase	firebird
for those who use the windows installer for some reason it doesn t provide an option to include the interbase and firebird modules so you ll have to download the matching .zip file and copy them from the ext folder in there

13728056
min	max
as your question is confusing i have given the possibility of removing both the max and the min elements

13728106
put	get
if i put die after the query i still get the same error

13728135
post	get
create some php scripts that will do what you need by sending post and get variables

13728139
sorting	grouping
if the returned order does not matter you can try using groupby from itertools to grouping the items by their first element after sorting by the first element and then pulling out the maximum value with the max function also it should be noted that this returns a new list as opposed to modifying in place

13728179
submit	submission
to your coding when the submit button is clicked it will keep the form from submission to nothing and so the page from refreshing

13728190
width	height	int	double
the most noticable difference is that system.drawing.size uses int s for its width and height fields while the system.windows.size uses double s

13728193
inherited	subclassing
if dog is not a subclassing of animal then you would need multiple inherited to achieve what you want

13728193
inherited	subclassing
since java does not support multiple inherited you have to make dog a subclassing of animal

13728200
mouse	keyboard
every gui has a different way of responding to user events such as mouse clicks keyboard shortcuts etc

13728226
octal	decimal
use inputbasen to convert from octal to decimal then you can use chr to output the character

13728230

i have 2 worksheets one with company data and the other with a min max and answer column

13728273
min	max
what i need to do is find out if value in column d in the company data is between the min max in worksheet 2 output answer in worksheet 2

13728273
min	max
this is clearly a vlookup question but i haven t got a clue how to do the min max

13728334
put	get
by using get method you can take the animal object you required and do the modification and again put new animal against same key

13728372
getter	setter
i m in the camp that getter and setter are largely completely pointless and silly regardless of what language you re writing code in

13728378
division	modulo
to iterate a non-array you need to separately keep track of your position to count through all possible digits using division and modulo to advance and extract the digit for example

13728387
google-chrome	firefox
i ve also tested from a win 7 machine and see the same problem in firefox while it works properly in ie and google-chrome

13728431

google-chrome	safari
note i get the alert in all the browsers but the second video is not being played in safari and google-chrome

13728463
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i got the bright idea to put some code in the detailentryviewcontroller viewwillappear that would automagically pop itself if the user had logged out but apparent making calls to dismiss a modal controller are not allowed in viewwillappear viewdidload etc

13728510
button	checkbox
radio button cannot be unchecked once they are set to true unless you re using them in a group so i included an example using a checkbox widget as well

13728532
int	chars
i ve seen samples written in while loops but my statement returns int and chars so i would like to save them to the respectable variables and not an array

13728626
width	height
try adding a height and width constraint to your circle_view

13728643
int	chars
first of all your returns will not be int and chars

13728643
int	chars
from there if you need them to be chars and int you can convert them

13728650
inherited	properties
remember to call super in the child constructors so that the inherited properties will also be assigned default values

13728738
post	get
generally you want to use post requests when you re changing data on the server and get requests when you re making read-only requests for information

13728749
g++	gcc
btw you could install a recent linux distribution with a recent gcc compiler 4.7 and run it as g++ -wall -g it would certainly have warned you if you statically accessed the testvect out of bounds like it seems that you have had

13728764
for-loop	loops
i have split the signal with the function buffer so that 30 seconds worth of data lie in each column of the matrix segment_mat but i want to be able to store the results of the power spectral density in a matrix using a for-loop to loops through the data and to also store the average power of each segment in a vector avpow

13728872
getter	setter
this is what i ve come up with but i m not sure if i m taking the right path using a getter and setter this way

13728881
apache	nginx
ssi includes can be a major pain since they re dependent on apache in particular try getting nginx to read ssi s

13728895
int	double
however i often need to use the same function but with differently typed arguments int and float and double

13729017
inherited	properties
the item classes automatically inherited this properties and there is no need to redefine such a field there

13729022
chown	chmod
if you understand and know what the permissions should be for the files you can have your script run after each deployment to set the chown and chmod to what you want it to be

post	get
im trying to get a facebook like button for every post using this code

13729138
calloc	malloc
finally it s worth noting that whether calloc malloc new require physical allocation is allocator-dependent but it s safer to assume yes especially for allocations less than a large number of pages

13729141
post	get
if you want to get the first ten post replace

13729175

13729217
width	height
as far as i can tell by experimentation i only get the problem when the width or height of the rectangle is odd

13729217
width	height
in other words always round the brush rectangle up the the next even number of pixels in both width and height

13729228
width	height
callout extends container so you shouldn t have problems setting the width and height to 100

13729229
websphere	ibm
i realised that ibm websphere seems to use a modified version of this jar

13729229
jpa	javax.persistence
just for clarification i m not asking about actual jpa implementations but the official javax.persistence classes which are part of the jsr jpa spec in a binary form

13729304
portrait	landscape
or you can use the second method for simply landscape portrait

13729314
post	get
if you post or get it you can use yii s chttprequest getparam to read in the raw json

13729325
draggable	droppable
and imagine combinational usage of jquery s draggable droppable etc. then to be in use with the tabstrip html-elements

13729325
draggable	droppable
jquery basics and specially draggable droppable used on the tabstrip window - html-elements find out what elements are used via firebug

so i was going to hide the drop down and on double click show the drop down and hide the text

13729476
kerberos	ntlm
wfetch allows you to specify ntlm negotiate and kerberos this may well help you better understand your problem

13729476
kerberos	ntlm
i ll finish by saying that i have experienced this same issue and my only recourse was to use kerberos rather than ntlm don t forget you ll need to register an spn for the service if you do go down this route

13729523
put	get
running a program i am making to draw with turtle graphics i put in an exit command however now whenever i enter any single-word commands i get an indexerror indexerror list index out of range at the elif for the back command

13729544
min	max
to each value assign opacity 10 + value - min max - min 90 percent

13729544
min	max
more generally if the highest opacity is x and the lowest is y then the formula is y + value - min max - min x - y

13729567
width	height
is there a way to know the true width and height of an image using jquery when the image is scaled down in css - without any extra data of dimensions - any link or code example would be helpful thanks

13729591
free	realloc
realloc returns a pointer to the reallocated buffer and may free the original buffer

13729623
multiplying	division
you may have to force floating point division by multiplying highest_value by 1.0

13729634
hide	show
i though to use the jquery hide and show but hide will hide the entire page also the current page

13729661
width	height
the thing is you can only access image true width and height when the image is loaded u could also load the image without any container to some place where you can not see it and ask for img .css width but i think this is a more elegant way to do it

13729666
folder	directory
you can then just loop through the files of the directory to delete them or if deleting the folder is okay as well you could create them afterwards again you could also just use shutil.rmtree

13729683
int	double
i have a two double arrays x and y and int i

13729694
post	get
i figure i ll need to have my form run a script that does not post get inputs that have no value

13729720
min	max
the first goal is to get the max and min value from the list

13729720
min	max
val - min max - min performs this scaling no number will be greater than max - min once min has been subtracted from it and never less than zero once min has been subtracted from it

13729758
disk	ram
simply putting your tmp disk or wherever php session files are stored onto a ram disk such as tmpfs or ramfs would also have serious performance gains and would be a much more transparent switch with zero code changes

13729785
hash	salt
a salt is something you mix with a password before you hash it to add to the security of what you re storing

13729785
hash	salt
so you should be using your salt to make the password hash more secure and so storing it later for rehashing and comparison purposes at every login

13729785
hash	salt
it s possible to use sha512 hash for salt but they don t need to be nearly that long

13729785
hash	salt
what you should do is combine the user-entered password with the salt which you generate separately then hash the combination

13729786
width	height
set textviews width and height to wrap_content

13729838
folder	directory
if you have a config-folder in your projects directory and there is a file you want to read from you have to copy this folder to the directory of your jar-file too

13729857
getter	setter
normally domain classes act as dtos in the application and should be only have fields and the getter and setter know

13729988
calloc	malloc
the malloc and calloc functions return a pointer to the allocated memory that is suitably aligned for any kind of variable

13729988
calloc	malloc
null may also be returned by a successful call to malloc with a size of zero or by a successful call to calloc with nmemb or size equal to zero

13729988
realloc	malloc
as you can see malloc s friend realloc gets its only entry in the man page because of the highlighted part the value returned from realloc can be different from the reference to the memory that you pass in

13729994
stdout	stderr
but of course you also need to detect when you re not on a terminal or at least write this stuff to stderr instead of stdout so if someone redirects or pipes your script they don t get a bunch of garbage

13730023
ubuntu	linux
i am using ubuntu linux and i am just a beginner is c language i have created a program that creates a lock file when started inside a folder but both the file and folder are with dot like .folder and .file and linux hides such files and folders and i have another program that checks if the file exists or not if it exists then the program is running and if it doesn t then its not simple here is my code

simple enough the for-loop you ve written iterates the properties of the object rather than the items in the arrays what you probably want is actually

13730188
int	double
using float or int instead of double using scanf_s using scanf d or f for i or li or lf or e or g using fflush stdin to clear keyboard buffer reading in b first trying like all possible combinations

13730241
int	chars
for printf your values are wrong for same reason d is used only for int and possibly chars if you know what you are doing numbers

13730245
layoutparams	viewgroup
even if gridview is a viewgroup you can t access it s layoutparams

13730288
min	max
assumes that d2 contains the number of employees and that your sheet2 table is in a2 c4 max in a2 a4 min in b2 b4 and output in c2 c4

13730310
min	max
this is a bit boilerplate-y but gives fairly readable exception messages as above the actual min max value are exposed as well if you choose to catch the derived exception type and can do something useful with it

getter	setter
second there may be actions that you want to perform in getter or setter such as firing a notifypropertychanged event

13730429
getter	setter
in other languages this is often accomplished by programs implementing specialized getter and setter methods

13731228
children	parent
i can see that you show a list of children in the show action of parent and the parent isn t sortable in this action so will be a simple change

13731279
getter	setter
you need to create the getter and setter methods in the code you provided i could see a set method to rollno but no get method also they must be public

13731286
versioning	upgrade
you can take advantage of the new storage emulator even if decide to use the old libraries -- indeed the libraries are installed side by side only the emulators are upgrade the new versioning replace the older ones but they are still compatible with older versioning

13731358
screens	tablet
i know it s a bad idea to rely on screens resolution because many tablet today are simialr to desktops in terms of resolution

13731396
children	parent
then you can build the parent project and it will build all children in order or you can use one of the advanced maven reactor flags

udp	tcp
hi i m working a project for a networking class where we are creating nodes in a network that receive messages from a control app via udp and then create tcp connections with other nodes

13731418
udp	tcp
the basic order goes 1 control manager sends udp message to node a telling it to connnect to node b 2 node a receives udp message and forwards the udp message to node b 3 node b receives the udp message randomly choses a port number opens a listening tcp socket on that port and sends a udp message back to a with the port number 4 node a receives the udp message and opens a connection on that tcp port to node b

primitive chars is a compatible type with primitive int in java and if you add chars you will get the sum of their ascii codes

13735579
int	chars
you end up calling system.out.println int due to the addition of the chars values themselves yielding an int value

i am trying to dispatch a post request to get an upload token from youtube using requestbuilder from the client-side of my gwt app

13749117

13749117
implements	extends
public class springservicejobfactory extends springbeanjobfactory implements jobfactory

13749121

instead of using setinterval call settimeout in the ajax completion callback to start each call 10 seconds after the previous one finishes

13749232
setinterval	settimeout
instead of using setinterval calculate the request time usually using a unix timestamp in seconds how much for 10 seconds in the server side use settimeout the remaining time so it will vary from user to user on their ping time or the business of the site

you should be tracking mouseenter mouseleave as opposed to mouseover mouseout

13749704
move	drag
i use it rarely such as when i want to move components around via animation or with a mouselistener but even then many suggest that you create your own layout to handle that such as rob camick s drag layout

13749721
post	get
examples of this data are the post and get variables the user agent the language ip adress and many more

13749728

13749764
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome use -webkit and -moz is used my mozilla

13749771

13749830
getter	setter
you can try creating getter and setter for the map variable

13749830

13749861
google-chrome	firefox
my research i ve searched online for firefox visual studio integration close debug google-chrome visual studio but nothing related appeared

however on the controller i get a list of parent and they all have the same children collection even though they were correct a moment before

13750161

if you are using tcp or udp on top of ip then no

13750161
udp	tcp
both tcp and udp only use 16 bits for the port number

13750187

the structure of the httprequest object is essentially the same as that of the httpresponse object so you can read cookies out of the httprequest object much the same way you wrote cookies into the httpresponse object.

13750208
post	get
since jsonp works by creating tags you can only use jsonp with a get http method not post

13750220

13750275

the server control inherited system.web.ui.control which doesn t have style as a properties

13750287
int	chars
you can then convert this int into a string if you must for example with base64 encoding hexadecimal notation or by interpreting it as string in some chars encoding though you have to take care to end up with valid strings

13750304
post	get
i have multi input type text and i want to get all values of it to these fields and store it to var to send it via post to codeigniter controller

13750323
xslt	xquery
i am not looking for an xslt or xquery solution

13750349
post	get
the only time they intersect is indirectly when you use php to pre-populate javascript constants usually a bad idea or when the javascript uses get post to send data back to a new instance of the script standard practice.

13750364
portrait	landscape
in landscape mode the ipad zooms content in so that the effective viewport with is the same as in portrait mode

13750377

it depends a bit on how your form is set up but you can sometimes set up two sections and show hide them

13750510
hide	show
so to show just field b hide section 1 and show section 2

13750510
hide	show
to show them both show section 1 and hide section 2

currently we are experiencing some problems so we d like to upgrade current subversion workspace versioning 1.4 to 1.6 and we notice there is an option to do it in the manage jenkins section

13750531
versioning	upgrade
my question is if it s safe to do that because jenkins will upgrade workspaces automatically or if all the jobs will begin to fail and a manual update of workspace versioning should be done after changing that property

13750670
getter	setter
i was instructed to use more pythonish way of setter and getter property

13750828
free	malloc
malloc error for object 0x100103b40 pointer being free was not allocated

13750956
put	get
you put color instances into the array so you should just use that to get them out

13751080
screens	hdpi
when using it on hdpi screens the text size jumps when trying to increase the text size

13751137
onresume	onpause
onresume called after onpause which in turn is called when the activity loses the foreground note that this has nothing to do with the activity s content visibility

13751137
onresume	onpause
because onresume is always called after onpause you are guaranteed that it will be called every time the user were doing something else and then switches to your activity which seems just your use-case

13751140
width	height
i finally solved it using the css and had to use scaling where you add the width then use auto for the height

13751176
getter	setter
it s basically hitting a lot of the getter and setter in a 60 000 long loop and if i set a breakpoint on one of them at any given time and check the file_id in the debugger it s got a new file_id every time which is how i know it s looping through all of them

13751188
post	get
with some modification i could use the function to get all of the images in a post and then do something with them

13751200

filtering	grouping
putting rotues into route grouping or if you using controllers add the filtering there add it in the base_controller so it will be applied to all

13751264
hash	md5
i have seen the questions and answers about using md5 and sha1 hash as well as the file sizes to compare the files i setup the system and while this works most of the time there is one specific case where it matches false positives with identical md5 sha1 hash and file size

13751339
implements	sealed
sealed class types may achieve a slight performance advantage by implements

13751339
equals	compareto
two instances whose names match but whose t s differ should return 0 for compareto but false for equals

13751339
equals	icomparable	equals	gethashcode	icomparable	gethashcode
because of this overriding icomparable does not require overriding gethashcode if equals is not changed

13751361

google-chrome	firefox
i have a basic css only dropdown menu that works great in google-chrome and firefox but not so well in ie9

13751470

google-chrome	firefox
this all explains why my original code worked for firefox but failed on google-chrome

13751487
maven	pom.xml
we use a maven repository so i have it setup to create a pom.xml and then use mvn deploy deploy-file to deploy it back to the maven repository

setinterval	settimeout
one approach could be to use settimeout or setinterval for your div showing the progress bar

13751503
dateadd	datepart
as you can see the number of days covered between the start and end dates will be different depending on the reference date so i can t use the day datepart within dateadd

13751503
dateadd	datepart
i have a table of reference dates #referencedates that i ll be joining the exchange rates table #exchangerates to and i d like to use between within a where clause to pull the appropriate dates for each reference date hence the need for compound datepart within dateadd

13751517

13751524
memcached	apc
it s slower than apc but it s faster than memcached redis etc

13751532
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome and safari i notice that the text inside the pre is getting divided in two at the 65535 character mark

13751565
folder	directory
it s to do with the structure of the folder in prestashop all modules are placed in prestashop modules directory but the modules are viewed from prestashop admin

in all truth the values you put in a .settings file get inserted into the app.config file but the process of reading and updating is managed by the application

13751628
width	height
after this the view it s already rendered but not attached to the dom hence properties like height or width will be undefined or zero

13751649

you need to do this using int or be happy with imprecision because floats and double are inherently imprecise

13751699
folder	directory
k so i have all my css in separate files but it wont load i have it in a folder called css in the root directory and have separate css files for each view

13751711
post	get
the form simply takes one param and post it to the same form on the same page but for now when the page reloads the param doesn t show i don t know if it is the python thats wrong or weather it is the html anyway i have no idea as i don t get any error messages.

13751724
128bit	64bit
in the same way the double quad word 128bit arrived now with 64bit amd64 architecture

13751724
int	chars
1 sizeof chars sizeof short sizeof int sizeof long sizeof long long

13751724
16-bit	64bit
if you will use int to store it you program will correctly behave if int will be 32-bit will have 4-byte memory overhead per each value instance if int will be 64bit and won t correctly work if int will be 16-bit

13751724
octal	binary
we have three choices use plain binary encoding use octal encoding and use hexadecimal encoding

implements	sealed
in practice that means that should either be implements only by t itself if t is a sealed class or struct or not at all if t is inheritable or if the performance benefits aren t worth the effort

13751743
coalesce	nullif
try coalesce with nullif

13751747

13751790
draggable	droppable
what you can do is wrap your draggable in a div that you also make droppable

13751805

it does have a run method but the class neither implements the runnable interface nor extends the thread class

13751851
ienumerable	iqueryable
orderby turns an ienumerable like list into an iorderedenumerable but turns an iqueryable into an iorderedqueryable

13751854
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox have some really nice tools to find css for the elements on the page and rearrange things in the browser so you can see how they will look with the changes

13751931

i am using jboss as 7.0.2 final and was trying to upgrade the versioning of resteasy that comes with 7.0.2 resteasy 2.2.1.ga to a newer versioning such as 2.3.4.final

gridex	janus
i am trying to implement custom grouping in the janus gridex control

you could try passing the datagrid as the commandparameter if you can find it using an elementname or relativesource binding

13752434
strcpy	strncpy
replaced strcpy with strncpy which is much safer apparently and that removed the segmentation fault

13752470

13752620
versioning	upgrade
what you can do is publish a fixed versioning on google play and wait for users to upgrade

13752628

13752966
getter	setter
there are no reason you should use getter or setter

13752975
getter	setter
as suggested in comments it is not considered pythonic to have setter and getter for a basic attribute

well the question in op is open ended because it s not like there is one fixed set of protocols tcp udp used in this kind of applications and also its scope is large due to various technologies involved in this end-to-end solution of camera capturem encoding streaming decoding processing

13752999
udp	tcp
there are plenty of tutorials online to get basics of using tcp ip or udp ip sockets and its programming concepts

13753198
laravel	codeigniter
i need to know which are my options when deploying codeigniter laravel apps

13753223

i have been upgrading my database structure and rewriting a lot of the backend code and had forgotten to change the notification table from myisam to innodb

13753232
fadein	fadeout
when you have fadein and fadeout running at the same time both elements are visible and in the space and there isn t enough room so the other image drops down below the first image

13753250

filtering	grouping
i will be grouping by storehash theformat which might be by day month week year and also filtering by date range

13753563
excel	listobject
if i manually enter a formula into a column in an excel table listobject autocorrect applies this formula to the whole column

13753586
int	chars
now i know that in case 2 first byte of x is reinterpreted to think that it is an int and the bit pattern is copied into b which gives of some garbage and in case 1 it just converts the value from chars to int

13753613
int	chars
for example an int might occupy more space than a chars or it might be that the chars lives at an address where no int can ever live.

once you have saved your filenames in a string arrays then you can iterate through the arrays using the for-loop for example and use the

display is a textblock used to display values of variables for debugging purposes tb is a richtextbox

13754156
width	height
i realized it is because there is an edge case when the height or width of the area to calculate is 1

13754165
typedef	struct
it is only a matter of habit or convention to explicitly name the struct in addition to the typedef

13754197
typedef	struct
that s because the struct is known at the opening brace while the typedef isn t known until the final semicolon simplistic but good enough here

13754238
button	checkbox
you ll need to treat text fields differently from radio button checkbox etc

13754252
division	modulo
repeat your previous solution using 100 instead of 10 for the modulo and adjusting the division

13754261
typedef	struct
notice that typedef is and struct are two different statements in c

13754308
google-chrome	firefox
i have the following code that works in google-chrome and firefox but that solution fails in ie8 using the following

13754308
google-chrome	firefox
i never see the inside change event alert box it pops up every time on google-chrome and firefox

13754318
google-chrome	firefox
i recommend to use a plugin like firebug or even the built in functionalities of google-chrome or firefox to see what has been sent and what has been received in your post request

13754351
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the issue doesn t occur in safari ie and google-chrome 20 and until recently it didn t occur in firefox

to reproduce zoom out in google-chrome or firefox

13754417
switching	screens
however when i visit the website on a ipad it looks good at first but when i switching page within the website and then press the back button the bottom menu gets stuck in the middle of the screens

13754483
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari give different results

13754507
jar	war
i recommend using apache ant for creating jar war files because it is portable so you will not need to rely on shell features for regex-based excluding files

13754541
google-chrome	firefox
i check w firefox and google-chrome same behavior

13754617
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari

however i also suspect you have an out-of-date macports installation that you installed for an earlier versioning of os x and didn t follow the upgrade instructions when upgrading to mountain lion

13754796
.htaccess	httpd.conf
if you are the server admin then have a root around in the httpd.conf file and or the appropriate .htaccess assuming apache

13754806
rtp	rtsp
i have seen lots of examples with android s videoview api being used to stream data from an external server into a device videoview internally uses an rtp and rtsp stack to receive data

13754806
rtp	rtsp
however there are very few discussion on possibilities of using android s internal rtsp and rtp stacks for achieving server capabilities i.e making an android device act as a streaming server and stream media out

13754820
switching	screens
so the aquire method would switching the screens on if it wasn t already and the release would switching it straight back off

13754820
switching	screens
in android 4.2 it seems that the switching off doesn t happen when you release the wakelock but only when the screens timeout setting for the display is reached default seems to be 2 minutes

13754820
switching	screens
i ve seen some bits in the api about specifically switching the screens on and off but i m a little unsure about using as i wouldn t want the app switching the screens off if somebody was in the middle of doing something so the wakelock seemed to work well

13754836
versioning	upgrade
it simply wouldn t work unless you upgrade your library to versioning 4

13754852
post	put
i have another question related to the put and post requests

13754884
stdout	stderr
this is almost working except the order of the output via stdout and stderr is random

13754893
spaces	delimiter
this will use a spaces or a new line as the delimiter

13754893
spaces	delimiter
the issue is that using the spaces for the delimiter causes all the first lines to the spaces between the numbers to be one item that is evaluated

13754914
put	get
i ve put together the following so far but i can t seem to get it to work after struggling for a couple days using a number of variations both with and without a rewrite rule

13754924
put	get
but i have no idea on how to put the error message to its parent element in the body content which is easy for me to get it in the service operation

13754933
post	put
the save method will determine whether to post or put based on the return value of isnew

13755040
free	realloc
realloc errors like this generally indicate that the memory heap has been corrupted which usually occurs because of out-of-bounds writes or reusing free pointers

13755045
gridview	sqldatasource
i have a gridview that is connected to an sqldatasource my select statement joins two tables survey category

13755077
google-chrome	safari
but on google-chrome 23.0.1271.95 or safari 6.0.2 i the multiselect is displayed but i can t select items

13755082
folder	directory
i created the following directory u documents windowspowershell modules and copied the extracted pscx-2.1.0 to the modules folder

13755094
arraylist	treeset
but now i decide that the arraylist is not good because i want to maintain the items ordered so i substitute it with a treeset in this way

13755096
post	put
but for post put and delete requests where the server is expected to take some

13755096
post	put
a 303 in response to a post put or delete means that the operation has succeeded

13755096
post	put
a 307 in response to a post put or delete means that the server has not even tried

13755126
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it works just fine in google-chrome firefox and safari but in ie it stops refreshing after anywhere from 1 to 12 refreshes

13755136
cos	sin
i m manipulating a 2d map with basic sin and cos quite successfully to give a 3d perspective

13755136
width	height
effectively doing the transformation in reverse the output is 0 0 and width height and i want to know where on my map those points lie

13755147
sorting	grouping
if you want to use hql hibernate query language you must define all fields which are used in select clause where clause sorting grouping in your mappings

13755170
express	node.js
this seemed relevant but didn t fix the problem static javascript not rendering in jade with express node.js

13755203
subtract	add
if your local time is something else and there s no timezone specifier then you need to parse the date add or subtract the offset from your time zone to match aest and then call touniversaltime

13755209
post	get
sorry for the long post but wanted to get it as clear as possible

13755272
stdout	stderr
there is no way to read stdout and stderr in the correct order because there is no notion of order between different pipes

13755297
int	double
by primitive types i mean int bool double string etc

13755307
put	get
if i m parsing through the first line a is the 1 letter and i have the following code what do i put in each case so i can get the individual tokens and store them as variables

13755400
put	get
solution removed the p paragraph from within the form and adjusted the rest from css added float left to the different inputs fields and rows lowered the label width so the input came closer then calculated and put the correct margin-right to both input and textarea and last to #submit to get everything in nice order

13755432
comparator	comparable
treeset forms a binary tree keeping elements according to natural or not orders so in order to search quickly one specific element is the collection treeset uses comparable or comparator instead of equals

13755432
comparator	comparable
see comparable or comparator

13755432
equals	compareto
compareto or compare method so two elements that are deemed equals

13755432
comparator	comparable
if contains using comparator or comparable returns true equals has to return true too in order to be consistent with equals

13755438
punctuation	words
after editing the question it seems that the punctuation like semi-colon is not wanted in a words

13755438
punctuation	words
the code above would include punctuation as part of the words

13755460
children	parent
lets say those 10 clips or any number of clips were all the children of a parent object called clips

13755460
children	parent
you re looping through all the children of the clips parent and telling everyone to play

13755522
for-loop	arrays
then using a for-loop the messages stored in the arrays will populate below the form

13755549
hide	show
however it s really up to you how you show and hide the picker

13755605
equals	gethashcode
you sort of need to choose between mutability and gethashcode returning the same value for equals objects

13755646

using maybe again as an example if we only knew it was a functor that gives us a correspondence between the objects and and between the objects int and maybe int and between the objects chars and maybe chars

13756111
int	chars
but while we have the ability to take a value in and a value in int and produce a value in chars maybe being a functor doesn t guarantee that we have any ability to do some corresponding operation with a value in and a value in maybe int

13756111
int	chars
when we also know it s an applicative functor then we do have an ability to take a value in and a value in maybe int and produce a value in maybe chars and this satisfies certain properties wrt the application of values to int values

inherited	properties
is saying that class4 inherited the public methods and properties of class3 and class2 and treats them much the same as its own public methods they are public methods of class4

13763671
public	protected
had you used private class3 protected class2 you would have taken the public methods of class3 and made them private within class4

13763671
public	protected
likewise class2 s public methods would become protected in that example

13763671
inherited	properties
you d inherited serialisable and renderable to gain the properties of both

vbscript	vba
having seeing some complications in vbscript compared to vba i would suggest the following rather-lazy method

13763810

13768729
background-image	background-color
when changing css attributes in javascript you need to camel-case them for instance background-color becomes backgroundcolor and background-image becomes backgroundimage

13768779
prepare	execute
in fbpreparedstatement however executebatch is overridden to execute the originally prepare statement with batch parameters in your example it won t do anything as you never actually add a preparedstatement-style batch

13768794
post	get
the following examples shows how you can implement filters based on method eg post get url and read post data and response bodies

13768807
hash	md5
i m trying to do it this way because the email that gets sent out to the user contains a randomly generated md5 hash code that i also need to have sent to me in the email sent to me telling me they ve registered

13768856
folder	directory
and this works if i am in development but if i build and take the build output and put it in a folder called c test 1 when i run the app from c test it says it can t find the c test 1 custom directory

13768871
maven	m2e
assuming you have setup m2e plugin within eclipse correctly and your project is configured to use maven i ve found jetty maven plugin within eclipse to be particularly useful

13768912
laravel	cakephp
there are a number of php frameworks including but not limited to zend cakephp laravel and fuel

13768929
width	height
i am first getting the width of all images and assigning that width to the container but i want to make a button that will change the height of the photos 400px 600px

13768929

when i click the button to change the height i also need to re-calculate the width of all images - and that s my problem

13768960
superclass	subclassing
just create a superclass called robot and subclassing it

13768965
pull	push
now in the first case you need to pull 4 ints and push them back to the stack while to call the second case you only need to pull the reference to the rectangle

13768970
listview	gridview
so i use a listview gridview where i build up the columns in code behind

13769005
carrierwave	fog
carrierwave also supports fog so your integration with amazon s3 will be easier

13769084
width	height
if you want to give a height and width to your gridview put a relative layout outside of the gridview and give android layout_width and android layout_height to your relative layout

13769084
width	height
then give your gridview s width and height to match_parent

13769084
width	height
after that if you want to give exact height and width to your gridview cell elements at first you have to know the exact width and height of all cells and you should define the columnwidth according to that for example for this code

13769135
sorting	grouping
it would probably also simplify your code because of grouping sorting aggregate functions etc

13769180
try-catch	exception-handling
actually this is very common approach organize into transaction-like blocks wrap block into try-catch neatly roll back on exception-handling

13769190
gruntjs	yeoman
personally i prefer using build tools like gruntjs yeoman or brunch for that purpose

13769193
next	except
the 5 radio buttons are in a button group and i used the clear selection method to clear the selection it works fine except if the user hits the previous button to review a question once he hits the next button to continue all the selections get clear lets say the user answers 10 questions and goes back to review question number 3 once he hits next to go back up to question 10 all the questions in between will get cleared

13769235
folder	directory
a google drive folder is just a folder that replicates across multiple machines using the google drive magic infrastructure code so as long as your pc network can keep up with the changes there should be no problems with a cloned repo in a google drive directory

13769339
uilabel	uitextview
i have a uiscrollview that has a number of uilabel and uitextview inside it

13769339

13769346
cpython	pypy
i m trying to create a way to interact with a sandboxed pypy interpreter from within a normal non-sandboxed cpython or pypy script

13769359
superclass	subclassing
for what it s worth the accepted way to do what you want is to just declare whatever the superclass is robot declare and implement methods with empty bodies possibly throwing an nsexception if they aren t overwritten by a subclassing and create your subclassing subrobot or what have you

13769365
versioning	upgrade
an update or upgrade is considered to be in-progress as long as there is at least one instance of the service which has not yet been updated to the new versioning

box-sizing border-box

13769435
webclient	httpwebrequest
then i ve encountered interesting bug - when i had fiddler launched httpclient started to show its upload progress in unexpected way like in webclient httpwebrequest above so i thinked maybe that was a problem of why webclient showed upload progres not correctly i think i had it launched

13769447
profiling	instrumentation
when i m testing uitableviewcell scrolling performance i often use the time profiling in instrumentation

13769520
button	checkbox
one of my fields is a int but i want to make it a turn on off button red circle green circle or simplifying a checkbox

13769539
prawn	gruff
iâ m willing to use gruff to render some graphics inside prawn documents

13769539
prawn	gruff
gruff offers the to_blob method that renders the graph image as a blob in memory but looking at the prawn manual image section it only gives us a way to render images directly from files

13769547
google-chrome	firefox
the tests are working fine for firefox and google-chrome

13769547
google-chrome	firefox
the problem i think is i am not handling the alert but why only in ie it is recognized as part of the page not in firefox and google-chrome for them autoit solution is working perfectly

13769569
firefox	safari
it worked and still works in safari and firefox

13769569
google-chrome	safari
as both google-chrome and safari are built on webkit i would have assumed that they would display the same

13769663
pygtk	pygobject
inspiration dervied from the pygtk faq and adapted to pygobject

13769677
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the code below produces the desired result in google-chrome firefox ie but not in safari

13769734
portrait	landscape
in android when you switch from portrait to landscape or viceversa the activities are recreated so if you want to keep some data you have to manage theses with the bundle saveinstancestate

13769741
stdout	stderr
i want the data produced by this terminal stdout and stderr to be displayed on the window that appears as well as to a set log file

13769741
stdout	stderr
i have tried redirecting stdout and stderr using qprocess.setstandarderrorfile foo.log and qprocess.setstandardoutputfile foo.log but it seems like that would be redirecting the stdout from the gnome-terminal itself which isn t anything

13769753
hide	show
i need the page user 1 visit only change info state show hide when user 1 click button not cause by user 2 on user2 s page

13769756
width	height
because all of the columns except the last column have a padding-right border-right they effectively have a different width thereby making the image a different width height

13769756
width	height
by removing the rule for zero padding border on the last item of the column all of the images have the exact same width and height

13769773
post	get
my problem is that after i make a post or ajax request to my site the get request disappears and thus leaving me a null object since i create my object from that id

13769773
post	get
i have made some tests and the problem is at the get is null in the response i got from the post

13769773
post	get
when i make my ajax i tried regular post also request the status response from post is ok but after that nothing happens and det response says that my get request is null

13769779
disk	ram
since searches on the system will be resource-intensive and just out of good common sense we would like a clean way to cache each result set so that it can be pulled later from memory ram or disk

13769779
disk	ram
the server will have plenty of ram but since there could be hundreds of people using the system we may need an approach that stores to ram first but then can also cache to hard disk if ram is getting full

13769820
post	get
you are post -ing your data to your php page rather than sending a get request

13769820
put	get	post	get	post	put
or you could do a post but put the get variables in your url object

13769830
post	get
your ajax request is doing a post request thus the get array is not being filled because well you re doing a post request instead of a get one

13769867
post	get
making post ajax request but in the same time searching for a get parameters

13769890
hide	show
i would like the first textview caption to be clickable if clicked that it show the second textview text and if clicked again that it hide it

13769910
jar	war
also try removing the jar from the war file because it s already included

13769910
jar	war
remove struts core api jar from your war lib folder or from global

13769929
pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	hash	hash	salt
we ve been using pbkdf2 with random salt instead of just one time hash but it can definitely eat up your cpu

13769981
width	height
i m converting my svg object into an svg data uri applying that to an image s source and then drawing that image to the canvas but it s clipping the text after a certain width and height for some reason

13769994
implements	extends
one more thing all those classes extends from another class called parentclass so one workaround that i could use is to include some code in the parentclass that force the child classes to implements an empty parameter constructor but don t know how to do this

13770003
post	put
i read on one of the post on here that you could put the create a json array and send the array to the ajax call

13770039
getter	setter
moreover in situations where the getter ans setter are trivial starting with c# 3.0 you can use automatic properties like this

13770050
ubuntu	linux
i have eclipse juno on linux ubuntu 12.04 lts

13770052
implements	extends
i created the shapes by extends the shape class and implements the defininggeometry function like this

13770069
google-chrome	safari
for the ie8+ safari google-chrome support you should go with sequelsphere www.sequelsphere.com

13770086
range	minimum
i have a rallyiterationcombobox instance to select the minimum and maximum for the iteration range

13770086
range	minimum
since i would like to include the largest range by default and then let the user narrow the search results if they wish i would like it if the minimum iteration would default to the last on the list first chronologically and the maximum iteration would default to the first on the list last chronologically

13770208
post	get
i get data and post by .ajax to db and show in preview section

13770220
stdout	stderr
that will print a small header including the revision number to stderr and the content of the file to stdout

13770256
jobs	cron
there is no suport for windows task scheduler but it does support creating cron jobs

13770256
jobs	cron
check out the documentation for the details but esentially the gem creates cron jobs based on what you configure in the schedule.rb file that is created when you install the gem

13770315
jar	war
this way it transparently ends up as jar in web-inf lib of the built war

13770315
jar	war
this way it won t end up as jar in the web-inf lib of the built war at all

13770317
textarea	pre
i have a textarea control with white-space pre

13770317
pop-up	dialog
the problem occurs when i try to edit such text in a pop-up dialog with the same textarea feeded from ajax response

13770322
width	height
if you load the nib programmatically you can use the constructor that takes in a rectanglef and use that to set x y width height

13770332
.htaccess	httpd.conf
enable mod_rewrite and .htaccess through httpd.conf and then put this code in your .htaccess under document_root directory

13770355
google-chrome	firefox
okay i just like many others who commented did not see the same difference you show between my google-chrome and firefox and neither browser was behaving for me as you show you desired in your picture

13770371
nexus	artifactory
it can be a simple repository where resources are deployed using ssh or an http transport see the deploy plugin or a real artifact manager such as archiva artifactory or nexus

13770376
wmv	flv
so i m developing a custom video player for android but i need to play more than the android supported video files mp4 3gp... like wmv avi flv

13770386
sorting	filtering
of taxonomyitemmanager returning taxonomyitemdata with null properties i ll be using the above method + linq for the sorting filtering etc

13770402
int	chars
17 the type chars the signed and unsigned int types and the enumerated types are collectively called int types

13770407
.htaccess	httpd.conf
enable mod_rewrite and .htaccess through httpd.conf and then put this code in your .htaccess under document_root directory

13770430
put	get
it s also important to note that in the following the directory s age is calculated in fractional not whole days which means that seconds count and that one that was only say 6 days and 23 hours and 59 seconds old won t get put on the list to be deleted even though it is only two seconds away from being old enough

13770455
post	put
i worked around this issue and instead put a like button inside the details of each post and that would solve the problem of having lots of like buttons in the same page linking each other

13770468
mouse	keyboard
i was able to access everything with just a keyboard or mouse inputs showed focus and headers were used appropriately

13770470
int	double
which merely detects things that look sort of like int and double containers with distinct overloads

13770480
try-catch	exception-handling
if you can t avoid it is it a good practice to try-catch the exception-handling inside the shutdown hook

13770501
implements	extends
the reason i m implements my application as a pipeline is because i feel it will be easy for plugin authors to replace extends existing filters

13770507
mouseleave	mouseenter
when the mouseenter the menu the box moves across it and across part of the logo when the mouse then enters the logo directly from the menu it changes color correctly but uses the mouseleave animation from the menu

13770535
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i was able to solve this by creating a couple of categories for uitabbarcontroller and uinavigationcontroller

13770570
mouse	keyboard
but when the menu strip is active and the user navigates through it using either the mouse or keyboard the other controls on the windows form also respond to it

13770595
shadowbox	lightbox
i tried a couple modal boxes like shadowbox and lightbox but they just removed focus from the map part and wouldn t let it highlight either

13770610
french	turkish	hindi	turkish	hindi	french
english spanish french turkish german russian japanese chinese arabic and hindi

13770630
google-chrome	safari
for google-chrome and safari you still need the old syntax prefixed

13770644
width	height
i found this link that try to find a way to get the height so you could use the same to find the width of the screen if your grid fill the size of the screen android - get height of the parent layout

13770666
accessor	properties
i m weighing the option of using a private accessor only to test my gui as opposed the the methods properties that are publically exposed

13770677
postgresql	mysql
so i can develop for sqlite in the beginning and later on switch to mysql or postgresql

13770716
strcpy	strtok
one thing to note is that putting the line into the separate variables using strtok strcpy and strcat is working fine

13770741
google-chrome	firefox
it reloads the page with different hash tag but for some reason google-chrome and firefox load the same tab every time

13770748
post	get
you might get lucky and be able to compile and use them in combination with gcc dev-c++ but i wouldn t bet on it see the third comment on the opening post

13770754
public	protected
declare string sound as protected or public in animal.java or

13770763
put	get
so this is the out put i get

13770771
getter	setter
one solution is to use getter setter methods declared in the base class animal for all access to properties even from the subclasses

13770808
principalcontext	directoryentry
we re trying to query active directory for this information using the directoryentry api and the principalcontext api but can t figure out where it is stored

13770849
toupper	uppercase
the c runtime msvcrt.dll also includes the function toupper which converts a string to uppercase

13770873
inherited	subclassing
see the section what you can do in a subclassing in the inherited turorial

13770892
direct3d	directx
also if it is a directx issue you could try disabling direct3d as well as and texture acceleration via the dxdiag as others have suggested

13770943
box-sizing	border-box
i fixed this problem myself today using table-layout fixed and box-sizing border-box to force chrome to stop taking padding into account

13771044
maven-jar-plugin	pom.xml	maven-ear-plugin	maven-jar-plugin	maven-ear-plugin	pom.xml
in my master pom.xml i have where i define configurations for the maven-jar-plugin maven-war-plugin and maven-ear-plugin

13771070
width	height
x is the width of the image and y is the height

13771168
children	parent
adds a node to the end of the list of children of a specified parent

13771179
children	parent
they can of course be children of a parent class to make it better

13771195
vb.net	vb6
when vb6 create binary file it contains only binary data but when vb.net creates it like in this example

13771219
for-loop	arrays
one character at a time each character being stored individually in an arrays and pumped to cout in a for-loop

13771259
width	height
if you resize the image tag to be 100 height if the browser is wider than the ratio of the image s width to its height then there will be a gap on the right hand side of the image when the height is small

13771259
width	height
i m not able to put my finger on the correct height to use to avoid creating scrollbars when you reduce the height and to avoid leaving gaps when you increase the height and width of the browser

13771277
filtering	grouping
i am making some grand assumptions here but most of the time one would filtering by category not grouping by it

13771277
filtering	grouping
if i am wrong and you really do need to show all documents from all categories grouping by category and filtering by date then you are going to have to adopt an advanced technique like the one i described in this other stackoverflow answer

13771277
filtering	grouping
i experimented with trying to build an index that would use that technique i described to let you have all results in your category grouping but still filtering by date

13771287
shortcode	shopp
in my single.php page at www.avengerscollectibles.com wp to display the shortcode for my azon pro shopp list that appears at the bottom of my single post pages but need some code to randomly show 1 of 5 such lists from an array based on each of the 9 categories characters

13771320
post	get
your main mistake is that you re thinking that datatype will post your data as json but actually the datatype content will define the expected data to get to have an already-decoded object when calling your callbacks

13771370
charat	indexof
instead of indexof i you need to use charat i to retrieve the character at position i the loop and logic look ok for the purpose stated

13771377
junit	testng
it seems that i can either run all junit tests or all testng tests in my case

13771389
pivot-table	crosstab
to get the resultset from that query converted into a crosstab or pivot-table with each separate row from table_two displayed in the same line of output that is usually better handled in the client rather than in the sql statement

13771443
getter	setter
while this is the effect that i m wanting to have happen i was under the impression that i would have to have some sort of getter setter to carry the edited currentsquare back to the arraylist and replace the old square

13771458
disk	ram
i have a single node instance of apache hadoop 1.1.1 with default parameter values see 1 and 2 on the machine with a lot of ram and very limited free disk space size

13771466
rss	feed
meanwhile this looks interesting interssection lets you read multiple atom and rss feed and do set operations on them and export the result to a single feed in any format

13771472
popover	tooltip
i have a bootstrap popover inside a div that has a tooltip

13771491
getter	setter
of course you need to have getter setter for startdate and enddate in your graphsaction action

13771542
filesystems	hfs
hfs plus like other posix-compliant filesystems stores filenames as bytes

13771542
filesystems	hfs
this proves that the directory name on your filesystems cannot be mac-roman encoded with byte value 8f where the ã is seen as long as it s an hfs plus filesystems

13771542
filesystems	hfs
but of course the jvm is not assured of an hfs plus filesystems and smb and nfs do not have the same encoding guarantees so the jvm should not assume this scheme

13771567
for-loop	arrays
printing 2d arrays in c# through for-loop

13771583
put	get
maybe a stupid question but when i put a maps.latlng object into an indexeddb objectstore and subsequently i get this object from the store the maps

13771584
popover	tooltip
it allows you to have multiple tooltip popover etc

13771627
button	checkbox
rather than a table of checkbox i d like for it to look like a wall of toggle button

13771627
button	checkbox
i wasn t sure if there was css that could make a checkbox do this look like a button and change colors on check rather than show a check mark or if i would have to use some combination of button and javascript jquery and hidden checkbox or what

13771631
post	get
if the second is your case you might find the following post that i wrote on this topic interesting to get you started

13771694
qlistwidget	qtablewidget
the gui has a qlistwidget a qtablewidget and a plot implemented with mayavi

13771694
qlistwidget	qtablewidget
i ll admit i m intentionally avoiding model-view framework for the moment hence the qlistwidget and qtablewidget

13771720
move	drag
it got me to zoom in neatly but what i m really looking for in my panning is a mouse drag i will be working with a touch screen so dragging to move is important no need to use touch classes i have done dragging events with mouse classes before and find it easier to me

13771758
ant	maven	ant	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml
although similar to kevin s case what i m finding is that although i do create a separate run profile and -succssfully- run the test install goals maven instead of ant here but that s negligible noise and specify the java_home environment variable for that run profile the project does not validate the pom.xml file

13771806
division	multiplication
i used multiplication for both operations because multiplication is typically faster than division

13771815
unsigned	short
you use larger types to begin with don t declare a as an unsigned short just declare it as an unsigned int

13771849
express	node.js
i m looking to use node.js with express to create a webserver that serves static files as opposed to using something like apache

width	height
i m appending an image in my javascript code but want to get its correct width and height

i know how to get the image width after it has been loaded but i m loading an img and want to get its corresponding width and height directly

13772073
uiview	subviews
i have it so when the user starts a panning dragging gesture on a class called documentview subclass of uiview it adds an instance of mntrectangle as a subviews to the instance of documentview

13772112
width	margin
the idea is to give the wrapper an overflow of hidden then add an inner wrapper with a width wider than the parent to accept the extra right margin

13772129

his invoices are in folder invoices 155 directory

13772133

to go along with the gson answer i would suggest jackson

13772258
interpolation	splines
i did some digging and found the mathematical function that interpolation a cubic bezier splines but i was wondering if there were any javascript libraries that did svg-like vector arithmetic

13772264
hide	show
it still needs some work to show and hide the correct tabs but your overflow problem is fixed

13772283
int	chars
you can get away with this with const int variables and because they have static linkage but for string literals which are essentially chars arrays you will get this error

13772291
int	boolean
i think you can extend webview and override public boolean onkeypreime int keycode keyevent event

13772316
google-chrome	firefox
i tested both ways on firefox and google-chrome

13772323
folder	directory

13772342
unixodbc	iodbc
for other oses however several driver mangers are available mainly either iodbc or unixodbc

13772362
floating-point	fixed-point
update if you are stuck with 32-bit doubles then the only way i can see for you to increase the accuracy by a digit or two is to forget floating-point and use fixed-point

13772374
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
my website quizz.pl works fine on firefox google-chrome ie 7-9 mostly and opera

13772423
hide	show
you could test to see if the element is hidden before doing these types of measurements and if so show the element measure and then hide it again

13772435
instances	transient
unfortunately neither of these approaches resolved the transient instances exception

13772446

int	double
as a analogy it would be like truncating double in the range 0 1 and expect to get int different than 0 or 1

13772462
integer	unsigned
since the numerator would overflow a 32-bit unsigned integer hence you need something larger typically that would be a 64-bit type

13772462
unsigned	short
the usual arithmetic conversions are applied to the operands of + and so the unsigned short operands are converted to int since here all unsigned short values can be represented as int s and the arithmetic is performed at type int

13772462
unsigned	short
the result -2 is then converted to unsigned short by adding ushrt_max +1 to it resulting in ushrt_max - 1 being the value of e afterwards

13772462
addition	modulo
because the addition of temp1 and temp2 would result in a value outside the 32-bit unsigned range so the reduction modulo 2 32 of that result would change the overall result

13772483

for-loop	loops
bash on the other hand uses dynamic scoping and so using a variable i in a for-loop and using a variable i in another function which happens to be called during -- or not -- loops execution will affect each other s i value

13772803
prepare	execute
finally you want to execute it a number of times -- and it s always possible it ll get interrupted in the middle of things a task switch so you need to be prepare for the possibility of an execution taking quite a bit longer than the rest -- 5 runs that take 40-43 clock cycles apiece and a sixth that takes 10000+ clock cycles

for-loop	loops

13781123
ant	buildr
what s even more annoying is that i already have ant 1.8.2 rather than 1.8.3 but that shouldn t make such a huge difference and strangely enough there are no complaints as long as buildr doesn t find any java files tested this by leaving the layout at its default value

13781143

nsurlconnection	nsurlprotocol
the instance of the appropriate nsurlprotocol subclass for an nsurlrequest is created by nsurlconnection when a download is started

i solved it by styling my draggable element with margin 0 and padding 0 and make it consistent with a width and a height properties

13783297
inherited	subclassing
but now all the models that i make inherited this class can t use modelforms because i ve changed the save method to require this second field the userprofile corresponding to the authenticated user which must be supplied every time it is saved so i was wondering if it is possible for me to subclassing the modelform class to override it s save method so that it will call the new parentmodel.save method and fill in the currently logged in user that has been supplied to it

13783408
comparator	comparable
i assume you are not talking about the priorityqueue class and i am not sure if you are talking about an array or an arraylist but you don t need to implement comparable as you can create a comparator without changing the original class

i am trying to write a for-loop in r that loops over data i have starting in 1970

13783685
width	height
assuming that the variable biggest is the total width if so you should rename it to be more descriptive you are only setting the total width when you have figured out that the height of the current picture you have is bigger in height than a previously stored picture

13783685
width	height
for example if the point of explore is to determine the max height and total width you would think like this

13783685

gpus require natural alignment for all data a 4-byte int needs to be aligned to a 4-byte boundary and an 8-byte double or long long needs to have 8-byte alignment

13783917

since an odd number of int components preceed the double this requires padding

13783954
put	get
to get your desired behaviour put everything after the show call into the callback for the show command

13783975
int	boolean
the reason for that is that in c there is no specific type boolean - instead any non-0 int evaluates to a boolean true

13783975
int	boolean
in java assigns 4 to a and returns the final result of evaluation as int value 4 however type boolean is expected - hence you re getting a compile-time error about the incompatible types

post	get
jquery.get and jquery.post on the other hand can only issue get and post requests

13784874
post	get
internally these two functions use jquery.ajax but they use particular settings that you don t have to set yourself thus simplifying get or post request compared to using jquery.ajax

13784874
put	get	post	get	post	put
get and post being the most used http methods anyway compared to delete put head or even other seldom used exotics

13784902
width	height
pretty much i want to properly have the size of a button in my app converted to the amount of pixels for its width and height

13784902
width	height
so lets say it has a width of 50 and a height of 100 on a retina display device i want it to return a width of 100 and a height of 200

13784902
width	height
on a non-retina device it should return a width of 50 and a height of 100

13784956
free	malloc
this results in nix-compatible allocators typically directly giving you an malloc free implementation where it s assumed you ll only use one allocator for everything otherwise they d trample each-other while windows-specific allocators provide additional functions leaving malloc free alone and can be used in harmony for instance you can use heapcreate to make private heaps which can work alongside others

13784956
free	malloc
it s very rare to see an app intentionally use multiple heaps on windows -- mostly it s by accident due to different dlls using different runtimes which each have their own malloc free and can cause a lot of headaches if you re not diligent in tracking which heap some memory came from

13784987
width	height
if i go for div s can we achieve a effect which tables gives by default i mean if a column width increases the whole column width increases same like height wise row height increases too

13785050
put	get
there is no documented way to get matlab to automatically put in the

13785297
move	drag
if you are asking about how to do the drag drop part - you can set the manipulationmode on your custom control to translatex translatey and handle manipulationstarted events where you would move your control to a full-screen or grid-sized popup and move it in the manipulationdelta events by updating either the margin canvas or rendertransform properties then finally on manipulationcompleted - drop it in the cell that matches your criteria

13785317
integer	unsigned
of course java doesn t support unsigned integers so the best thing we have to divide by 2 as an unsigned integer is the logical right-shift

13785317
integer	unsigned
treats x as an unsigned integer and divides it by two

13785350

as an unsigned 8-bit integer the value of 0x90 is 144 a positive number with no bits beyond the 2 7 bit set

13786942
integer	unsigned
when working with bitwise operators almost always use unsigned types signed types often lead to unpleasant surprises and undefined behaviour if the shift result is out of range or a negative integer is shifted left

13786943

13787345
ostringstream	std
my recommendation is to change to std ostringstream and use std ostringstream str

13787356
inherited	subclassing
a subclassing must then handle the data and in some cases where the data is similar but laid out differently other classes inherited the subclassing

13787367
google-chrome	firefox
the code works perfect in firefox and google-chrome

13787378
width	height
iâ d like the character to automatically adjust its font size to fit the grid field it has been placed in in this case it should be bound to the height of the second grid row but since in some cases it could be unclear if the height or the width of the grid is smaller it would be also nice to know how to bind to the lowest of those 2 values

13787439
width	height
naturally i would like to be able to define the width and the height at a higher abstraction layer

13787504
voip	sip
best you could do for a generic encrypted voice application is a voip sip style application which would use a data connection

maybe you can define a class in css and adjust the width and height just from style

13787650
google-chrome	firefox
using google-chrome and firefox

13787668
explode	implode
i think the answer klaus byskov hoffmann gave wasn t bad but i d add on that and store the tag-list as many-to-many table like he said but also as serialized string in some form either via serialize like user466764 said or just a comma separated thing like you said yourself which could be handled with implode explode in the main table

13787689

13787786
getter	setter
a setter getter pair will not do

13787796
int	double
well usually these warnings don t cause too many problems unless for example you miss some special cases in your program like converting double to int but not checking if this int becomes 0 and you divide by 0

13787796
int	double
it should be obvious that int can t store all values of double but there is nothing wrong with converting it as long as you keep in mind that it might have become a value which can cause problems like converting by 0 but this depends on what you do with your int

13787804
uiview	calayer
i suspect however that the uiview method is just calling the calayer one so you might be ok

13787839
hash	md5
i upload the static files to s3 while renaming the files to append the md5 hash of their content

13787842
prop	each
each function the getters has a reference to prop so when they are called later on when the getter is used they use the value in prop which happens to be the last value that was assigned in the loop

13787851
getter	setter
as to your getter setter problem i would write

13787864
integer	unsigned
values expressions of an integer type whose conversion rank is less than or equal to that of int and unsigned int integer types with width that of unsigned int and bitfields of type _bool int signed int and unsigned int are converted to int or unsigned int int if that can represent all values of the original type unsigned int otherwise

13787915
inherited	properties
this could generate a type with the two properties defined in the string but you cannot add anything more to the generated type although you might be able to generate actual type using generative provider and inherited from it... i think this is probably the best you can do

13787917
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i have this fluid layout concept which works kinda okayish in firefox opera google-chrome but goes awry when opened wih ie7

13787922

post	get
instead use to determine if the request method is post or get unless you don t care but in your form the request method is set to post so i assume you do

13787978
folder	directory
you must put in in the default package in your sources directory whatever it s named so that eclipse copies it to the target folder when compiling which makes it available at the root of the classpath when the application is executed

13787992
put	get
also if you try to make a put or delete request to user starred owner repo with an owner or repository that doesn t exists you will get a 404 status

13788192
width	height
i have set the height of both containers to 100 and the width of both containers to 50

13788213
mouseevent	glasspane
so to resolve this use glasspane of jframe to attach mousexxxlistener s thus we can get correct co-ordinates when dragging the main problem with this solution is glasspane will consume events that are meant for other components on jframe this can be overcome by redispatching the mouseevent s appropriately

13788213
mouseevent	glasspane
create custom listener class to redispacth mouseevent s to the necessary components as glasspane will consume all events to the jtextarea jscollpane

13788257
width	height

now i need to know how good this browser support is because i heard that opera version 8 and the really early firefox versions around v1 had problems with or didn t support it

13788635
int	boolean
to avoid looping that boolean array each time the user checks a checkbox you could have a int field in the adapter which initially is the size of the boolean array

13788641
width	height
the simple and easy solution lies in the underlying layout just call collectionviewcontentsize on your mycollectionview.collectionviewlayout property and you get the height and width of the content as cgsize

13788643

the projects on this url are maven projects but they also complain about missing dependencies the ant build does work

13788689
acaccount	slrequest
i am trying to get likes of the current user within my app using acaccount and slrequest

13788698
centroid	threshold
the answer was actually pretty easy and not matlab-related if you divide your domain equidistantly and choose these values as the representative value of the corresponding quantization level and pick threshold at the centroid of each of these intervals endpoints you get the threshold that matlab uses

13788829
minimum	max
if you extract the minimum n times you can obtain a sorted array which is a max heap

13788831
width	height
note that i have to generate a texture that is a power of 2 so there is some math in there that allows me to generate a bigger bitmap than i need based of the width and height variables of the button that were specified in the constructor

13788866
google-chrome	firefox
not 100 clear on your exact problem but i also had similar problems with firefox firing loads of scroll events before the first one even completed whereas google-chrome did not

13788870
width	height
you should use ratioresolutionpolicy it will use the largest possible size while keeping a constant ratio between the width and the height

13788929
google-chrome	firefox
no combination of overflow and height on html body and .all seems to fix this neither in google-chrome nor in firefox

13788931
width	height
in an ios opengl app i d like to get the width and height of a glkview

13788960

google-chrome	safari
for example google-chrome shows a color picker but as of yet safari simply shows a textfield

13789164
children	parent
iirc the normal implementation of binomial trees on which binomial heaps are based is that you have a linked list of children for each parent node and a linked list of roots

13789180
post	put
if you need to make post put delete or any other request then you will need another approach

13789180
post	put
example listed below has been tested - all methods post put delete work just fine

13789180
post	put
requestmethod - method type in this particular case it should be post but can be put or delete or any other

13789231
post	get
so i still use the get method but i want to after processing in get method is finished i want to the url back remove parameter into as previously not using post method

13789248
put	get
so if i put nothing in i get 000000000000000000000000 for the value and if i change totalattack to a 1 i get 10000000000000000000000

cos	sin
however a lot of the operators that aren t supported sin cos tan etc. are available as specific methods on the model class such as below

13789403
width	height
you just multiply the width height by the scale factor

13789409
spaces	delimiter
there is no delimiter between the width and the distance fields for example and some fields have a spaces after the colon and others don t

13789467
width	height
what happens if you fix height and width to 100dp instead

13789485
width	height
f.e. if all items in vf are buttons with the same width and height can i somehow set it in vf so i don t have to code width and height for each button

13789492

is there any way to access the subclassing object from superclass

13789600
inherited	properties
and two unnecessary color properties with inherited values wouldn t be removed even in the compressed mode

13789618
lodash	underscore.js
lodash seems to be a drop-in replacement for underscore.js the latter having been around longer

13789620
superclass	subclassing
here s something very similar to the observer pattern you can do if you wish to access subclassing from the static method in your superclass

13789620
superclass	subclassing
then in your superclass s static usesubclass method you can iterate through that list of subclassing instances find the particular one you care about maybe specified by some argument and then do something with it

13789643
superclass	subclassing
no you cannot because the superclass cannot know the methods of the subclassing

13789643
superclass	subclassing
you should consider to create a new class which sees both superclass and subclassing and implement the static method inside this new class

13789667
width	height
create a new div mycontainer with a width and height of 100 position fixed z-index 10 and display none

i am having an issue when i am pushing to a uiviewcontroller by code from another uiviewcontroller which has the same uinavigationcontroller

13803653
uicontrol	uibutton
you might be better off faking it with three adjacent uibutton s or even subclassing uicontrol to make a custom segmented control which can have a separate image for each segment

they ve made a folder in the gem s lib directory named after the gem itself

13803688

13803818

looks like your canvas doesn t refresh it s width and height on window resize or orientationchange event

13803954
button	checkbox
when the user checks unchecks various checkbox then clicks an update button i want to be able to save the changes on the objects

13803989

this code will use your phone s default camera if you need to use their client you will need to start their captureactivity your layout should include a textview to show results imageview to show the image you captured and button to start the camera

13803993
post	put
i have some hero content which i have put together using post from here and jquery site

13804017

google-chrome	firefox
the first one which maxes out at 640px width works perfectly when i resize a firefox google-chrome window to be small but seems to not work at all on mobile

13804084
getter	setter
if you re using eclipse it could generates automatically the getter and setter souce code generate getter and setter it may help you to understand

13804093
width	height
this means that when you are extracting rect roi from rotatedrect box then either x or y are smaller than zero or the width height pushes the dimensions outside the image

13804119
post	get
jsonp works great for get requests but i can t post anything

13804127

equals	gethashcode
in c# when creating an anonymous type it generates an equals and gethashcode implementation for you using all the properties of your anonymous type

13804246

removing the key modifiers would fix the problem since you have a well defined class where you can implements your equality there

13804270
screens	hdpi
i also agree with other people who have posted the link to supporting multiple screens on the android developer website as it is a great resource to get to understanding the difference between the classes small normal large of screens and the different screens densities ldpi mdip hdpi

13804270
mdpi	hdpi
i personally like to associate ldpi with a resolution of about 240x320 mdpi with 320x480 hdpi with 480x800 and xhdpi with anything larger such as the sgs3

13804270
mdpi	hdpi
this means that if you want to create a button with the size of 48x48 which translates to 48x48 px for mdpi you also have to supply a graphic of 96x96 px for xhdpi 72x72 px for hdpi and 36x36 px for ldpi

13804270
mdpi	hdpi
it s pretty obvious you should try to create your graphics on the highest possible resolution xhdpi for example and then downscale to hdpi mdpi and ldpi

13804273

serializable	deserialization
the serializable worked for this but now the deserialization which i never bothered to debug and get right because it still wasn t working because instead of creating a json it was serializing a object array which you would expected because that was what the method getobjectoserialize method is returning

13804464
getter	setter
this is an example for using getter and setter

13804477
filesystems	ntfs
its never been clear to me but it seems that the windows nt filesystems has the option of implementing some file operations especially for large files asynchronously so that the kill may not be completed by ntfs even though vb6 thinks that it is and has moved on to the name statement

13804504

don t forget to put correct url in init of editable to get correct answer passed back to edit field

this means there is an xml file called game_menu in the menu folder of the res folder in your project s directory

13804641
vpn	lan
your web server is exposed to the world by necessity while your db server should be locked down like fort knox i see no reason why you shouldn t use that same service as-is for an internal winforms application using a lan vpn to access the service layer on the db server

13804641
ssl	https
you can also set up the service endpoint to only accept https connections and thus simply run your existing service through ssl tls

13804659
width	height
in either of these circumstances despite the bitmap is whole black or not this method will return me the bitmaps correct width and height

13804702
stdout	stderr	stdout	stdio
it s because jboss stdio wraps stdout and stderr and the log4j consoleappender outputs to stdout

13804737
keydown	keyup
it seems to be failing on keydown if i remove keydown it fails on keyup

13804747

a note to other readers i recently had this invalid argument. error reported in ie7-9 and eventually found that it was down to the way i was using settimeout setinterval

13805014
disk	ram
your query does not look computationally intensive so it s more likely to be hitting a limit in terms of paging data off disk or running out of ram

13805066
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
note that this is dependant on os support not any built-in power in tee so isn t universal but will work on macos linux solaris freebsd probably others

13805095

string literals decay to and chars is an int type

13808233
int	chars
if you try to sum them the compiler finds that the simplest way to make sense of that stuff is to convert chars s to int s so the result is performing pointer arithmetic over the string literals - + a goes to the 97th chars in memory after the beginning of the string literal if a is represented by 97 on your platform

put	get
it s not about composing all of the behaviour into the superclass though - if only dogs can dig and it doesn t even make sense for animals in general then it doesn t make sense for you to put dighole into animal - when you want a dog to dig you probably should know whether or not it is a dog anyway or if you want to move from animal to dog for instance to get all of the dogs out of an animal list so that you can use the dighole method you can use an explicit cast

the underlying cause is that libstdc++ s vector will move elements if the move operation is guaranteed not to throw it s declared noexcept or throw otherwise if the type is copyable the elements will be copied otherwise if the type is not copyable but does have a possibly-throwing move operation then it will be moved and if an exception is throw the results are undefined unspecified. this is implemented with checks to the is_nothrow_move_constructible and is_copy_constructible type traits

be aware that if you pass values by get or post hidden input field they can be changed by the user easily

13811557

post	get
i m sure google could have given you a very complete answer far more quickly and easily than asking it here and indeed even here i get 3 145 search results for post containing inode indirect blocks but since you did ask here here goes a reply

13813119
multiplying	add
so you just have to multiplying them out and add them up considering that the first indirect block s set of addresses point directly at data blocks and the double-indirect blocks point first at more blocks of data-block addresses and the triple-indirect blocks point at blocks of pointers to more blocks of pointers to data-block addresses

so to use ftruncate safely with stdio it may be necessary to first fflush any stdio buffers with fflush if your program may have already written to the stream in question

13813461
stdio	fflush
this will avoid stdio trying to fflush the otherwise unwritten buffer to the file after the truncation has been done

13813461
stdio	fflush
you should not have to make the stdio stream unbuffered if you follow the procedure above though of course doing so could be an alternative to using fflush but not fseek

your version could be tweaked by iterating over s.split which would be a list of the words but you then run into an issue where the punctuation is causing words to not match your dictionary

13814639
punctuation	words
you can get it to match by importing string and stripping out string.punctuation from each words but that will remove the punctuation from the final string so regex would be likely be the best option if replacement doesn t work

when a person interacts with the web page the browser generates many dom events mousemove mousedown contextmenu and the web application may depend on any of these events in order to trigger the required behaviour

13816148

qtp does not know which events each web application will use and thus reproduces the subset that qtp s developers thought are interesting for example for click qtp replays mousedown mouseup and click

13816148
width	height
the way that rightclick in device replay mode differs from your implementation is that it clicks in the middle of the webelement by default try getting the width and height of the element and doing obj.mouseclick getx+ width 2 gety+ height 2 right_mouse_button

13816661
accessor	properties
a read write properties is a pair get and set accessor method s providing variable-like capabilities but crucially when you get a properties you always get a copy of the underlying variable - even if that variable has a reference type

13816661
accessor	properties
in this example - if you could pass ref myclass.property to a method - it would be meaningless because it would be passing a reference to a transient variable on the stack - the copy of the reference returned by the properties get accessor

13816661
accessor	properties
the only way for c# to allow you to pass a properties by reference would be to pass the get and set accessor to the target method - and this would not be compatible with ref at all because that s just a memory location

i don t necessarily need it i merely want to know why it s not possible to implements in inner interfaces yet it s possible to extends inner classes

13818665

prng	random
you can optimize this a bit if you have a good prng by batching for example since you know that the random numbers will be in steadily decreasing ranges you could get the random numbers for n through n-3 by getting a random number in the range and then extracting the individual random numbers

13824191
prng	random
indeed if you used a 64-bit prng you could extract as many as 10 random numbers out of it

regarding the second question use the width and height options along with fittoview and autosize to set your preferred box dimensions like

13828133
uicontrol	uibutton
if you really must use a drawrect method i d subclass uicontrol rather than uibutton

13828229
libstdc++	libc++
presumably the answer depends in part on the level of c++11 support offered by clang for this version and in part on the version of libc++ and libstdc++ were shipped with 4.1

13828229
libstdc++	libc++
my general sense is that c++11 support is nearly complete these days when using libc++ but that you lose something when switching to libstdc++ but i can t figure out what -- a few simple c++11 features seem to work fine on both

13828229
libstdc++	libc++
context due to upstream dependencies i might need to link to libstdc++ instead of libc++ so i want to figure out what i might be losing

13828230
pull	push
however i also want to be able to push changes up into myproject but not yet immediately create a pull request to get them merged into originalproject until my branch is complete and tested

13828230

13828259
hash	salt
it goes without saying that a salt and hash password needs to be retrieved at some point to compare the hash to authenticate a given user but once the comparison has taken place is there a quantifiable security risk associated with keeping it in the user object

13828289
onclick	onfocus
for a while and say other options like onclick instead of onfocus

13828297
scatter	graphing
i need to replicate an excel scatter with smooth lines graphing in code

13828308
rcurl	rjsonio
but using rcurl and rjsonio you can load your graph from neo4j

13828312
hash	salt
if the salt hash is secure storing it in the server-side session shouldn t be any less secure than storing it in the database

13828312
hash	salt
after all the whole point of using a good salt hash is that even if your database is compromised and someone obtains all the salt hash they still wouldn t be able to recover the actual passwords

13828314
min	max
i did a mean max min sum on the cube and it matches my fortran code

13828321
hash	salt
if the salt and elements which construct the hash are exposed other than the password then it becomes possibly but usually impractical because rainbow tables are useless and brute force is the only way

13828500
width	height
if i wrap the textbox into a contentcontrol without giving the height and width of the textbox like the following

13828500
width	height
in style i use the following to set width and height of the border

13828500
width	height
they rely on the textbox s width and height

13828500
width	height
if i wrap the textbox into a contentcontrol textbox s width and height are set to auto and changed according to the contentcontrol

13828500
width	height
but the style cannot get the exact height and width any more

13828500
width	height
since the contentcontrol is draggable i cannot set exact height and width to the inside textbox

13828534

13829618
integer	fractions
as far as i recall vbscript just stored the date part in the integer or a float and the time part in the fractions part of a float as parts of a 24 hour day so 12 00 is 0.5 hence you can just add them together with +

btw - it is generally considered better to implements runnable than to extends thread

13830699
ember.js	backbone.js
i realize the challenge that you guys are up against but hopefully this at least makes you pause for a minute and think of how you could make life easier for the incoming developer who s worked with other frameworks or hell even worked within an mvc framework like rails or django or backbone.js or angular and say this is how we think ember.js should be used

post	put
also yes when i use the put or post when xml is de-serialized it is not able to create the subclasses if xmlseealso is not present

13831203
for-loop	loops
unless you avoid that problem by having dummy head node so that the empty list contains one node n with and in that case you don t actually want to print the dummy at all and can use a genuine for-loop just put the above condition back into loops statement

13831216
pop-up	dialog
i think you would have to use a fragment and just make it look like a pop-up dialog

13831458
int	double
also use double instead of int as avg returns a double

13831465

13831478
portrait	landscape
from there you may be able to get away with testing for portrait landscape by comparing document.width to document.height something like

versioning	upgrade
so it looks like the online docs are for much newer versioning which you d need to upgrade to to have this predicate

13831495

13839211
post	get
design the service so that if a post fails the client can issue a get on the same resource and based on the data returned they can determine if the post was successful of not

13839211

the problem with this approach is the when you get a 412 precondition failed you can t be sure if your post modified the collection or someone else s

13839211

google-chrome	firefox
use firefox and google-chrome to view the console.log messages correctly

13839575

13840018
getter	setter
once you have this mapping it is up to you if you include the conversion logic directly into the class to getter and setter of urls property or if you use overriden savechanges and handler for objectcontext.objectmaterialized to do the conversion in scope of data access infrastructure

13840107
int	chars
extern c int _stdcall f2 chars txt unsigned chars aerror

13840116
getter	setter
your getter and setter are the wrong way

13840116

a getter should return the value and a setter should set the value

13840124

13840319
sorting	filtering
im using the mongodb c# driver and wanna use filtering by expression and sorting by fieldname

another approach is to create a custom configuration section inherited from configurationsection and add custom properties - make sure these properties are of the types you want to test against

13840399
translation	localization
what causes my problems is that i use a localization directive in the control that should translation the title

then the translation in localization directive ends with exception because it tries to translation incorrect string see localize directive in

13840407
width	height
i m trying to centralise a div boxtest within a div which is 100 width and height fixed

13840409

13840775
client-side	server-side
client-side or server-side

13840861
hide	show
either use fields which hold the views that you want to hide show and use them in the onclicklistener or use findviewbyid within the event handling

13840888
getter	setter
as you can see they re of different types and all have getter and setter

13840888
getter	setter
i d also like to iterate over groups of the variables but with this flat getter setter format i can t really do that

13840888
put	get	getter	setter
this would remove the need to have a container class with lots of getter and setter since i could just call put or get on the map

13841236
dbcontext	objectcontext
we can cast a dbcontext to type objectcontext

13841272
put	get
get requests are working fine put requests are returning 404 not found

13841290
versioning	upgrade
on the other hand if the error is regarding the uploaded file i will have to agree with your statement that the error could be caused by the php versioning being upgrade

13841320
width	height
you need a relative layout which has fill_parent width and height at some layer of your activity

13841425
uinavigationcontroller	uiwindow	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
it is a uinavigationcontroller based application and since ios handles most the responsibility to the rootviewcontroller of the uiwindow i have to manually ask each uiviewcontroller what rotation it wants

13841425
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
as i have a very large amount of uiviewcontroller s manually adding code to each controller to do this would have taken me ages so i made an extension of both the uinavigationcontroller and uiviewcontroller to override these calls and there i could manually set what views i want to block portrait to and what ones to allow it to

13841425
portrait	landscape
at fist i thought this had fixed the issue i also kept the app locked to landscape in the info.plist so that it would launch to landscape and then in the app delegate i called application supportedinterfaceorientationsforwindow and returned all orientations so that my select views could access portrait if needed

13841425
portrait	landscape
the one issue i found however and can t seem to fix is that when i for example am in portrait on my allowed view controller and try to pop back to the previous view controller what is locked to landscape supportedinterfaceorientations is never called again and the view that should be locked to landscape isn t this causes issues

13841457
dictionary	map
note that this will only prevent external classes from changing the instance reference assigned to map not from changing the content of the dictionary itself

13841458
getter	setter
my alternative solution is to use getter and setter

13841463
careplicatorlayer	calayer
i would like to have a calayer class similar to careplicatorlayer but with more control

13841463
uiview	calayer
by backing store i mean the rendered texture for the calayer uiview

google-chrome	safari
there is some problem when it is not present with google-chrome and safari

13841513
d3.js	raphael
in this case the output was converted form d3.js to raphael for final product.

13841558
width	height
for caching the text you can use a html element with visibility hidden but not display none so that it sizes out to accommodate the contents - measure out its computed width and height and use that to size your cache-source canvas

13841562
google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly in firefox nightly 20 and google-chrome 25 but chromium 20 keeps telling me the size of myfile is 19 bytes when it should be several kb and subsequent upload fails consistently

13841565
google-chrome	firefox
more than likely the problem here is that the download location is associated with a specific user profile and the google-chrome driver follows the same pattern as the firefox driver in that by default it uses a copy of a completely clean user profile every time it is run so the download location you set for your user is never picked up by selenium

13841565
folder	directory
under the system user folder find the chrome user data directory

13841570
width	height
set the parent element s width and height larger then the window is its was horizontalalignment.stretch before

13841606
versioning	upgrade
i just upgrade phonegap in my ios app to versioning 2.2.0

13841621
width	height
you then make the height of the upper and bottom row fixed as you make the width of the left and the right column fixed

13841633
antivirus	norton
i am placing this line at the end of the html code and works fine except when some system has antivirus like for example norton internet security

13841638
google-chrome	firefox
this has to be supported on ie6 and up firefox and google-chrome

13841675
google-chrome	firefox
requestanimationframe can throttle to run less frequently when the page is not visible which can save battery life but some implementations of setinterval do this as well currently in firefox and google-chrome

13841679
getter	setter
button is a private variable that only has getter and no setter in view

13841694
accessor	properties
the current plan is for it to be a magical data properties existing solely on object.prototype and acting as an accessor the magical part

13841739
pdu	smpp
for emi2 this is encapsulated into the xser 0c field for smpp this is encapsulated into the service_type of the submit_sm pdu

13841782
melt	reshape
use melt to reshape data

13841788
prepare	execute
however with this solution i would have to instanciate a new pdo object for every call of some method of such class connect to the database then prepare thge query and execute

13841791
noexcept	throw
n3050 introduces a new kind of exception specification noexcept the specifies that the function will not throw any exceptions

13841791
noexcept	throw
unlike throw noexcept does not require the compiler to introduce code to check whether an exception is throw

13841796
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i m with a non-profit trying to raise funds for end-of-year giving to help save animals and this page works on most browsers windows firefox ie older ie google-chrome and mac safari and google-chrome

13841839
google-chrome	safari
the problem is that i want to disable the location bar it works in safari but not in google-chrome

13841849
spaces	delimiter
this should get you the array by spaces as a delimiter

13841853
getter	setter
to make matters worse quickfix n is a port from java with many javaisms that make mapping very difficult using getter setter methods instead of properties

13841924
put	get
i ve verified that i can get around this by creating a new application in my website and put the subfolder in there and then disable forms auth on the application itself but i d really prefer not to do that if possible

13841948
unix	bsd
these two commands would be executed in cmd.exe powershell and under bash if your in a unix environment such as linux osx or bsd

13841951
ftp	telnet
a server account has been brute-forced an ftp telnet user or other common account

13841959
int	chars
you could use an underlying type of ushort it s an unsigned 16-bit int like chars like so

13841982
width	height
as i said before you need to set fixed width and height so we will do it programmatically with a listener in the oncreate

13841990
uilabel	uitextview
i think what you re looking for is more a uitextview than a uilabel

13842001
versioning	upgrade
longer be able to seamlessly upgrade to new versioning of your

13842026
hash	md5
second a cryptographic hash algorithm like md5 doesn t match up well with the need here where you re hashing for performance not security

post	get
i use tip from this post to open new tab however when i go back to old one i get nullpointerexception and my viewscoped bean data are lost

13842065

to fix the width and height programmatically you did it

13842091
gtk	pygobject	pygtk	pygobject
be also aware that pygtk is for gtk 2 only available under linux and windows but it s obsoleted by pygobject for gtk 3 on linux as there s currently no official all-in-one installer of pygobject for windows

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
if you re using compass and sass sass-lang.com like me this works nicely in google-chrome safari and firefox

13842330
google-chrome	firefox
my current solution is to wrap every word in a span but sadly it only works properly in firefox and google-chrome

13842330
opera	safari
if you look at it in opera and safari the words have little gap between them and in ie10 the words are all in one line

13842341
width	height
but the default jframe width and height is zero

13842430
jboss	weblogic
you need to deploy your web service projectb in an application server i.e as a war in a tomcat server or ear in jboss or weblogic etc

13842453
blogspot	blogger
im going to try to develop a web application like blogger blogspot

13842482
rtp	rtsp
after you have a way to encode your still going to have to packetize the data to get it working over rtp which is what rtsp uses to send the media to each client

13842511
free	malloc
apart from that your code leaks memory you never free your malloc ed memory

13842511
free	malloc
since you are programming in c++ i d recommend not using malloc free altogether but

13842576
margin	word-spacing
i think u need to remove span after every single word put whole text in single span and use word-spacing property for example and if u don t want to remove span you can use margin instead of padding

13842620
spaces	delimiter
the problem is that you want to keep some delimiter and not others keep and loose the spaces

13842620
spaces	delimiter
this uses the lookahead and lookbehind regex to find keep the delimiter while we added in a normal split for the spaces to trash those

13842652
maven	pom.xml
a nice alternative to maven is sbt examples use scala but it works just as well for java which required less setup - no need for pom.xml files or suchlike unless you actually want to pull dependencies from a maven repo

13842658
inherited	subclassing
i have two subclassing bed and table which inherited from roomobject

13842715
post	get
you need to post something similar but with enough of your actual code to get the exception

13842738
put	get
if i press up arrow then down arrow here i get the original line and then i can ctrl+a to the front of it but i really have no idea why i was put on the right side in the first place

13843171
for-loop	loops
if you only wanted it to run a certain number of times you could use a for-loop instead or you could have it check for the non- existence of a certain file each iteration and exit loops when you create or remove that file

13843185
lxml	beautifulsoup
i m using beautifulsoup and lxml to parse a html page

13843223
base	fractions
this is due to the fact that many finite fractions can t be represented in finite number of bits in binary -- just as 1 3 can t be represented with finite number of digits in base ten

13843225
mongohq	mongolab
1 host providers - mongodb has only two well known hosting providers mongolab and mongohq both of them charge heavily.and for shared hosting platforms like godady mongodb does not work.so you are left with two choices

13843245
getter	setter
property not working with getter and setter

13843245
getter	setter
then in the implementation i create my own getter setter like this

13843245
getter	setter
if i remove the getter or the setter then it works fine but i can t keep both

13843252
filtering	grouping
the documentation for isotope has the option to filtering multiple grouping of items but i need it to filtering combinations of individual items

13843270
flexjson	jackson
i realize there are other solutions out there like jackson but this is part of a large codebase that already uses flexjson a lot

13843287
post	get
in the code you post sindex will equal soundfilesize when you get to your first if statement

13843304
getter	setter
and i can have a getter that will return the business object based on the index of the underlying collection and a setter that will lookup the data key from the underlying collection and save the object to the database

13843323
getter	setter
you need to declare the instance variable in the interface if you re going to use your own setter getter

13843323
getter	setter
your particular implementation certainly makes a difference they aren t simple getter setter methods as they do something as a side-effect

13843326
put	get
it means instead of to get just an array i have to put variable into a viewmodel return a viewmodel and get those variable from the viewmodel

13843354
put	get
i have an ftp utility responsible for the usual ftp stuff put file get file etc

13843367

cells	tablecell
i thought that maybe it was because i was creating a tablecell and then setting it to equal an already existing table cells instance so i tried this

13843402
cells	tablecell
dr every time i add a tablecell to my existing table on buttonclick it replaces the other cells in my table instead of adding to it

13843564
google-chrome	firefox
this is happening in google-chrome and ie and not in firefox

13843583
serializable	deserialization
this is great because sessions survives after an iis application pool or entire iis restart but it s a bottleneck as it means that every access to the session requires a deserialization and or serializable of the session state objects and after all database connections and so on

13843629
hide	show
the reason i prefer this method over adding the view to the window is because if you ever have a view that you don t want to show the logo you won t need to show and hide something you added to the window

13843649
google-chrome	firefox
webdriver is telling me certain elements aren t visible when they definitely are but only in ie - firefox and google-chrome work fine

you shouldn t be writing routes for the webroot directory and its folder anyway

13843757
free	malloc
when writing c compatible code in c++ where you have to use malloc because some pure-c library is going to free it i would recommend writing up a quick typed malloc

13843771
inherited	properties
looking at the problem from a different perspective since child scopes prototypically inherited from parent scopes this means that any properties we define on a parent scope are immediately accessible in the child scope.

13843787
put	get
when i put the data through utf8_encode first the encoding error goes away but the greek characters get all messed up

13843833
portrait	landscape
my app have two different layout for portrait and landscape mode which both encapsulate a webview and some buttons

13843833

if i put the correct number currently 127 as the max then i get the error java.util.nosuchelementexception because it s looking for 128 as the next iteration

13844034
public	protected
on the other hand it also depends if the files should be protected or they are some kind of public docs

13844100
put	get
to do this the application is put in suspended mode and it will not process rows until it get one of the 2 commands i outlined above

13844101

yes that s fine though you might want to upgrade your java ee versioning at some point as well

13844333
vsto	add-in
i ve got a visual studio 2010 solution which contains a vsto add-in project

13844456
equals	gethashcode
you need to override equals and gethashcode for your object based on the object data if you want to behave in that way

13844462
equals	gethashcode
to check for list equality override equals and gethashcode on your entity class and use sequenceequal on the list

13844472
maven	pom.xml
i shouldn t have to configure maven for the project but the thought is that the configuration should reside completely in the pom.xml for maximum portability

13844529
inherited	subclassing
if b is a subclassing of a and c is a friend of a b doesn t have access to c s private members including the inherited members

13844529
inherited	subclassing
this url states the subclassing of friend classes don t inherited the friend associations

13844532
freemarker	velocity
in java world i would probably use velocity or freemarker

13844790
int	chars
create an int array with the same contents as the chars array and sort that copying the results back

13844890
post	get
if not then check for the get post value being set and if its empty don t include that in your update statement

13844891
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
it works as intended in ie firefox and google-chrome but opera creates a vertical scrollbar to scroll the distance covered by the horizontal scroll bar

13844893
packets	multicast
when i use another program to send a multicast packets to eth2 it works and prints the packets

13844893
packets	multicast
it sees both the packets i send from another program and all the current multicast traffic

13844927
google-chrome	firefox
the issue i m having is that the browsers firefox 17 and google-chrome 23 seem to render the chinese part of the text with fonts as arial that do support those chinese characters making the user believe that the font he s trying to use works fine

13844928
folder	directory
i d like to have something like default root folder for resources inside project directory around classes

membase	couchbase
from the memcache- membase days moxi handles the routing distribution from the couchbase cluster side but then all your appservers hit individual nodes of moxi in the cluster

13845277
implements	extends
you could make your subclasses extends jeditorpane and then create an interface identical to the abstract class that you have now and have your subclasses implements that interface as well

13845281
phpunit	simpletest
i am using simpletest api and phpunit test api

13845294
nsdictionary	restkit
since restkit 0.20.0 the method loadobjectsatresourcepath has been replaced by the following method where it is no longer possible to pass a nsdictionary in parameters which is used as http body json encoded

13845300
implements	extends
you can use abstract methods when you have an abstract class and you want classes which extends it to implements that method because the abstract parent class uses the abstract method - it may be something like print

13845319
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
anyways when ever the over all image view is touched i detect it with touchesbegan touchesmoved

13845319

i do have the buttons working for things like min max restore close but can t quite get how to handle the resize

13845378
gridview	rowdatabound
if you absolutely must retain the data in the gridview s underlying datasource but don t want it displayed one solution is to handle the rowdatabound event on the gridview

13845380
hide	show
if you have other stuff to do or are using some kind of transition you can always hide the tab div immediately afterwards and then show it later

disk	ram
in case someone comes upon this question in the future i tried the ram disk approach using dataram ramdisk which was suggested and it did not yield any speed increase unfortunately

13845428
free	calloc
if i were you i d probably use free and calloc

13845454
hide	show
the details view hide everything with a shadow transforms the parent grid view with css transform and show details in divs inside it

13845537
mouseover	mouseout
i think it s because you re binding the mouseout function inside the mouseover function

13845583
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in google-chrome but the circle is just white in firefox

13845617
inherited	subclassing
if there is no meaningful default and in practice every non-abstract subclassing should either implement the method itself or inherited an implementation from an intermediate class it is a very bad idea to provide a fake implementation in the base class

13845677
width	height
my app has a window with a fixed width height

13845680
rss	feed

min	max
i don t see how you could possibly get 283 if min max are 320 640

13845857
superclass	subclassing
where it makes sense have the subclassing chain to the superclass so the superclass can have default behavior that the subclassing can augment

13845857
oncreate	ondestroy	oncreate	onstart	onstart	ondestroy	onresume	onpause
you do not have to implement oncreate onstart onresume onpause onstop ondestroy onsaveinstancestate onrestoreinstancestate and many other methods

13845857
superclass	subclassing
subclassing can override those methods where desired to add functionality or in some cases replace the existing functionality onsaveinstancestate can chain to the superclass or not as desired

13845949
portrait	landscape
this is because the default zoom level when cropping landscape photos is aspectfit rather than aspectfill as it is for portrait photos

post	get
since there is no direct answer to your question i ll just post a bit of a rant that can hopefully get you off the ground

as david m also said calling findviewbyid after setcontentview will solve the problem

13846451
post	get
anyway to use them from the browser methods other than get or post you ll need to create an ajax call there is a large step-by-step sample on this topic anyway you can also build it with common jquery.ajax by defining the request type

bigger height than a bigger width

13846665
client-side	server-side
this would be primarily for seo purposes and allowing the developers to create the same solution client-side in terms of templating as they do in server-side so it eases development in simplifying how client-side and server-side templates are done regardless of the technology used to setup the websites

13846705
tcpdf	fpdf
php pdf libraries tcpdf fpdf mpdf etc... cannot run javascript code because that would require javascript interpreter and browser rendering capabilities or if it supports javascript it will not run it the way you are used to using it in client side programming

13846705
google-chrome	safari
i m sure there are some other options out there but i am using wkhtmltopdf for years and it produces pdf file looking exactly as the webpage would look in google-chrome or safari browsers and also javascript execution works perfectly

13847182
division	subtraction
there is no such initial value such that subtraction and division work the way you might expect them to such that fold 1 2 is 1 2

13847182
division	subtraction
thus folders of subtraction and division are either sums of inverse and product of inverse ie fold r 1 fold r and fold r -fold r which seems pretty boring or they are fundamentally different things that don t work on empty containers

13847182
min	max
max and min should clearly generate the highest and lowest value for a given type or be the folders of the second type that do not make sense on empty containers

13847182
division	subtraction
the real trick here is that there is no left-hand identity for subtraction and division but there is a right hand identity

13847215
cos	sin	cos	sqrt	sin	sqrt
for a rough idea + - sqrt sin cos etc

13847237

using a gridview you can then set the datasourceid to the id of your sqldatasource

13847460
width	height
the result of this is if you take a div with width height 100 nested inside of another div with fixed size if you apply zoom everything inside your inner zoom will shrink or grow but if you apply transform your entire inner div will shrink even though width height is set to 100 they are not going to be 100 after transformation

let me guess width and height are integers

13847770
integer	fractions
you re getting integer division which discards the fractions part of the result

13847775

i ve also tried changing the height and width to nonzero values thinking it might be doing something weird with those but no

13848095
versioning	upgrade
now if i were doing this purely for myself i would just accept it was a bug in an old jvm and require people to upgrade to the latest versioning of java which works fine but many of our customers are corporate users with very sticky it departments who take ages to roll out updates or users who don t even know what java is let alone know how to update it

13848252
getter	setter
and it would take care of the custom getter setter validations etc

13848303
stdout	stderr
it s the idiomatic way to tell bin sh that stderr should go in the same place as stdout

13848306
width	height
given that you re over the canvas you use getimagedata x y width height to get pixel data of a portion of the selection

13848310

imagemagick	magick++
the magick++ api has likely not kept up with imagemagick api changes

13848399
imagemagick	magick++
the imagemagick api is still available via a magicklib namespace and if you study how the magick++ image class works you will see that it is possible to use the c api and pass the result into image

13848399
magick++	pythonmagick
pythonmagick is based on the magick++ api so it supports what magick++ does

13848414
min	max
you mentioned that you are keeping track of the min and max values for x and y co-ordinates that also seems the solution you have chosen in the earlier question

13848414
min	max
in similar way to this you should be able to find the min and max x y co-ordinates for the erased area from the erase event.

13848414
min	max
you can use similar logic though slightly different and figure out the final min max x y values

13848419
int	double
it s not choosing the type based on the type of parameter you supply just using the default you ve specified for the template is you didn t specify a type but passed say a double the template above would still instantiate over int not double

13848424
swing	windowbuilder
when i select lazy in preferences windowbuilder swing code generation in jframes i get lazy style code for all components

13848462
width	height
since you have a non-repeatable custom shape on the right side by both height and width we should take that piece as a whole

13848462
width	height
so the top cap width should be the height of the image to preserve the shape of the thing on the right side left cap width should be 20 pixels rounded rectangle corners the bottom cap can be 0 since the top cap is the whole image height and finally the right cap should be the width of the custom orange shape on the right side which i take as 40 pixels

13848466
google-chrome	firefox
i am trying to understand then why these three code segments require the same ram usage in google-chrome and firefox

getter	setter
let s say we would want and would know how to make a point in having dynamic getter and setter in javascript more like those in php __get __set

13849533
getter	setter
but as javascript does not have a catch-all property the only thing we could do is to provide a list of possible keys and iterate to add getter and setter on those only and hope none other will ever come

13849533
getter	setter
and then it came to me what if i would use the original window.undefined getter and setter after all it must be called every time i screw up and misspell a word or something

hash	salt
here s a row in the database for a sample user i m logging the salt now though i know it s supposed to be included in the hash

13849681
crypt	salt	crypt	hash	hash	salt
i believe that when i call crypt pwd hash it truncates hash leaving only the original 22-character salt plus prefix thus the output will be the same as hash as long as pwd is the same

13849681
hash	salt
i m seeing clearly there s an issue here in that the salt i m recording is one character longer than the one that ends up appended to the hash but it s the appropriate length for blowfish and anyway making it one character shorter doesn t seem to help

13849860
folder	directory
i have placed a private key generated in college in my .ssh folder under the home directory

13849861

temp	tmp
now the temp file located in private tmp xxxx has the text written in it verified this and then i go ahead and format the command

13851428
temp	tmp
however when i don t delete the temp files and use the same php-created command xml2brl -p private tmp pll_myry9m private tmp pll_dmik7e and temp files in the cli i can run them under my user

13851469
jsf	seam
i think you should look at chapter 3 of seam in action by dan allen for a detailed overview of how seam 2.x extends the jsf 1.2 life-cycle using servlet filters and a jsf phase listener

13851469
jsf	seam
there is also a diagram that compares http request handling with and without seam added to jsf

i tested this in firefox 17 ie 7+ safari 6 and google-chrome v.23

13851776
children	parent
i realize that constants if named well and used well should apply only to a parent class and it s children so i could instantiate them in the frame.py file

13851801
folder	directory
but when i look at the physical folder there is no themes directory and obviously anything under it

13851830
g++	gcc
so i use after which cmake checks for gcc and g++ with success but nonetheless yields

13851852

13851971
getter	setter
you can t do it automatically with the magic getter and setter

13852036

in reality it looks like most browsers don t release these from memory until the whole page is unloaded which is problematic and seems to be quite a few tracking this issue for both firefox and google-chrome at least

13852123
hide	show
this code show the divs with class show_on_success if success true appears in the page s url and hide them otherwise

s + usage can be vectorized with cumsum but the floor on the sum is problematic

13852220
sctp	tcp
i ve asked this question but in sctp environment i didn t get any answer so i ll ask here with tcp as i can use the same design in both protocol almost

13852226
getter	setter
as you can see the storage is still internal you just have getter and setter set for you

13852226
getter	setter
on top of that you can t access your ivar from outside since it has no getter or setter and the implicit declaration is private

13852226
getter	setter
you can only access your property from within your class in this case which makes it somehow redundant the getter and setter you could have declared it as an ivar

13852226
public	protected
the difference between the two is that instance variables declared in the implementation are implicitly hidden and the visibility cannot be changed with public protected and private

min	max
does it have something to do with the min max tag id

13852327
onchange	onblur
when the user moves out from the box it runs an onblur or onchange or some event function which calls a python code that takes some arguments and takes other data from the page and inserts that data in the database and saves

13852349
getter	setter
in python there is no point to creating these sorts of getter and setter that don t do anything but directly get and set the underlying variable

13852349
getter	setter
there can be a benefit in using getter setter but in python there is no real reason to use trivial getter setter instead of just getting setting the attribute directly

13852354
margin	height	width	margin	width	height
you can make a pure css solution using a combination of display table and margin 0 auto along with smart height width settings

13853535
getter	setter
getter and setter allow your code to evolve more easily in the future if getting and setting turn out to be slightly more complicated tasks

13853561
getter	setter
setter and getter have a performance overhead when not optimized out

13853561
getter	setter
however you use getter and setter are there because you might want getting or setting that variable to have additional side effects

13853561
getter	setter
finally the overhead of a getter and setter operation within the context of optimized code is very small not worth worrying about unless the code is hot

13853561
getter	setter
and if it s hot it s so easy to just move the getter or setter to the header file and inline it

13853561
getter	setter
so to sum up getter and setter are well worth the minor or non-existent overhead as it allows you to specify very specifically what can and cannot happen with your object and it also allows you to marshal any changes

13853749
getter	setter
if this is a image class like opencv cv mat or 3d data like polydata in vtk it is better that setter getter deals with pointers iterators than the actual data to avoid memory allocation problem

13853749
getter	setter
when you want to template things the setter getter can be a lot useful to avoid inexplicit type conversion

13853749
getter	setter
a setter getter can be a way to access private protected member which is also allows you to avoid using x as the common name of variable

13853749
getter	setter
more over the setter getter can return a lvalue reference which allows you to do

13853763

i thought if i convert a string into a double or int i could write an if or for-loop

13853923
getter	setter
getter and setter are signs that your class isn t designed in a useful way if you don t make the outer behaviour abstract from the internal implementation there s no point in using an abstract interface in the first place you might as well use a plain old struct

13853923
getter	setter
that s pretty much the whole point af getter setter

it has a built in scanner and takes care of basically everything checking to make sure it was actually an int double etc.. and in the main class you can simply set a value equal to one of the getter methods to make sure it is actually a valid input

13854204
int	double
this class could be useful for many things but could also be considered wasting memory it also checks for double and i in the program it just checks an int

integer	unsigned
in most cases the result will be implicitly converted to the type of whatever you assign it to but if time_t happens to be an unsigned integer type subtraction of a later time from an earlier time will yield a very large value rather than a negative value

13855956
integer	unsigned
every system i ve seen implements time_t as a 32-bit or 64-bit signed integer type but using an unsigned type is permitted -- one more reason that simple subtraction of time_t values isn t necessary meaningful

13865508
post	get
i think your server-side script can only handle get parameters encoded in the url not post data transmitted via standard intput

13865508
post	get
note that there are several different methods described by http these are get post head delete etc

13865508
post	get
most often one of those ways is also called get parameters and the other one is called post data because the get parameters are usually used with the http get method and post data is usually used for the http post method

13865508
post	get
and i think you re mixing up the http post method with get parameters in the successful case and with post data in the unsuccessful case

13865508
post	get
yes post http requests mostly from html s can also be sent url-encoded like get parameters but there s a length limit imposed by the http standard on the urls including all parameters

13865508
post	get
you could simply swap post ... for get ... in that case and it should still work

13865514

13865553
children	parent
i bet that python 3 is less forgiving than 2 about leaving around orphaned stream handlers or something so blowing away the parent process is causing the children to choke

13865853
boost	stl
the question is about a code developed in ms visual c++ 11 with access only to stl no boost

13865902
submit	submission
apparently email is a program that lets you submit an email message a mail submission agent that relies on another program to actually send the message a mail transfer agent

13865983
inherited	properties
by creating a class that inherited from dataannotationsmodelvalidatorprovider and by overriding the method getvalidators it seems plausible that the attributes can be properties injected into before the validation happens.

13866016
rpm	yum
since you don t have internet access on your vm you probably won t be able to use the dependency resolving yum or rpm

13866069

the first format is fine except that it can make runtimeexception like nullpointerexception difficult to debug because the stack trace returns a line number and there are multiple things it could be on one line

13866469
fflush	gets
since you don t have a newline in that printf hello gets buffered up and is not fflush to the terminal immediately

13866496
draggable	droppable
this jquery ui droppable plugin makes selected elements droppable meaning they accept being dropped on by draggable

13866498
fflush	gets
this is because the output from the printf statement is buffered and the write to the named pipe is blocking so the output never gets fflush

13866564
filtering	grouping
when hovering over the first filtering grouping and click on naming voice it filtering properly and the margins on the image placeholders are all correct

13866603
getattr	isinstance
first you can use isinstance on getattr self name and make sure it s a method-wrapper or get the type of the bound version and make sure it s an instancemethod

13866641
post	get
over time you ll learn how to abstract your tools in a manner that will avoid this problem but in the meantime you can fix it by simply moving the lines from queries_final2 import get_db to inside your get and post functions instead of leaving them at the module level

13866642
post	get
if i try head or post instead of get i still receive the same error

13866647
versioning	upgrade
google links said to upgrade and maybe the new versioning would fix the problem

13866770

13867281
bash	subshell
when you bin bash your command is going to run in a subshell so you are immediately exiting the process

13867302
int	chars
if you really want it you could write a class that uses a chars to keep track of the address in memory a chars or short int however the value would never need to be higher than 0000 0111 so a chars would reduce the memory footprint to keep track of which bit in that byte you are at and then overload the operators so that it functions as you want it to

13867325
width	font-size
i need to be able to measure the relative change in the width of the plot area in different scenarios such as change of y-axis labels font-size

add a urllaunchdelegate to your app delegate and at appropriate times viewdidload or viewwillappear have your view controller set itself as the urllaunchdelegate

13867334
client-side	server-side
in your question you were talking about the situation when you have both client-side tests and server-side tests running with mocks

13867334
client-side	server-side
otherwise if you changed the mocks on client-side your server-side tests would fail because they would get the broken mock data

13867334
client-side	server-side
what you need are the integration tests so when you run some client-side code in your headless browser your server-side code would also run

13867338

13867374
uicollectionview	uitableview
uitableview and uicollectionview are both optimizing by removing subviews that are no longer needed and putting them in a reuse queue

13867374
uicollectionview	uitableview
if you use uitableview or uicollectionview instead of a plain scroll view they provide a mechanism to register views in nib for certain reuse identifiers and then the dequeueing will automatically load a new instance of a subview from nib is none is queue or dequeue one if there is

13867376

hash	salt
when you salt your padding your input data with random data then generating a hash value

13867408
hash	salt
this random salt obviously affects the hash value returned so if you had password as your password with a salt your hash value would be completely different than the hash value derived from the password password without salt added

13867408
hash	md5
consider the md5 hash value you get you change just a few characters and your hash change seemingly completely

13867581
dtls	sctp
there are too many security issues allowing webrtc to send to a random address port - we have to make sure it doesn t work as a ddos platform so we require the target to implement ice as an implicit permission to send data and we also don t allow sending arbitrary data just srtp mediastreams and data in datachannels over sctp over dtls over udp+ice

13868079
mouseover	mouseout	button	checkbox

i need a good example of hiding showing the grid columns for extjs 4.1.1a where i can click a button and show hide a column based on the dataindex name for each column i have a itemcontextmenu that grabs the dataindex name for that column or have the column dynamically show hide based on the dataindex name grabbed

13868660
integer	radix
an integer that represents the radix of the above mentioned

13868670
loops	while-loop
i ve tried to write the do-while loops so that it reads the 512 bit array and checks each array to make sure it doesn t contain a new header in the first four bytes of the array which would make it stop and start the while-loop again copying the next one but instead it never seems to find another header even though i know it s in there and it should come immediately after the last 512 bit chunk

13868963
min	max
which gives x for min for and and max for see

inherited	properties
i m not sure if you are referring to the datatable.extendedproperties properties or something else but if you are the properties returns a system.data.propertycollection which inherited from system.collections.hashtable

13869210
inherited	properties
most of the methods and properties including the indexer item being discussed here are directly inherited from hashtable so in general table.extendedproperties key can return any object including null

domxpath	domdocument
i am not entirely sure if you have to stick with a simplexml object but if you don t have a look at the domdocument and domxpath combination

int	double
i was looking through the avx instruction guide and though there are load store and permute operations for 32-bit int values other operations such as determining minimum or maximum values or shuffle operations are present only for floats and double

13869595
google-chrome	firefox
using developer tools in google-chrome or firebug in firefox f12 set a break point in your script and follow the function calls step by step and make sure your library is included and called function is defined before you call it

13869598
floating-point	integer
the bulk of the integer operations for 32b vectors are in the avx2 extension not the initial avx extension which is almost entirely floating-point operations

13869598
min	max	floating-point	integer
unfortunately you cannot use the floating-point min or max operations to simulate those operations on integer data as a significant number of integers map to nan values when interpreted as floating-point data and the semantics for nan comparisons don t do what you would want for integer comparisons you also would need to deal with the fact that floating-point encodings are sign-magnitude so the ordering of negative values is reversed and that +0 and -0 compare equal

13869616
pull	push
note if the push or pull requires you to enter a password then the red gate plugin will stall out and force you kill ssms

13871436
integer	unsigned
it will return the highest possible unsigned 16bit integer

13871447
integer	unsigned
just plug that code in and step through and you will see the value that you get when you cast -1 to a 16 bit unsigned integer

13871447
integer	unsigned
that being said if you think about a cast as simply saying disregard what you think you know about the data at this memory location just tell me what it would mean if you read it as a and if you know that computers usually represent negative numbers as two s complement see above then the answer should by now by pretty obvious c is taking the value in memory and reading it back as an unsigned integer

13871455
for-loop	loops
if you are not preserving the hierarchy in your output eg displaying these items as a list of lists flatten the list and use a simple for-loop and loops counter

13871459

i am creating a game and the games camera width and height is 800x480

13883532
hide	show
another alternative would be do do two stacked divs and show hide them on click of a button

13883564
hash	md5
a good hash is a balance between ease of implementation this kinda rules out md5 unless you re willing to fetch a library hash size you don t want to store a copy of the script in localstorage and its detection capabilities so the string length may not suffice

13883640
equals	gethashcode
if you implement iequatable you should also override the base class implementations of equals object and gethashcode so that their behavior is consistent with that of the method

13883713
hide	show
currently i m using .toggle slow in in some and hide slow in others to show modal animations

13883890
qstandarditemmodel	qfilesystemmodel
as you probably know you are not using your qfilesystemmodel at all and simply populating a qstandarditemmodel with manual entries that you look up

13883890
qabstractitemmodel	qstandarditemmodel	qabstractitemmodel	qfilesystemmodel	qstandarditemmodel	qfilesystemmodel
another way is to just subclass qstandarditemmodel or qabstractitemmodel and do the file system listings yourself instead of using qfilesystemmodel

13883947
post	get
to prevent this you need to implement the post redirect get pattern

13883947
post	get
post redirect get prg is a web development design pattern that prevents some duplicate form submissions creating a more intuitive interface for user agents users

13883952
onresume	onpause
my guess is because it s a common mistake that you are registering the listener in onresume and unregister it in onpause

13883952
oncreate	ondestroy
if that s what s happening changing your code to register during oncreate and unregister during ondestroy will fix the problem

13883956

certainly your web site will rely on 3rd party libraries such as log4net or structuremap but those are extremely well-known and vetted libraries that are not in question regarding their security impact

13884083
metaclass	subclassing
if you re using python 3 it s possible to do this cleanly using a dict subclassing that only allows nonexisting keys to be set and the __prepare__ method of a metaclass

13884116
ati	nvidia
requires one card only works on ati and nvidia cards and it s free

13884142

13884334
folder	directory
my jquery is in a script.js file in my javascripts folder in the same directory as my index.php file

13884379
range	minimum
the minimum levenshtein distance between s or in fact any given length-n digit string that doesn t start with a 0 and any number x in the range 10 m x 10 m+1 -1 is necessarily abs m+1-n since if m+1 n it s possible to simply choose the first n digits of x to be the same as those in s and delete the remainder and if m+1 n then choose the first m+1 to be the same as those in s and insert the remainder

13884379
range	minimum
in fact we can deal with all these subproblems in a single constant-time operation if the smallest easy subproblem has b 10 m and the largest easy subproblem has b 10 u then the minimum levenshtein distance between s and any number in any of these range is m-n if n m n-u if n u and 0 otherwise

13884379
range	minimum
what we will do is design a variation of the levenshtein dp matrix that calculates the minimum levenshtein distance between a given digit string s and any number x in the range b x e

13884398
uiview	subviews
in the subclass i would create a uiview with the two labels or images or whatever and add them as subviews to the button be sure to set interactive for the text and view as false

13884562
subtraction	add	subtraction	addition
such addition or subtraction will be done in thread-safe fashion so it may be possible to use these methods in event add remove methods without additional locking

13885100
google-chrome	firefox
this works ok in ie google-chrome and firefox

13885139
setattr	subclassing
i m not even sure you could overwrite it in a subclassing because i think defining it in a subclassing would still invoke the setattr code

but if there is a solution it would probably involve using metaclass and either creating a property of the metaclass or modifying the metaclass s code for setattr and delattr

13887375
std	ostream
as a side note for this specific case i might recommend that you rely on the std ostream instead of the to_string function since it is more likely that custom types a 2d vector or something will be equipped with an overload for outputting to a stream

13894184
trie	tree
a suffix tree can be viewed as a data structure built on top of a trie where instead of just adding the string itself into the trie you would also add every possible suffix of that string

13894222
post	get
then you must use post not get

13894229
return-value-optimization	nrvo
note also using the for a matrix type is a bad idea because you need to return the result by value unless you are sure that you have a compiler with enabled named return-value-optimization nrvo and tested it works

13894256
inherited	subclassing
i have a subclassing subclassing that inherited from baseclass baseclass

13894256
inherited	subclassing
when subclassing is initialized it calls the baseclass init and my expectation would be â â because inherited to me implies that characteristics of a baseclass pass through to subclassing â that the commoninit method in baseclass would be called during baseclass init

13894256
super	self
let me clarify â i get that self ends up being subclass when i call init on super

13894269
width	height
the reason is that media-list-items is not the full width of it s parent and i only want to drop to the right side which is a different background color the full height

13894454
folder	directory
first copy the lvl library to the folder just at the same directory your project is located

13894476

all widgets have hide and show functions that can be used to achieve what you want

13894670

depending on what your date related operations are you might want to invest in integrating a library such as datejs or momentjs which make things so much easier for the developer but that s just a matter of personal preference

13894674
hide	show
this works but the tooltip is flickering but without the hide and show the tooltip doesn t update

13894701
children	parent
by the way the only change i ve made is moving the dependencies up out of the pom.xml of the children and into the parent

13894712
children	parent
always use associationkey if you return the children in the same response as the parent

13894718
width	height
my question is regarding having 2 divs both having 85 height and 100 width but only displaying one at a time

13894744
versioning	upgrade
if it works correctly you know the problem is probably related to the server versioning and that it might be resolved with a versioning upgrade

13894768

setinterval and settimeout

13894785
google-chrome	firefox
it should run on google-chrome but it is running on firefox

13894789
width	height
set height and width attributes to your iframe

13894798
children	parent
since this simple addition seems to make parent containers properly contain their floating children would in not make sense to default to that for everything and just change it when needed

13894805
width	height
also you should change the iframe to have width and height of 100

13894808
sudo	passwd
sudo nscd -i passwd should work

13894883
post	get
i did a get to the imagegetuploadhandler and copied the resulting link into the testing application where i used a post with a multipart form-data with an image file under the correct key to the upload url

13894995

a text is displayed by defualt show and div named formula1 is displayed when clicked on show it hide the test show and hide the previous div formula1 and text hide appears with another div formula2

13895004
equals	gethashcode
when i say mutate i mean your key object must implement equals and gethashcode to be used as a key for a dictionary

13895004
equals	gethashcode
anything you do to the object while it is being used as a key must not change the value of gethashcode nor cause equals to evaluate to true with any other key in the collection

13895039
hide	show
by using simple show and hide functions..

13895039
hide	show

webclient	httpwebrequest
please let me know if anyone knows how to use a webclient or basic httpwebrequest to download an xls file

13895081
width	height
bitmap data always has a width and a height just take a look at the numbers and if the width is less than the height rotate the image as per alistair3408 s answer

13895086
calloc	malloc
i think calloc or malloc if you don t have calloc is what you re after

13895113
realloc	malloc
this is called dynamic memory allocation as opposed to static allocation and it allows you nice things like changing the amount of allocated memory at runtime using realloc or using a variable in the malloc call

13895113
int	chars
technically sizeof chars above isn t needed because 1 chars will always be 1 byte in size but most other data types are bigger and the multiplication is important - malloc 100 allocates 100 bytes allocates the amount of memory needed for 100 int s which usually is 400 bytes on 32-bit systems but can vary

13895133
qgraphicsitem	qgraphicspixmapitem
it applies to any qgraphicsitem also qgraphicspixmapitem

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
as you ll see the page content loads in firefox and safari however it doesn t get to its final display point in google-chrome

13895400
int	chars
if the field is a varchar 255 that normally contains about 30 chars and the alternative is to store a 4-byte int in the main table and use a second table with a 4-byte int and the varchar 255 then you re looking at some space saving

13895420
disk	ram
from what you re writing it seems that you want to avoid writing the decrypted data to the hard disk which is fine because data written to the hard disk will still be there after a shutdown while data in ram won t survive

13895436
listview	gridview
i realize that i could just create a listview and toggle its and the gridview s visibilities but i d rather not have to bind to an extra control and duplicate other related code

13895452
gmail	hotmail
many receiving servers will simply ignore the incoming message if it does not meet certain criteria in my experience gmail and hotmail are particularly prone to just silently denying delivery so it doesn t even end up in spam

dns	spf
1 you ve set up ptr spf reverse lookup entries in your dns records

13895460
post	get
if you re logging in doing a post see the simpleurlconnections sample app for demonstrations on how to make simple post and get requests of your web server

13895461
post	get
how to post it to the method so i will get it as list or ienumerable

13895478
stdout	stderr
the fact that five stdin stdout stderr input and output.txt file descriptors are open instead of only four when writing the output to stdout makes no difference

13895520
stdout	stderr
apparently i have to start to read the stdout stderr pipe in the loop which checks to see if the process is still running as well as read it after the process has terminated

13895525
mouse	keyboard
like the gridview s events mouse and keyboard events

13895577
google-chrome	firefox
when i try it using google-chrome or firefox everything is fine alert but on internet explorer it fails alert

13895611
tunnel	lan
i routinely shuffle folders quickly across a trusted lan connection with commands such as tar -c | lzop -1 | socat -u - tcp-connect 192.168.0.101 4444 and gzip could be used similarly over a much slower link doing the same thing i just described through an ssh tunnel over the internet

13895664
contentplaceholder	loginview
in the loggedin view of the loginview control is where i put the contentplaceholder for pages that use that master page

when my methds were consuming json post put cases i found out that jaxb had some problems there

13895768
serializable	deserialization
this is what i have in web.xml to enable jackson s deserialization serializable of json

13895794
int	chars
1 is not the int value 1 but the chars literal 1 and has an int value of 49 so i suspect it is not entering that case in the switch

13895797
int	chars
also you re switching on a chars value of 1 not the int value of 1

13895811
lsof	netcat
the advantage of netcat lsof over parsing netstat is that you can t parse it wrong your case would break if an app listened to udp port 13307 for example

13895825
rss	feed
i am able to successfully parse the items title link description creator pubdate and cdata image from rss feed

13895825

width	height
what you re doing is you re trying to initialize the location text width and height properties of the textbox array but the array does not have those properties textbox does

13895901
for-loop	arrays
if you want to initialize an arrays with a non-default value best way would be to use a for-loop as in

13896011
post	get
they re going to want you to post one anyway but if that s all you do it probably won t get answered for awhile unfortunately

13896015
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
although we are missing key piece of information here how is util.datetime.getweekdatepair java.util.date implemented i suspect that what you do there is instantiating java.util.calendar using default locale and then search for first day of the week

13896028
content-length	content-type
host www.googleapis.com content-length 244 content-type

13896034
firefox	safari
in both firefox and safari it passes with no problem

13896034
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i checked and these variables are not defined in safari or firefox so obviously something in google-chrome or one of my google-chrome extensions is defining these three variables

13896048
children	parent
hi i want to make a tree that keeps two-way references between parent and children

13896066

the icu libraries already implement this but you can also roll your own based on the data from above links to convert from any numbering system chars to int or vice versa

13900463
dictionary	map
another approach using dictionary and map

13900470
children	parent
user a adds the parent register and its children to the context

13900470
children	parent
user a deletes the parent and all the children that are loaded in his context

13900470
children	parent
well in practice there is no problem when user a tries to delete the parent there is an exception for referential integrity and the need to load all its children and try again

13900472
for-loop	loops
a for-loop can be rewritten as a while loops in your case this would look like

13900518

after this i want to show hide some buttons on the second game layout

13900557

the 32 bits get just relevant if your are processing these chars in your cpu in a register and you load them as an int

13900562
udp	tcp
if you program udp to make a game you must code 80 of the protocols tcp to make your packettransfer save

13900569
superclass	subclassing
just to add to dave4420 s and jberryman s anwers the problem with defaultsignatures is that you need to describe your default implementations in the superclass not in the subclassing where it would fit more logically

13900594
jsf	jspx
the trinidad 2.x examples use jspx while their old demo site use pure jsf xhtml

13900597

interface like abstract class can have reference to a class that implements extends its but it s not concrete class so you cannot create object on those interface nor abstract class

13900665
post	get
the implementation of the functions getvirtualpathforroutedata and trygetroutevaluesforalias is tied with our solution so i won t post it here but i think you get an idea how it is working

13900710
centos	linux
i need a limit let s say to 6 how many users can be logged in my linux centos 6.3 system

13900723
cpu	processors
but that still leaves the problem that the code uses the memory bus inefficiently cpu and memory never exchange single bytes only cache-lines 64 bytes on current processors

13900806
centos	linux
i have installed a centos linux in a virtual machine

13900828

13900943
org.json	jackson
if also you care about the parsing speed try to use the jackson library instead of the org.json because the first is a few times faster than the second

13901070
pull	push
both sides will need to have the same remote repository - this way you can push - pull wherever you do the work and the code be the same

13901092

13901153
factors	matrix
i would like to convert my dataframe into a matrix that expands a single factors column into multiple ones and assigns a 1 0 depending on the factors

13901155
disk	ram
if the documents in the duplicate collection are much smaller then they can presumably fit into a smaller amount of total ram decreasing a chance that a page will need to be swapped in from disk

13901163
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i m using placeholder for inputs but i am aware that some major browsers ie 9 firefox 3.7 google-chrome safari 4.0 don t support this html5 feature

13901163
required	placeholder
my favourite way to fallback for placeholder is this code which doesn t required any modernizr or other javascript

i never used artifactory but i can guarantee that with nexus and maven configured you can easily retrieve code or other artifacts from a central repository

13901540
cinnamon	gnome
however when i click on the jar file in cinnamon or gnome which is what most of the users will know to do i do not get the correct paths

13901762
google-chrome	firefox

13902041
google-chrome	firefox
modification for google-chrome doesn t look to nice on firefox and on ie it looks the most ugly page ever

13902064
x86	mips
when programming nowadays you typically write in a high-level language such as c or java your compiler breaks it down into assembly language mips x86 etc. and then assembles it into machine language binary which your processor can natively interpret

13902107
children	parent
container.remove removes this from it s parent container while container.removechildren removes all the children from this container

13902117

when i found this directory i found the lib folder and dumped the file in there

13902148

13902199
invokelater	invokeandwait
as discussed in initial threads an initial thread schedules the gui creation task by invoking invokelater or invokeandwait . you are trying to both play a sound and operate a gui on the same initial thread

i expected this code to work as i believe that every scenario has been accounted for if it s jpg png or gif it returns true otherwise it returns false

13902263
salt	md5
you can concatenate a salt string into the md5 function call

13902274

for example if i am creating a class having an int and a boolean properties

13902293

i dont see any true aggregations such as min max sum values but aggregation only to the respect of add another column corresponding to each depot

13902310
ienumerable	ienumerator
ok so i was just working through the ienumerator and ienumerable

13902310
ienumerable	ienumerator
so what is flawed in my understanding the above is giving me the same result that i achieve after implementing ienumerator and ienumerable

13902363
xdebug	xhprof
i spent some time looking at xhprof xdebug

13902363
profiling	debugging
xdebug wont work since i cannot toggle it on and off at runtime our current debugging system allows us to pass an attribute in the url which turns on off debugging as a session variable ultimately displaying the profiling data in the bottom of the page after load - this is very useful

13902363
profiling	debugging
xhprof is closer though it doesn t allow me to break up each function call nor pass additional debugging information to be attached to the profiling element

13902363
profiling	debugging
another example would be attaching incoming outgoing function data and any other debugging information i would like to track to the profiling element

13902381
mouse	keyboard
but from webapps block mouse and keyboard for all the os environment isn t possible

13902397
octal	binary
or radix such as binary octal and hexadecimal

13902401
ienumerable	ienumerator
ienumerator and ienumerable require exactly the attributes that are needed for foreach to work and no others which is why functions can use them as requirements knowing that they will be able to iterate through whatever type of collection they get passed

13902423
hide	show
you could also use named ranges if some of your responses show hide multiple rows it would mean you don t have to hard-code them you can edit the named ranges

13902442
yourkit	jprofiler
jprofiler or yourkit is very good at doing this

13902476
google-chrome	firefox
i have tried inspecting the elements in firefox and google-chrome but cannot figure out what is adding the space

13902518
put	get
when i put page in web-inf and clicking on shuffle i get error

13902529
stdout	stderr
the reason why you got array when you did not specify an argument is probably because the error s send by java are send to stderr and output only gets data from stdout

13902530
width	height
and adjust width and height manually

13902538
int	boolean

because i m not the most experienced at passwords i m not really sure of the best practices how when you hash the password + salt what happens then how the passwords are retrieved.

13902616
scrypt	salt	scrypt	pbkdf2	pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	hash	hash	salt
if you use bcrypt scrypt or pbkdf2 the salt is part of the hash you get so no you don t have to worry about storing it separately

13902616
scrypt	pbkdf2
bcrypt scrypt and pbkdf2 are actual password-hashing functions

13902633
xdebug	xhprof
the live server doesn t have xhprof or xdebug but the development server has what is needed

opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
for firefox safari google-chrome and opera you can use mask

13902866
hide	show
if you don t use the url anchor + css to hide show the corresponding content and you don t have a fallback for users bots without js you should display both at the same time popular and recent content for users with disabled javascript

13902891
mouse	keyboard
i think it ll have to detect both mouse keyboard on any program

13902935
filepath	unc
the error is clear in that dialog box the file you are trying to attach is on a unc share any filepath beginning with is a unc path which is not supported

13902984

13903250
stdout	stderr
you ll want to be able to see error messages in the output redirect from stderr to stdout

13903260
modifiers	sealed
because a sealed class with all static members and private constructor constitutes certain performance enhancements because of the way the il is formed for the use of the static class versus the sealed class in-fact the static class gets the abstract modifiers in il to prevent new from being called where as the sealed class does not

that makes you pass a long double and not just an int which gets converted

13903909
width	height
when you make a chart or a dojox.gfx canvas without width height it will try its best to determine its dimensions from the container you put it in

13903909
width	height
as a consequence i think the chart simply assumes a height of some proportion to the width

13903909
width	height
in your css i see you have a #chartdiv rule with width and height 90

13903909
width	height
assuming you changed that the chart would now use 90 x90 as width height but if you try it you ll see that the labels axis are still positioned incorrectly

you can then just set width height on panelcontainer

in conclusion the reason __iadd__ accepts any sequence is because when pep 203 the augmented add proposal was implements for lists it was simplest just to reuse the extends method

at minimum you need to get mediastore to update its index such as via scanfile on mediascannerconnection as i outline in this blog post

13904433

13904544
tpagecontrol	tpanel
what you describe might be better served using a single tpagecontrol instead of two tpanel controls

13904570
int	chars
as you can see here chars is almost certainly going to be 8 bit so casting that to int is always safe in every sense of the word

13904570
int	double
casting an int to a double however is not

13904579
post	get
you should be able to get a reference to that left most controller in your post with -- you ll need to cast self.navigationcontroller to whatever class that is

13904583
ilist	icollection	ienumerable	icollection	ienumerable	ilist
as with ienumerable there are interfaces that enable you to implement them in a standardized way look for icollection and ilist

oncreate	onnewintent
you ll want to make the code it s own method and call it in oncreate as well as onnewintent

13905114
equals	gethashcode
2 since you re having your own equals now override gethashcode and to be consistent with various equality checking override equals as well

13905114
equals	gethashcode
that s unlike not overriding non-generic equals or gethashcode which can bite back because framework doesn t use anywhere but only if we ourself use it

13905114
equals	gethashcode
1 override equals and gethashcode

13905114
equals	gethashcode
1 override equals and gethashcode

portrait	landscape
i think you can also adjust the margin in percentages if you know if your image is portrait or landscape and the aspect ratio is the same

13905172
free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	malloc
after being initialized with a heap pointer and the size it provides free malloc realloc managing that area

13905173
min	max
it still looks messy but this way you can alter the smooth radius by changing the min and max variables

13905207
free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	malloc
also see doug lea s malloc realloc free implementation commonly called dlmalloc

13905207
realloc	malloc
the former will give you a simplistic internal view of how the malloc realloc functions actually work

13905224
width	height
i think i have achieved that by simple initializing a window with the size of the image and then having a vbo with a vertex grid also of the image size grid of width and height

13905229
spaces	delimiter
by setting the delimiter to the spaces character you get the error that the next newline isn t a delimiter anmore

post	get
i would need to insert a row in the topic table then get the newly generated topicid sequence and then use that in an insert to the post table

13905399
google-chrome	safari
i think your code won t work on safari or google-chrome since transition needs webkit-prefix on those browsers

13905416
post	get
i just dont get it how to catch the data of the ajax post and update the div with the preview image with the id inside

13905421

i can also easily imagine that showing the rss feed on a company web site or on a personal web site that shows advertisements next to the feed is also interpreted as commercial use

13905454
public	protected
you can however access such member though public or protected accessors such as getname

13905455
inherited	subclassing
all members are inherited by subclassing

13905465
jaydata	breeze
i ve considered breeze and jaydata for their crud capabilities and batch operations but i m still not sure on which one suits me best

13905465
jaydata	breeze
in this respect jaydata offers a number of providers over breeze like odata websql indexeddb localstore facebook and yql which is almost overwhelming

13905468
superclass	subclassing
it is correctly making the primary key id in the subclassing table reference the id in the superclass table - but it is also creating a foreign key in the superclass table which it doesn t need

13905529
git-rebase	amend
see thou shalt not lie git-rebase amend squash and other lies for a discussion about why

13905638

maybe it would be good to have one development branch one branch for each stable release and one current-stable branch which is expected to jump whenever a new release is ready

13905648
postgresql	mysql
i don t think mysql does comments this way but oracle and postgresql do

13905676
hash	md5
the first thing i note is that you apply the md5 hash to a php variable

13905676
hash	md5
you should apply the md5 hash client-side with js here an example

13905676
hash	salt
if you want to add another layer of security you should also consider using a salt in addition to the standard hash

13905682

if the property is of a type that s compatible with interlocked methods or if it is a struct with exposed fields of such types the interlocked methods may be used to perform atomic updates to the property

13905752
mongodb	bson
so as all queries are against 2 fields which i know will never change accountid persistedid i dont see any reason why i couldn t query mongodb objects without a strongly typed object to get back the raw bson document then call tojson on that bson document and send back to the client

13905762
folder	directory
i simply created a folder named detail in the directory and copied warpers.hpp to the folder

13905762
folder	directory
your system probably doesn t have detail folder in the directory or has warpers.hpp in the same directory as detail folder when it needs to be in the folder

it s likely that if you use stdio that fflush will portably push data all the way out to the socket or pipe

13905829
put	get
although a read-write property is essentially a get method and a put method and can t really do anything which such a pair of methods can t do one can only get the syntactic sugar associated with properties if the methods are wrapped up in a property which poses various restrictions on the forms the methods can take

13905829
getter	setter
if a read-write property was simply a getter method juxtaposed with a setter method it would be possible to have an abstract readablefoo type with an abstract get for property foo and have a derived mutablefoo type which overrides the get and adds a set

13905840
width	height
select the chart area and set its height and width to identical values

13905909

13906052
children	parent
i ve left the signal handler in place for the parent to notify the children to get weaving but simplified it to simply change the value of a volatile sig_atomic_t variable t by name still from 1 to 0

13906052
children	parent
i ve removed rr since the parent is no longer responding to signals from the children

13906069

equals	gethashcode
2 since you re having your own equals now override gethashcode and to be consistent with various equality checking override equals as well

13906125

that s unlike not overriding non-generic equals or gethashcode which can bite back because framework doesn t use anywhere but only if we ourself use it

1 override equals and gethashcode

13906125
equals	gethashcode
1 override equals and gethashcode

13906147

this means that long can also be the same size as an int which then implies that the min and max for a long and int of the same type signed or unsigned can be equal

13906156
knitr	latex
i became super-interested thinking that similar to integration of knitr and latex into rstudio which enables me to use rstudio for both my r programs and latex codes the new version enables me to do the same with my c++ codes

int	chars
i trying to write a function which gets an int number represented by string and check if all his chars are digits and return #t #f accordingly

13906648
min	max
also there is no point in removing the i from min and the a from max

13906651
getter	setter
the best way to allow for such a pattern is to avoid implementing virtual or abstract properties but instead implement non-virtual properties whose getter and setter chain to virtual or abstract methods

13906651
getter	setter
doing things this way will ensure that there s one patch point for changing the property getter and one for changing the setter and those patch points won t change even if the property itself gets redefined

13906736
pull	push
write my own ssh server that allows msysgit to communicate with a repo pull push etc using the ssh protocol and going though my ssh server

13907153
min	max
alert g min max step - 4975 obviously min max step 1 100 2

13907190
integer	radix
parseint can also be used if you want an integer no floating point number 1.3 but be sure to set the radix parameter in order to always get consistent results

13907191
min	max
alert g parseint min parseint max parseint step has solved it

13907203
keydown	keyup
you should use the keyup event rather than keydown - on key down the field hasn t updated yet so testing the value at that point doesn t give you the right result

yea finally i can upload my whole directory of file to specific folder in google drive simply because of unmatched folderid

13907391

but you ll only get away with this if both ends of your pipe agree on both what sizeof data-type equates to and the byte ordering of int longs long longs float double .

13907399
integer	unsigned
i tossed in some sfinae code to detect that the type i m converting to is an unsigned integer type

13907431
post	get
the other application was set up to receive this data with an mvc controller class collectionaction and insert methods for get and post respectively

13907431
post	get
the receiving application was running the get method collectionaction instead of the post action itemaction

13907431
post	get
i sent the header x-http-method to override the request method from get to post i was already setting the request httpmethod to post but this was being ignored

13907431
post	get
so now i am stuck pulling my hair out because i can see a post request with content-length and data being sent out and i have a get request with no data or content-length coming in but the headers were preserved

13907433
get	http-method	post	get	post	http-method
but in doing so it ignored the http-method and the post data which just got set to defaults get and null

13907480
pop-up	dialog
this is how websites pop-up ads achieve the are you sure you want to leave dialog

13907531
gridbaglayout	miglayout
for that s gridbaglayout you may also want to consider miglayout or jgoodies formlayout as well

13907582
put	get
could have been but maybe not because the compiler or at least the guys who wrote the compiler may well be cleverer than you and it might just remember that it should have put a 1 into it_was_true so that when you actually get around to checking the value the compiler can emit an appropriate branch or whatever

13907584
folder	directory
and when i reload the browswer instead of directing me to the index.html file in my app views home folder it displays a directory structure of my public folder

13907679

13907804
hash	md5
if your partner requires md5 hash algorithm then this solution based on their site will not work

13907824
getter	setter
and call the set functions on it - although i personally would do away with the set functions altogether and manipulate the data in point directly there is no need for the getter setter and they don t buy you anything

13907833
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
an example of a header view would be a uinavigationbar which is included in uinavigationcontroller

13907841
pycrypto	m2crypto
i ve tried several different modules pycrypto m2crypto etc but can t seem to get the correct combination of changing the password to the right size key and encoding everything correctly

13908041
public	protected
if you use public protected functions to init the returned object this should work

13908048
getter	setter
usually the setter along with getter provides memory management and synchronization features therefore is preferable and generally more safe to use it instead of accessing the ivar directly

13908082
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
if yes change this to uinavigationcontroller and call pushviewcontroller instead uiviewcontroller s presentviewcontroller method

13908083
post	get
the following post helped me get it working

13908087
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
on this computer running linux mint 14 so it should be the same limits as ubuntu 12.10 the ulimit -s command shows a stack size limit of 8192 k-bytes which tracks nicely with the problem as you describe it

13908089

i need to send extra information such as image width height for each image

13908115

with out knowing or seeing your code block for a a sible gle its difficult to second guess but if your using show or hide as the swutches to decide wether to show or hide a row.......

13908134
hide	show
where switch is either show or hide and your serverside function to get the display status should be as follows

13908162
folder	directory
as an alternative you can also expand the code to set the current directory to the folder that contains the script

13908202
onresume	onpause
this can simply be done by registering a broadcast receiver using code in the onresume and unregister it in onpause

post	put
controlling the locaiton of the details with css so they re next to the selected post will put it in the same render-cycle as everything else

13908573
setinterval	clearinterval
also note that the return value of clearinterval is not particularly useful since the argument to it should be the value returned by setinterval

13908573
setinterval	settimeout
also note the distinction between settimeout which will call a function once and setinterval which will call it repeatedly

13908580
post	get
for some reason i cannot get the textarea into my ajax and post it to the rest of the application

13908581
for-loop	loops
i have a for-loop i m using to iterate through an arraylist and once i find the object i need i want to set a previously obtained object in a set method for this object set a flag for not found to false and then break out of loops

13908583
getter	setter
i m not creating repeatdaysenumlist but hibernate will do because of setter and getter then how this null value coming.

there s no real noticeable difference but aesthetics and proper usage here all else being equal as a getter and setter method is generated per property per implementation of get and set - so all calls to return the value of a thing from a property is actually a method call although there might be some implementation factors optimisation going on that make using properties better even in terms of speed but with negligible improvements to comparable effect for the most part
