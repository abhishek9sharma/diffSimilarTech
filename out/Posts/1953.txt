actually javascript interpret those variable in octal values please convert them into decimal by using

7205154
colt	jscience
since i have to move from python to java for a project i was looking for any equivalent in well known math libraries colt jscience apache commons math

7205175
integer	unsigned
the easiest way to do this is probably to convert the time to a unix timestamp unsigned integer representing the number of seconds which have elapsed since january 1st 1970

7205227
ssl	https
one of the benefits of ssl the s in https is established tools for key management you won t have to re-invent the wheel

7205265
width	height
the above color code inserted in after width 600 height 400 colors in every other line like it should

7205308
post	get
running python over ssh and trying the same code is successful ie i get a list of post objects

7205344
keydown	keyup
this example creates a textbox and whenever you press a key two messageboxes one for the keydown one for the keyup pop up

7205348
submit	submission
because you re submission the form directly using js you re not clicking on a submit button so none are been submitted

7205357
int	chars
i care a great deal about using the right formats for the right content so i wonder if chars gives any performance improvements over int

7205359
portrait	landscape
thanks both answers are correct and work if i am using different image name for portrait and landscape

7205370
textview	imageview
i am trying to animate a textview sliding down from behind an imageview

7205370
textview	imageview
i am using a relativelayout instead of a linearlayout to get the description textview to appear behind the imageview z-index-wise

7205391
int	chars
the only benefit i can see of using int over chars in this case is slight performance

7205456
comparator	icomparer	icomparer	iequatable	icomparer	iequalitycomparer	iequalitycomparer	iequatable
so i ve made sure to implement comparator iequatable iequalitycomparer and icomparer and sorting works fine

7205530
ienumerable	ilist
c# offers you ienumerable and ilist interfaces and all the stuff that derives from them so no need to stick with old fashioned arrays

7205565
folder	dir	folder	directory
inside your plugin dir look for the org.cfeclipse.cfml directory it probably has a timestamp after the name which depends on your version but there should be only one and inside that there is a dictionary folder containing a bunch of xml files

7205624
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
runtimeexception indicate broken contract like nullpointerexception and should never be thrown if code has no errors

7205630
min	max
the error can be gotten around if you don t care about which row the subquery returns - simply return min terms_id or max terms_id or whatever to only bring back 1 row

7205638
portrait	landscape
it looks great in portrait orientation but there is a ton of white space on the right when it is turned into landscape mode on the iphone

7205711
pop-up	dialog
i have created 2 pop-up dialog box when you click on a link

7205716
textview	imageview
i have a xml component composed by an imageview and a textview

7205725
unsigned	short
this is because when the option is set to no wchar_t becomes a typedef for unsigned short which means you can no longer overload on it

7205725
unsigned	short
as a result the expression invoked the for unsigned short rather than the one for wchar_t which doesn t give the correct result

7205730
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the site works perfectly in google-chrome and safari and only teething problems in firefox

7205747
post	get
yes you can just switch from get to post and it just works

7205747
post	get
get is more appropriate than post for queries because of its safe semantics

7205750
profiler	perf
the stdlib profiler uses feature of ruby that incur a tremendous perf hit set_trace_func among others

7205781
opera	google-chrome
canvas text rotation + scaling used to look awful in google-chrome and opera

7205781
opera	google-chrome
google-chrome has it fixed since version 12 opera still looks awful

7205831
disk	ram
when the operation completes windows might be notified that it needs to pull previously swapped memory from disk and shove it back into ram causing a delay

7205858
firefox	safari
it works fine in firefox and ie as well but not safari

7205885
int	chars
now for the real problem it looks like you have already defined truck to be a string further up in your code so when you try to read write to it as if it were an associative array you are really read writing the first chars in that originally defined string the string key your are using is converted to an int

7205909
junit	easymock
unit testing with junit and easymock

7205909
mockito	jmockit	powermockito	jmockit
you could also check out other mocking frameworks such as mockito powermockito and jmockit

7205922
int	chars
if you re worried about performance a chars 4 takes up as much space and or so one would think disk i o bandwidth and processing time as an int which also takes 4 bytes to store

7205947
sorting	grouping
ordinary key index is key for speeding your searching by this column sorting grouping and joining with other table by this key

7205972
width	height
also to ensure that your layout will not break if the images do not load you could give the a tag the normal height and width of its image

7205988
postgresql	mysql
so a key in a relational database such as mysql postgresql oracle etc is a data constraint on a column or set of columns

7205998
dataoutputstream	bufferedoutputstream
i tried various kinds of outputstreams bufferedoutputstream dataoutputstream pipedoutputstream servletoutputstream

7205999

7206013
mouse	keyboard
so i am not a fan of using mouse unless something cant be done with the keyboard through shortcuts

7206059
postgresql	mysql
oracle mysql postgresql sqlite

7206101
width	height
by that i mean entering new height width value and get new coordinates not using transforms

7206151
pull	push
for the sake of simplicity and interoperating with subversion it is recommended that all git svn users clone fetch and dcommit directly from the svn server and avoid all git clone pull merge push operations between git repositories and branches

7206166
maya	blender
we are considering maya cinema 4d blender or zbrush poser 3dmax however last three does not have scripting language as far as i know

7206198
post	get
however in the database only 234 post get inserted and i suspect it is mysql not being able to insert certain post but i have no idea why

7206199
hide	show
show and hide divs at a specific time interval using jquery

7206200
getter	setter
note getter setter are supported in some js environments which would allow you to map to card.set pip .

7206227
width	height
lastly change you layout height and width attributes to

7206262
width	height
so you can check width and height with the old ones

7206285
firefox	safari
works as expected on safari firefox mac firefox win

7206286
short	base
in short only the base version file is stored statically all the other versions are dynamically generated with base file and necessary change sets

7206356
google-chrome	firefox
i have found that firefox and google-chrome will execute the fb.logout call quickly enough for this to work properly but that ie and mobile browsers because of network speed in addition to differences in the javascript engine will not complete the call successfully before the browser loads whatever page you re redirecting to

7206356
google-chrome	firefox
i was originally putting fb.logout directly in the onclick event of an anchor link and while that worked in firefox and google-chrome it did not work in ie or in my android browser

7206419
min	max
i just want to get a list of the first and last days basically and max and min day date for each year-month combination

7206429
sql-insert	sql-delete	sql-insert	sql-update	sql-delete	sql-update
you can use loader sql-insert sql-delete sql-update elements to configure store procs for entities and lazy load collections although it means quite a lot of keystrokes

7206455
folder	directory
i have wcf service that twice a minute check programdata myapp folder and send all xml-files from this directory to sharepoint site

7206511
google-chrome	firefox
i was originally putting fb.logout directly in the onclick event of an anchor link and while that worked in firefox and google-chrome it did not work in ie or in my android browser

7206511
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome will execute the fb.logout call quickly enough for this to work properly but that ie and mobile browsers because of network speed in addition to differences in the javascript engine will not complete the call successfully before the browser loads whatever page you re redirecting to

7206513
post	get
i tested it and binding works in both get and post scenarios

7206528
width	margin
the reason this fails is that the column mixin not only sets the width of the element but also floats it left and applies a right margin unless it s the last column which has no margin

7206528
width	margin
so you can use span here to simply set the width without getting the float and margin that column would add

7206528
width	margin
if you just apply the margin yourself you don t need to override the grid width that container sets

7206596
savefiledialog	folderbrowserdialog
well if all you need is for them to pick a directory then you don t need the savefiledialog and can instead use the folderbrowserdialog to at least let them choose where it goes

7206601
width	height
use max-width in your css to fix a maximum image width and don t specify your image height

7206616
postgresql	mysql
inspectdb works with postgresql mysql and sqlite

7206616
postgresql	mysql
foreign-key detection only works in postgresql and with certain types of mysql tables

7206619
treelist	grid
i would like to fill the grid with data after selecting some nodes on treelist

7206619
treelist	grid
the treelist nodes are filtering the grid data

7206620
post	get
you can create two copies of the controller method one for http get and one for http post

7206640
width	height
height and width are dynamic

7206661
savefiledialog	folderbrowserdialog
as adam said above you could just use a folderbrowserdialog instead of a savefiledialog

7206807
gtk	pygobject	pygtk	pygobject
i m currently foolish enough to try to maintaintain two parallel code bases for a python desktop application one using pygobject introspection for gtk 3 and one using pygtk for gtk 2

7206807
pygtk	pygobject
i work mainly on the pygobject branch and then i port changes over to the pygtk branch

7206807
pygtk	pygobject
i ve seen that there are some libraries for this but the main ones for pygtk haven t been updated in years and so they will almost certainly fail with pygobject introspection

7206868
width	height
haven t tried it but the first thought i have is to gather the x y coordinates height width of the area you want it to change the class over

7206877
inherited	properties
im trying to create a domain class constructor that inherited another class properties dynamically

7206945
width	height
from there you will need to iterate x y over width height and suppress non-maximum edges

7206965
post	get
if someone ends their session on facebook.com their session on your website is still present - though if you tried to get or post data to facebook using that session it would probably fail

7206974
coldfusion	railo
due to a bug in adobe coldfusion that doesn t work like that though it does in other cfml engines like railo and you have to split it into two lines like this

7206991
textinput	textfield
then simply style the textinput to make it look like there s only one textfield

7206994
hide	show
i have treeview in windowsform application when searching for node is performed i need to hide all the remaining node and i need to show only the searched node and its parent .like

7207003
mouse	keyboard
you should be more worried about the slow response times from the keyboard and mouse

7207004
facebook	fbconnect
i am a facebook developer have a site which registers using fbconnect register feature button

7207012
vsto	add-in
i have a vsto add-in which allows users to drag n drop emails to an item in a listbox and save it

7207036
queue	fifo
you can create your own serial queue that will execute in fifo order with dispatch_queue_create

7207061
jobs	cron
php running scheduled jobs cron jobs

7207075
firefox	safari
this worked fine in safari but not with firefox

7207089
put	get
you might get better help if you put your query on where the readers deal with this kind of data all the time

7207094
listview	gridview
implement a scrollable listview for most sizes a paged gridview for a very large list or a single textbox if your list is very small

7207120
windows	wow64
the other direction is possible through an emulator on windows it is called wow64

7207150
button	checkbox
problems no support for checkbox or radio button

7207153
ssl	https
if the asset you need is available on ssl then always use the https asset

7207166
profiling	debugging
another thing to try is the excellent entity framework profiling - has saved us many headaches in debugging performance issues like these - gives you a lot more than sql profiling and you can see what queries objects are created per objectcontext and method source line etc -

7207178
jar	war
the created artifact jar is not supposed to have any persistence.xml because it is already contained in a war file which includes several modules

7207183
hide	show
it looks like you re trying to flip between two different images not just show hide a single image like the other answers show i m basing that on the fact that in your examples you reference two different images. if i ve understood that correctly then you can do the following

7207197
opera	firefox
be aware some browsers like firefox or opera might be masquerading as ie

7207223
getter	setter
use property declarations to synthesize your getter and setter

7207270
put	get
you can read file system using file api then get resulting data to javascript array string and then put this content to a websocket message

7207273
min	max
now extract the min and max for each month

7207293
openssl	gnutls
edit 2 it appears that the difference between command-line and library use is that the command-line version is linked to openssl and the library is linked to gnutls

7207304
realloc	malloc
you could also create it on the heap with malloc and friends but again you d need to make it large enough at the outset to hold your extra values or else grow the array as necessary with realloc before adding your new values

7207387
disk	ram
today most of the functionality is written in c or perhaps c++ but one still needs to go to assembler for the very earliest stages that take over from the bios loads more code from disk than the single sector bios gives you and puts the processor into protected mode so it can access more than 1 mb of ram

7207387
free	malloc
no malloc free new delete unless you implement them yourself for example

7207415
client-side	server-side
the demo link that you sent along does show the server-side automatic crud operations with inline editing not client-side

7207451
int	chars
the tilde chars is used as an operator to invert all bits of an int bitwise not

7207454
packets	multicast
failing that try running tcpdump and see if there s a device that s spewing out multicast packets on the network

7207491
width	height
the sub-view the one contained in the white section is 75 width x 160 height

7207506
short	base
in short a base class pointer may point to a derived class object even if derivation is protected or private

7207513
int	double
three of the four columns are int or double so i could add an if statment to convert searchstring to a number if needed

7207517
client-side	server-side
this way you don t have to perform a bunch of style changes in server-side or client-side code after the page has loaded or mix your user preference code in with your html or change much about the base pages if you want to change the way the stylesheet works

7207584
draggable	droppable
the droppable method then provides an event called over which will execute a function whenever a valid draggable object is hovered over it

7207587
unix	bsd
exception when running on certain bsd s or other unix s or managed hosts you don t control

7207589
button	checkbox
from their inbox my users can select multiple checkbox click the delete button and selected messages are removed

7207593
int	double
for searching a column with int using double equals should work fine too

7207598
post	get
i realise that similar questions may have been asked here before but as i am a complete novice the post that are saw here did not contain enough information for me and i require as much help as i can get - almost a step by step guide

7207661
put	get
unfortunately the xslt has been mangled a bit by the blog engine and i haven t put in the effort to get it working yet

7207665
rss	feed
i have an rss feed that pulls in three weather images sky temp and wind

7207665
rss	feed
the wind images are titled as follows windn.gif windne.gif respectively for all directions.the rss feed sends the wind image title in the exact same format

7207665
rss	feed
i also cannot get the rss feed changed to have no caps in its title format

7207673
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseleave
try mouseenter and mouseleave instead of mouseover and mouseout

7207681
put	get
its broke if you put a filter in you get the erroneous error message and no data in your chart

7207730
move	drag
i am trying to create a mechanism to allow the user to right click and drag on a toolbar in order to move a window.

7207740
updatepanel	scriptmanager
since you re using a scriptmanager and updatepanel use the asp.net ajax pageload function

7207770
jquery	simplemodal
i ve noticed that many plugins such as simplemodal that work fine in a desktop browser do not work fine on the ipad with jquery mobile

7207778
for-loop	arrays
this works because the way the for-loop is written it s going to return the first one that it finds that has the most duplicates so if the arrays is sorted the smallest number will come first so it ll be the one that the for-loop finds

7207783
xslt	xquery
you either have to live with it assembling the text yourself at application level or use a higher-level interface for xml processing such as xslt or xquery

7207847
move	drag
for a business reason i need to move the canvas also if i hold and drag the canvas

7207889
width	height
if you simply leave out the page height and width properties as follows it will work fine

7207891
box-sizing	border-box
there is a css3 box-sizing border-box style that will let you do what you want

7207903
contentplaceholder	loginview
i would place a contentplaceholder in the master page that contains a loginview control

7207903
contentplaceholder	loginview
the reason for putting the loginview control in a contentplaceholder is so that your pages that use the master can easily replace or remove the menu if needed

7207914
int	chars
in your case using chars and int there are no differences

7207915
int	chars
have a table with file ownerid int ownertype chars 1

7207926
int	chars
in the case of a chars and an int which are both primitive types initialization actually means no initialization here

7207934
int	chars
for small types like int or chars this isn t a big deal but when those member variables are large types that would take lots of cycles to construct you definitely want to use the initializer list

7207934
int	chars
1 for built in types like int and chars they are actually not constructed at all

7207952
post	get
but to get the information it has to redirect out to the login site which sits on a different server and the login site then post back the login information to the php page and the php page turns the raw data into something the first page can understand

7207977
google-chrome	firefox
i am defining this function in javascript and i am getting an error like myobj is undefined in firefox and google-chrome

7207994
getter	setter
it is always recommended to use getter setter for accessing private variables

7207996
hindi	tamil
however cp1252 doesn t support tamil and hindi characters or â º

7208013
post	put
usually i would just put all objects from these three arrays into one array and compare them using the same variable which they all contain but in this case post has the variable dateofupload and like and comment have the same variable date

7208033
getter	setter
and that would save you from having to make massive amounts of changes to where you accessed the public property instead of using the getter setter

7208038
ienumerable	icollection	ienumerable	idictionary	idictionary	icollection
if i implement idictionary it seems that it is a bit of an over kill to implement all the idictionary icollection ienumerable and ienumerable

7208042
hide	show
if you want to hide and show the div with id addchild while clicking the button with id addbutton

7208076
width	height
we re building out the page as a grid and setting the transposed height width from the printdocument s printablearea

7208076
width	height
this gets the content to be rotated correctly and everything appears to be stretched the width well height in this case of the page but the bottom section is being cut off

7208076
width	height
it s almost like the content displayed to the normal width of the page typically the 8.5 width although it was rendered to the height of the page the 11 height

7208082
webclient	webrequest
webclient doesn t allow you access to the webrequest object used so you ll need to drop to using webrequest webresponse directly

7208086
implements	extends
it will produce a family of concrete products that extends or implements the abstract products

7208090
accessor	ivar
if the imagearray is an ivar for an object perhaps not a safe assumption you should use an accessor to set the array to nil

7208113
couchbase	couchdb
normally nosql database work handy when you know which object you have to retrieve from the database if you need to have some query on your data think about couchdb or couchbase or mongodb which use json like document to save data and gives you querying ability with different pros and cons

7208122
clang	llvm
at the moment i think that your best bet is clang you can try some simple code on the try out llvm page

7208122
clang	llvm
when compiling c c++ or obj-c with clang llvm you may ask the compiler to emit the intermediate representation llvm ir instead of going the full way to assembly binary form

7208122
clang	llvm
clang lowers the c++ code to llvm ir

7208134
post	get
the model binder could do you a bad joke d if for example you have a class account with a property isadmin and you expose this entity in a registration form the user could try to pass an arbitrary isadmin true parameter in the get string or in the post payload and the mvc model binder will set that property in your model.

7208150
width	margin
if it s at the end for instance you can then give the placeholder a negative top margin that s the same width as your border thickness - so basically you re drawing a rectangle of the background color on top of the bottom border of the last item in your list

7208162
pull	push
later when the next user tries to push the changes git will give error that the global repo has been changed and you must pull the changes first

7208169
getter	setter
so this is twice times slower than using a getter or setter and 3 or 4 times slower than accessing the property directly

7208174
terminate	timeout
the session key is discarded when the ssl session either timeout or is terminate

7208190
min	max
still need to set the x axis max min values as well though

7208213
hide	show
clickable so clicking on the show content will not hide the content

7208215
inject	interceptor
if you need to inject something beyond that you can also use an interceptor

7208223
firefox	safari
this code works fine in firefox and ie but when i access this cookie s data in safari - an empty string is returned

7208242
hash	md5
uuid3 generates a uuid by taking an md5 hash of an arbitrary name that you choose within some namespace url domain name etc

7208242
hash	md5
uuid5 is the same as uuid3 except using a sha-1 hash instead of md5

7208243
put	get
to correct this you need to put your code within the sandbox that created the widgets or get a pointer to that sandbox for your use function call

7208288
width	margin
p s total width of divs with margin is 1345 1400

7208331
g++	gcc
note that i don t mind using g++ for the unit tests as long as i can use gcc for the project itself

7208403
gridview	repeater
you can set up a web service or controller that allows you to retrieve data by the page much like just calling a paging service using gridview or other repeater

7208420
hide	show
a better approach would be to have the img there all along and just show hide it when dragging

7208454
primes	modulus
if the only reasons that the things being compared wouldn t match would be random corruption of one of them then the use of a primes modulus for an adler-32 checksum is probably not particularly helpful

7208454
primes	modulus
it wouldn t be especially likely that they d occur an exact multiple of 257 bytes apart but it s a risk which can be avoided by using a primes modulus provided at least that the number of bytes in the file is smaller than the modulus

7208459
client-side	server-side
i need to know best practices for how the data-flow of an interactive web application can be best organized in terms of database server-side code and client-side code

7208459
client-side	server-side
i have been using jquery s ajax function to make calls from the client-side to the server-side to retrieve a json string and then parse it

7208474
inherited	subclassing
also important is that public non-static methods could be inherited and overriden by a subclassing so making them static could actually break the code in possibly unexpected ways

7208490
width	height
i would like an image to have proportional scaling to be as big as posible but no bigger than div either the image width should equal the div s width or the image height should equal the div s height but i dont exactly know which case

7208530
invokelater	invokeandwait
by caling code wrapped into invokelater invokeandwait

7208556
jobs	cron
we used in one of the project to schedule jobs at fixed intervals using cron expression

7208577
google-chrome	firefox
however ff5 mozilla firefox 5 is not allowing members to see it whilst browsers such as ie9 and google-chrome are fine with it

7208606
superclass	subclassing
my factory class has a collection of classes i don t want that dependency when i add a subclassing of superclass i need the factory file to stay unchanged

7208606
superclass	subclassing
my factory class has to return all superclass s subclassing instances but i can t have a collections of them or their names because that s means i will have to change the factory file whenever i add a new subclassing

7208609
hide	show
the current version of jqm uses and to show and hide the loading spinner respectively

7208614
getter	setter
you do not want all of your private variables to have public getter and setter

this page provides a nice graphic-equipped explanation of md5 and similar hash functions and how they re used an illustrated guide to cryptographic hash

7212629
width	height
consequently i can t include the image width and height in the tags because i don t know what they are

7212629
width	height
in order to get around this at the client side i use cycle s onbefore to fire a script that dynamically looks at the image being processed and then sets the slideshow container to a width and height matching the photo s native width and height

7212631
folder	directory
i also tried to create a database folder in the src directory and then put the db file inside the folder src database database.db and access it using

7212634

7213015
inherited	properties
of course when you have unique per-item properties the unique values for each object then yes you can can performance issues i hesitate to use the term instance because it doesn t mean the same thing in prototypical inherited compared to class based inherited

7213015
children	parent
instead of looking at it as the child doing stuff look at it as the parent prototype tending to the set of functions that live on it like a central phone operator that everything routes through with children as thin clients

7213015
inherited	properties
the constructor properties inherited same as anything else but they re all named constructor so you only get the direct prototype s constructor for free

7213025

7213160
fast-forward	merge
then you just checkout master and do a regular fast-forward merge of mybranch

7213165
getter	setter
i am still very confused about getter and setter methods

7213187
getter	setter
the point of getter and setter is that only they are meant to be used to access the private varialble which they are getting or setting

7213187
getter	setter
there is no requirement for getter and setter to start with get and set - they are just normal member functions

7213196
fast-forward	merge
note it will be no harm since it is only a fast-forward merge and would not clutter your history

7213217

int	boolean
boolean promptmenu int menu

7213302
getter	setter
other than that i see 3 reasons for having getter and setter

7213302
getter	setter
2. classes with getter and setter often follow the java beans design pattern

7213302
getter	setter
wrapping the date variable with getter and setter that operate only with the value not the reference would prevent this

7213335
getter	setter
getter and setter -- how properties are accessed -- still function like methods in this regard

7213335
getter	setter
the copy of the structure value is made when it is returned from the getter or passed to the setter

7213356
macports	homebrew
instead install it from source in a different location or via homebrew or macports in their default location then add this line to your .bashrc or .profile

7213369
put	get
i get an uncaught typeerror illegal invocation for both versions of this attempt to put down an eventlistener i get the error when the listener should be added not when i click on the target

7213387
bufferedreader	bytearrayinputstream
copy all the data to bytearrayinputstream and use tostring on it or read text as text using bufferedreader

7213458
return-value-optimization	nrvo
see below the difference with the second case is that the compiler was smart enough to use the nrvo named return-value-optimization and elide the middle copy instead of creating a temporary copy on return from play the compiler used the actual b inside of the play function as the rvalue for t1 s copy constructor

7213503
width	height
the map div must have width and height declared otherwise it doesn t work

7213529

i am having to format the values appropriately so that string chars int decimal are inserted correctly

7213621
int	chars
they are assigned to int and chars variables at least that s my goal

7213645
width	height
also when you create new view then you have to set its layout parameters height width

7213648
width	height
you can look at the output html sample to get the code to generate width and height attributes instead

7213750
post	get
i found a post on a forum i will add the link if i can find it again that explains this issue and indicates that in order to get this type of xml jaxb needs to see a collection rather than a map

even though it displays fine in firefox google-chrome safari it s having difficulties rendering in opera

7213773
width	height
width and height practically work on checkboxes only in internet explorer

7213775
inherited	properties
the power of inherited is in being able to abstract away general properties behaviour to a common class and then derive specialized classes from it

7213874
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works for firefox safari and google-chrome but not ie

if you can t get put post delete those resources then you shouldn t map them in rest

7214139
put	get
if the format for currdate is fixed i guess you will have to process your string and put a number of if and else to get the final result

7214154
inline	inlining
the advantage is that the compiler has access to the whole code and that means that it can take the best decisions as to whether it inline or not the code and might be able to optimize further in the case of inlining

7214181
pull	push
make something with your repository clone push pull and view the output

7214189
serializable	deserialization
the binary serializable standart one is usually cheap in terms of memory used on hard disk but not very scalable as one time you refactore your code you will face deserialization problem of previously saved binaries

7214190
width	height
also it enables you to see the real width height margins and paddings of a element

7214215
jtree	jinternalframe
you might use jinternalframe if you like them or simply use a main panel with a cardlayout and display the appropriate card depending on the clicked menu item or the selected jtree node as it s done in windows explorer and similar applications

7214256
prepare	execute
to make work for non-predefined insert array crete a varible to hold the array size from your data entry page and change the delete to insert into table prepare statement and execute

awt	swing
there are many examples of this in the java awt swing apis for example focuslistener and focusadapter

7214338
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
these div s tend to move around in firefox in safari and google-chrome everything is okay

7214351
inline	inlining
inlining could in theory improve the performance but the users functions cannot be inline a compiler cannot inline code that hasn t been written yet

google-chrome	firefox
fe restricted access page works fine with firefox but in ie and google-chrome it not

7214433
postgresql	mysql
but in mysql it is ok and in postgresql it is wrong and ask for the other fields besides site_id either in a group by clause or in a aggregation function i know that postgresql is stricter on sql than mysql so i must select the site_id in the query object of msg_published but in pure sqlalchemy i can do like this

7214445
superclass	subclassing
i ve created a superclass control and a subclassing led

7214445
width	height
control s initializer sets several attributes like height width that sort of stuf

7214527
onresume	onpause
when i am switching between first two activities the activity which is going to background passes the onpause state while the new one becomes active and onresume is called

7214528
multiplication	modulo
looking only at the units digit of an arbitrary product is equivalent to taking the remainder of the multiplication modulo 10 for example

7214530
multiplication	exponent
i m sure there s a proper mathematical way to solve this but i would suggest that since you only care about the last digit and since in theory every number multiplied by itself repeatedly should generate a repeating pattern eventually when looking only at the last digit you could simply perform the multiplication until you detect the first repetition and then map your exponent into the appropriate position in the pattern that you built

7214584
viewmodel	caliburn.micro	viewmodel	caliburn
according to structure viewmodel knows about abstract iview.if you worked with caliburn caliburn.micro mvvm frameworks you remember viewaware class and iviewaware which allows get view in viewmodel

7214586
switching	screens
unfortunately currently it is not possible to switching off the type verification using jsdt configuration screens in eclipse

7214587
dictionary	map
however it should be accompanied with a well-planned memory management strategy if you have a dictionary of tile locations that naively map to vectors of entities you re going to have a lot of memory being allocated and freed when entities move from one tile to another

7214612
exponent	modulo
after that just call it with modulo 10 for you desired base and exponent and there s your answer

7214754
hide	show
i want to show or hide some fields using a select s value as criteria

7214754

instead it returns a date object in iso 8601 2004 format yyyy-mm-dd hh mm ss which if you try to put date before it you ll get a syntax error

7214788
hide	show
you can use jquery s toggle method to show and hide elements

7214788
hide	show
you can also pass in a boolean to the method which will only show or only hide the elements

7214823
filtering	grouping
you can create mutually exclusive grouping by flagging each row in an inner query and then filtering on that

7215160
websphere	ibm
application servers like oracle weblogic or ibm websphere application

7215160
jboss	weblogic
so my question is in what situations you think you need an so called advanced server like weblogic websphere jboss

7215165
ant	maven
if you don t like the repeated call to #attempttostartseleniumserver and are using either ant or maven in your project have a look at the available ant task maven plugin which can manage your server instance

7215344
int	chars
the second line just converts an int value to the chars represented by that value in the ascii table

7215356
geany	notepad++
i think a lot of that is the scintilla engine not geany so notepad++ likely also provides that ability

7215357
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
you ll notice your first use of .clone in code actually functions just fine in ie9 firefox google-chrome and safari

7215372

7215677
ddms	adb
when my phone was connected by adb and i was checking new files with ddms there wasn t any file on foreign path

7215703
children	parent
instead of creating parent children and grandchildren at a time as mentioned earlier i want to create parent first then child and grandchild together

7215716
accelerometer	gyroscope
the ipad first generation does support cmmotionmanager as it has an accelerometer but won t return any gyroscopic data - it doesn t have a gyroscope

7215738
width	height
there are no built in settings to control the window minimum width and height so you will need to handle it with code

7215750
pop-up	dialog
when i click a link with removelink class it works properly and dialog pop-up but after i click on a link with responselink class and then click on a link with removelink the page does not show dialog and link works as a normal link

7215759
free	malloc
i m calling malloc free many many times a second always with the same sizes there are about 10 structs each fixed size

7215760
hash	md5
you can just use a simple hash like md5 to determine if their contents hash to the same value

7215767
udp	tcp
it s a great library for developing networked systems has a lot of proven production usage and is well suited for things like tcp or udp client-server communication

7215778
udp	tcp
the use of rpcs as an abstraction do not preclude the use of udp as the transport layer rmi is an rpc abstraction that generally used tcp under the hood last time i looked

7215841
xml-rpc	json-rpc
if you re interested in rpc there is always xml-rpc and json-rpc both of which have free open-source c++ implementations

7215841
xml-rpc	json-rpc
they also have java implementations so you might even be able to support both java and c++ applications with xml-rpc or json-rpc if you want to go down that route

7215862
multiplying	add
if you know the range of you numbers you could multiplying the x by some large number and then add y to that number

7215892
tripledes	aes
that might not always be easy on your shared server but your java application could only choose to use tripledes idea and aes

7215895
fink	macports
you must use it instead of fink or macports in order for the following steps to work for you

7215911
int	chars
you will also need to cast the result from system.in.read to a chars from an int or else use or something like that.

7215935
teamcity	jenkins
with this in mind i have developed a standalone build radiator web-app that talks to jenkins and teamcity over their rest apis

7215952
int	chars
even if you change the above two it wont work as system.in.read returns an int not a chars you d need to either make a stack of int or read the value from the input to a variable and then cast it but its not a good practice

7216038
int	chars
primitive types can be auto-boxed when necessary that is they can be converted to a wrapper object like chars or int but only when the value to be converted is a constant expression that can be represented by the target type

7216038
casting	autoboxing
you could work around this by explicitly casting the read result to a char and then letting the autoboxing convert it to a character but that would hide eof which is represented by a value of -1

7216074
awt	swing
however i would like to use swing awt to present a user interface

note although this is beyond the scope of what i m asking i ll throw one more thing out there just in case it would also be great if it could recognize changes that are out of order....for instance if someone changes the order of two paragraphs while leaving them otherwise identical it would be awesome if it recognized it as a simple move rather than as one subtraction and and one unrelated addition

obviously tags need to be excluded from conversion otherwise the html won t work - doing this is really the complicated part - to be sure of success it is necessary to use a parsing package like lxml or beautifulsoup

7216982
width	height
given that the width and height properties of size are inlined i can see that there wouldn t be much penalty from storing a size as you suggest.

7217758
mousemove	mousedown
jquery binds to all present and future elements so if you need to add a mousemove and mousedown to a dynamically created element this should work again in chrome at least

7217790
post	get
then post some specific questions and i m sure you ll get some help here on the specific issues

7218234
integer	unsigned
there is no standard type called u32 but if you stdint.h for c you can use std uint32_t 1 a 32 bit unsigned integer which is i assume what you want

7218575
inline	inlining
since different methods can be inline on different machines how does inlining not break the stack trace mechanism

nsurl	nsstring
i append the hashmark to the nsstring then i turn it into an nsurl using fileurlwithpath

7218742
mouseleave	mouseenter
however when the button is eventually released the appropriate mouseenter or mouseleave event fires if the mouse has moved in or out of the panel while the button was down

7218742
mouseup	mouseleave	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mouseleave
if you definitely need to fire a mouseup when the mouseleave the panel you can check the mouse location in the mousemove event and call mouseup whenever it is outside the panel and the button is pressed

7218748
actualheight	actualwidth
the actualwidth and actualheight properties however do not return the correct value that is the difference between the points

i need to use the actualwidth and actualheight properties since i am using an algorithm which uses those properties for other shapes

7218773
octal	binary
8 is not an octal digit no more than 2 is valid in binary or g is valid in hexadecimal

7218776

7218807
post	get
but when i post the form with html in the dynamic tab content i get the following error

7218860
width	height
if you want to avoid having the images cut off you need to explicitly set height and width on the div s.

7218860
width	height
with those numbers matching the height and width of the images

7218861
client-side	server-side
javascript is a client-side scripting language it can not store anything on your server as you will need a server-side scripting language

7218908

7218950
nsobject	nsuserdefaults
which indicate that nsuserdefaults inherits and extends nsobject

assuming that each library s dom ready function works as advertised the dom should be available when either one is called which is the only point of using those methods anyway

7219047
cpu	affinity
if you can do the latter then look in to cpu affinity under linux

7219058
min	max	range	max	range	min
inside the range min max inclusive

7219066
for-loop	loops
if you want to limit the scope of line variable to inside loops only then you can write a for-loop as

7219070
min	max	range	max	range	min
however i should point out that the range -3 -29 has its min and max reversed

7219104
width	height
lets say one div has width w1 and height h1

7219202
x86	64bit

7219252
stdout	stderr
dumps the stderr and stdout streams

7219252
stdout	stderr	stdout	fflush	stderr	fflush
the problem especially when mixing stdout and stderr streams is that there is reliance on the streams being fflush by the program

7219252
stdout	stderr	stdout	fflush	stderr	fflush
if for example all the writes to stdout are not fflush but all the writes to stderr are fflush then they ll end up out of chronological order in the output file and on the screen

7219252
stdout	stderr
this will cause stdout and stderr to write to the screen and file immediately and keep them in sync when being combined and redirected to tee

7219256
toolchain	binutils
is use of toolchain like binutils is mandatory for cross compilation

7219274
git-rebase	undo
assuming you still have master checked out and haven t done any git-rebase since run git reset --hard orig_head to undo the git-rebase

7219608
folder	directory
if i understand you correctly you re asking for a pointer on how to get the directory listing of a remote folder

7219629
post	get
this is because http provides no in-built method to list the files in a directory - it is not designed to be a direct alternative to ftp and has less commands only 8 request methods are defined by the rfc one of them very vaguely and only 2 of these are commonly used by browsers - get and post

7219636

opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
at present opera version 10.5 onward safari version 5 onward and google-chrome version 5 onward all support the individual border- -radius properties and the border-radius shorthand property as natively defined in the current w3c specification although there are still outstanding bugs on issues such as border style transitions using percentages for lengths etc.

7219868
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome and other webkit based browsers have supported border-radius with the -webkit- prefix since version 3 no longer needed from version 5 onward although again with some discrepancies from the current specification see this article for further details of how older versions of webkit handle border-radius

7219872
google-chrome	safari

inherited	base-class
with the virtual inherited a d object has a single base-class a sub-object

7220005
inherited	base-class
in contrast without virtual inherited a d object has two distinct base-class a sub-objects each with its own implementation of the function which is ok until you try to call it on a d object at which point you need to indicate which one you want

accessor	properties
make them private and define public accessor or public properties for them

7220125
accessor	properties
one way to debug this without the nice shiny vs2010 fetures would be to make the access to the _sync only possible with a properties accessor

7220160

implements	extends
there are a lot of prebuild ones see know subclasses at the top of the class documentation but you may also implements your own by extends the inputfilter class

7220261

an idea that comes to mind is adding an image element to the page with a height and a width set to be 100 of its container and then positioning your table with a transparent background color over it

7220296
client-side	server-side
you cannot asynchronously send a value from php server-side to flash client-side

7220397
width	height
so we can at least simulate the full screen for those that not support it by using the width height or whatever you want to fix the player size and make use of the wmode property

7220405
comparator	comparable
and this comparator only works as the javadoc says if the elements of the collection implement the comparable interface

7220405
comparator	comparable
you should either make the song class implement the comparable interface look at its javadoc to know what this interface must do or you must use a specific comparator implementation

7220415
division	modulo
you can have the minutes with a division by 60 and the seconds with a modulo

7220472
inherited	properties
my first thought was to inherited my user class from membershipuser but then i lose the control over the properties

7220491
width	height
but it s recommended to use 0dp so view s do not do extra calculation of their height or width which is then ignored

7220516
postgresql	mysql
if you look at the generated sql in the sql_query setting of config development.sphinx.conf for source person_core_0 you ll see how municipalities.name is being concatenated together i d post an example but it depends on your database - mysql and postgresql handle this completely differently

7220535
post	get
the only difference of post and get is that post sends the data in the http-body and not in the url headers so both methods are not secure for transmitting login credentials

7220548
haskell	agda
i wonder if it is possible to create such a type constructor using a richer type system such as agda or haskell with various extensions

the error only seems to surface when i define width or margin to the offending div

7220713
cvs	svn
i have used svn and cvs before but i am very new to git

7220743
inherited	subclassing
if you don t specify any special mappings for the derived classes ef will assume tph table-per-hierarchy inherited which means that all subclassing together with the base class are stored in the same database table distinguished by a discriminator column

7220743
inherited	properties
if you have many derived classes with many properties each the better inherited strategy might be tpt table-per-type

7220777
google-chrome	firefox
if you use inspect element on the page it looks commented out in google-chrome or isn t even visible in firefox so you might have to view source

7220984
viewmodel	caliburn.micro
right now i add the cellvm s to a collection in the igrideditor s methods then when the containing viewmodel imports the instance sets the containing viewmodel s cellvm collection to the instances collection and the item control binds to that using caliburn.micro s conventions

7220984
caliburn.micro	mef
i m using caliburn.micro mef btw

7220990
rss	feed
include is a bad idea because the contents of are evaluated as php code which opens your site open to attacks if someone can inject php code in the response of that rss feed

7221000
rss	feed
however if i understand you right you could not just include the rss feed using the include construct anyway because it is not valid php code - include expects the path to be a valid php source code file

7221000
rss	feed
you need to connect to the rss feed using curl or fsockopen depending on the level of control you want over the request to the remote site and parse the feed data so you can output in a sensible format

a good way to get around that is to have the children use weak references to point back to the parent

7221268
quicksort	heapsort
it begins with quicksort and switches to heapsort when the recursion depth exceeds a level based on â the number of elements being sorted

7221285

to uplift this post beyond a debug my code for me answer there are two fundamental things you do wrong they are going to get you into a lot more trouble

7221409
integer	unsigned
i have come across code from someone who appears to believe there is a problem subtracting an unsigned integer from another integer of the same type when the result would be negative

7221409
integer	unsigned
result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer

7221424
strlen	memmove
memmove shouldn t use sizeof p which is always going to be fixed say 4 it should use strlen line - p + strlen p - line

7221430
hide	show
then you d attach a client-side event to your first dropdownlist to check for specific values and show hide controls accordingly

7221432
strlen	memmove
memmove p+ strlen deststr -strlen srcstr p sizeof p

7221432
strlen	memmove
if you want to move the remainder of the line to adjust for the changed length try this memmove p+strlen deststr p+strlen srcstr strlen p+strlen srcstr +1

7221435
post	get
when someone post a form on the page with for example swedish characters ã ã ã then i get questionmarks in my servlet code when i look at the posted string in a debugger or in the persisted string on the deployed server

7221449
integer	unsigned
because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is

7221449
integer	unsigned
note that although it does say a computation involving unsigned operands can never overflow which might lead you to believe that it applies only for exceeding the upper limit this is presented as a motivation for the actual binding part of the sentence a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is

7221554
mbunit	moles
it s provides exactky what you re looking for a moles extension for gallio mbunit v3

7221556
mp3	flv
your question is how to extract audio from mp4 flv files and save as mp3 file

7221556
mp3	flv
what i would suggest is to use your mp4 flv parser to extract audio track do transcoding if audio track is non-mp3 and save the transcoded if audio track extracted is mp3 then extracted data data

7221556
stagefright	opencore
you may have to replicate some code from stagefright opencore

7221674
put	get
i turned off client validation to test the registration form and put some invalid values so i get back form saying that i have some errors after i fixed that i got very interesting error

7221676
google-chrome	safari
just to give one example some versions of webkit the renderer used by google-chrome and safari mis-report the margin-right property in some situations

7221702
getter	setter
select the variables you wish to create getter and setter for and click ok

7221707
getter	setter
use generate getter and setter from the source menu or the context menu on a selected field or type or a text selection in a type to open the dialog

7221707
getter	setter
the generate getter and setter dialog shows getter and setter for all fields of the selected type

7221720
getter	setter
there source generate getter and setter and next to it you can see the shortcut which is alt+shift+s and r on my system

7221740
std	ostream
you can use std stringstream as an in memory std ostream

7221747
ubuntu	linux	versioning	upgrade
check installed libxml2 versioning of cents 5.4 and your installed ubuntu linux and maybe can be nexttime yum upgrade

7221755
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
for firefox google-chrome and safari

7221757
ubuntu	linux
i d need a program to be run every time i startup my ubuntu linux

7221767
post	get
until now i only use fixed fields so i always know in my php script how many post or get vars i will get

7221795
outputstream	inputstream
the server will then receive the message through its inputstream and can in return write to its outputstream again flushing when done

7221798
multiplying	add
as long as the weights add to 1.0 you can simply multiplying them by the texture values

7221828
getter	setter
if the property name is foo the getter is just named foo and the setter is named setfoo

7221840
actualheight	actualwidth
you can t override actualwidth and actualheight they are computed

7221897
division	multiplication
assuming your system does multiplication with constant speed and no division at all caching or pre-calculating 1

7221897
multiplying	division
in reality multiplying larger numbers is more costly and you also could do division 90

7221902
getter	setter
since processing is opensource out of curiosity i tweaked the pshape class by adding setter for vertex positions and getter setter for the fill colour then recompiled the library core.jar

7221963
int	boolean
i always assumed that boolean were more efficient than int at storing an on off value - considering that s their reason for existence

7221963
google-chrome	firefox
on google-chrome it s significantly faster to do this using 1 0 but on firefox it s slightly faster to do this using bool

7221963
google-chrome	firefox	int	boolean
this appears to have significant advantage for int as opposed to boolean up to 70 faster to use 1 0 instead of boolean - on both firefox and google-chrome

7221963
int	boolean
why are int so much better at boolean s job

7221977
width	height
the grid needs to know things such as xmin xmax width height .

7221977
width	height
the scatter renderer also needs xmin xmax width height

7221978
128bit	64bit
since today s machines can easily deal with 64bit arithmetic maybe even 128bit arithmetic it might also make sense to never cache a value for 20

7221987
innodb	myisam
innodb allows you to make concurrent select insert update but myisam allows you to do the same things if you don t delete from myisam table

7222014
post	get
i have done raw rest get and post and also could do post in namevaluepair but no matter which tutorial i follow i just cant get json post done .

7222031
post	get
i want to get the first tag of the post and query all other post who have the same tag

7222058
postgresql	mysql
i suggest you use innodb or if that s feasible switch to postgresql - not only does it provide foreign key constraints it also has full support for transactions unlike mysql which will silently commit a pending transaction whenever you do something that s not supported in a transaction with potentially devastating results

7222058
innodb	myisam
if you have to want to use mysql i suggest you use innodb for everything unless you know you need the extra performance you can get out of myisam and you can afford the caveats

7222058
innodb	myisam
also keep in mind that migrating large tables from myisam to innodb later in production can be painful or even outright impossible

7222074
profiler	visualvm
rather it is the number of objects created since application start or since a reset of the collected results buffer in visualvm there is a button in the memory profiler view to reset the collected results buffer

7222098
memcpy	malloc
or you could use a generic array container that either used pointers requiring all array elements to be malloc ed or opaque memory blobs which would require a cast with every element access and a memcpy for every element get set

7222099
post	get
basically i m trying to get a user to post

7222102
int	chars
given a string such as 123456abcdef consisting of n 2 int followed by n 2 chars

7222124
client-side	server-side
the server-side package logging works but i have troubles with the client-side

7222180
google-chrome	firefox
this functionality works as intended in firefox and google-chrome but not ie

7222188
folder	directory
you are opening .. uploads folder for file scanning but checking filesize in current working directory

7222194
google-chrome	firefox
disclaimer i can only speak for firefox but i guess google-chrome is similar

7222194
int	double
so i think i found the right code that seems to suggest we first check for double and then for int

7222249
portrait	landscape
both the controller and the views are in landscape orientation but after the first couple of switches some of the views display in portrait mode

7222264
for-loop	loops
the for-loop construct creates a new variable that you can use as the current value in your loops

7222285
many-to-many	many-to-one
that being said you should really think about storing tags in a separate table with many-to-one relationship with planet_osm_ways or create a separate table for tags that will have many-to-many relationship with planet_osm_ways

7222291
nsstring	uifont
so i have an nsstring uifont and a uicolor

7222337
getter	setter
define a simple getter setter api on the object for the data you want and use it to separate out the complexity of dealing with the arrays and user defaults

7222388
width	height
i did have a full height and width declared for the bordercontainer

7222390
pull	push
if you really want to keep them in sync a human will have to pull from both resolve any conflicts and then push to both

7222390
pull	push
alternately you could make one of the repositories read-only so other people can pull from it but only one person can push which eliminates the potential for conflict

7222395
codeigniter	cakephp
cakephp is considered slower than codeigniter but you can tweak it to enhance speed

7222423
children	parent
if you really need to change the opacity of a parent without affecting it s children the best cheat would be to swap the background-image of the parent to a png transparent this way the children won t be affected and the opacity of the parent would seem changed

7222429
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
you should probably use a fileinputstream wrapped in an inputstreamreader created specifying the right encoding utf-8 in this case then wrapped in a bufferedreader

7222471
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and probably firefox would let it trigger only form elements like checkbox as expected

7222499
put	get
in fact using separate small examples i can put a file inside the database along with his information and i can get the file out of the database

7222532
hide	show
the best thing is that they are actually inside them so you can easily put a hide show effect to make a cool effect

7222573
post	get
there is no way to get realtime updates for page post updates but you could poll the post object you made via its id and pull the list of comments and likes from there

7222574
profiling	debugging
this is making the ide behave as if the program is still executing and the run main project clean and clean and build and debugging buttons are shaded disabled and the only buttons i have are the profiling and paste history

folder	directory
whenever i request an image for a directory i get an empty folder in my program

7222776
guard	autotest
i recently moved from autotest to guard for a reason it works better than autotest and it has a lot of available guard

7222776
guard	autotest
in other words guard is more a generic framework for every process which needs to do something triggered by a file change autotest is restricted to running tests

7222786
strftime	strtotime
have you looked at the date functions in php especially strftime for formatting a timestamp and strtotime

7222788
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
i wanted to know if its possible or there is some library for having buffered i o methods for writing reading objects in java objectoutputstream objectinputstream

integer	unsigned
if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or

7222894
integer	unsigned

7222905
getter	setter
it would store these values using custom setter and could be retrieved from the data store with custom getter too

7222934
post	get
the post body of the current resource is not available to javascript so unless you would need some other way to get it or infer it from page content

7223055
getter	setter
it is session-scoped and features an instance of user class which would be null when you are not authenticated with a getter and setter nothing more

getter	setter
i want to create getter setter methods dyanmically to retrieve private properties

7223667
getter	setter
then i extended winclass with getter setter methods as follows

7223667
getter	setter
it makes sense because that x isn t in the winclass scope but thus i don t know how to setup dynamically getter setter methods for private variables

7223675
profiling	instrumentation
another option is to fire up the time profiling instrumentation and check both hide missing symbols and hide system libraries checkboxes

7223698
getter	setter
the getter setter have to be in the scope that can see the private variables and the only scope that can see these variables is the internals of the constructor

7223698
getter	setter
so to make setter getter for them you have to put the functions in that scope that can see them

7223698
getter	setter
if you want a generic getter setter for privates you could do it like this

7223781
decimal	ieee
the upcoming gold standard for decimal arithmetic is ieee decimal128

7223784
hide	show
that means you have to hide the original widget views and show the progressbar in your remoteviews

7223816
post	get
i want get all post in category id 20

7223849
width	height
you don t need to reset the height and width each time

7223910
getter	setter
a jsf model-bean should be a pojo that follows the javabean design pattern with getter setter encapsulating properties

7223910
getter	setter
although it typically has javabean-style properties with associated getter setter these are properties of the view -- not of the underlying application data model

7223988
installation	upgrade
zen cart database upgrade are done using the code based installer that comes with the new release taking care to select the upgrade rather than installation option

7224051
ssl	https
i m writing a java wrapper for an api and i have a fundamental question about ssl and https connections

7224072
children	parent
i have a jpanel parent with 3 jpanel children inside

7224083
telerik	radwindow
the following property is involved in this case it is a telerik radwindow but it can be any window object and you can probably also just store the window handle but using this property permits manipulation of the object more smoothly helpwin.bringtofront as in the above example.

7224095
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
a uitabbarcontroller in a uinavigationcontroller

7224115
mouseleave	mouseenter
i just want to set border style to 1px visible when mouseenter an image and back to 0 when mouseleave

7224115
firefox	safari
with ie it works fine while with firefox and safari once the border is set to 1px it won t go back to 0px

7224141
teamcity	jenkins
environments are actually hosted on-premise and deployed to via a build server such as cc.net teamcity jenkins etc.

7224149
opera	firefox
it seems different when i test with dreamweaver ie9 ie6 firefox and opera

7224150

i am using nstimer to make a stopwatch

7224163
keydown	keyup
listen for a keydown keyup or keypress event

7224164
innodb	myisam
myisam engine is simpler and this one doesn t spend resources on different additional things like transaction logging journaling and so on like it s done in innodb

7224212
portrait	landscape
is really easy to change picture if the position is in landscape or in portrait but the picture change when the iphone is already rotated not while is rotating

7224212
portrait	landscape
for example the iphone is in portrait and the user rotates it in landscape

7224212
portrait	landscape
that there is a very ugly effect because the pictures change just when the iphone is in landscape and for a fraction of a second the user sees the portrait picture deformed before that it changes

7224286
hide	show
when you click another link it hide the other and show the new selection

7224321
hide	show
this will first hide all content blocks then show the one you want to be show

7224327
mkmapview	mkoverlay
when you want to add an overlay onto a mkmapview you first add something that follow the mkoverlay protocol

7224333
hide	show
i ve used a class in the following code to show hide your div

7224338
apache	nginx
also have a look at nginx for example it is fast and uses less memory than apache to handle client connections

7224372
inherited	properties
i fully understand that the properties are more easily accessed as public and that normally inherited objects won t have access to them otherwise

7224395
x86	64bit
if you are running on a 64bit processor with your project compiling as cpu-any you will either need to compile only for x86 or register the dll in the 64bit com+ space

7224443
google-chrome	firefox
i get inconsistent behavior across firefox google-chrome and ie and was wondering if there was some way to normalize this

7224445
google-chrome	firefox
does anyone know if it s possible to get google-chrome to behave the same as firefox

7224459
portrait	landscape
tracking acceleration in the x axis will give you landscape portrait orientation

7224491
post	get
if the user post a comment if someone post a comment on his wall send him a message i wish in my server side i can get this notification

7224502
width	margin
old computers running on a 800x600 resolution and the ipad with 768x1024 when standing in portrait will all be able to display a page with a width of 720px including some margin borders scrollbar etc

7224522
onresume	onpause
i can press home but it only launches onpause then onresume i think

7224558
post	get
the above string is what i have in json and now what i want to do is to just get the values of post and titel as in the above string what i am having 3 values of post which makes sense to me

7224588
getter	setter
add getter and setter functions to the public interface

7224664
namedtuple	dictionary
i think using namedtuple would get rid of your drawbacks about using a dictionary

7224665
profiling	instrumentation
if i am in xcode and i go to product profiling or press cmd + i it launches instrumentation allows me to select a template and loads the standard screen

7224667
profiler	visualvm
most notably in the oracle sun jre several heapcharbuffer instances are created in the young generation as noted in the following snapshot obtained using the memory profiler of visualvm

7224677
drawimage	todataurl
you could use the canvas element and draw the image using drawimage onto it then use todataurl to get the base64 encoded image

7224687
post	get
i ve seen similar post already but couldn t quite get the answer i needed

7224698
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome this works as expected

7224704
mp4	webm
i have a simple html5 oriented local page that can correctly and consistently playback a simple video loop using mp4 and webm formats correctly under windows vista and windows 7 using ie 9 and google chrome 13

7224741
uiviewcontroller	uiwindow	uiview	uiwindow
i tried creating a uiviewcontroller that sits in-between the uiwindow and the opengl uiview but i get the same behavior

7224774
punctuation	words
and after it i have to print it with changed words but spaces and newlines and punctuation unchanged and on the same position

7224791
width	height
edit i could set the width and height of a normal accordion library from the size of the window at page-load but that doesn t adapt to page resizing very well at all.

7224799
istream	getline
if you prefer c++ way of working with files iostream you can use istream getline

7224819
hide	show
and checking the checkbox hide the above div and show this div

7224829
next	except
next i set all text boxes except for the one next to the button

7224835
hide	show
assuming you have proper html structure that everything you want to hide is in div with id youroldcontent and what you want to show is in div with id yourdivwithnewcontent which is initially hidden with display none

7224881
post	get
the post is to the proper place but then the get reroutes me

7224881
post	get
now when i enter data into the form my routes.rb file seems to post to the proper place signup so profile can be filled out further but get routes me to login

7224888
innodb	myisam
myisam locks the entire table for every insert or update while innodb uses row-level locking

7224899
width	height
i ve found that adding half the width or height on each end worked nicely

7224911
post	get
if you need to do something with the data serverside validation processing etc you can either use javascript with ajax or send it off on a page reload using post or get depending on what you re sending

7224933
getter	setter
each object has a field that is an id number and all fields are public no getter and setter

7224933
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
i don t want to use a for-loop or a similar technique to loops through every object because the arrays may be large

7224942
installation	upgrade
recently upgrade to xcode 4 but kept an installation of xcode 3 in a separate folder

7224948
ready	each
it works by dynamically creating the attribute dropdownlists when the page loads you would implement it based on the result of a db query and hiding each one ready for display later on

7224948
hide	show
you would then show hide the panel instead of the dropdownlist but hopefully it points you in the right direction

7224961
comparator	comparable
either use java.util.arrays.binarysearch if its an array of primitives or you have a comparator or java.util.collections.binarysearch if you have a non-array collection of your own comparable object

7225016
min	max
go through your array and save min and max values of latitude and longitude

7225021
post	get
so as an upgrade i need to delete the previous post i have it s id and post a new one so we don t get spam reports

7225025
int	chars
i fixed this issue by changing the chars in int main to const chars

7225029
post	get
i want join this table and get the category_name of each post

7225061
getter	setter
because of this when you call some getter or setter nothing happens

7225062
children	parent
when i create an edit form for the parent and children then post it only the parent part of the view model is populated

7225071
google-chrome	firefox
you may want to inspect the elements via firebug in firefox or google-chrome s inspector

7225102
post	put
here is an example which sends a post request basically you just have to change it to put

7225141
hide	show
i am having a hard time trying to show hide a div on click

7225143
hide	show
edit both show and hide should be same animation

7225153
pull	push
just pull into any clone with a working tree do what you need to do then push to your bare clone

7225185
fadein	fadeout
fadetoggle is an alias of fadein and fadeout which set display none

7225199
post	put
eventually i would like to also do the same thing with the image source but that if that is another post let me know and i ll put that in another one

7225213
children	parent
i am wondering if i can automatically generate a .zip file which contains all the files of it s children which i can then link to in the parent s interface

7225303
post	get
i have been altering a query for a while now reading many post on this wonderful site to get to where i am with this so far

7225329
int	chars
human-readable int followed by a nul chars

7225342
opera	firefox
if you visit it on firefox or opera and see the search bar on the left column that s what i am going for

7225342
google-chrome	safari
now if you visit it on safari or google-chrome you should see that it is replaced by their default input text field which makes the text illegible

7225392
integer	unsigned
one is the direct concatenation of the big-endian unsigned encodings of the r and s values both being normalized to the length in bytes of the q parameter in the public key the subgroup size usually a 160-bit prime integer thus yielding a 40-byte signature

7225402
getter	setter
the case doesn t use row at all and the model is all about getter and setter

7225402
getter	setter
my row classes are extended from zend_db_table_row i don t think there is necessary to write test cases like getter setter

7225419
d3.js	protovis
if you know a bit of javascript you can program one in d3.js the successor of protovis

7225422
mouseover	mousedown
or you can stimulate a keypress on mousedown mouseover etc

7225439
post	put
what i normally do is put post and comments in the same table

7225461
implements	extends
public class normalparser extends parserfactory implements parsingbehavior

7225514
.htaccess	httpd.conf
if it s your own server it s a little faster to disable .htaccess files while instead putting the redirect command in your httpd.conf file

7225571
width	height
this works for file format video frame rate encoders and bit rate however when i attempt to set the video size to the width and height returned by the camcorderprofile 1920 x 1080 the video recorded is just a green flicker

7225621
folder	directory
the root directory of the app contains a folder images which contains a subdirectories of folder for each page in the app i.e page1 page2 page3 etc.

7225632
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
this will work in firefox 2+ safari 3+ opera 9+ and ie8

7225633
int	chars
1 when i should use int or chars or varchar or other types

7225743
centos	linux
c++ in linux centos 6 oracle 11i

7225799
stdout	stderr
probably sakis3g program print message to stderr instead of stdout

7225799
stdout	stderr
try to redirect stderr to stdout

7225808
google-chrome	firefox
this works perfect in firefox google-chrome and ie8

7225808
google-chrome	firefox
again this works perfect in firefox google-chrome and ie8 but when i change to compatibility mode to get the ie7 experience the whole div area goes blank instead of refreshing with the updated html

7225814
postgresql	mysql
you could start off with a db software mysql postgresql etc. running on the same server as your application

7225820
google-chrome	firefox
also see keep placeholder on focus in ie10 for comments on how placeholder text disappears on focus with ie10 which differs from firefox and google-chrome

7225822
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
try it in firefox google-chrome and on windows internet explorer and safari for windows

7225849
google-chrome	firefox
if you work with this script in google-chrome or the latest versions of firefox 5 or 6 you will notice how the jquery in this script is intended to work

7225866
hide	show
2. on click of any of the list items it hide all the other blocks of content and show the appropriate one while adding an .active class to it in the nav

7225884
google-chrome	firefox
in there it doesnt loop on google-chrome either while it does with ie firefox

7225888
disk	ram
but unfortunately it can t monitor the sys class net eth0 operstate file since sys is located in the ram not in the disk

7225902
children	parent
also there is no relationship between the loaded event of a parent and it s children

7226006
int	double
for basic types like int float double

7226022
post	get
i was supposed to get reply after i execute get function on the server because after post i was getting redirect all the time by server

7226056
width	text-align
text-align works for text but not other elements and auto margins only work if you know the width of the container so not a solution if you don t know the width in advance

7226062
for-loop	loops
because you re assigning event handlers inside the for-loop and because javascript does not have block scope this means that every handler you create in loops is referencing the same myclasssrc variable which will be set at whatever value it was after loops completed

7226113
qstyleditemdelegate	qitemdelegate
the easiest way to do that seems to be by subclassing qitemdelegate because the text is drawn by a separate virtual function drawdisplay with qstyleditemdelegate you would almost have to redraw the item from scratch and you would need an additional class deriving from qproxystyle

7226129
jobs	cron
i firstle i am uploading traks on my server after that to the soundcloud server through cron jobs

7226131
versioning	upgrade
the webhost will not allow me to install my own versioning of python or upload modules unless i upgrade to vps

7226162
opera	firefox
in opera elem.currentstyle width returns auto but in firefox it must use getcomputedstyle which returns something like 1149px

7226191
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended
instead of using a gesture recognizer use the uiview instance methods touchesbegan withevent touchesmoved withevent and touchesended withevent

7226214
hide	show
what we want to happen is to hide the misaligned images meaning not centered on then run the function for centering on window.onload then show the images after that

7226214
google-chrome	firefox
the images hide immediately on firefox and google-chrome when the page is loaded

7226218
width	height
the getcomputestyle is not designed to retrieve the element s width or height

7226227
width	height
an ellipse an oblong circle has no such property- it has a width maybe and a height and possibly an x and y coordinates or a position property

7226227
width	height
for an ellipse you will probably need another method that adjusts shapes that have width height left and top properties

7226242
hide	show
you should hide the img first before it appended to dom waiting for the condition meets then show it

7226259
nexus	artifactory
nexus and artifactory and i am sure all other repositories do as well

7226310
width	height
explicitly set the height and width of the div and then set it s overflow css property to scroll or auto

7226317
filtering	grouping
in other words the result is a set of attributes which included the necessary elements and unnecessary if i use filtering result of the filtering - set - is user but - is grouping

7226349
jquery	scriptaculous
i m trying to make a drag + drop shopping cart and have looked into two options jquery ui draggable and scriptaculous draggable + rails helpers but i m having difficulty tying controller actions to items that have been dragged into the shopping cart

7226371
google-chrome	firefox
in ie8 google-chrome firefox etc

7226375
folder	directory
simple question here -- all i want to do is identify the folder in a directory which share a specific stub

7226383
subtract	add
i think this convention is only for the add and subtract instructions

7226464
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the page works fine on google-chrome safari and opera browser but i cant get the video to play in firefox 6 and ie 9

7226465
public	protected
most c-style languages will typically provide you public protected and private access modifiers

7226506
put	get
you can maintain a bool variable and when you get call first time in the method make this bool true and next time before calling the method you can put check there using this bool variable

7226553
postgresql	mysql
do some research on how to grab information from databases with postgresql or else use a mysql database as it is preferred with php

7226558
post	get
also when a page is loaded on a tab a post request is sent to your server with a signed_request callback so your server or code may be expecting only a get request

7226568
vim	emacs
if this part is separated with an api through which it can be told things it needs to know where are the files of the project what are the include paths etc. then it can return the necessary information help for a symbol at the cursor possible completions etc. and any editor emacs vim etc. can use it

7226615
ada	pascal
but heck i like languages like pascal and ada which both go to great lengths to specify a formal interface separate and distinct from the implementation

7226623
int	chars
basically given an int i need to generate a string with the same length containing only the specified chars

7226626
put	get
if i simply put the task on the threadpool unity will eventually get to the point where another class that needs my product cache is executing its initialization code and it is then accessing datastructures that aren t fully initialized yet in this case it would result in a cache miss and a call to the db to fetch the particular product and there might be many such requests in 30 seconds

7226628
google-chrome	firefox
when i look these in ie it doesnt show any url this is great but when i check it in firefox and google-chrome i shows me url

7226628
google-chrome	firefox
my question is can i hide address bar in child window for firefox and google-chrome

7226634
gif	png
as it is mentioned here output text as gif or png for use in ebook

7226641
rss	feed
creating sql based rss feed dead link

7226663
keydown	keyup
note that if you re trapping the keydown or keyup event the keycodes returned are associated with the keys not the characters so upper and lowercase a both have the same code

7226682
terminate	timeout
as such the timeout function will only be called when the scanf function will be terminate

7226689
ubuntu	linux
the linux type is ubuntu

7226723
implements	extends
i tried implements it so that controller implements observer and the view extends observable

7226769
integer	unsigned
in practice the unsigned long long above equates to an unsigned 64bit integer on my targeted platforms above and g++ 4.4.1 on linux 2.6 a different type that amounted to the same thing would also be acceptable but i haven t found any.

7226841
int	boolean
which disallows implicit conversions such as function calls conversions to int for arithmetic and so on but still allows the shared_ptr to be converted to bool in boolean contexts

7226950
rss	feed
i am fetching my resut from a rss feed using following code

7226950
rss	feed
but sometimes the description contains html tags inside rss feed as below

7226987
google-chrome	firefox
note that google-chrome firefox and ie9 all provide developer tools just press f12 for ie9

7227027
google-chrome	firefox
i recommend using firebug in firefox or using the dev console in google-chrome anduse the console.log function to log things so that you don t have to alert them all the time

7227043
haskell	ocaml
all i can say is that fp languages like ocaml and haskell are exceptionally good at doing exactly this

7227050
nsurl	nsstring
i am changing the nsstring to nsurl and creating the uiimage

7227068
aggregate-functions	sum
from the reference - the sum and avg aggregate-functions do not work with temporal values

7227078
google-chrome	firefox
well first off you re not listening for any errors that might be happening which might be the case and if you wanted to debug you should of used something like the developer panel in google-chrome or firebug in firefox to see the http request

7227134
width	height
i want from select box if selected 700x7000 then image s size will be height 700px and width 700px

7227212
grizzly	netty
not sure about netty but for grizzly its

7227229
getter	setter
in the vehicle class i m taking its getter setter bitmaps and the same in the frog class as vehicle

7227253
google-chrome	firefox
for some reason known only to microsoft out of ie7 ie8 ie9 firefox 3.5 6 and google-chrome only ie7 honored that instruction for a deeply nested div 400 lines further down the css sheet

7227295
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
the example below does onewaytosource bindings from the read-only dp s actualwidth and actualheight to the width and height properties of the datacontext

7227303
client-side	server-side
it is a server-side issue the server -side application is not sending the expected http content-type header field value for the client-side script resource

7227303
client-side	server-side
but if the client-side script resource is generated by a server-side application like php then it is necessary to set the content-type header field value explicitly as the default is likely text html

7227303
client-side	server-side
server-side generation can happen easily to a client-side script resource even if you have plain .js files on the server if comments are removed from them as they are served if they are all packed into one large response to reduce the number of requests which can be more efficient or they are minimized by the server-side application in any other way

7227349
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i was curious and actually tested it none of my browsers opera firefox google-chrome internet explorer.

7227350

7227477
hide	show
i wanna get something like that if there s no result then hide #school and #class and show only error message

7227483
gif	png
all you need to do is call the field accessor with a file-like object preferably one that includes the file mime-type image png or image gif in your case

7227524
put	get	post	get	post	put
i can create a wcf rest service and post put and get data ok

7227529
swt	styledtext
it s possible to use styledtext widget so no dependency on jface to show syntax highlight see into the deep end of the swt styledtext widget but it s quite lot of work to do.

7227537
google-chrome	firefox
btw in ie9 rendering speed is fantastic in firefox and google-chrome it is around 1 sec

7227547
implements	extends
the model should extends observable and the view should implements observer you want the view to depend on the model

7227583
puts	gets	post	get
what you could do is write a little program which gets the barcode and puts it into your browser textbox or sends it via get post to your php script

7227594
docx	xlsx	xlsx	ods
and also docx xlsx odt ods .

7227615
getter	setter
opaque handle to struct and setter getter

7227641
superclass	subclassing
the problem here is quite obvious - all operations of the superclass that return a new instance of have to be re-defined in the subclassing with a cast

7227693
post	get
i have a page where the user does a http get to fill out data for a form the user then http post the form and when successful the user is http redirected to a receipt page

7227715
hide	show
on the page show and hide divs at a specific time interval using jquery

7227726
pull	push
when developing you want to be able to see your changes locally throughout all the apps without having to commit push and pull

7227772
comparator	comparable
edit i just stumbled across collections.reverseorder which does just what you want it gives you a comparator that reverses the natural ordering of objects that implement comparable

7227779
post	get
for posting files you need libcurl which can send http get form post multipart post etc

7227845
google-chrome	firefox
when i copy the same url and try to run the website in google-chrome or firefox it shows me the following error

7227935
post	get
p-r-g is used to prevent multiple form submissions so if the user presses refresh on their browser after a post aka form submission the form won t be re-submitted - since the refresh button just executes the previous request in the history which was a get as a result of your redirect

7227940
getter	setter

children	parent
parent index id - children index - fields index string

7233916
children	parent
now i can implement this by making structs containing an arraylist and string for both the parent and field and just an arraylist for children but when i need to for example invert field1 and field2 it becomes difficult and expensive

7233916
children	parent
then if i want to switch fields children or parent i just have to change the pointer and it is cheap

width	height
even though you set the height and width inline ie may still have issues with haslayout

7234963
rsa	aes
use rsa for nothing else than symmetric key wrapping and digital signatures in all remaining cases where you want to actually encrypt sensitive data you use a symmetric cipher aes is a good choice - 128 or 256 bits doesn t really matter

7234963
rsa	aes
now you would rsa-encrypt this symmetric key and nothing else using the server s public key and send the key to the server then encrypt your private data using aes and the symmetric key the server would decrypt the symmetric key using its private rsa key and decrypt the packets you send to it

7234964

add-ons and their dependencies should be always added to web-inf lib to make the server-side classes available to the application and client-side code available to the gwt compiler

7235040
client-side	server-side
so you might also check your code for unnecessary server-side dependencies to client-side gwt classes like haswidgets

nsurl	nsstring
edit upon further examination if i save this nsurl as an nsstring instead with the same data it still fails

ienumerable	iqueryable
the reason your second query works is because the linq to sql returns a list and then you do a linq query to filter out what you need on a c# list which implements the ienumerable iqueryable interfaces and understands the grp.lastordefault

7235844

ubuntu	linux
as i wrote in the comments it works for me i m using openjdk 1.6.0_22 linux ubuntu and firefox

7235989
hide	show
im simply using show hide and to progress im using

7236034
single-quotes	double-quotes
then you can escape the single quotes and the resulting html string looks more like that html you would see in everyday markup double-quotes around attribute values single-quotes in the javascript

7236072
public	protected
if it matters then yes you should make it protected private and make public wrappers like you have

7236076
public	protected
normally good coding practice is to keep your data members private or protected and provide whatever public methods will be needed to access them

7236081
google-chrome	firefox
i ve looked at google+ and they re using contenteditable for google-chrome and some iframe hybrid for firefox

7236097
express	node.js
i m using node.js express and connect and fluent-ffmpeg

7236097
google-chrome	safari
we also noticed big differencies in the way google-chrome and safari request the audio tag src but this may be discussion for another topic

7236139
post	get
post this question to server fault and you might get a better answer

7236146
integer	unsigned
the other alternative is to force php to treat it as an unsigned integer as per the notes on the ip2long man page

7236146
128bit	64bit
as well remember that ipv6 will be widespread any day now and you ll need to use a 128bit integer to store those values which mysql doesn t support - it d have to be two 64bit bigints at least

7236171
uiview	uitouch
so you should be able to retrieve the current cgaffinetransform applied to your uiview then apply this cgaffinetransform to the point of your uitouch using cgpointapplyaffinetransform probably after inverting the affinetransform to apply the inverse transformation to your point

7236186
uiview	subviews
i have a uiview that contains a subviews called menuview managed by a menuviewcontroller

7236188
rtp	sdp	rtp	sip	sip	sdp
3 it s not a problem with sip but with rtp whose parameters that are included in the sdp as part of the sip message body that include private ip addresses

7236242
aggregate-functions	sum
note that you will need to use an aggregate-functions sum max avg for example on any columns in the select clause that you do not include in th group by clause

7236254
keydown	keyup
if you need to have some special effect on keys that don t generate characters press you need to listen for keydown keyup events in those you got keycodes they are fired for every key in the key board and the shift status is not applied when you press the key for a don t matter if shift is pressed or caps lock on you always get 65

7236254
google-chrome	firefox
did test it on firefox google-chrome and ie 9-7 and it seem to do want you want

7236265
min	max
one way to do this is to specify min or max values for the columns that you do not want repeated

7236281
serializable	deserialization
we would like to use the google protobuf library for message serializable and deserialization over ethernet

7236341
getter	setter
that s why they re even called getter and setter

7236383
hide	show
we also use show hide onclick

7236404
sip	sdp
the idea is that the sip messages contain sdp data that contain the information needed so that eventually the phones will be able to set up a session and users will be able to start talking

7236406
width	height
the 256px image is actually stored with width and height equal to 0 because that field is byte sized and 0 was formerly invalid

7236476
textview	imageview
below is my asynctask as for my onretainnonconfigurationinstance i am grabbing storing gettext results from textview as well as storing a string and imageview inside a hashmap

7236479
profiling	instrumentation
in c or c++ this is often referred to as instrumentation or profiling

7236481
maven	pom.xml
maven should deploy to a nexus based on the pom.xml and -drepositoryid

7236493
google-chrome	firefox
worse is that when i use firefox google-chrome no problems

7236517
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
typically you would call viewwillappear then add the view the call viewdidappear

7236524
post	get
use a post http verb instead of get

7236527
button	checkbox
the solution must not mess with checkbox the value must remain but checked state must be cleared nor the submit button

7236668
mouseup	mousedown
you should be able to use the mousedown mouseup events to get the same behavior as mouseclick

7236670
put	get
i ve seen many articles telling me how to get the debug.keystore fingerprint however when i get mine and put it in online i m told it is invalid

when my if conditions are met i hide the disabled submit and show the enabled one

7236746
put	get
if you put that in mymethod above you d get o and object

7236796
serializable	deserialization
edit one additional requirement - it should not rely on any markers or special properties on the json for serializable deserialization as sometimes i ll need to read json from a 3rd party

7236815
int	chars
if the file is filled with 48-bit int like i am assuming you are talking about from the chars array you can do this

7236816
membase	couchbase
if you want production support outside of the forums couchbase the creator of membase provide 12x5 and 24x7 support

7236854
fpdf	fpdi
fpdf and fpdi

7236854
tcpdf	fpdi
now i m transistioning to tcpdf and fpdi because the powers that be have decided we need water marks transparencies

7236854
fpdf	fpdi
in addition the fpdi website says fpdi has a dependency on fpdf_tpl file which looking into the file tells me it extends fpdf

7236881
pull	push
what you actually want is not pulling the server every second but instead keep a connection open and use the observer-pattern to distribute updates to the specific clients in other words push instead of pull

7236904
google-chrome	firefox
i m not sure on the specifics but some quick tests show that google-chrome uses body but firefox and ie use html

7236918
post	get
use the paging data from your api request or until and since parameters which are just unix timestamps or any string accepted by the strtotime function as described on under paging to get all post going back until the beginning of your wall

7236922
post	get
you may also want to explore or post update comments and wait for me to get back around to this

7236937
mouse	keyboard
you won t get live update but you will be able to process the mouse and keyboard events however you like

7236974
submit	submission
if the form is unpredictably doing something script-illegal under those circumstances and the template is submission only with js perhaps that s why it won t submit

7237045
post	get
i m writing a web server in java and when the browser sends a string with get or post with accented characters for example ã ã ã ã² ã¹ the server receives strange symbols

7237078
touchescancelled	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchescancelled
the sources are created and started on touchesmoved and stopped on touchesended or touchescancelled

7237141

you could use jquery style getter setter methods

7237141
getter	setter
it is possible to stack multiple docblocks one for getter and one for setter

7237146
fadein	fadeout
how to fadein and fadeout img tags in div use jquery

7237160
rspec	capybara
also if you are looking for integration tests rather then acceptance tests which is what it sounds like plain capybara with rspec will probably be a better fit scroll down to capybara + rspec

7237236
put	get
to be accessible anonymously i ll call the service in sample code so i don t want to put my key in the code or request users to get a key

7237327
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if you fully qualify it on the client side it will work with firefox and google-chrome and safari

7237329
width	margin
note that the outer linearlayout should be set to have the dimension of the image and the width of the gridview column should be the width of the image plus any margin

7237348
post	get
in some post i ve seen that people have changed the web.config file to get things working but according to the documentation net connector 6.4.3 the connection should be added and edited via adding a new data source via the database explorer

7237367
google-chrome	firefox
here is my issue top raw messed up in google-chrome and ie but working fine in firefox

7237425
minimagick	mogrify
rmagick shares memory with rails while minimagick has a separate memory allocation for mogrify

7237431
hash	md5
you can do a reverse lookup of the md5 hash you provided by googling

7237447
children	parent
floating an element means that the parent element won t recognize its height even if you float the parent element as well it will stretch to the height of floating children but still won t have a recognized height

7237450
onresume	onpause
note that usually these things are placed in onresume and onpause the difference is subtle though onresume onpause are called when the activity gets placed behind another activity onstart onstop are called when the activity is no longer visible in the screen

7237466
proj	mapnik
for those curious the xml is from the openstreetmap s mapnik proj

7237509
google-chrome	safari
this seems to work fine in ie7+ ff6 and google-chrome does not work on safari

7237513
ubuntu	linux
i m currently implementing a threading library in linux my os is ubuntu natty

7237518
wireless	umts
however especially if your payload is small think messages the size of a typical sms or tweet the overhead you create with webservices is prohibitive bytes sent over a wireless network like gprs or umts are still very expensive compared to bytes carried over cable or adsl

7237518
short	base
so if your use case is based on short messages i d at least advise to do some bandwidth simulation calculations and base your decision on bandwidth savings vs increased complexity of your app

7237522
oncreate	ondestroy
then the service will be spending the majority of its time not in the protected oncreate onstartcommand or ondestroy methods

7237528
google-chrome	firefox
based on your live site now adding float left to the rule below should fix it in google-chrome and it still looks ok in firefox

7237531
pull	push
stax is a pull not push library so its a lot easier to keep track of state

7237578
getter	setter
as long as i get a symbol through square brackets or on initialization i can easily store the k v pair and create instance methods for the setter and getter

7237580
getter	setter
i assume spring may also require getter and setter on fields of the somecommand object

7237583
mp3	wav
edit wav seems to be the most heavily supported - but is probably going to come with size impacts compared to mp3 and still isn t supported by ie

7237641
uicontrol	uibutton
in the end your uibutton inherits form uiview via uicontrol

7237659
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in google-chrome but the class is not applied to that same element for firefox opera ie

7237662
traceroute	packets
take a look at traceroute to see how to measure distance in terms of hops by sending packets with increasing ttls

7237705
for-loop	arrays
an index-based for-loop might perform much better than an iterator since you can index the original arrays directly and avoid copying to a new arrays

7237769
children	parent
all examples that i found about saving associated models are when saving from user parent n children my shop model

7237775
dictionary	map
i would use a dictionary to map the datetime to a structure that contains valueone and valuetwo

7237799
stateless	stateful
i d like to start by saying i d prefer a stateless service whenever possible and unless you really require a stateful service i d discourage it

7237844

7237930
ant	maven
if i don t use maven and simply use ant and specify the location where the testng.jar file is there is no problem at all

7237930
ant	maven
i have used the same .jar file that maven downloaded for ant to make sure i am using the same source

7237964
jobs	cron
for requests initiated by cron jobs and tasks i believe you re allowed 10 mins to complete it whereas typical user-driven requests are allowed 30 seconds

qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
now i switched to using qgraphicsscene and qgraphicsview and now my images have a gray background wherever they used to be transparent

7238120
srp	principles
try to follow the srp single responsiblity principles - an object should have a single responsibility and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class

7238157
quicksort	heapsort
if it helps here s links to java implementations of heapsort quicksort and smoothsort all of which runs in o n log n time

7238157
quicksort	heapsort
heapsort and smoothsort use only o 1 external memory while quicksort can use o n in the worst case though good implementations can limit this to o log n using cute tricks

7238157
quicksort	heapsort
since the reordering step uses o 1 memory the overall memory usage would be either o 1 for something like smoothsort or heapsort or o log n for something like quicksort

7238168
post	get
a more recent blog post says october 1st which is consistent with the roadmap which does get updated often

easymock	unitils
unitils also provides integration with easymock such that if you extend the unitilsjunit4 unit test class you get automatic mock object creation and injection

7238480
error-handling	exception-handling
if you get a different kind of exception-handling that you weren t expecting to get typically this means that something novel failed in a way you didn t anticipate and you want this behavior to be noticeable not just get swept under the rug with all the regular error-handling code

7238484
membase	couchdb
yes couchdb is a good persistence layer for membase

7238537

7238624
hash	salt
since the users passwords are well protected hash with salt i m thinking of capturing their plaintext password during authentication encrypting it and storing it in the php session until the user logs out

if you have a properly normalized database tags should be split up to a new table as this is a one-to-many or maybe even a many-to-many relationship

7238699
versioning	upgrade
just make sure you test the hell of your observers look for test_after_commit gem if you use use_transactional_fixtures so when you upgrade to new rails versioning you ll know if it still works

7238717
addclass	removeclass
if you know the styles ahead of time define a class for that in your css and addclass or removeclass from the necessary objects

7238724
postgresql	mysql
as far as scaling mysql vs postgresql you re mostly going to run into the same hurdles since they re both really fast and stable rdbms

7238724
postgresql	mysql
all that said postgresql is much more acid compliant than mysql it handles fks just as you re needing and i would generally recommend it based on what you ve expressed in your post

7238726
google-chrome	firefox
instead of html content it displays html source in google-chrome firefox ie 9 works fine

7238988
button	checkbox
click the button to see three checkbox which you can use to set the hover active and focus pseudo-classes for the selected element

7239019
post	get
while it is legitimate in your case to have both get and post that has the same path such as register that perform different action such design introduce ambiguity in services provided and may confuse the consumer of your services

7239079
google-chrome	safari
it is not working mostly in the google-chrome and safari and in latest version of the google-chrome

7239140
versioning	upgrade
we have to make a database upgrade procedure where in we have to check some flag or the versioning number in database if provided and based on that we have to create a database upgrade procedure

7239140

folder	directory
currently my root web directory has a .htaccess which redirects to my application folder like such

7239927

as erik said there is no need to make those pointers unless you want to make them point to other variables or want to malloc or calloc them

7239978
width	height
the properties parameter is expected to be a javascript object whose properties match the set of param names with a few additions such as width and height

7240064
width	margin
for example suppose this property includes the uiviewautoresizingflexiblewidth and uiviewautoresizingflexiblerightmargin constants but does not include the uiviewautoresizingflexibleleftmargin constant thus indicating that the width of the viewâ s left margin is fixed but that the viewâ s width and right margin may change

7240354

i would use jquery to show hide divs.

7240381
active-directory	adam
for me the best way is to install an adam active-directory application mode on w2k3 r2 or an lds lightweigth directory server on w2k8 r2 if you prefer microsoft solutions or openldap opends for open source solution

7240398
calloc	malloc
another alternative is you can also use calloc which does the same thing as malloc but sets all bits to 0 in the block of memory it gives you

7240422
srp	principles
make sure you oo knowledge is up to scratch as well as knowledge of basic design patterns mainly soc seperation of concerns and srp single responsibility principles

7240429

7247511
children	parent
but within a parent i already have the children and their order

7247511
inherited	properties
being inherited from treenode they can be used directly by the tree but because they have overrides of the basenode properties such as loadchildren and display properties the display and retrieval any given set of data is implied by the type of node and the guid that the item represents

7247781
width	height
i resized them using width and height properties in css but i would like to show them bigger maybe in popup or something like that after clicking on them

7248017
children	parent
i am using jstree and it is loading ok with json data the searching in the parent nodes works fine as well but when it comes to searching the child nodes which are not loaded at first as the tree is big and children are only loaded when a parent is selected i am experiencing a problem

7248017
children	parent
my tree is two laryers in depth only parent and children so based on above doc i should only send the parent node that contains that child node which has the search string in its title and in the success section of the search ajax i can see that all the appropriate parent nodes are being passed by the server but no results show up i am thinking it has to do with my formatting i pass a list of the id s of the parent nodes

7248093
put	get
get yourself a good profiler i use redgate s ants memory profiler which has a free trial put your app through it s paces let the memory usage build up and then use the profiler results to narrow down the actual culprit

7248119

start with a uitabbarcontroller project in xcode place a uinavigationcontroller in each one of the tab view for the controller and you re done

7248455

7248487
width	height
height and width works normally

7248507
public	protected
you probably know this but with inheritance you can have public protected and private member access

7248507
public	protected
if a member is private in the base class the derived cannot access it while if that same member is protected then the derived class can access it while it still isn t public so you re maintaining encapsulation

7248507
public	protected
this could be useful because class b could inherit from class a as protected thus getting its protected members while class c could inherit from the same class a as public thus not getting access to its protected members

7248515
hide	show
it s much easier to hide show controls when needed or use repeaters or datagrids

7248950
int	double
if i understand this page by oracle describing the format used for number on sparc correctly the sparc uses the opposite endian as x86 for int but the same endian as x86 for floats and double

7248950
int	double
however pb encodes floats double by first casting them directly to an int type of the appropriate size via means of a union

7248950
x86	64bit
as lyke pointed out ieee 64bit floating points are stored in big-endian order on sparc in contrast to x86

simple but no other benefit beside very easy to implements and extends

7249312

ubuntu	debian
don t know if this is standard but my perl package debian ubuntu includes a usr bin prename and a symlink just rename which has no other purpose

ok so i decided to not inherited from a base and instead implement an interface with the same properties my base had

7253375
versioning	upgrade
i guess this is specific to 3.7 as i upgrade the eclipse versioning and started getting this issue first way still works in eclipse 3.2

7253388
width	height
then change only the width and height attributes to be whatever you want and hopefully that should work

7253403

then in the viewmodel i make sure that the accessor is created and set to the passwordbox.password properties

7253530
ubuntu	linux
however in ubuntu linux i did and it worked

7253536

skip-lists	linked-list
i first thought of linked-list but insertion is o n and amit corrected me with skip-lists

7253924
implements	extends
for refreshing the cellwidgets which is attached to asyncdataprovider you will probably have to extends the asyncdataprovider and either extract the rpc call to a getdata method which is called in the onrangechanged method or create an interface with a refresh method and implements it in your custom asyncdataprovider which calls the protected onrangechanged method

7253929

try-catch	exception-handling
here s a food for thought...from the code above you have used a try-catch block...my guess is that one of the above operations is throwing an exception-handling because of which the out.close operation is getting skipped...why not add a finally block and close the stream there...it would definitely help you save the trouble

7255940
classcastexception	classnotfoundexception
solution 2 and its evolution which is ram only are much more elegant but much more complicated loading a single class from a classloader different thatn the one used by the rest of your entire application is tricky you could get weird class exceptions like classcastexception classnotfoundexception etc.. due to a mismatch between classloaders

7255986

margin	word-spacing
the genius and trick to this method is in using inline-block elements and then using word-spacing to counterbalance using a negative right margin

7256297
width	margin
a negative right margin on it s own will pull elements together allowing you to have 100 width set and still fit things in between but leave the elements overlapping

7256297
width	margin
setting negative margin on the parent just undoes the child margin in regards to the effect on interacting with total width the magic 100 width mark we re trying to hit

7256297
box-sizing	margin
it is often used with box-sizing in the jury rigged solutions to this problem at the expense of losing the ability to use padding at all otherwise and margin and likely requiring more wrapper elements

7256297
text-align	word-spacing
magical text-align justify gets webkit almost there with the word-spacing one

7256374
public	protected
you should change those methods to protected so new additions will keep the public interface and derived classes can still change how objects are constructed

children	parent
using the simple html dom parser example if i have a dom object that has no children and i var_dump it i d like it to just dump the object and no start traversing up the dom tree and dumping parent grandparents other children etc

as others have pointed out floyd-warshall runs in time o n 3 and running a dijkstra s search from each node to each other node assuming you re using a fibonacci heap to back your dijkstra s implementation takes o mn + n 2 log n

7265454
bellman-ford	dijkstra
the algorithm works by first running bellman-ford on the graph to transform it to a graph with no negative edges then using dijkstra s algorithm starting at each vertex

7265454
bellman-ford	floyd-warshall
because bellman-ford runs in time o mn the overall asymptotic runtime is still o mn + n 2 log n so if m o n 2 note that this is little-o of n this approach is asymptotically faster than using floyd-warshall

7270657
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
this worked well for the nt4 password process which used md5 hash and no salt

7270657
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
when a salt is added to a password before hashing then the rainbow table is useless - instead of looking for the md5 hash of mypass it has to precompute mypass-random-string_of-letters

7270657
hash	salt
you append the salt and hash comapre to the hash stored in database

7270657
hash	salt
a salt adds a two factor defence to the passwords - even with the hash an attacker will need the salt to have any chance of cracking it

7270657
hash	salt
this way you can re-confirm the password by rehashing with the salt and reversing the hash is next to impossible

7270657
hash	salt
to brute force this by computing the hash directly ie making my salt specific rainbow tables i should see a collision after 62 8 2 and at lets say 100 hash per second it will take around 12 million days

7270657
disk	ram
i have no idea how to tell if my server just swapped the ram holding my salt into disk and thats only one mistake i can immediately think of in rolling my own authentication

7270675
hash	md5
save it in md5 hash which can t be reversed

7270734

looking at the sp.clientcontext.get_current provides a lot of information about the current spsite spweb etc

7270855
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
ios is set up to allow for this to happen very easily and i think attractively by using a uinavigationcontroller and pushing in a new view controller could be a uitableviewcontroller or simply a uiviewcontroller that contains a uitableview

7270877

datalist	repeater
this can be done in a repeater but a datalist control is more straightforward and is just as easy to use

7271113

converting a repeater to a datalist is a much easier approach than having editable items in a repeater

7271320
post	get
i have seen post related to same problem but couldn t get a solution for mine

awt	swing
also i highly recommend that you use swing components not awt components

7271674
int	double
we currently have only maximumsize int but are evaluating the need for where that type just has a weigh k v method returning int or double

7271700

instead of keeping a list of children every node could have a reference to its parent

7271727
postgresql	mysql
however that is different for sqlite the dev database and postgresql production since in mysql the command is rand

7271769
put	get

7271960
getter	setter
and some other fields setter and getter

7272002
scrypt	salt
the correct way to handle password matching is to use a salt to alter the original password in some simple way so that simple dictionary passwords will now no longer result in values that can be easily reversed by a google lookup and then use use a cryptographic hashing algorithm like bcrypt scrypt or if your really have to sha1

7272038
folder	directory
this is a normal folder under the project directory but it s displayed specially in solution explorer

7272038
folder	directory
the only reason i ve ever seen anyone change it is when there were multiple .csproj files in a single directory so it didn t make sense for them all to share the same properties folder but that was a very oddball scenario

7272056
innodb	myisam
only the innodb tables store the utf-8 data correctly and the myisam tables don t

sure but strtotime has long handled invalid month and day values the same way as mktime by effectively rounding them into valid values the 0th day of the month becomes the last day of the previous month the 0th month is the last month of the previous year and so on

7273027
width	height
looking at width height of them was not overly helpful - some were the dimensions of the iframe itself some were the dimensions from top-left pixel of slide 1 to bottom-right pixel of slide n some were 0x0 and some burried in the middle were the dimensions of a slide

7273027
width	height
the pattern i found was that you have to skip the first element in document.all and iterate through until you found one with non-zero width height who have identical values for clientheight offsetheight scrollheight as well as identical values for clientwidth offsetwidth and scrollwidth

7273027
width	height
the first one of these will give you the height width of a single slide and you can go from there

7273027
width	height
so to extract width height of a powerpoint presentation you can write

7273027
width	height
and do whatever you need to with width height from that point on

7273195
implements	extends
if a class extends an abstract class should we implements all the methods in the abstract

7273195

7273448
versioning	upgrade
the simplest way to use long term caching for speed and efficiency but immediate and safe upgrade when you upgrade a js file is to include a versioning number in the deployed filename or path like jquery does with jquery-1.6.2.js and then you bump change that versioning number whenever you upgrade change the file

7273474

int	chars
it binds an int property to a quantity textbox so that when alpha chars are entered it gets a red validation border

7273822
int	chars
i thought that the int binding on quantity threw an exception in the setter when you typed alpha chars

7273826
int	chars
note that if you change the chars to int this works fine

7273990
htmlcleaner	jsoup
use the jsoup htmlcleaner with a configuration specified by a whitelist

7273993
int	chars
the problem with passing directly is that the string class interprets every int as a separate chars while after converting to string treats input as raw bytes and understands that 195 164 is actually is a single chars consisting of two bytes rather than two chars

7274023
cos	sin
again by checking the sign of dot product you are actually checking the sign of cos theta and by checking perpdot you are checking the sign of sin theta

7274026

getter	setter
in which case the runtime is generating an atomic getter while you have written a non-atomic setter

7287847
curb	libcurl
you don t mention how you are making the socket connections but you might want to try using ruby libcurl bindings curb instead of net http

7287890
onclick	onfocus
through an inline js call or a listener capture the onfocus onclick event on the options and toggle a classname selectedoption whatever you wish the name to be on that element

7287915
width	height
you would need to track the original start point somewhere variables data attributes on #currenthighlight wherever you want and check for width or height 0

7287915
width	height
then set the #currenthighlight width height to the same difference but positive

7287924
lxml.html	beautifulsoup
unfortunately python does not have useful html parsing in the standard library so the only reasonable way to parse html is by using a third party module like lxml.html or beautifulsoup

7287930
google-chrome	firefox
i highly recommend you debug in either firefox or google-chrome because of this

7287948

currently i m having trouble showing the other content besides the tag as well as adding another showhide inside of the original show hide

7288113
screens	tablet
drawing to the screens is handled completely by the cpu and on only one core and larger screens sizes tablet and tvs is too much without a cpu with serious single-core speed

7288115
post	put
no post no relocated and if i put an alert in the function it is not run

7288228
int	chars
i have a query that i use on mysql database that order the result casting a chars database field to int when possible when the chars string is numeric so for example the order by clause that i use on mysql is

7288242
wordpress	joomla
if you are on joomla or wordpress you may want to look into s3media stream

7288249
hide	show
here s a fiddle use .show and hide instead of explicitly setting the css display properties even though show and hide do this in the background

7288277
getter	setter
in the header add class and take care of the variable declaration + getter setter

7288306
submit	submission
can i submit a request through jquery using .get and use the returned result as it returns from normal submission to server

7288314
outputstream	inputstream
you ll have an inputstream coming from your web source and an outputstream going to your local file and you will loop through the inputstream writing chunks until there are none left

7288315
hide	show
by adding class attributes to the item you want to trigger the show hide and the element you want show hidden you can do something like this

7288347
textview	simplecursoradapter
i have a database and textview i bind them together with a simplecursoradapter

7288362
width	height
it doesn t loop and accounts for both height and width

7288367
client-side	server-side
for example the client-side exit can prompt the user for id and password encrypt these and then forward to the server-side exit for validation

7288402
width	height
it doesn t loop and accounts for both height and width

7288404
g++	gcc
i use g++ gcc but i cannot link the c executable with c++ shared library

7288444
folder	directory
however i noticed that each directory the root folder and all of its sub directory that the installer created does not give write permissions

7288444
folder	directory
in my case i need give the root directory of the application and all of its sub directory and the folder that is placed in the programdata folder read write permissions for the users group

7288485
g++	gcc
you may have to use g++ as the linker not gcc

7288489
post	get
in the core-data scenario you implement declarative mappings between your data model and the content you get from and post to the server and it takes care of things like injecting objects from the cloud into your client model posting new objects to the server and incorporating server-generated objects ids into your client-side model doing all of this in a background thread and taking care of all the core-data context threading issues and so on

7288496
google-chrome	firefox
everything works great in all tested versions of google-chrome firefox and ie9

7288507
width	height
the image should resize to parent along whatever dimension width or height has the greatest difference between itself and the parent and then center along the other dimension

7288532
qstackedwidget	qsignalmapper
you can use a qstackedwidget and a qsignalmapper to do that

7288555
qapplication	qwidget
i was playing around with hudson on my development computer and ran into an issue where one of my automated unit tests has to create a qapplication in order to test a subclass of qwidget

7288568
int	chars
and my table has all the columns of type nvarchar chars bit numeric uniqueidentifier int

7288686
super	self
quick question about python ic inheritence what is the difference between the idiom posted here super childclass self .method args vs

7288741
super	self
using super childclass self .method args allows you to walk the method resolution order and -- if everyone but the last parent uses super -- call every class in the hierarchy exactly once

7288759
jobs	cron
its path magic will break in non-obvious places cron jobs and you ll be up a creek

7288759
ubuntu	debian
here s a tutorial for ubuntu that should translate pretty well into debian

7288786
vbscript	vb6	vb.net	vb6
as darin dimitrov pointed out this is definitely vb.net which is definitely not vbscript vb6 asp classic

expand button -- checkbox -- rest of treeitem stuff

7288790
button	checkbox
checkbox -- expand button -- rest of treeitem stuff

7288828
integer	fractions
treating this as an integer and incrementing it gives a fractions part of 0000 with a carry

7288828
int	double
converting the representation to an int incrementing and converting back to a double does work nicely for positive normalised numbers

7288828
range	infinity
finally eventually you will overflow the largest normalised number and increment the exponent into the infinity and nan range

7288832
getter	setter
this implementation will contain synthesize instructions that generate the getter and setter methods for you

7288839
pop-up	dialog
dialog are slow to pop-up so i used a textview..but its not working

7288876
filtering	grouping
paging filtering or grouping to be performed purely on the client by

7288921
projectile	angle
so a projectile hitting a surface at an angle of 45 degrees will bounce at -45 degrees

7288921
projectile	angle
this will require you to know both the direction angle that the projectile is moving as well as the angle of the surface

7288952
inherited	subclassing
i m looking for a simple example of creating a class in javascript which is then inherited in a subclassing

7288972
versioning	upgrade
i for one would certainly prefer using a custom separate database and leave drupal databases to its own devices if you would ever need to upgrade the site to a higher versioning of drupal it helps if you don t modify it and also consider using webform as it makes development easier both in components and hooks

7288973
post	get
this would seem to cause a problem because you are using method post in your form not method get

7288977
google-chrome	firefox
this is working fine in google-chrome but for some reason its not hiding the elements in firefox ignoring ie for now another guy in the office specializes in that so he will make it work there poor soul

7288980
division	addition
after this its trivial addition and modular division in case you don t know what that is have a look at this

7288983
stdout	stderr
con is the equivalent of dev stdout and dev stderr in windows

7288994
getter	setter
and last if you change your mind you can run the unlombok or let your ide create these setter getter and ctors which i think no one will ask for once they see how clear your pojo becomes

7289004
inherited	subclassing
you need to look into the objects prototype however you won t have traditional subclassing and inherited

7289026
put	get
class dbadapter get s the values to put into the listview and allows for programatically controlling the display

7289058
pdostatement	bindvalue	bindparam	pdostatement	bindparam	bindvalue
you could try pdostatement bindvalue as it seems that pdo will modify the reference you are passing in to bindparam even though it should only read it

7289058
bindparam	pdostatement
from pdostatement bindparam

7289058
pdostatement	bindvalue
unlike pdostatement bindvalue the variable is bound as a reference and will only be evaluated at the time that pdostatement execute is called

7289099
put	get
if i understand you correctly you have to get rid of in the loop and just put before the loop

7289143
post	get
within your function you have access to the wp object and you can get either the pagename or the post name with

7289143
post	get
if on the other hand you really need the post data the first place to get it and arguably in this context the best is

7289165
restrict	shared
in the same way if the first eight logical cpus shared an l3 cache and the other group of eight logical cpus shared an l3 cache then 8 threads modifying the same memory may run better when restrict to one group of logical cpus and not spread across separate physical chips with separate l3 caches

7289198
subtract	add
the latter is trivial - just add and subtract a value

7289250
inherited	properties
and because clr don t allow you to inherited from structs - you should specify an interface and encapsulate your fields into properties in your structure

7289252
post	get
the following url points to a blog post with links to resources that will help you get started

7289295
rss	feed
i currently have an android activity which manages some locally-stored rss feed

7289301
xdebug	xhprof
because you will download xdebug report to local machine but with xhprof you will look at profiler page in real time

7289315
put	get	uilabel	uibutton
finally i get to replacing it with a button so i delete the uilabel and put a uibutton in its place keep in mind this is all in interface builder

7289318
installation	downgrade
if using .net 4 specific features is less important than avoiding installation you can try to downgrade your app to .net 2 or even .net 1

7289339
screens	tablet
working with a xoom tablet and the menu options button on the bottom of the screens does not light up is not active

7289364
post	get
i will try the other suggestions when i get back and post my findings

7289406
width	height
so the first thing you have to do is calculate the rectanle x y width and height which defines the visible area of your original image

7289409
google-chrome	safari
webkit for safari and google-chrome though each have differences themselves

7289434
content-length	content-type
additionally you can set content-length header but in my opinion if you are building webservice it s not http server proxy server content-type is enough

7289474
accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
in their sample app the geocoder is set using the properties accessor otherwise the autorelease will release the ivar when you exit the method

7289476
width	height
so i need to tell the div wrapping around the iframe to change its width and height

7289482
int	double
not much you can do with this unless you pass in an array of double int

7289512
oncreate	ondestroy
the game data is loaded in the oncreate method and saved ondestroy so it s a problem if i can t then send that data on

7289512
getter	setter
need some very basic help with setter and getter

7289512
getter	setter
i was trying to use bundles but it was suggested using setter and getter would be simpler

7289555
getter	setter
i don t fully understand the question but to use those setter and getter that you wrote you will have to have a spacewarz object created somewhere in your code

7289555
getter	setter
then you can call its setter or getter method

7289560
jar	war
this will let you call out your jar just like you do a dependency but it will copy it wherever you like so that it can be included in your war

7289566
getter	setter
but getter setter are as simple as they sound

7289593
width	height
to put the values of the width and height variables in the string you have to concatentate them into a string

7289616
post	get
at my current website i am using this code to get the first image witch is inside the post

7289616
post	get
i wanted to know how to get all the images that are in the post not only the first one

7289677
freebsd	linux
while i haven t verified the exact process for gnu linux on freebsd it works like so

7289753
dateadd	datepart
2 use dateadd and datepart to add hours first then minutes then seconds...

7289756
inherited	properties
what is plain wrong is trying to inherited from dependencyobject as viewmodel and specifying dependency properties

7289757
udp	tcp
http and tcp udp reside in different layers of the communications systems models the two most popular being the osi model and the tcp ip model

7289757
udp	tcp
i can t tell you if you should use tcp or udp - that depends on lots of factors but the basic difference is that a tcp connection would guarantee a successful delivery if there s connectivity available or an error message if not while udp just sends the data and doesn t care if it gets there or not for streaming live video there s no point in ensuring that every bit of data is being transferred as 1 second later it s no longer relevant

7289774
sorting	grouping
sorting details is not as simple as sorting grouping

7289774
sorting	grouping
sorting details is not really point and click like sorting grouping

7289777
google-chrome	firefox
however even though a verbose mode is available in firefox with webgl.verbose set to true i haven t found such a thing for google-chrome

7289790
post	get
you would need to use group by to get the post count

7289849
stdout	fflush
it s possible that the second line doesn t print because stdout isn t fflush

7289865
jar	war
you probably have added the same jar file in both your war and your ear and you use it in your ear

7289900
filtering	grouping	sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping	int	boolean
the has method is for attributes - which are mostly int floats timestamps and boolean values which are used by developers for sorting filtering and grouping

7289911
int	chars
and you re only supposed to use int signed unsigned or otherwise as the type not chars

7289956
put	get
but if i put the run_test helper call in the view twice i get a double render error which shouldn t be happening with partials

7289958
do-while	break
an unlabelled break only break out of the enclosing switch for while or do-while construct

7289969
many-to-many	one-to-many
technically if two people live at the same address you would not be completely normalized if there was simply a single one-to-many detail table for the row in tblperson called tbladdress however if you want just one instance per physical address you will incur the overhead of a many-to-many relation table of tblpersonaddresses which fk s to tbladdress

7290106
children	parent
i wouldn t recommend this solution if the user can reassign the parent of a category because you need to regenerate the lineage for all affected children

7290145
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome ie8 not checked 9 and firefox 3.5 this looked perfect

7290160
put	get
also you neither need to compare the return value of get to n nor put it in a loop

7290174
qtreeview	qmodelindex
the signal for a qtreeview expansion event is expanded qmodelindex

7290214
google-chrome	firefox
and suddenly i get 2 to 5 mm of green space between the two iframe s folder content email content in both google-chrome and ie8 haven t tested firefox

7290217
post	get
keep in mind that people could load a page in their browser and then use the javascript console built into most browsers to load your ajax page providing whatever get post data they want

7290220
switching	screens
choose task manager select my app shown in the list and select switching to to bring the app to the front instead of activity 2 it ends up on the activity screens 1

7290227

7290274
interpreted-language	smalltalk
there are already some things allowing simple development on android using interpreted-language like smalltalk web-based development etc

7290284
profiling	instrumentation
compiling with -pg instrumentation your code so that gprof reports detailed information see gprof s manual 9.1 implementation of profiling

7290284
profiling	instrumentation
please note that with such an instrumenting profiling you re profiling the same code you would compile in release without profiling instrumentation

7290284
profiler	vtune
contrary to an instrumenting profiler a sampling profiler like intel vtune works on non instrumented code by looking at the target program s program counter at regular intervals using operating system interrupts

7290383
rss	feed
i am not always going to have an even number of items in the rss feed so at the end of the table i might have only one table cell on the last row

7290442
rss	feed
in this case you d have the first rss feed item in an itemtemplate then the second rss feed item in an alternateitemtemplate another row then the third rss feed item in an itemtemplate and so on

7290458
division	modulo
if you have exponentiation division integer truncation and modulo you could use the following to see if to find out if bit x is set

7290493
int	double
for float and double the semantics of the enumfrom family is given by the rules for int above except that the list terminates when the elements become greater than e3 + iâˆ 2 for positive increment i or when they become less than e3 + iâˆ 2 for negative i

uitableview	nsindexpath
based on the sample app i ve added the following to my - uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath function

7290592
submit	submission
you have not shown what your submit function does but if it does a normal form submission not ajax then you will need to redirect at a later time

7290612
post	get
i m assuming you ll know the user advertiser id based on authentication so you can have an empty create method signature for the get to display the form and a create method signature that takes an advertisement object for the post

7290637
vbo	normals
i found someplace that listed these as the indices for glvertexattribpointer but they could easily be wrong these are the shader position shader normals etc in the vbo setup function

7290639
gif	png
if i have an image jpg png gif .doesn t really matter and i want to have some javascript code change part of an image

7290720

7290732
post	get
i m going to be writing a pagercurrsor adapter for sqlite so i ll post it here when i get it working

7290762
multiplying	add
i think this would work but it s clumsy means preprocessing the deps file to add all that build whatever prefix stuff and would multiplying its size by however many kinds of builds

7290850
folder	directory
you can use project_loc at the begining to specify the project directory so for your example you would type project_loc src main res as the folder to link to and use the automatically generated name of res for the created folder

7290855
postgresql	mysql
as far as databases go there are plenty you can use mysql sql server postgresql etc.

7290967
int	chars
then use the chr built-in to convert a 8-bit int that is in the inclusive range 0-255 to a chars

7290981
jar	war
just add an execution of it somewhere before your war is built to copy the jar to an appropriate place

7290987
folder	directory
i ve created a services folder under the app directory to contain services like this in the past as well

7291023

grass	proj
you might benefit from combining each proj into a single war but i do think this is really one of those the grass is always greener problems

7291086
coldspring	model-glue
fortunately model-glue has tight integration with coldspring a popular bean container for cfml and model-glue 3 makes it easier than ever to use coldspring beans in your controllers

7291144
pull	push
once the upstream branch has been configured you can use a bare git pull to automatically pull from origin new_auth when you have new_auth checked out you might also want to git config push.default upstream so that git push will only push to the upstream branch instead of pushing all branch names that exist in both your local and the remote repositories

7291146
google-chrome	firefox
i also got frustrated why the json file not being processed even if i don t use google-chrome - i use firefox or ie

7291270
rss	feed
i m using codeigniter and inputting some data from rss feed

7291313
free	malloc
as asveikau mentioned you could longjmp out of the signal handler and try to clean up but this could make an even worse mess if the crash happened in the middle of malloc free printf or any function modifying the state of global data or data that s shared with other threads or that will be accessed in the cleanup code at the longjmp destination

7291333
jobs	cron
using heroku - as i plan - the most frequent cron jobs would run hourly which i don t think will be acceptable

7291379
folder	directory
here i am going to add some files in my project and this files need to be copied in document directory folder

7291440
post	get
i stopped searching after reading several post by others who were unable to get this function working some stating that it requires a system reboot

7291441
post	get
also note that you are first doing a post request to maps_append.php which will have both and set to the options you sent then once that script has returned a response you make a get request by using the load method which will then replace the html in #append

7291452
stdout	stderr
i want to make it so that the stdout and stderr output from check_call is sent to syslog

7291486
stdout	stderr
yes it is possible but i think you would need to use popen instead of check_call and send the process stdout and stderr to a properly configured logger

7291538
google-chrome	firefox
correct it is not possible for javascript to detect if a link is visited in either firefox or google-chrome -- which are the only 2 browsers applicable in this greasemonkey context

7291538
google-chrome	firefox
that is because firefox and google-chrome take security and privacy seriously

7291538
pseudo-class	visited
it is possible for style sheet authors to abuse the link and visited pseudo-class to determine which sites a user has visited without the user s consent

7291560
width	height
i was able to solve it by setting the width and height both to 100 on a div wrapping the content i was rendering within the colorbox

7291564
google-chrome	firefox
in order to call it from globally as .myobjectfunction from a console in firefox google-chrome

hide	show
in finder press cmd-i to see file info including its full name and the option to show hide the extension

to read an array of chars supposing there are no spaces or other delimiter you can read the whole of it from input stream at once

7291656
int	chars
to create an array of int you can read the input chars by chars and fill the array in place

7291678

from looking at the sample code from the link you posted it would appear that the rpc is implements by extends a servlet class

7292062
octal	decimal
you can t say that a variable contains a hexadecimal value decimal value or octal value.

the thing to note is that any uiviewcontroller s views that are added to the uinavigationcontroller will all have their content constrained to navview s bounds not the frame of the subviews added to the uinavigationcontroller so the content in each subview should be created to properly display for the navview s bounds

implements	extends
so i noticed this wired spring aop s behavior - if your class implements some interfaces then it will use jdk s proxies to implements them and delegate all calls to target but if class does not implements any interfaces then it will use cglib to extends your class and delegate each method call

7297068

7297255
ubuntu	debian
option 2 debian ubuntu

7297296
oncreate	ondestroy
this makes me think i should register it in oncreate and unregister it in ondestroy

7297308

the typical place to do this is in onpause and onresume

7297313
post	put
i don t know which page those are supposed to go on because the post that contain them from googling don t usually say on which page to put the codes

7297335
int	double
we can think about this as for instance int or double

7297335
int	double
so its type is a function which takes an int double and triples it and ads the two together

7297346
mockito	easymock	easymock	powermockito
however powermockito can be used with either easymock or mockito to mock a static method call

7297356

i use debian but i guess cron is in the default installation of ubuntu

7297445
put	get
before we get to that question we put on our statistical caps the profiling reports from summaryrprof profr ggplot etc. only reflect the cumulative time spent for a given call or for calls beneath a given call

7297445
profiling	instrumentation
as r doesn t yet have line profiling like python and matlab the simplest way to handle this is to just instrumentation one s code

7297450
udp	tcp
this is almost impossible to do for tcp but can be done for udp

7297451
png	ico
you can t just save it as a png with the ico extension.

7297451
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i m guessing google-chrome opera firefox can t read the file so they decide to open up the file and find out what the actual format is rather than depending on the file extension while ie doesn t

7297457
int	chars
notice the second line where i had to cast back down to chars from int as the addition operation is automatically widened to an int

7297481
addclass	removeclass
the float isn t being added as a class so using addclass or removeclass will have no effect on it

7297481
folder	directory
just copy the image plugin folder from the ckeditor _source plugins directory and put it in the ckeditor plugins directory

7297499
post	get

trie	tree
this is homework and it isn t a requirement to make it a compressed suffix trie which is basically a suffix tree

7297576
for-loop	loops
in the for-loop main method i am creating taskjob class objects which are local to loops

7297585
cpu	processors
i have a celeron processors and android emulator on eclipse uses 100 of cpu and hangs everything unless i kill it

7297674
filtering	grouping
the having clause is used to filtering grouping of rows

7297674
min	max
you reference min a and max a which in the absence of any group by clause aggregate over all a values in the table but then use a comparison against a single a value

7297716
min	max
that relationship would be many-to-many with team with a min and max value of 2

7297768
matlab	simulink
there is a library for matlab titled hardware input output library for matlab simulink by werner.zimmermann that have some good facilities such that it can make simulink to be run near real- time and it can make connection and send data via tcp ip between two computers but it seems it can just make the connection between two computers running simulink

7297768
matlab	simulink
it also have some constraints for os and version of matlab simulink and is not updated

7297785
button	checkbox
i followed but that wasn t enough for me because i have to handle with checkbox and radio button

7297970
filesystems	ntfs
if you are using windows 6 or later vista 7 2008 2008r2 the ntfs filesystems supports transactions including within a distributed transaction but you will need to use p invoke to call win32 apis see this question

7297971
postgresql	mysql
to do in postgresql what mysql allows requires a subselect

7297976
mouseover	mouseout
use the jquery .hover method instead of binding mouseover and mouseout

7297976
mouseleave	mouseenter
the .hover is actually binding the mouseenter and mouseleave events which are what you were looking for

7297982
int	double
note that this will view 1.00000000001 as still a double - if these are values which have been computed and so may just be very close to int values you may want to add some tolerance

7297982
int	double
also note that this will start failing for very large int as they can t be exactly represented in double anyway - you may want to consider using bigdecimal instead if you re dealing with a very wide range

7297992
udp	tcp
there is an excellent article about udp and tcp hole punching techniques

7298039
salt	md5
so md5 + strong password + average salt is better than usual password + phpass

7298039

to check is the lib ok make the md5 hash of it and compare with the md5 hash of the lib on a working system

7298209
accelerometer	gyroscope
devices with a gyroscope also have a three-axis accelerometer in addition to the traditional one that measures acceleration individually along three axes

7298300
vim	emacs
it could be separated from the eclipse ui and it could be run in a separate process with which emacs vim and other editors simply talk to when they need information want to perform intelligent code completion or do some refactoring

7298350
vim	emacs
as a vim lover i can t speak for emacs

7298370
public	protected	inherited	properties

7298443
inherited	properties
static methods and properties will get inherited the same as non-static methods and properties and obey the same visibility rules

7298443
inherited	properties
incrementing an inherited static properties in the base class will also increment it in all the child classes and vice versa

7298453

if you have forms then what you should do in your case is to put method post so that the fields don t end up in the url at all in your case

7298514
width	height
cell size of 74 pixels for the height and width of a cell

7298514
width	height
minimum width and height in density-independent pixels dp use this

7298514
width	height
following this formula you should use 72 dp for a height of one cell 294 dp and for a width of four cells

7298518
width	height
as you can read here one cell in height takes 80 pixels and 100 in width so you should change 200 to 160 if you want 2 cells

7298552
rsa	aes
what you can do is use asymmetric cryptography in javascript include javascript encryption code for example rsa not the symmetric aes and a public key in your code

7298788
for-loop	loops
i had tried to create a load of nested for loops to go through the collection of players etc and attempt to replace the tags each time but with there being many possibilities of tags i was just creating one nested for-loop within another and it has become unmanageable and also i suspect inefficient since i need to loops through over 1 000 base string like the samples above and replace difference tags with players etc for each one.

i just want to add these qtextedit to the qmainwindow and later remove them

7300027
qtextedit	qmainwindow
i also tried new qtextedit this hoping it would appear on the qmainwindow with the properties defined by the objects geometry to no luck

7300027
qtextedit	qmainwindow
if i setcentralwidget to be that of the qtextedit than it works but i don t want the object to consume the entire qmainwindow and restrict access to existing widgets

7300242
width	height
the second idea was to listen to document height and width changes which i think is the most efficient way to do it

7300297
width	height
another example is a class which has height and width properties but you also want to give the user a convenient area property

7300297
width	height
you obviously don t want to have a separate variable for area so you just write a __get method which returns the height multiplied by the width when the user asks for the area

gridview	objectdatasource
i m facing a very strange problem with a gridview an objectdatasource and two radiobuttons in a group

7300570
int	double
then in method foo you are trying to pass a to updateobject but since the compiler doesn t know which generic type your collection accepts it could be int like in my example but it could also be double or any other type that extends number it won t allow any object to be passed

7300584
pop-up	dialog
when i press it i want a dialog pop-up asking the user to login in with their facebook account

you can test it here that in ie9 the demo display alert with the text object window and on the current versions of google-chrome and firefox you will see undefined

7300595
post	get
i need my code to be notified when a user want s to send a get post or even ajax request to a url

7300607
put	get	post	get	post	put

7300736
keydown	keyup
use keydown in place of keyup

7300749
spoofing	traffic
the remote database check is still a bad idea though because people can sniff the network traffic and reverse engineer the keys or learn how to spoofing the response a simple hosts file edit could intercept the network traffic

7300755
google-chrome	firefox
it seems to work on all the elements where it has been applied in both google-chrome and firefox except for select and input

7300755
google-chrome	firefox
it will work fine for these input types in firefox but not in google-chrome

7300786
google-chrome	firefox
this web app works in html5 browsers like google-chrome or firefox

7300804
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
objectinputstream can reconstruct any data previously written serialized by objectoutputstream -- so in this case you de-serialize a previously serialized object of type john

7300913
width	height
thus if your view has a width height aspect ratio of 2 1 then the west east boundaries would be 200m from the center while north south boundaries 100m from the center

7300914
hide	show
add an uiactivityindicatorview to your view in interface builder connect it to your code and use the delegate methods sami already pointed out to show hide the uiactivityindicatorview that s the spinner you re talking about

7300979
hide	show
looking at your example i would suggest you to use jquery slidetoggle method which show hide alternatively

7300981

7301006
int	chars
because you are passing in a value of type chars which is a signed type the value is being converted to an int and being sign extended

7301006
put	get
you can get more info here printf placeholders essentially between the and the x you can put extra parameters

7301007
int	chars
chars is a signed type it gets promoted to int when passed as an argument

7301009
int	chars
this means printf expect an int or a long again depends on os but you are only supplying it with chars so the value is up-cast to the appropriate type

7301014
draggable	droppable
the problem is that both the draggable and droppable is attached to it but is not working

7301088
put	get
i put some logging in the init method and created a singleton class called ratespoller that the init tries to get an instance of

7301146

7301352
qlistwidget	qtextedit
i wanted to add multiple qtextedit so i can use a residing qlistwidget

7301352
qstackedwidget	qtextedit
you could put a qstackedwidget in place of your qtextedit and add all the qtextedit s to it

7301352
qlistwidget	qtextedit
only one of the textedits would be visible at all time but you can switch between them automatically by connecting the signal currentrowchanged int of your qlistwidget to the slot setcurrentindex int so that the index of the qtextedit stay the same as the index of the selected item in your list

7301383
implements	extends
i have created an abstract class activitytemplate which extends the activity class and implements some callbacks ontouchlistener

7301400
inherited	subclassing
when using inherited always ask yourself the question whether your subclassing has an is-a relationship with the parent

7301421
iprincipal	iidentity
by creating your own implementation you can control the creation of the iprincipal and iidentity instances which are passed around in the context

7301485
ssl	https
as long as you have an ssl cert and serve traffic over https then you should be fine

7301537

i want to be able to move multiple drawables with the drag simultaneously

7301660
integer	unsigned
use an unsigned integer rather than a signed one

7301660
int	chars
actually there s probably 32 bits there since you re using an int and not a chars

7301672
int	chars
you can print it as an unsigned chars int unsigned int notletter or

7301691
addition	multiplication	subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication
a trivial hash is where we mix values of object by multiplication addition and subtraction with some prime

7301699

shape.transform is a transform which indicates how this shape and its children relates to its parent

7301752
xna	spritebatch
the xna hasn t support for drawing single line pixels to screen directly need to pass through a spritebatch

7301787
google-chrome	firefox
everything works fine in ie9 and firefox and google-chrome even iphone but ie8 and ie7 throws an error i debugged the issue to be that the .css method can t resolve the property

7301840
width	height
this query should give you max for the width and height given the two need not to be associated with anything

7301852
width	height
it expects both a and b to be objects with x y width and height properties

7301881
django	web2py
i ve flirted with django but i just recently discovered web2py and it s definitely caught my eye

textile	asciidoc
you d have a inst wiki subdirectory with plain text files in markdown asciidoc textile with embedded r code

7301957
awt	swing
swing is double buffered by default and i see no reason to use awt components with a buffer stategy

7301963
jruby	mri
but unless you really need to use the c-ruby mri i would greatly recommend you to avoid any of the approaches above and just use jruby as delving into native code will lead to possible segfaults memory management issues and all options above force you to run in a single thread while you could build a multi-threaded solution by using jruby

7301985
httpresponse	request
i was looking over some code and came to this question -- django what is the difference b w httpresponse vs httpresponseredirect vs render_to_response -- which discusses the different types of request responses

7302014
post	put
to put data i use dopost post request

7302014
post	get
from reading the references i got the idea to use post whenever you change the database and get is simply for fetching the data

7302038
vim	notepad++
using regular expressions to do mass replace in notepad++ and vim

7302112
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome are both refreshing the entire page

ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
ubuntu linux debian linux in the intro tutorial linked above

7302230
rss	feed
just out of interest why don t you use the rss feed instead - it s probably more consistently formatted strictly encoded as it s xml not html

7302255
int	double
in doing so it can also handle missing int and double otherwise the resulting data type will remain as string eg

7302366
printf	strlen
you also can t use any of the standard functions like strlen printf and friends

7302375
next	document.write
it is because of document.write which clears table so in the next iteration document.getelementsbytagname tr returns nothing

7302383
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
however i don t have any uinavigationbar in my xib file as it is created programatically via the uinavigationcontroller

7302406
width	height
fwiw it appears that setting the width height of the div containing the uploader to 0 does not make the error occur

7302426
getter	setter
i assume it is related to the fact that the code uses indexed properties with getter and setter defined in an ancestor class

7302426
getter	setter
i guess you could write your own getter and setter and call the inherited getter with the given index

7302466
minimum	max
the idea is that a max and a minimum value are posted and then a random number between the two is generated

7302510
width	height	portrait	landscape
i drop this on my main page in the wp7 app and it looks fine in landscape mode but when i switch to portrait the width expands and the height contracts so it is no longer a circle

7302510
width	height
i ve tried putting sizechanged event on layoutroot and setting the grdcircle width height to whatever was smaller - the layoutroot actual width or the layoutroot actual height but as soon as i do that changing the orientation doesn t fire the sizechanged event of layoutroot anymore because layoutroot also becomes smaller

7302526
width	height
graphviz only supports svg input where the width and height attributes are set on using absolute units pixels inches etc.

7302561
processors	hyperthreading
when you enable hyperthreading all processors become virtual

7302561
processors	hyperthreading
when you turn on hyperthreading each individual physical processors

7302574
put	get
i have tried to do this a few ways but the closest i can get is a function which will put all the more values into 1 array like this

7302585
rspec	minitest
my current client uses ruby 1.9.2 and all the tests are written using minitest and they are concerned about the slowness of rspec

7302595
disk	ram
stuff like ram disk can speed up stuff like -compilereport since it can generate a huge number of files

7302596
width	height
represents a object type that has a width height and imagemetadata such as a bitmapsource and a drawingimage

7302610
width	height
represents a object type --- that has a width height and imagemetadata --- such as a bitmapsource and a drawingimage

7302657
gridview	sqldatasource
in search.aspx i have gridview that shows me results and sqldatasource

7302718
jar	manifest.mf
after searching on the internet i found that it is necessary to specify a main class in the file manifest.mf of a jar file in order to run it

7302728
twig	smarty
the slim framework makes use of other templating engines such as twig or smarty so as long as you choose a templating engine that allows subviews then it ll work

7302747
sorting	grouping
using the muenchian grouping method plus sorting we obtain in sorted order each grouping of name elements consisting of all names starting with the same character

7302753
strcpy	getline
use getline in the while condition and get the string delimeted by n and use strcpy

7302759
public	protected
this allows you test code to call package private and protected methods making it much easier to test internal behaviour that should not be exposed in the public api

7302766
mdpi	hdpi
so on device there s the drawable directories for hdpi mdpi ldpi etc.

7302766
mdpi	hdpi
is there some way i can check if the current device is hdpi mdpi ldpi and download the right resolution accordingly

7302787
hide	show
you can still use autocomplete on an input element that is hidden and you can hide and show the element or its containing div as much as you like

7302824
addclass	removeclass
an alternative is using addclass and removeclass but i have not been able to re-create the exact behavior that i can get with animate

7302824
addclass	removeclass
here is my current best attempt using addclass and removeclass note that for the animation to work you need jquery-ui

7302824
addclass	removeclass
when animating addclass and removeclass jquery adds a temporary style to the element and then increments the appropriate values until they reach the values of the provided class and only then does it actually add remove the class

7302865
width	height
then set the top left margins as half the height and half the width to center the whole iframe

7302877
cos	sin
so we take the standard usage and swap sin and cos

7302881
clang	llvm
llvm bug 5960 shows that this problem results from an interaction between clang s c99 support and the old version of gnu libc that is installed on rhel 5

ssl	https
put your entire page on ssl https

7302901
qlabel	qtextbrowser
if you really want to use a qtextbrowser you can try something like this adapted from qlabel source code

7302905
swing	windowbuilder
if you want to target swing you can use google s windowbuilder

7302929
margin	height
i need to use the top property instead of bottom because the div must be aligned with the top margin and depending on its content may have different height

7302934
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the uinavigationcontroller is a subclass of uiviewcontroller â that lets you navigate among the pages

7302955
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
works great in google-chrome firefox safari everything except drumroll please internet exploder 8.0

7302966
g++	gcc
install packages make gcc g++ cmake and cygidn in your cygwin

7302981
pop-up	dialog
another way is to create a linked table for the .csv file select the correct file type from the open dialog pop-up form when creating a new linked table and create an append query with the additional field holding date or now as default value

7302994
abstract-class	superclass
let s say i have an abstract-class superclass from which i derived

7302994
superclass	subclassing
myfield s type should be a list of a fixed subclassing of superclass either

google-chrome	firefox
i am trying to get a horizontal line to work in my blog site but i am having trouble in displaying the line in google-chrome ie and firefox display it perfectly

7303020
range	minimum
the above mentioned query get the difference between maximum and minimum values and divide by 9 turn out to be 10 sections for each range of data i would like to get how many records belongs to that range

7303035
width	height
i use jquery mobile to generate my buttons and i have a css code below to change its design but no matter what value i put in width and height the size of the button doesn t change but it is relatively dependent on the font size of the label

7303049
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontroller are there to help you control the hierarchy of your app

7303049
flip	slide

7303056
macports	homebrew	fink	macports	fink	homebrew
if you want a later gcc macports and fink and homebrew have a later version as a port

7303069
hide	show
then in your javascript you hide the standard login div and show the forgotten details one

7303074
width	height
to speed things up create just one array the largetst pixel width height and reuse it throughout the lifetime of the function

7303118
hash	salt
but note that salt don t really make a lot of sense for something like aes because it s not a hash algorithm

7303120
post	put
i d take telerik hands down...#1 reason being support #2 reason is that if the control can t do what you need you just need to put in a ticket or post to the support forums and you can drive their feature development

7303210
post	get
i am currently just converting it to a querystring and posting it as a get however what i really need is something that will convert my array to a data array for the ajax post as the querystring becomes too long

7303234
folder	directory
i want to replace the src obviously with my own logo3w.png that will be located in the root of the extension folder thus afaik no advanced directory is needed

7303240
hide	show
the easier way is just to hide the navigation bar on the home view and show it back on the other view.

7303273
hash	salt
a salt is most typically encountered with cryptographic hash functions not encryption functions

7303273
hash	salt
the idea is that rather than hashing just your data a password you hash data+salt where salt is typically a randomly-generated string

7303286
hide	show
i have a previously working website that uses a small jquery script to trigger an image with the class content slide to animate when rolled over and show a div containing content when clicked and hide in when clicked again etc. this worked fine in my main pages example index.html but does not work on my subdirectory pages example subdir code howcssworks.html and i m assuming it s due to the relative link paths no longer working

7303302
comparator	comparable
here are few differences between comparator and comparable i found on web

7303302
comparator	comparable
if you see then logical difference between these two is comparator in java compare two objects provided to him while comparable interface compares this reference with the object specified

7303302
comparator	comparable
if any class implement comparable interface in java then collection of that object either list or array can be sorted automatically by using collections.sort or array.sort method and object will be sorted based on there natural order defined by comparator method

7303302
comparator	comparable
objects which implement comparable in java can be used as keys in a sorted map or elements in a sorted set for example treeset without specifying any comparator

7303307
getter	setter
i create a getter and setter using date or whatever java temporal objects you are comfortable with i prefer date for its immutability but the actual column is a long or long unfortunately it implies a null check needs to be done

7303314
width	height
by default a is display inline and so does not establish box with width height

7303322
min	max
i m trying to get the min max for each column in a large data frame as part of getting to know my data

7303347
hide	show
the idea is an alphabetically ordered and grouped series of unordered lists which i can show and hide easily using javascript

7303362
unification	inference
it already can t do the unification and type inference until it reaches the end of the function

7303387
folder	directory
here is the original directory layout of the tests folder

7303389
actionscript	mxml
i find the flexibility in using fx script to get all as3 see each other easily but i have a few mxml module some actionscript from main.mxml want to access the id in specific module such as module1.mxml

7303391
rsa	aes
generally first make sure you can reliably encrypt decrypt using aes then you might move on to using rsa

7303420
min	max
unless you specify that it is an ordered factor operations like max and min will be undefined since r is assuming that you ve created an unordered factor

7303420
min	max
note that this just means that min and max will assume alphabetical ordering by default

7303435
google-chrome	firefox
also google-chrome ie and firefox on both platforms

7303442
imperative	declarative
imperative and declarative describe two opposing styles of programming

7303442
imperative	declarative
imperative is the traditional step by step recipe approach while declarative is more this is what i want now you work out how to do it

7303442
imperative	declarative
so it s not unusual for some parts of a program to be written in a more declarative style but for the speed-critical parts to be more imperative

7303442
imperative	declarative
as you might imagine the language you use to write a program affects how declarative you can be - a language that has built-in smarts for working out what to do given a description of the result is going to allow a much more declarative approach than one where the programmer needs to first add that kind of intelligence with imperative code before being able to build a more declarative layer on top

7303442
imperative	declarative
it might seem odd then that functional imperative and declarative are often mentioned together

7303442
imperative	declarative
and if you do that - if you limit how variables can change - then almost by accident you end up forcing the programmer to write programs that are more declarative because a large part of imperative programming is describing how variables change and you can no longer do that

7303442
imperative	declarative
imperative and declarative are two opposing styles of programming the same names are used for programming languages that encourage those styles

7303470
int	chars
so if the user has a 2 card they enter 2 but that 2 is actually chars and must be converted to int

7303470
int	chars
points_for_card is of type chars and number_value is int

7303470
int	chars
so what i am going for here is if the user enters 3 as a chars it becomes int 3

7303470
int	chars
if i move points_for_card to int instead of chars then the arithmetic works perfectly for whatever numbers i enter because at that point it s just adding them together

7303523
inherited	properties
this means that movieclip not only contains it s own native functions and properties but also all functions and properties of sprite and all the functions and properties that sprite inherited from displayobjectcontainer as well and all the functions and properties within the other classes going all the way down the line to object

7303523
inherited	properties
therefore if you create a class that extends sprite you will automatically have access to all of sprite s native and inherited functions and properties

7303535
oncreate	onnewintent
i ve tried to set the launchmode to either singletask or singleinstance and android would bypass oncreate and directly call onnewintent which is expected as it s documented but the problem is each time the editnote then gets the same intent which contains the same rowid so step 3 above editnote a would be launched instead

7303551
post	get
when i make a post to the same url i get a rails exception

7303575

7303601
build.gradle	gradlew
to use gradlew add the following lines to your build.gradle file

7303631
width	height
the first one cannot change width or height i know this isn t responsive but the image size must remain the same within it

7303656
onkeyup	onkeydown
easiest thing to do would be in edit note b override onkeydown and onkeyup to start a new intent for the home screen as such

7303686
postgresql	mysql

pull	push
note that git push and git pull both accept zero or more refspecs as their final argument s

7303715
decoder	encoder
you can write a simple json encoder decoder in a page of code whereas xml and even yaml will require more complexity

this works nicely in google-chrome and firefox but fails in explorer

7304031
pivot-table	crosstab
in my case i would like to create pivot excel automatically using excel since jasper report crosstab is not sufficient for my client requirement so i have an idea to add vb script that will create pivot-table when the generated jasper report is opened for first time

7304049

getter	setter	tostring	getter
another possibility is to use gson note i use lombok here to generates getter setter tostring etc

pop-up	dialog
for some reason cr on my development machine didnt pop-up a dialog for datasource so i assumed it worked

7304293
public	protected
this includes public protected default package access and private methods but excludes inherited methods

7304304
post	get
you may be forced to use post in some circumstances for example if the amount of data you plan to send to the server is greater than the allowable get url length but generally this shouldn t be an issue

7304321
repo	egit	put	get
eclipse now comes with egit included so you could share your project as in put in version control in a git repo and you would get precisely the feature you are looking for

7304378

when compared directly ternary is the integer base with the highest radix economy followed closely by binary and quaternary

7304552
inherited	subclassing
so whenever you use generics the compiler puts all those generic inherited methods in the subclassing

7304552
superclass	subclassing
i just checked when i removed the generic related code the part from the superclass and the reflection code gave me exactly two methods in the subclassing even though it overrides them

7304554
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have a uinavigationcontroller which has a uitabbarcontroller as the rootviewcontroller

7304726
maven	pom.xml
as far as i know if the cloned repository lies on the root of your eclipse workspace and your maven project file hierarchy has a pom.xml on its root then importing such root project will rename the cloned folder with the template you chose defaults to artifactid

7304727
hide	show
to hide and show it just switch the subclassed viewâ s hidden property to either yes or no

7304729

7304820
superclass	subclassing
just define a common superclass c and two subclassing a b of c

7304878
inherited	base-class
the usual way to create a pointer that can point to either of the two is to make them inherited from a common base-class

7304878
base-class	subclassing
any pointer of the base-class can point to any subclassing

7304878
base-class	subclassing
as for your second question using the technique described above you can create a set of pointers to a base-class which can then hold instance of any of the subclassing these can also be mixed

7304910
nsstring	nsdata
make sure all the objects you keep in the array are the property list objects nsstring nsdata nsarray or nsdictionary

7304951
post	get
here is my understanding for post requests to a servlet we use a link thus making a get request on that servlet and in the servlet we need to call dopost from doget

7304967
google-chrome	firefox
on my computer i can replicate issue using google-chrome and colleague can replicate on firefox

7304967
versioning	upgrade
also my friend couldn t replicate this issue until he upgrade flash player to latest versioning

7305006
post	get
for post requests to a servlet we use a link thus making a get

7305006
post	get
the client side either makes a get or a post request

7305006
post	get
the convention is to use post to send post data to the server while get is used to return data

7305016
put	get	post	get	post	put
four methods are supported get post put delete

7305016
post	get

7305047
put	get
as long as whatever you put into the hash function generates the desired hash it will get you through correct input or incorrect input

7305047
hash	salt
if you include the username or a salt in the hash it s a different story

7305048
post	get
you can write a client that creates get and post http messages and invoke a servlet

7305048
post	get
also from your question you seem to thin that all servlets handle get requests via a post request

7305048
post	get
the reason it is done in the servlet you viewed is because the servlet does that same thing for both get and post request

7305048
post	get
well a browser is just a client that efficiently and easily lets us make get and post requests to a server in our case a servlet

7305048
post	get
we can also write a java proram to make get and post request to our servlet but that will be tedious and cumbersome

7305050
ubuntu	linux
the gcc toolchain is the very same we ve found only 1 difference to linux ubuntu in a 10k line source server stuff some include was in different place

7305057

7305057
g++	gcc
you should have no problem with gcc g++ etc

7305083
post	get
there are two was to call a servlet http get which invokes doget and http post which invokes dopost

7305083
post	get
customerservlet - use get to find records post to update

7305284
post	get
if you do want to get without making a call refer to this post instead

7305291
post	get
depending on the amount of theming and how you implement it you can either update the ui in javascript to the new theme which could be tedious possibly loading css on the fly and etc or maybe consider simply refreshing the page with a full post or get which would render the page server-side with the new theme settings since your brain.php would be executed again and it would pull the most recent data from the database

7305297
hash	md5
b take any md5 hash run it thru this algo

7305343
post	get
here is my understanding for post requests to a servlet we use a link thus making a get request on that servlet and in the servlet we need to call dopost from doget

7305343
post	get
get post

7305343
post	get
for convenience some ides set up servlets so their dopost method calls doget because they are intended to handle get and post requests identically

7305348
keydown	keyup
you might want to try keyup or keydown events assuming the update process will involve data entry

7305360
switching	screens
i got an null pointer exception on android 3.2 emulator on a simple android project created by wizerd with a service in separated process when i switching between stretch to fill screens to zoom to fill screens

7305360

weka	orange
if you look through the documentation of orange or weka i think it will give you a few ideas about what you could actually do with the data you have and when you know a few techniques that seem interesting to you and applicable to the data maybe you could get more quality comments and info on a few specific methods here than when just searching for a general advice

stdout	fflush
stdout is line-buffered by default which means that you only get updated output when you send a newline character or when you explicitly call fflush stdout

7307537
stdout	fflush
stdout is buffered and therefore you won t necessarily see the output until either the buffer is full a newline character has been encountered or you specifically fflush the stream

7307537
stdout	stderr
therefore if you re wanting to print debug messages use stderr instead of stdout

7307547

7315946
versioning	upgrade
everyone s talking so good about the performance in versioning 1.9.x i thought it might be worth the upgrade

7316000
concave	convex
i would need something robust for convex and concave polygons

7316039
stdout	stderr
you can read input from stdin and you cat write to stdout or stderr so if those are wired up to a console then you can theoretically prompt the user for input by writing to stdout and read the input back from stdin

7316044
centos	linux
this question has been asked few times here and there but you see all of them seem to have a linux desktop i don t want a notepad++ alternative for a linux desktop i want a notepad++ alternative for centos server and i want it to be like nano not like vi i don t know vi so i m looking for an editor that let me open a file on vps choose a programming language and it should correct my coding mistakes this way i would not waste my time uploading files from windows to the vps it should be easy to use and small i don t want to waste my vps resources on an editor

7316068
punctuation	words
you can add b before and after your search words - this is a words boundary and so will match beginning end of the string a space punctuation etc

7316078
uitabbaritem	uitabbarcontroller
i have a uitabbarcontroller if i push to different views from the first uitabbaritem and i tap the first uitabbar two times then the views that were pushed are popped back

7316088
hide	show
my idea right now would be have a cached collection of label tags innerhtml then loop through each tag and check for search term when found hide all others but show only matching. my concern is what will happen when list is too long on every keypress looping is not the best idea i suppose

7316209
post	get
post or get it doesn t matter the parameters would still show up in the url and you definitely don t want that

7316250
client-side	server-side
server-side standpoint client-side changes will be ignored

defaulttextformat is not a function it is setter getter

7316415
google-chrome	firefox
it happens only in firefox and google-chrome browsers

7316436
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
as far as sqlconnection goes it will only allow you to have a single query open at a time so if you re using sqldatareader you d again have to lock something

7316472
getter	setter
however for clarity and testing i would add public getter setter for the tree

7316472
getter	setter
your getter can lazy-load from zend_registry as you are doing but at least allowing a public setter more clearly reflects the dependence and allows you to test with a mock tree

7316486
primefaces	richfaces
i m familiar with richfaces but relatively new to primefaces and trying to implement a simple h graphicimage inside a p datatable additionally inside a ui repeat

7316490
mouseover	mouseout
given a number of .hovertarget divs on a page the mouseover mouseout events below seem to be firing synchronously - if you quickly move the mouse from one item a to another b the b fade-in will not start until the a fade-out has completed

7316505
move	drag
now i want the user to be able to rearrange the nodes using drag and drop so i move a node to its new parent in the data model

int	chars
no idea what pp is but strtol returns a long int which you re trying to assign to a chars - that s not going to work the way you think

7316533
hide	show
just for a quick start you will have to use binding of combobox s selecteditem with visibility of all those controls you want to hide show through a proper value converter

7316562
portrait	landscape
if you re looking for a simpel portrait vs landscape orientation info you should look into the interfaceorientation of the view controller

dlsym	dlopen
i would like to call this .c file using the mycode.so and dlopen and dlsym

7316611
richfaces	icefaces	primefaces	icefaces	primefaces	richfaces
currently there are other implementation that i am seeing the primefaces richfaces and icefaces

7316629
mouseover	mouseout
i would like to implement behaviour such that a mouseover hover event is triggered when the mouse pointer hovers over a certain div but such that the mouseout event tiggers not when the pointer leaves the div but when it leaves the area 10px ourside the div

7316651
getter	setter
declare a class that fits your needs with all the fields getter setter and constructors and inside your function you could create an instance of that class fill every field and return this class

7316657
cck	ubercart
use cck you can add custom fields to any node type including an ubercart listing page

7316689
serializable	deserialization
however during serializable and deserialization jackson transforms long values such as 4 to integers

i need to print five random words between min and max letters

7316779
pull	push
first all of you ll need to decide whether to adopt a push or pull model

7316781
int	boolean
instead boolean values are stored as int 0 false and 1 true

7316805
postgresql	mysql
i ve used database template library to good effect with oracle mysql postgresql and sqlite on windows mac os x and linux

7316862
int	double
since 0 is int in ansi c and any other number except float double and long double will be converted to int or unsigned int by int upgrade when compare with 0

7316864
for-loop	loops
you re declaring your string variable inside of your for-loop and then trying to return it after loops ends - i imagine you re getting a compile error

7316886
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
edit i just realised that this works in google-chrome and safari but not in firefox not had a chance to try it on windows yet

7316923
richfaces	icefaces	primefaces	icefaces	primefaces	richfaces
i do not have any metrics regarding performance between richfaces and icefaces primefaces but the ease of development should be approximately the same

7316923
richfaces	icefaces
imo richfaces and icefaces are the two frameworks that have been around the longest and i would put my bet on one of these two

7316924
mousemove	mouseenter
but if you insist on not creating another div then i would bind custom mousemove handler that would be binded on document on mouseenter over div and would detect the fact that mouse move away from div bounding box for more than 10px

7316945
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
first use touchesbegan and touchesmoved methods to detect how much pixels the image has been dragged

7316953

7316973
concave	convex
it is fully robust for both convex and concave polygons and runs in o n 2 time

7316981
getter	setter
and as normal i added synthesize to the property to generate setter and getter functions

7317000
hide	show
that way i can have more control of which elements to show and hide as well as the contents within each element but i can still hard-code my main page layout in the facelets template file

7317021
filtering	grouping
however this involves custom coding and this doesn t assign permissions automatically it just enables you to filtering documents by grouping

7317026
range	minimum
pre calculate the operations needed for the first minimum range after that just keep adding multiples of +12

7317028
hash	salt
then use a strong hash with salt for storing passwords like sha256 here is a sample

7317049
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it s simply unrealistic to try and provide the same experience for ie5.5 users as for firefox 6 safari and google-chrome users

7317056
hide	show
that way i can have more control of which elements to show and hide as well as the contents within each element but i can still hard-code my main page layout in the facelets template file

7317063
post	get
but according to this thread back from 2006 post by john resig so it should be legit source jquery was compatibile with ie 5.5+ in 2006 meaning based on this history that you can try to get it working on jquery 1.0

7317071
stdout	stderr
connect the repl to stdout stderr stdin

7317078
getter	setter
now these objects are created but you need to wire up these associations - you can do that externally in a separate initializer class container so to speak and just use setter getter to connect them

7317079
postgresql	mysql
geospatial data is a common specialization - so much so that a lot of other database types will provide vector functionality mysql and postgresql which are relational databases

7317092
getter	setter
note if you want to keep attributes inside private region then provide getter and setter methods in node for accessing them.

7317209
hide	show
i dont want to write javascripts for show hide of divs rather want logic to be coded somewhere at server side

7317225
put	get	post	get	post	put
in extjs4 any read is send by get and any write post put delete is send by post

7317348
queue	fifo
i use a simple queue implementation as my buffer where the first node is the oldest data fifo

7317362

first thing i d try is removing the property lines and synthesize line - so the getter and setter are created automagically

7317365
rss	feed
also i have downloaded universal feed reader python rss atom reader module

7317374
vim	emacs
all in all these are more powerful than nano but less powerful than np++ which i m not familiar with and a fortiori vim or emacs

7317374
vim	emacs
i don t know about emacs but vim can be used in easy mode like this vim -y yourfile.php

7317374
vim	emacs
vim and emacs both offer these fatures and sooo much more either natively or via plugins

7317374
vim	emacs
the first problems you may be facing is the abruptness of the learning path and the weirdness of their models but most vim emacs users will tell you that once its internalized it s hard to come back

7317382
ora-06512	oracle
oracle error code ora-06512 unhandled exception

7317465

in the applications jar manifest.mf looks like this

7317536
google-chrome	firefox
if you just want the website to work that s most likely already the case if the website works on webkit browsers which it usually should if it works on other popular browsers like firefox and google-chrome other than a few quirks

7317558
primefaces	richfaces
i used primefaces for a new project almost a year ago because at that time it was the only one that was fully compatible with jsf 2 both icefacves and richfaces have had jsf 2 compatible releases in the meantime

7317571
int	double
for general int of arbitrary precision you can use repeated squaring combined with a binary search to take logarithms using only o log log n arithmetic operations each time you square a number you double the exponent which means you can only square the number log log n times before you ve exceeded its value and can do a binary search

7317588
hide	show
this will show the .info div on the first click of .showdesc and hide it on the second and so on

7317590
int	chars
now suppose for whatever reason i don t want the users of class a to create objects with chars or class b which fortunately or unfortunately can implicitly convert to int then you can disable them as

7317613
int	chars
as someone else pointed out unsigned chars gets promoted to an int since any value of a for an unsigned chars a can easily fit in the range of an int

7317617
fadein	fadeout
you have jquery animation functions fadein and fadeout

7317617
hide	show
you can also use show and hide functions

7317668
hide	show
i have to do it because i hide a div including everything in it but it still show the textboxes that has validation

7317678
submit	submission
when submission the form the local server using http its working fine but when accessing sharepoint externally through https i m getting the below-warning message and i can t submit the form since i have try again and exit form

7317685
let	curry
first of all let s look at why f can be called with four arguments when its definition only names three arguments as you probably know ml allows curry function definitions and the definition is really just a shortcut for

7317695
implements	extends
if all the classes are implementations of matrices then it probably makes sense to have them implements a common interface or extends a common abstract class

7317823
width	height
in css an em does not represent the width of an â œmâ but rather the height of the current font

7317849
put	get
the second question is whether it is possible in the given layout to put that qualified value into some properties or defaults for jaxbcontext or use other non-declarative means allowing to get rid of package-info.java

7317860
nsstring	nsdata
i m trying to convert a hex nsstring to nsdata i m using the below attached code

7317874

you can try to force the parent linearlayout setting height and width manually or simply adding an imageview inside the framelayout

7317916
cassini	iis
it works great in cassini and when i use iis express but after doing publish and pointing iis to those files i get this message

7317937

7317956
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and ie works but not on google-chrome

7318004
getter	setter
but in my domain class private sting description property has public getter and setter

7318024
min	max
min max length will count space as an character

7318035
int	double
therefore if you send a double as argument of printf and read d it reads the same number of bytes 4 but interprets the bits as an int and not double -- what you get is gibberish

7318037
width	height
the height attribute as well as the width one must have an integer as value not a string

7318045
public	protected
after that you can call performfiltering 0 it s a protected function so you can export this call via a public function in your class

7318097
range	max
what i would like to do is have the range set as the already stored amounts if salarymin max are already set so that i can edit the form

7318097
min	max
i have no knowledge of javascript and was surprised i managed to get the min max values out in the first place

7318100
autoresetevent	manualresetevent

you can definitely push manually from your librariessubrepo in project1 to the libraries repository on the server and then manually pull from libraries into librariessubrepo in a project2 clone

7318295
button	checkbox
my requirement is to allow users to select multiple records using checkbox when they click on the print button the pdf should be generated printed for the selected records

7318361
unsigned	short
note that unsigned short is accepted as observed by inverting the 2 methods of the interface

7318388
sorting	grouping
then all the grouping sorting and the query will be implemented via

7318435
put	get
you could use js to get the data and put it into a two dimensional array

7318452
kerberos	ldap
use kerberos linux-based authentication server or other servers using kerberos ldap framework windows server instead of designing your own login algorithm

7318475
versioning	upgrade
try to upgrade to new versioning

i am working on a very simple app just for learning.this convert celcius value into fahrenheit value.it has a single view with two uitextfields and a button.after entering a celcius value in 1st uitextfield and clicking on the button a function with argument as - void requestcelciusandresponsefrnht nsstring textfieldstring is called.this method is in my nsobject class named webservicecall

7318516
nsstring	nsxmlparser
- void parser nsxmlparser parser didendelement nsstring elementname namespaceuri nsstring namespaceuri qualifiedname nsstring qname

7318519
filtering	grouping
beware because linq is implemented using deferred execution enumerating letterswithmultipleoccurences multiple times will perform the grouping and filtering multiple times

7318598
int	double
i needed a class that could create polygons with double or float numbers instead of int numbers

7318614
equals	gethashcode	iequalitycomparer	iequatable
this can be done by a custom iequalitycomparer link implementation or if you own the struct by implementing the iequatable interface with appropriate gethashcode and equals method overriding

7318636
oncreate	setcontentview
you need to call requestwindowfeature only once in oncreate before you call setcontentview

7318636
hide	show
then you can use setprogressbarindeterminatevisibility true|false to show or hide the progress indicator from anywhere in the activity as long as it is on the ui thread of course

7318639

all i know is break-which destroyes the for-loop and continue-which continue loops from the next iterate

7318640
post	get
now i would like to consume add-on which i have hosted on heroku platform add-on is simple rest wcf service like get post addon-menifest.json file looks like as per below

7318645
width	height
so there are different behaviors when using overflow float and height or width together

7318645
width	height
overflow will tell the browser what to do with the content that can t fit in the box if you have defined the dimensions of the box float will put elements next to each other respecting the dimensions of the parent element and height and width will delimit the visible area

7318705
google-chrome	firefox
it seems ok on google-chrome firefox

7318706
width	height
height 110px | width relevant to the height if the width is bigger than height

7318706
width	height
width 110px | height relevant to the width if the height is bigger than width

7318706
width	height
for example if the user uploads a picture with 110px width and 200px height dimensions after the resize the new image after crop will be 110x110 cropped by 90px from right

7318712
folder	directory
this function is giving me all the contents of the directory even inaccessible folder which i don t want to show the user client

my personal taste prefers primefaces but i haven t tried richfaces since it turned jsf 2 ready

7318746
hide	show
also i hide the first row no meaning to show and show the last period at the footer

7318764
nsmutablestring	nsstring
if you declared soapresults as an nsmutablestring but in fact affected an nsstring to it then you probably don t have a warning but will have a runtime error on execution

7318783
innodb	myisam
copy the whole disk if its myisam tables or just the innodb files if it s innodb

7318788

7318841
textview	imageview
each row contains the one textview and one imageview

7318842
for-loop	loops
maybe look at not using a for-loop and do your loops manually example below uses recursion

7318873
interbase	firebird
firebird + interbase

7318880
ienumerable	ilist
this will work with ilist even with ienumerable so you wont have to change the type of allrules

7318979
jobs	cron
a possible workaround might involve setting cron jobs to do your task in smaller parts

7319000
uiview	subviews
now i need to zoomin zoomout the image which is added to imageview which again add subviews uiview

7319083
min	max
then i get max min lat long and pull it out of coredata

7319083
min	max	range	max	range	min
when i zoomed out quite far it has a wide range from min to max

7319094
integer	unsigned
in old dos programs that used far - segmented - pointers as opposed to near pointers which only contained an offset and implicitly used ds segment register they were usually treated as 32-bit unsigned integer values where the 16 most significant bits were the segment and the 16 least significant bits the offset

7319099
min	max
where min and max are the min and max of your slider

7319102
post	get
there are i am sure better ways to do the above and i will post here should i get to know more myself

7319113
nsmutablestring	nsstring
as an aside nsstring is really an nsmutablestring code-wise even though nsmutablestring is a subclass of nsstring

7319113
nsmutablestring	nsstring
still casting an nsstring to an nsmutablestring is not a good idea what really needs to be done is find where it is becoming an nsstring and fix that

7319114
qmainwindow	qwidget
in your thread manager thread your main qwidget or qmainwindow you could have a queue manager class that has a slot to which this signal is connected

it all works well but i need the script to resize the height and then crop the width so that the aspect ratio does not get messed up

7319340
nsurl	nsstring	nsurl	nsdata	nsstring	nsdata
option 3 is for things like nsstring nsdata nsurl nsset ndictionary etc - basically

7319373
interbase	firebird
for firebird and interbase

7319399
width	height
even that is not a correct descriptor for an applet which must explicitly state a documentbase name width height

7319408
width	height
scale to fit -- the image is resized so that one dimension width or height has the desired size while the other is same or shorter while maintaining aspect ratio one extra step may be required to fill the shorter side with solid color

7319408
width	height
crop to fit -- the image is resized so that one dimension width or height has the desired size while the other is same or longer while maintaining aspect ratio one extra step is required to trim the outside region

7319441
websphere	ibm
i am using ibm rad and websphere

7319446

uiview	calayer
yes you can add a border to any uiview uibutton is a subclass of uiview by accessing properties of the calayer in the view

7319550
button	checkbox
you could output the html for the checkbox and button straight away and later add behaviour to them using selectors or you could output the tree first and then after document.ready modify the dom by using jquery s dom modification such as before

7319571
put	get
i originally put this service call in this particular actionresult method as still being new to mvc i was falsely under the impression that it would get fired before any of the main page content for each page across the site

the orientation changes to landscape - the user clicks a button that shows another view - this new view gets created and shown but its default positioning is for portrait orientation - when the view is shown the elements i rearrange in the willanimaterotationtointerfaceorientation method are in the wrong position

7324849
fflush	gets
a stream may use an internal buffer which gets actually streamed when the stream is fflush

7324849
cout	cin
in case of cout you may not notice the difference since it s somehow synchronized tied with cin but for an arbitrary stream such as file stream you ll notice a difference in a multithreaded program for example

7324881
post	put
one possible reason put forward in other post on this site is that there are dependent dlls that must be referenced and in fact after downloading dpendencywalker i found that my dll uses ipps-7.0.dll

7324912
autocomplete	multi-select
i am implementing a multi-select autocomplete textbox similar to one that stackoverflow uses for tags input using fcbkcomplete

7325021
versioning	upgrade
in that case you will not lose values and there will be no need to upgrade settings between versioning

7325023
for-loop	arrays
it works right now but i want to reuse these arrays in other functions so i tried to move the arrays declaration and the for-loop outside the function the function errors out when it reaches the first reference to aarr i as though the function does not recognized aarr

7325043
versioning	upgrade
user upgrade to a later versioning of your application application

7325114
post	get
however when i post the form back to the controller i only get the first selected value returned

7325129
google-chrome	safari
so i guess test it out in google-chrome or safari

7325151
int	chars
otherwise you would be requiring the global_id to have a chars to differentiate it from the int field and create unnecessary cycles to determine how to query the data based on the content of the data

7325153
g++	gcc
now regarding the difference between g++ and gcc continue with the next

7325191
std	ostream
the data class will want to have a member function that takes a std ostream by reference and saves the reservations to a text file easiest is one variable per line

7325191
std	ostream
then it calls the std ostream member function again to save the changes

7325208
for-loop	arrays
i can t from the example quite figure out what index and current are supposed to be but either way if the for-loop is ran before the dom is ready then you re arrays are obvisouly empty and the indexing will be messed up

7325214
width	height
onattach is event fired by every widget when it is been added to its parent once any widget as been added then you can get the offset height and width

7325214
width	height
extend panel class for top central and bottom then when all these panels has been added to parent try to get width and height

7325239
uicontrol	uibutton	uitapgesturerecognizer	uicontrol	uitapgesturerecognizer	uibutton
you can use uitapgesturerecognizer and pass the event through a delegate or use uicontrol which is a subclass of uiview but with uibutton tap events like touchupinside and so and then pass the event with a delegate to your view

7325257
getter	setter
i know spring roo uses this for getter and setter the idea being that having that boilerplate code out of the .java file makes it cleaner

7325299
move	drag
you have to use intermediate again in the drag functions start move up but with translate function which make everybody in the set move in the same way

7325301
stdout	stderr
as far as the standard streams go there are different ways to access them for example using stdout stderr like file handles to fwrite but there are only 2 of them at the end of the day

7325301
stdout	stderr
sometimes actual output will be done on stdout and progress or debugging related output on stderr

7325301
stdout	stderr
that way the user can pipe stdout into a file and leave stderr going to the console

7325381
put	get
it s a hack but you could take the tests out of the tests directory and put them somewhere else that they won t get run automatically inst tests then use your own parallelizable framework make run in parallel may be relevant to run the tests .

7325399
solaris	aix
it works on some platforms and on some it doesn t works on windows macos and aix doesn t work on linux hp_ux solaris freebsd...

7325422
folder	directory
i can extract it to the same directory as the tar file but not into another folder

7325474
children	parent
basically its a parent which contains a collection of children

7325474
children	parent
right this works fine for creating new parent without children

7325509
src	attr
so that now we can clone that image and give it a different src and place it underneath the first one .clone .insertafter this attr src hover

7325561
children	parent
assuming your parent are truly unique you know that another thread just did the parents...proceed with children

7325613
parent-child	one-to-many
from the question it seems that the parent-child relationship has been setup as one-to-one rather than one-to-many

7325614
getter	setter
i tried adding some debug statements and breakpoints into the property s getter and setter but they are never hit

7325630
mouseover	mouseenter
my problem is that when doing that the appropriate mouseover mouseenter callbacks don t get called when he mouse cursor is directly above them

7325671
mouseover	mouseenter
probably should file a bug report with the browser manufacturer and check other browsers to see if the behavior is replicated - which i m guessing it will because dont think any browser will fire a mouseover mouseenter event if the mouse was not physically moved

7325675
portrait	landscape
there should always be a case where you return yes for either portrait or landscape regardless of whether it s an ipad or you have uisplitviewcontroller class

7325687
portrait	landscape
also if you need to check if the device orientation is landscape or portrait its better to use

7325759
rss	feed
wordpress generates an rss feed of your blog

7325811
put	get
in addition put another applet on the server that obtains data from whatismyipaddress.com actually the estmated location of the pc and tries to get weather data from buienradar for that location the latter fails because of the applet security

7325817
clang	llvm
according to opencl wikipedia at 2011-09 the apple 22 nvidia 23 rapidmind 24 and gallium3d 25 implementations of opencl are all based on the llvm compiler technology and use the clang compiler as its frontend.

7325844
min	max
one of the functions that we have to have is to be able to take a statistician list count sum min max and mean and multiply it by a certain integer

7325848
oncreate	setcontentview
tactically you cannot create an activity via its constructor nor can you call setcontentview before oncreate is called in the activity

7325878
rss	feed
please add it to the list of objects to be notified. it s kind of like subscribing to an rss feed in a sense - everyone on the list gets the update when it happens

7325905
ubuntu	opensuse
the code below works with every server i ve tested so far redhat ubuntu opensuse

7325907

7325929
width	height
needs to be initialized if you want to get its width and height

7325946
getter	setter
don t provider a getter or setter method

7325969
robocopy	xcopy
you can set verify to on before running xcopy or robocopy to ensure the file integrity

7325972
google-chrome	firefox
works google-chrome 13 firefox 6 ie9 on win7

7325990
google-chrome	firefox
i was able to save the file from all the major browsers i checked on firefox and google-chrome but when i tried to save the file from internet explorer..

7325997
switching	screens
unfortunately this solution seems undesirable to me because of what happens visually when you switching between desktop modes screens goes black temporary repositioning of windows - it s basically not a clean transition

7326013
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome everything seems to be fine but in firefox it isn t working

7326051
width	height
i can get a specific style property value using document.getelementbyid myid .style.property where property is something like width height etc

7326098
hide	show
the next solution and the easiest is to create a report that has all the possible fields you could ever need and then use the reportobject model to dynamically hide the fields you don t need to show

7326115
mp3	wav
it is about 1 4 the size of the raw wav files so it isn t as good as mp3 but the performance is much better especially if you are using a lot of small audio tracks

7326117
hide	show
therefore the decision about bookmarkability is your responsibility the hash will invoke a specific route and what views that route hide or show is up to you

7326122
super	self
self is the class that the method is a part of super is the class that the self inherits from

7326123
printf	atoi
i m aware of stringstream printf atoi etc

7326235
put	get
i am able to put a die statement in index.php and get output to the screen--so even more troubling is that i get complete abject failure of the hmvc module in centos not just a notice

7326260
int	chars
since is now holding the int value of the key it can t be used as an array and silently fails echoing an empty chars

7326269
rss	feed
i have been looking this sample project and i wanted to populate these page views with data taken from an rss feed

7326291
serializable	deserialization
i think what needs to happen is that the name of the class datetime needs to get serializable out and checked on deserialization

7326321
hide	show
i have a view in which i have a code block where i am setting some variables and later on using those variables to show or hide some areas.

7326322
versioning	upgrade
i would try to upgrade your jdk versioning versioning 7 where the bug seems fixed

7326345
trac	mantis
other tools very interesting in my opinion is some kind of continuous integration like jenkins and some ticketing system like trac or mantis

7326402
inherited	subclassing
suppose you have a class named flynetarrayofdataset which inherited from is a subclassing of nsarray

7326417
width	height
providing the width and the height will not really help speed if not for layout purposes

7326438
put	get
if i were you i d first get the lexer much cleaner by removing all the literal spaces and put them on the hidden channel so you won t have to account for them inside other parser- and lexer rules

7326532
int	double
asymptotically this is probably the best way to go since it would be possible to support all the relevant features of json documents along with supporting some specialized methods for doing stuff like diffing int double and strings using relative encoding edit distance

7326553
filesystems	ntfs
i expect the san to be ntfs for now in case there are any special features of certain filesystems

7326573
for-loop	loops
i am wondering what the stats would look like if the class.forname misc.a is done only once outside the for-loop it doesn t really have to be done for every invocation of loops

7326579
width	height
if the bitmapdata objects are equivalent with the same width height

7326640
equals	gethashcode
it would satisfy all the constraints of gethashcode - namely that if you call it on two equals values it will return the same hash code

7326720
pdostatement	bindvalue
the pdostatement bindvalue method offers a way to specify the type of the variable bound

7326720
pdostatement	bindvalue
pdostatement bindvalue parameter value data_type pdo param_str

7326727
post	get
the image shows you have to use a post which you can t do with bare-bones file_get_contents - it defaults to using a get query

7326774
rss	feed
i understand there s an rss type feed i can poll and check manually but i m wondering if there s a smarter push mechanism available

7326803
getter	setter
beans have a standard nomenclature for getter and setter if you have a getter like getstringrep hibernate will try to find a property called stringrep - which you don t have -

7326847
folder	directory
- does the target directory exist and does the user account that is running the tier have write permission to that folder

7326851
gif	png
just use an image with transparent areas so it has to be a png or gif set the windowstyle to none set the window s background to transparent and set allowtransparency to true

7326866
versioning	upgrade
i m running the latest versioning of everything made sure to upgrade before posting

7326888
innodb	myisam
innodb myisam and disk space

7326903
folder	directory
but since the user folder will all differ its impossible to know what directory path to specify

7326910
udp	tcp
the specific communication protocol was always defined above some standard protocol udp tcp ip serial can and included a set of messages passing from one side to another

7326925
hide	show
i am looking at examples to hide show div tags using javascript

7326935
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseleave

7326961
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i am using uitabbarcontroller + uinavigationcontroller

7326975
mp3	ogg
for html5 audio you will need at least two copies of the sound file to hit every browser i would say one in mp3 format the other in ogg vorbis

7326987
versioning	upgrade
after this stopped working i tried installing the fb 4.5.1 upgrade patch in the hope that this would also update any local framework sdk files to the latest versioning

7327009
ubuntu	debian
you can install it on debian ubuntu with sudo apt-get install sloccount

7327017
centroid	threshold
you could find the connected components in the image and only include those components that have a total size above a certain threshold in your centroid calcuation

7327019
qfile	qdir	qfile	qbytearray	qbytearray	qdir
basically qdir homepath returns qfile decodename qbytearray getenv home almost unchecked

7327037
getter	setter
the key message is and no properties discovered to create beanserializer your classes resourceresultsetcol and resourceresultsetrow should have default public constructor and getter setter for all properties

7327049
mouseleave	mouseenter
the problem is a you need to use mouseenter mouseleave and b the tooltip div needs to live inside the element that has the mouseenter mouseleave listeners

7327074
folder	directory
there is a folder directory that i do not want to upload to the svn server every time i commit my project

7327125

what i find is that when the first dialog box is displayed for the second time the taskbar pop-up

7327278
portrait	landscape
i m trying to determine what orientation portrait or landscape the device is in

7327304
nswindow	nspanel
nspanel is a subclass of nswindow so anything you read about swapping views in windows should work identically on panels

7327305
pull	push
just about any time i start to pull something out into an include or if i find myself copying a piece of display logic from one page to another i start thinking about how i can push that code into a custom tag

7327338
ssl	https
using an ssl cert and forcing https will make it much harder nearly impossible to catch the traffic on the netwrok

7327340
mouseleave	mouseenter
rather than firing the mouseenter and mouseleave events immediately it waits for the mouse cursor to stay still for a bit you can adjust the sensitivity and timeout so if you hover on each item quickly only the last item that s hovered on will show the tooltip

7327363
interpolation	splines
recently i ve been looking to find the interpolation cubic splines of some data that i have

7327377
onresume	onpause
as gaks mentioned your issue may involve onresume onpause

7327410
filtering	grouping
we have a bunch of templates some of which are only visible when adding a new item to a c# web application project filtering using the web template grouping id

7327410
filtering	grouping
i took a look in the registry under hkcu software microsoft visualstudio 10.0exp_config projects fae04ec0-301f-11d3-bf4b-00c04f79efbc the unflavoured c# project type registration and i can see that it does not specify any filtering based on template grouping id so that s no help it seems

7327410
filtering	grouping
flavoured project subtypes such as workflow do seem to filtering the items they allow you to add using for example a template grouping id of workflowitemtemplategroupid but it seems like unflavoured projects don t filtering their items and therefore any items that have visiblebydefault set to false will always be invisible since they can t specify a template grouping id

7327475
uiview	subviews	uitapgesturerecognizer	uibutton
maybe a better approach is to put a uiview subclass instead of a uibutton as subviews on uiscrollview and add a uitapgesturerecognizer on them

7327488
arraylist	treeset
more over customcollectioneditor supports only the limited amount of target collections arraylist treeset linkedhashset see customcollectioneditor#createcollection

7327507
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this excludes the class h2.question from the cufon replace in firefox safari google-chrome and ie at least

7327509
multiplying	subtract
you can pretty much guess what my question is gonna be when i multiplying divide or subtract two floating point numbers i end up with an infinite decimal

7327510
mouseleave	mousedown
when in ie the mouseleave the square it s not releasing the mousedown event

7327525
google-chrome	safari
users report to be using either google-chrome or safari on windows so this may be an issue with webkit

7327536
hash	md5
so comparing the md5 hash doesn t really help

7327543
floating-point	integer
that problem occurs because in javascript every number is 64bit floating-point there no such thing as an integer

7327571
post	get
rest is straight http - get post url for every request

7327572
google-chrome	firefox
when i view your site in firefox it says its in helvetica neue but in google-chrome it says ag1 agb

7327587
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in ie and firefox but not in google-chrome

7327603
jtabbedpane	jtextfield
i tracked it down to a settext method call to a jtextfield element that happens to be on an unselected panel of a jtabbedpane

7327608
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
an option would be an unlocker project that enables pro features but i prefer an installation of either the free versioning with later upgrade or directly install the pro versioning

7327611
equals	gethashcode
to start with - you must also override equals as gethashcode is only meant to be a fast method to determine if two objects are not equals

7327611
equals	gethashcode
that s what equals is for - it is meant to be the final check that two objects are equals and it could be much slower to compute than gethashcode

7327611
equals	gethashcode
if gethashcode returned the length of the strings then you could very quickly determine that the third string is definitely not equals to the first two

7327647
width	height
you don t need to use initwithframe as the cell s frame is decided by the width of the uitableview it s a part of and the height you pass in heightforrowatindexpath in the uitableview s data source methods

7327668
getter	setter
you really need to learn how to propertize setter getter a variable rather than asking people to post code for you

7327728
udp	tcp
for now i m using c++ and tcp qt sockets or boost sockets but if needed i don t mind doing udp in c and wrapping it

7327752
udp	tcp
i m not aware of any way to reliably punch through firewalls for tcp but there s a similar method for udp traffic that s pretty well documented

7327772
put	get
the files all get compiled into .o files and put into a .a library archive

7327776
mp3	ogg
an audio file in various formats mp3 ogg etc stored in different servers with unique urls the audio files are stored in binary format

textview	imageview
in the examples they use textview or imageview but mine is a

7327792
width	height
depending on the offset of the horizontal and vertical scrollbars or the width and height of the display the drawer needs to react accordingly

7327802
gentoo	linux
there is a guide for gentoo linux

7327808
google-chrome	firefox
i can repro this in google-chrome firefox and ie

7327813
versioning	upgrade
or you could make apps b and c both have paid versioning that are the full app and free versioning that are the lite versioning and then use in-app purchases or your code idea to upgrade from the lite versioning to the pro versioning

7327836
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
when you add the uinavigationcontroller via the nib it actually creates an instance of a uinavigationcontroller inside the nib file with a default rootviewcontroller set of type uiviewcontroller and with a default title of rootviewcontroller

7327886
domxpath	domdocument
once you have the domdocument instance you can perform create a domxpath object and perform queries on it

7327927
actionlistener	documentlistener
a documentlistener is not an actionlistener so as i stated earlier the use of an action doesn t seem appropriate

7327940
udp	tcp
the reason why i used the udp protocol was because it is similar to tcp when using c#

7327964
post	get
i will post code when i get bak to my laptop but i was just curious if anyone had any ideas

7327971
entity-relationship	diagram
this is my entity-relationship diagram

7327983
rss	feed
facebook fan pages have rss feed that you can access programmatically and parse it on your ui view

7327986
jar	war
if you have a jar that depends on the httpservletrequest then you can look at loading it in a standard http servlet filter and deploying play via the play war command

7327988
firefox	safari
it works fine in firefox and safari

7328003
udp	tcp
simple traversal of udp through nats and tcp too stunt which extends stun to include tcp functionality is a lightweight protocol that allows applications running behind a nat to determine external ip and port-binding properties packet filtering rules and various timeouts associated with tcp connections through the nat

7328027
for-loop	arrays
iterate over each element in the arrays array.length adding to the variable you set before the for-loop

7328040
subtract	add
you have a total number of pixels to start with then add or subtract from the counter depending on the pixel s color

7328045
width	height
note rectangle is actually a struct i created with 4 size_t fields for the top-left x y coordinate and the width and height of the rectangle

7328049
int	chars
because 1 + 2 12 in javascript you need to convert your chars to int

7328064
hash	md5
md5 or other cryptographic hash seems like it would be too expensive and overkill for this purpose

7328070
nsstring	nsdata
asihttprequest can return it as nsdata or nsstring

7328162
folder	directory
install java 7 in another machine and then copy the jdk folder into my java application 3rdparty directory so my machine still use java 6

7328194
gridview	repeater
repeater has fewer templates then gridview

7328197
post	get
to use it first get access token then tried to get post friends and they are fine

7328216
udp	tcp
if you are interested in knowing why i want to make udp reliable and why i don t use tcp instead take a look at this question

7328216
hash	md5
the hash will be an efficient algorithm such as md5 to make sure data got received in the right order

7328275
gridview	repeater
gridview also has a much more rich object model while repeater is rather simplistic

7328342
post	get
now....when i try to send a post to their wall feed i get this message

7328450
integer	unsigned
in the case of an integer a negative signed value x will be converted to uint_max+1-x just as if it were stored as a signed value in two s complement and then interpreted as an unsigned value

7328450
integer	unsigned
however 0 - 5 in unsigned integer math leads to an underflow error which is defined to result in uint_max+1-5

7328450
integer	unsigned
however the reason you see -5 printed in your output is a combination of the fact that the unsigned integer uint_max-4 and -5 have the same exact binary representation just like -5 and 251 do with a single-byte datatype and the fact that when you used d as the formatting string that told printf to interpret the value of c as a signed integer instead of an unsigned integer

7328454
pull	push
when i move to one of those locations i d like to use the local server for push pull

7328475
width	height
you can have the image automatically resize width and height using the little arrows on the layout page -- that s a bit hard to describe

7328510
actionlistener	documentlistener
you can add actionlistener to the button just like you have added documentlistener to the document of the input

7328558
solaris	aix
on at least some versions of aix int 0 0 and solaris has optional compatibility with this aix feature.

7328600
post	get
i think the problem you are having is that you are doing a post instead of a get so changing it to the following may do the trick

7328672
getter	setter
also getter and setter methods for array fields can be confusing

7328689
tunnel	vpn
use a vpn or ssh tunnel to send your network traffic through the gfw is a common option to bypass censorship

7328689
tunnel	vpn
i myself setup my own homebrew ssh tunnel vpn on linode vps

7328766
for-loop	arrays
the vba macro you d need to take the data from the spreadsheet and output it as a js file with a valid javascript arrays declaration would be trivial no more than 20 or 30 lines of code basically a simple nested for-loop ought to do it with some initialisation to open a file for writing etc

7328791
google-chrome	firefox
the script is working n firefox google-chrome but not in ie6

7328804
put	get
i have managed to get that working but i know the javascript code i implemented is obtrusive and am wanting to put the same code or equivalent onto my external javascript file to make it not obtrusive

7328850
mouseover	mouseout
the main issue that i see is that mouseover and mouseout handlers need to be functions

7328887
post	get
basically once you get your html from the post you can invoke validation using jquery.validator.unobtrusive.parse

7328933
jsf	seam
seam 2.x was created to ease development against java ee 5 and to serve as an incubator for future standards mainly java ee 6 and jsf 2

java ee 6 took the ideas from seam 2 and others to specify cdi and improve apis like jsf

7328933
jsf	seam
seam 3 brings new ideas to java ee 6 and serves as an incubator for future standards mainly java ee 7 and jsf 2.x

7328933
jsf	seam
cdi is so much more mature than seam 2 bijection jsf 2 is so much easier than jsf 1.2 that any kind of application development will simply be much more fun with seam 3

mouse	keyboard
vnc works like a relay of your actual desktop rdp console session 0 or the head of the machine the disadvantage being one remote session at a time only or you all share the same desktop + keyboard + mouse

7329099
ubuntu	linux
my local machine is windows7 and i am using pscp.exe to connect the remote ubuntu linux machine

7329129
cells	tablecell
you can create a uiview with image as background with your tablecell s dimensions and add it to your cells then you can add rest of the controls and elements on your uiview

7329157
width	height
what i would like to do is have the image width take up the whole cell minus padding 280 and the height variable based on the image size

7329157
portrait	landscape
in reality some of the images are portrait and some are landscape orientation

7329165
put	get
also with ado.net you should put your connection and command into using-blocks to make sure they get properly disposed when no longer needed

7329214
udp	tcp
i referred to different threads about reliable udp vs tcp for large file transfers

7329214
udp	tcp
however before making the decision of choosing udp over tcp and add reliability mechanism to udp i want to benchmark performance of udp tcp

7329214
udp	tcp
but when i used iperf on two linux machines to send data using both udp and tcp i found that tcp performs better than udp for 10mb of data

7329214
udp	tcp
this was surprising for me as it is well known fact that udp performs better than tcp

7329214
udp	tcp
scenario where udp is better than tcp

7329263
union	distinct
you are forcing the results across the union to be distinct with the first column sb

7329281
post	get
django cms uses request.language_code to determine what language to use if you don t specifically asks for a certain language in your get or post parameters

7329322
int	chars
the underlying fact that you are missing is that chars s are promoted to int s as are short s to do arithmetic

7329322
int	chars
stick with chars s or int s

7329342
udp	tcp
use udp when tcp windowing and congestion control is not optimised such as high latency high bandwidth wan links see udt and wan accelerators for example

7329356
maven	m2e
ever since i ve installed the new m2e plugin for maven my groovy project no longer builds

7329399
g++	gcc
this should not be a compiler issue but still have tried it on gcc icpc icc g++

7329456
equals	compareto
but because the treemap and everything deriving from sortedset only uses compareto and ignores the equals method we find that searching for duplicates based on id doesn t work

7329494
int	chars
as chars codes are non-negative int this may explain why the behaviour you re seeing only works for such numbers and not floating point and negative numbers

7329513
qdialog	qwidget
a simple alternative is to use a plain qwidget as your container instead of a qdialog

7329533
wakelock	powermanager
i have looked at the powermanager class and more specifically the wakelock mechanism

7329565
config	ini
python s standard library configparser exposes the sections and options of an ini style config file using the mapping protocol and so you can retrieve your options directly from that as though it were a dictionary

7329574
daemons	launchd
add a launchd plist for your daemons application to the library launchdaemons directory

7329585
hide	show
users are able to click register which hide the login div and show the register div

7329604

to get the coordinates of the mouse on a picturebox you should not handle the onclick event but the onmousedown for example in this way

7329611
fast-forward	merge
if no that a fast-forward merge will be done and that s what you need

7329645
qsort	bsearch

7329656
peer	p2p
typically a super peer is an edge peer with extra functionalities to support the structure of the p2p network

7329656
peer	p2p
there is no such things as a central server in a p2p network but rather a set of super peer

7329689
serializable	deserialization
which one serializable deserialization solution is the best for distant serializable deserialization on server

7329737
qsort	bsearch
so i wouldn t bother with hashes at all but just resort to sorting your string table on startup using qsort and later using a binary search using bsearch to look up entries

7329860
put	get
in the absence of that all i can think of is to put the info in hidden fields on the page and have jquery get its data from these fields

7329876
oncreate	ondestroy
if you need to have activity and service running simultaneously then start you watcher service in oncreate and stop it in ondestroy

7329904
set	bag
this solution is ok but when we add one more fetch for query then collection in object also be multiplied that is why i modified collection type from ilist bag to iset set

7329907
interpreted-language	compiled-language
even in c most statements evaluate as an expression - however a comparison between a compiled-language c and an interpreted-language coffeescript is rather useless

7329914
post	get
you d have to post that to get more specific advice

7329925
kermit	xmodem	kermit	zmodem	xmodem	zmodem
there are still plenty of open source implementations of things like xmodem zmodem kermit ymodem and many others still floating around since most of these can and did work with byte streams then it shouldn t be too difficult to make them work with a byte stream over udp instead of a byte stream over a serial port

7329939
hash	salt
if i had the need to share the users credentials i would probably share the username and the hash + salt password so you would be safe and only share the representation of a password not it s contents

7329953
post	get
also i recomand not to use the post method but the get method as you are not calling a ressource via get

7329979
width	height
now the layout appears fine if the content inside the td is less...but if there is more content ie kind of expands the cell width height and displays the content fine

7329979
width	height
but in firefox the width height for the content div remains fixed and does not expand as per the content which makes the layout appear a bit broken

7329986
width	height
i need to use same widgets buttons editext textviews with same properties like width height textcolor size etc in multiple screens xmls

7329986
width	height
if i define layout width height also in styles and simply giving style style mybuttonstyle for button in xml is working fine even though i did n t mention width height in xml might be inheriting from style

7329986
width	height
if i give width height in xml without style prop and simply giving my custom theme to activity is bringing all styles i specified in theme

7329986
width	height
but i did n t mention width height in xml it is raising an exception saying that u have specify layout width height which i already specified in style itself

7329987
listview	gridview
i need to implement gridview inline edit update and delete operations through listview in wpf from db similar to normal windows datagridview

perforce	svn
i have experience with centrally located source-control systems like perforce and svn

7330549
stdout	stderr
in case of big output use file handles for stdout and stderr

7330604
post	get
otherwise my best suggestion for a limited fetch store would be to adjust your back-end code to support filtering options such that when the store makes a post or get you parse out an array of fields that you want to search against and the result set is returned accordingly

7330628
put	get
as a fudge i have put an animation which does nothing on the containers which do not get collapsed and now it works.

the image formats can be png jpg gif

7330760

any help especially some code pascal delphi would be very much appreciated

7330797
portrait	landscape
working with the paperclip gem and i want to change the dimensions for each style applied to an uploaded image differently depending on whether the image is in landscape or portrait orientation

7330816
submit	submission
you can use the submit event to cancel the form submission do your analytics ajax stuff and then submit the form programmatically using the submit method on the form element

7330817
keydown	keyup
the keypress event is for detecting typed characters while keyup and keydown are for detcting physical keys in those events keycode works in every major browser

7330825
google-chrome	firefox
i may be wrong but it seems to me that in firefox and all the browsers that work the height always returns 200 but in google-chrome it returns 200 if the content is small so fadeout never gets called on content that is not collapsable..

7330826
pull	push
propagation between repo pull push of public branches ie branches made to be replicated amongst repo

7330838
gif	png
since the images might be png jpg or gif the format problem shouldn t apply

7330856

you can try to disable the stofdoctrineextensions in your app config config.yml before generate your entities getter setter like this

7330857
versioning	upgrade
that caused a lot headache to finally resolve versioning conflicts and upgrade few gems

7330894

7331076
getter	setter
your syntax seems to be right and in line with douglas initial post about getter setter validation

7331142
hide	show
if the user is not logged in i d like to hide the logout link and show a login link instead

7331183

7331217
children	parent
your relation cannot be 1 - 0..1 but one to many where one parent can have many children

7331227
button	checkbox
all inputs text button submit should be present except for checkbox that are off and disabled fields

7331270
width	height
the current setup is wrong because the scrollviewer does not limit the width and height of its child unlimited moreover the grid always fills all the available horizontal and vertical space available on its parent container and that is why you see this weird behavior

7331270
width	height
or set a fixed height and width for your grid

7331359
pop-up	dialog
so if yourclass is a listactivity the inside you can put a pop-up dialog for example with another list with customer details and then you can add a close button

7331380
put	get
here the ajax code that you can call to the server side php file and get the out put and do what you want

7331393
rss	feed
a button suscribe on the aspx would add the current user to this list which would be taken as a source for the rss feed mailing list

7331393
rss	feed
another possibity would be to redirect the user to the rss suscribing page of sharepoint view rss feed or the mailing list alert me but maybe would it be less ergonomic.

7331397
hide	show
so i would have some sort of document.onready handler which will hide your images and insert the loading... text then your load event handler will show your images and remove the loading text

this should allow you to define the type of the argument to int string or boolean

7332226
jlabel	jtextpane	jlabel	jeditorpane	jtextpane	jeditorpane
1 if you want to multiline jcomponents without using jlabel then you have to look for textcomponent as are jtextarea jtextpane jeditorpane if should t be editable then mytextcomponent#seteditable false

here is an example take a look at the min and max of the density function and real min max of the data

7332370
git-rebase	amend
the most flexible way to do this is to do an interactive git-rebase to squash together or amend your commits

7332444
google-chrome	firefox
when i posted this on facebook someone said that since firefox is open source project developers optimized math.min but google-chrome didn t since google-chrome is just a modification of chromium but beside that above statement is not quite right that makes no sense because that doesn t explain the reason why google-chrome s and firefox s math.min a b performs in similar speed and google-chrome s math.min a b and firefox s performs in same speed because if firefox is faster than google-chrome then google-chrome s math.min a b should be much slower than firefox s

7332444
google-chrome	firefox
since the speed of math.min a b on firefox â the speed of on google-chrome and speed of on firefox â the speed of math.min a b on google-chrome firefox is slow or firefox is fast can t be a reason

7332450
folder	directory
you need to give permission to write the cache folder in your lib for me sites all modules print lib cache directory

7332473
getter	setter
in php if at all you are uncomfortable with the magic getter and setter you can write them in your class as you have done in strongly typed language and you can use it as you have used it there

7332473
getter	setter
i think we can automatically generate getter and setter functions in some framework like symfony

7332473
getter	setter
you can write the appropriate implementation of magic getter and setter if you need more type enforcement or control over the properties

7332495
put	get
i want to count similar values and get a out put like

7333051
getter	setter
i see php magic getter and setter as one of its sickness

7333051
getter	setter
in most languages getter and setter are actually a functions where you can add some small logic it is not so wisely done in php

7333085
hide	show
look at that response and show hide the div based on the respons and show hide another div embedding another video from local sources

7333098

jboss	glassfish
i have seen this occur on application servers like jboss and glassfish that by default come prepackaged with their own jsf implementation

likewise the jboss glassfish classloaders gave preference to the bundled jsf implementation libraries versus any jsf implementations that appear in web-inf lib

for-loop	loops
you can put all that in a for-loop and make a new directory each iteration of loops

7333518

if you want to use your variable a in your derived classes you should make it protected because you cannot use it by public inheritance if it is private

7333980
width	height

7334322
implements	extends
i m not sure this is what you re trying to achieve as you set the ontouchlistener for the button - but if what you want to achieve is a swipeable activity e.g swipe the screen and the content of the screen changes you could try letting your activity extends the class posted below and then implements the next and previous methods with what ever actions you want

innodb	myisam
as you are no doubt aware from your searches innodb is primarily better than myisam for high volume inserts not counting non-comparable features like foreign keys or full text searches which are exclusive to innodb and myisam respectively while myisam is primarily useful for tables which are read more often than they are written to

7335774
innodb	myisam
to a lesser extent this so question as well myisam vs innodb

7335774
innodb	myisam
there is also a webinar about migrating from myisam to innodb although i have not watched it

7335888

you need to override equals and gethashcode for barobject because the is reference equality unless you have provided overrides of equals and gethashcode this is what uses

7336319
equals	gethashcode
remember to overwrite gethashcode when you implement equals otherwise it will produce strange results if you put your objects for example into a dictionary or hashtable as key

7336333
equals	gethashcode
for distinct and many other linq features to work the class being compared barobject in your example must implement implement equals and gethashcode or alternatively provide a separate as an argument to distinct

7336333
equals	gethashcode
so you should make all your classes you intend to compare in linq implement equals and gethashcode for completeness or create a separate implementation

7337128
int	chars
but chars in most six-bit encodings are interchangeable with ascii-7 chars through int arithmetic

7337128
decoder	encoder
on the other hand if you are operating against 6-bit encoded characters that each require 8-bit wide characters then the said arithmetic operation becomes easy otherwise you will need to track whether the encoder decoder is in an invalid state

7337133
websphere	ibm
run first steps console change directory to profile_root firststeps wsrr for example opt ibm websphere serviceregistry profiles wsrrsrv01 firststeps wsrr and . launchpad.sh

7337155
google-chrome	firefox
and yes i know xbaps are not meant to run on google-chrome but if you copy a bunch of firefox dlls to the google-chrome application directory it runs just fine steps here if anyone wants

7337165
post	get
oh and note that pages that make things happen so-called non-idempotent actions - increase vote count shouldn t be reachable via get as get is reserved for showing things without changing them - idempotent actions you may want to make a form which uses post instead

it is supposed to includ 4 pieces of information a string value for the items number a string value which describes the product an int value for the quantity of items sold and a double value for the items price

7337197
width	height
personally i would make a div and give it a set width and height and place that image inside it then the container div wont be able to adjust size due to the styled height and width.

7337250

realistically you need them to authorise your app before you can get their uid and by that time you could just use that same authorisation to access their public post without needing any hacky workarounds

7337345
put	get
i know if i have a table with 10 varchar 1000 columns and i actually put 1000 characters in each of those columns and try to insert that row i ll get an error due to sql server s row limitation of 8k

7337367
hide	show
and specially seeing that you need to conditionally hide show this toolbar might be easier to add it outside the tableview just above it i guess

7337367
hide	show
seeing as you need to hide show this toolbar at will

7337367
uiview	subviews
guess you can simply use a uiview for it and add the uibuttons on top as subviews

hide	show
-- declare it as a property in the .h file so that it can be freely accessed in the .m file whenever you need to hide show it

7337397

follow these steps to get an rss feed from mybb

7337397
rss	feed
then it s a matter of parsing your rss feed using php

the service requires you to do a post and you re doing a get curl s default for http urls instead

7337582

something i don t understand happens when the border is rendered in ie firefox and google-chrome

7338022
rss	feed
i am struggling with a warning in my android project when i use jsf-impl.jar for parsing rss feed

7338076
for-loop	loops
a for-loop like the two used here are primarily used when you want to loops through a proceedure a known number of times as in you have an exact number of times you wish to go through loops

7338083
portrait	landscape
my best suggestion create a custom landscape layout with a different fixed height than portrait

7338083
preferenceactivity	listpreference
listpreference should work in a preferenceactivity

7338094
post	get
is it possible to get post from all categories but exlude only one latest post from specific categories

7338094
post	get
something like get post from all categories but exclude latest post from category 2 4 and 5

7338124
spaces	delimiter
if you re using spaces as a delimiter anytime it s encountered getline will return with whatever there was upto the delimiter

7338134

if this does not fix it please post the exact line where you get the crash

7338149
netcdf	proj
i m currently also working on a proj using netcdf

however when i visited today i see the tutorial upgrade to higher versioning since 2.2

7338201
hide	show
i can follow this script to show or hide hidden files on a mac it works

7338217
ienumerable	iqueryable
most of these methods operate on sequences where a sequence is an object whose type implements the ienumerable interface or the iqueryable interface

7338217
sorting	filtering
the standard query operators provide query capabilities including filtering projection aggregation sorting and more

7338240
ienumerable	iqueryable
as i understand it ienumerable and iqueryable are deferred execution

7338291
ienumerable	iqueryable
in the case of ienumerable and iqueryable what s deferred is the enumeration

7338293
postgresql	mysql
this worked for me in postgresql though i may have gotten the quoting wrong for mysql

7338321
put	get
lastly i don t know much about this spritely but i would think you d want to put this through a loop to get the animation so putting it all together i d do

7338351
textview	imageview
each page has a framelayout with multiple layers of animated imageview textview buttons.

7338373
google-chrome	safari
the result in google-chrome and safari will be

7338390
google-chrome	firefox	fiddler	charles
there are many many tools you can use for this charles or fiddler are handy most dedicated screen-scraper tools have a basic proxy built-in the firebug extension for firefox and google-chrome have similar tools for viewing ajax requests...you get the idea

7338430
homography	keypoint
find homography matrix using matched keypoint

7338457
onresume	onpause
activity class s onpause and onresume are only called on the current top activity

7338483
iprincipal	iidentity
when a user accesses your silverlight-based application first the wif-based web application so the server side which hosts the silverlight component s receives the claims from ad fs and wif makes them available by returning an iclaimsidentity or iclaimsprincipal whenever the current iidentity or iprincipal is requested

7338483
iprincipal	iidentity
see for example wif s integration with iidentity and iprincipal

7338618
hash	md5	crypt	hash	crypt	md5
a bunch of the passwords are stored as the md5 hash output from php s crypt function see the third example there

7338618
crypt	md5
the crypt md5 output seems to use a different alphabet than django s md5 support which appears to be using a hexdigest

7338618
hash	md5
there s a similar and unanswered question with an interesting potential solution to convert the php hash to a base-16 encoding but based on some initial poking it doesn t seem to produce a usable md5 hexdigest

7338618
crypt	md5
crypt is operating in md5 mode but it s some wacky danish translation of the md5 algorithm update it s md5-crypt

7338618
hash	salt
in python i need to be able to reproduce that hash or some regular derivation of it given the original password and salt

7338640
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome 13.0.782.220 m and safari 5.0.5 it seems to be rendered as text html ignoring the encoding specification in the open call

7338640
opera	firefox
in firefox 3.6 opera 11.51 and internet explorer 8 this renders correctly

7338640
google-chrome	safari
i ve searched stackoverflow with google-chrome +text plain safari +text plain and webkit +text plain and saw no hits

7338660
put	get
put another way how do i get those bigpipe scripts to execute and fill in the content when i begin with either attempt 1 or 2

7338688
median	max	min	median	min	max
the assignment is to create a program that will read from standard input a file containing a list of integers into an array and then finding the mean max min median and standard deviation of those integers

7338741
winpcap	libpcap
winpcap for windows or libpcap for linux will allow you to manipulate the entire packet data including the ethernet header and indeed send any other l2 protocol you wish

7338743
postgresql	mysql
there is an application that you can use to import sql server oracle postgresql mysql etc

7338773
min	max
edit1 - my min cic.statusdatetime as beginning max cic.enddatetime as ending seem to not be helping

7338773
min	max
the min and max are not giving me the actual min and max for the whole day

7338775
screens	tablet
it all fits nicely on a 1280x800 tablet screens

7338782
post	get
i m new to struts2 coming from a php background where i d often have the same file handling get and post requests and processing a form if the request is a post request

7338782
post	get
which works fine but it bothers me that the url that handles post is different since now if the user reloads the page they get an error rather than simply seeing the contents of the get page

7338784
google-chrome	firefox
according to quirksmode defining multiple backgrounds works in at least ie9 google-chrome and firefox 3.6

7338784
google-chrome	firefox
firefox 6 and google-chrome 13 however display only the fallback gradient-only background

7338837
kde	gnome
as mru correctly pointed out there is no standardized way under linux to determine the proxy so i guess the best solution is to check if the user is using linux and in that case try to get the proxy settings from http_proxy environment variable or from gconf for gnome or from kioslaverc kde

7338868
m2e	groovy-eclipse
if that is the case then you must install the newer version of the groovy-eclipse configurator for m2e

7338907
pop-up	dialog
my save dialog pop-up was disappearing immediately and it took me forever to realize what was going on

7338960
getter	setter
i wrote a way a while back that also allowed getter setter but it was such a non-portable garrish hack that you really should not do this

7338976
post	get
i was thinking about something with a post get request and the php script

7338983
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
iâ m using google-chrome but also happens in safari firefox

7339005
post	get
from android do http get post requests to reach the php script

7339034
maven	pom.xml
i have used launch4j to wrap an executable jar into an exe in my pom.xml maven project file file during compile build time

7339048
post	get
i get also two messages but only one piece of timing data appended to post content - identical to the one delivered by the first message

7339058
google-chrome	safari
in this case i m guessing that safari may handle your attempt to crowbar the layout into the page differently from google-chrome -- it s possible for example that it simply ignores the in the section because it s in a second and it s already seen one of those

7339072
public	protected
the concept of private protected public is somewhat alien to objective c even though access control is supported for member variables

7339076
post	get
i got this code which address my get the 1st image of the post then display it issue

7339076
post	get
what i want to to do is simply get the image from my published post resize it 50x50 and 250x250 then display it

7339099
post	get
php will interpret post get variables ending with as arrays

7339100
width	height
i have a box of fixed width and height i have a link in it i want to display the link in the center of box vertically

7339151
children	parent
i ve searched google and the jquery site for information on parent and children but i m having trouble putting into words what i want to accomplish

7339178
folder	directory
of course the path to your downloaded .msi file should point to a temporary directory a good choice would be the windows temporary folder itself but the idea is to get to call the static method start of the process class

7339221
pull	push
fortunately unfortunately it s such an easy workflow that i sometimes go through many edit commit push pull browser-refresh cycles while coding

7339265
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
if you create a new winform project with sharpdevelop 4 then drag an openfiledialog or savefiledialog to the form then show the dialog .showdialog norton internet security 2011 blocks the application and delete it the binary

7339273
int	double
each attribute has a unique name and should have a specific type that corresponds to a certain java type such as int string short double .

7339277
iframe	prettyphoto
yes i know you can load pages within an iframe element using prettyphoto jquery plugin prettyphoto

7339300
put	get
also in this case since your operation is at the end you could just put it in its own continuation and get the behavior you want

7339316
getter	setter
however the performselector withobject call is incorrect here because while the name of the getter is mysubview the setter would then be setmysubview

7339316
getter	setter
obviously i could manipulate the string to achieve this task but i d hope there is a cleaner and more stable way to access the getter and setter for the same ivar

7339318
getter	setter
i want eclipse to generate the getter and setter codes as

7339324
versioning	upgrade
failing that you could upgrade to a newer versioning of php

7339325
ironruby	ironpython
ironruby seems a little behind ironpython for now just imo so i think i m going to stick with testing my mvvm framework for wpf in ironpython for now

7339380
fileoutputstream	filewriter
you can use filewriter instead but i prefer to wrap a fileoutputstream in an outputstreamwriter as that way i can control the encoding

7339405
junit	testng
learning to use junit or testng will pay off in the long run but even a few ad-hoc print statements might help you for now

7339408
mp3	wav
now i want to decode the mp3 back into wav

7339409
post	put
however i am trying to put a linebreak or some whitespace in between each post

7339424
swt	windowbuilder	swt	swing	swing	windowbuilder
windowbuilder allows you to build swing swt and gwt user interfaces and windowtester allows you to test the user interfaces that you constructed

7339456
children	parent
use jquery s .children selector method where you give jquery a selector to operate on the children of the given parent element as such

7339465
put	get
if you wish to automate code reading but not morphing you can use linecache as shown in here and just instead of printing put it into a list and get whatever value you want

7339484
salt	md5
django s salt md5 algorithm uses a very simple algorithm md5 salt + password which is then encoded to hexidecimal

7339484
hash	md5	crypt	hash	crypt	md5
on the other hand the hash output by php s crypt which begin with are not simple md5 hash

7339484
hash	md5
this is much more complex and secure than a simple md5 hash

7339484
crypt	hash
while django does have code which called python s stdlib crypt function the way django mangles the hash means there s no easy way to get a hash beginning with all the way through django and into crypt

7339586
versioning	upgrade
while we look at restructuring the library to seperate the parts we can make common between them we are thinking about how we might reduce space on the disk while supporting versioning upgrade

7339586
google-chrome	firefox
my first thought was we allowadvertise and when firefox tries to load the dll as directed by google-chrome it will cause the install it doesn t seem to work

7339594
post	get
in web i use the livehttpheader or firebug to see where is the page sending get post data too and which parameters are being sent

7339651
post	get
but it bothers me that the url that handles post is different since now if the user reloads the page they get an error rather than simply seeing the contents of the get page

7339651
post	get
look at the redirect after post or post redirect get pattern

7339681
yacc	bison
your flex lex and bison yacc files will tell me more about this problem

7339721
opera	google-chrome
works on google-chrome and opera but neither dolphin or the stock browser work

7339721
opera	google-chrome
works like a charm on google-chrome and opera but not on either of the mobile browsers i need it to work on

7339733
min	max
format resolution min year max year bytes date

7339744
waitpid	fork
edit as stated in the comments you d rather make use of fork and exec then use waitpid 2 to correctly update status

7339747
spaces	delimiter
access can import a text file which uses spaces instead of commas as the delimiter

7339747
spaces	delimiter
click next and on the next wizard page select the radio button next to spaces under the choose the delimiter that separates your fields heading

7339834
button	checkbox
based on what you stated it s not the checkbox which will perform the postback but some other button so you can check your whole selection at once

7339856
factors	matrix
returns a matrix of integers indicating their row number in a matrix-like object or a factors indicating the row labels

7339873
mousemove	mouseleave
i created a mousemove and mouseleave handler for my dynamic submenu items

7339911
post	get
you can get more info from the blog post

7339935
range	minimum
put minimum and maximum attributes on a single upgradeversion element to specify a range

7339945
folder	dir
i am thinking perhaps the tc nunit runner is using some other dir as the main app execution folder and thus preventing from files that are actually residing next to the test dll to not load properly but cannot prove this claim yet.

7339951
min	max
once you have the binary non-black part of the image so just the object and not the background you just want to find the min max corners of each voxel

7340003
margin	height
all i am doing on the page is animating the height of the ad container and animating the top margin of the content div

7340053
versioning	upgrade
then i upgrade the hosted versioning to a bundle versioning 2.0 and perform the same download again the app upgrade and launches without problems

7340067
google-chrome	firefox
tag is already supported by at least current versions of firefox and google-chrome

7340112
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
an idea to help you track the problem as you don t share the link you can easily just share the first page is to use safari google-chrome or even firefox and make them act as an iphone so you can use their inspector firebug to track the problem

7340140
gridview	linqdatasource
i have a page with linqdatasource and a gridview

7340152
int	chars
the c++ is interpreted as an int8 result and in c# it s simply interpreted as a positive int int is 32 bit an truncating to 16 by casting to chars doesn t affect the sign in this case

7340156
distance	polygons
do a comparison on those distance and then based on those comparisons narrow it down to the minimally far away line segment of the polygons

7340173
hash	md5
for the sake of saving 12 bytes per item that you are generating a hash for i would still suggest something like md5 which is know to work is probably better than rolling your own.

7340186
width	margin
it s expected behavior - you re using fixed-size margins and paddings which means that at a certain point the total 50px of padding and margin from your two columns will be greater than the 5 of width that your columns don t take up and will bump into each other

7340193
post	get
another note it may also be a good idea to use the method post instead of get as it s more secure however you may have reasons to be using get but it s just a heads up

7340213
superclass	subclassing
all of this can be summarized by saying that a subclassing has to behave as if it was a superclass

7340246
addclass	removeclass
when using removeclass and addclass do not include the dot

7340272
addclass	removeclass
your class name is heart so your selectors are correct but when you use the addclass removeclass and toggleclass methods use the actual class name addclass heart

7340283
button	checkbox
for radio button we use an array filter so if you really want checkbox and you really want they to all be the same name then try

7340325
google-chrome	firefox
only tested in the latest firefox and google-chrome

7340347
getter	setter
then getter and setter make no sense and moreover i write some code in setter method

7340347
getter	setter
i read in a book enterprise flex with blazeds by brain telintelo chapter 15 that out of box blazeds only serializes fileds that have matching getter and setter

7340347
getter	setter
can some body please explain how normal serializtion not amf serializtion takes place and keeps track of private transient variables even though they have public getter and setter

7340397
dbcontext	objectcontext
i can see the objectcontext in the debugger but can t find the dbcontext

7340523
put	get	post	get	post	put
for example exposing an api which could be essentially accessed in the same manner you describe but respond to more http verbs other than get post head put delete

7340524
ant	maven
it looks like you re making use of maven ant tasks

7340540
hide	show
part of the code in hopes of getting the demo page s scrollbar to show up vertical but all it did was hide the horizontal scrollbar that was already there and now i just have a blank page

7340568
opera	firefox
however in ie and newer versions of firefox and opera you can do so by calling the element s native dom method .click directly like this

7340578
put	get
i am using an asihttprequest method to connect to my php script that calls requests data from the database from there i initiate the nsxmlparser delegates everything seems to work fine i can even nslog the results as they get parsed however it seems that when i try to put these results into a nsmutablearray the results dont seem to want to go into it

7340615
hash	md5
as soon as i changed it to md5 hash it worked

7340655
hide	show
i need to hide a div and only show it when a file is selected

7340784
centos	linux
i use linux centos with openssl-devel.i386 0.9.8e-12.el5_5.7

7340790
opera	firefox
edit in ie and newer versions of firefox and opera you can use the native dom method .click to simulate an actual click on the link

7340798
hide	show
i have a ssrs 2008 report in which i have created 5 parameter so that whenever i preview the report it show 5 drop down to select values based on which report is generated.now i want that when i preview the report there should be a check box like something so that i am able to show or hide the drop down list

7340800
direct3d	direct2d
i believe it would also be possible to do this with just direct3d no use of direct2d and just have a simple vertex for each pixel and draw it in orthogonal view

7340815
width	height
launching various sample apps from xna 4.0 and vs express 2010 for windows phone they tend to be 854 for the default width and 480 for the default height

7340818
chunked	transfer-encoding
transfer-encoding chunked set-cookie

7340822
innodb	myisam
having both full text searches and foreign key contraints which are good for joins is a hassle for mysql as they are only supported by myisam and innodb engines respectively

7340836
maven	pom.xml
if you are a maven purist and i ll risk a claim you might be you could add the ep-commons to a section of the root pom.xml but that will only save you one line in each pom.xml for version

7340860
dbcontext	objectcontext
so you could try this to create a dbcontext wrapping the objectcontext which you retrieved from your proxy create an appropriate constructor for your derived context.

7340863
superclass	subclassing
an alternative solution is to store a boolean on your superclass which indicates whether the object requires iap and then always set this to yes for one subclassing and no for all others

7340881
put	get
so if you put a 4 entry input you ll get a 13 entry output

7340899
fadein	fadeout	fadein	hide	hide	show	hide	fadeout
you should use fadein docs and fadeout docs instead because those will also hide show the element as well

7340904
post	get
this can be done by either making the ajax call through an ajax object which then references other objects or you can take an easy approach and simply set an extra post or get field which indicates an ajax call

7340907
put	get
there s no cost to get started or to put your apps on your own device other than actually having an android device

7340942
portrait	landscape
the app supports only portrait mode thus in default landscape mode of the emulator it s rotated by 90â as on android 2.2

7341034
post	put
so my second approach was to put the html into a hidden form set the form s target to the new window and post the form

7341048
multiplying	subtract
then you can divide the rest of the days remaining by 7 multiplying that number by 2 and subtract to the days

7341052
put	get
where i put the comment i need to get another attribute c.attribute objective

7341072
avr	microcontroller
currently commands are sent over a serial interface to an avr microcontroller

7341101
move	drag
i ve managed the drag and drop functionality but need to persist the text in the text boxes once the program is shut down so that when reopened the last location of all move text is still present

7341111
post	get
all get and post data must be treated as malicious

7341113
vim	notepad++
here is one example of exactly this but of course it doesn t cover several of the programs that i use extensively myself which include vim sed notepad++ eclipse and believe it or not ms word at least version 2010 i suspect 2007 also has this they call it wildcards has a simple regex implementation too

7341116
srp	principles
stuffing all the actions in a single controller is a bad practice imho and violates a couple of principles like restful routing and srp

7341149
jquery	simplemodal
this can be achieved quite easily with jquery and simplemodal

7341170
ssl	https
when you connect to an https server you can trust that the server is the owner of that certificate because the server must be holding the private key and hopefully nobody else has it because otherwise the ssl connection is not possible

7341174
udp	rtp
you could make your software send midi events using midi rtp or midi udp so you don t care about the driver os

7341184
post	get
you can get a list of feed post and then you could issue an http delete to the item you want to delete like

7341191
width	height
the div#main is set to height and width similar to div#u-button and set overflow to hidden

7341200
google-chrome	firefox
i went ahead and continued developing my script in google-chrome seems it seemed i got further than in firefox

7341200
put	get
it was easier just to re-use the getscript function to also get jqueryui and put the alert in a function called from the callback

7341226
wordpress	joomla
the web is filled with wordpress tutorials but finding a good article for joomla is extremely hard

7341239
min	max
if you want to replace more than one then you would have to add the g flag and change the regex slightly for min match instead of max match to this

7341240
nvda	narrator
also keep in mind that narrator is a basic screenreader most users will actually be using something like jaws which costs 800 or so or nvda free

7341276
int	double
am thinking a double can be converted to two int and submitted together

7341286
post	get
any external received from get post file etc

7341318
width	height
i am trying to accurately capture the window height and width of a mobile browser when the orientation changes but in android i m testing - when the orientation listener fires and the function is called to capture the window height and width the new size has not yet accurately been reflected so i end up having to call an arbitrary delay to get things to register their proper size

7341341
int	double
you might as well just convert your double to an int in actionscript

7341341
int	double
you won t lose any accuracy because in actionscript double and int have the same bit depth

7341343
carrierwave	fog
i m using carrierwave with fog to handle thumbnail uploads for an app hosted on heroku and the image urls don t seem to be generating properly

7341364
width	height
their layout height is set to wrap_content and layout width ist match_parent

7341372
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome when my form is displayed it correctly shows the watermark everytime

7341375
mouseover	mousemove
you should get click mousemove mouseover etc

7341380
spaces	linefeed
the first renders converts the characters from ascii to ebcdic so you can see what they are the second goes through and pads out lines so that linefeed markers are replaced with enough spaces to reach the record length

7341404
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have a cfform with two submit buttons the logic in my action page works perfectly fine with safari google-chrome firefox and ie9

7341442
min	max
using mike s max min trick we can make previous next jumps for all sorts of things

7341442
min	max
the trick is we can previous next # of whatever s with max min and a jump function

7341446
administration	activation
with the components services administration tool formerly known as dcom config you can change the activation configuration to use the currently logged on user and the dllhost.exe instance will run in the active window station

7341464
fadein	fadeout
imo you actually should use fadein or fadeout for ultimate smootheness imo

7341464
hide	show
but you can set the time on the show hide if that is what you really prefer

7341469
factors	mean
the advantage of this approach is that by tweaking the underlying distribution and its parameters mean and variance in the case of a normal distribution you can fine-tune to what extent the agility measure factors in

7341477
photoshop	fireworks

equals	gethashcode
if you haven t go ahead and override equals for each of your types as well they can inherit your implementation of gethashcode if you like or have new ones and there you can make sure that the type of the compare-to object are the same before declaring them equals

7349645
equals	gethashcode
and make sure equals and gethashcode are always implemented so that

7349645
equals	gethashcode
objects that are equals must have same gethashcode results

7349645
equals	gethashcode
objects with different gethashcode must not be equals

7349663
equals	gethashcode
this means that whever you implement gethashcode you should also implement equals and check that the types match

7349663
equals	gethashcode
similarly whenever you implement equals you should also implement gethashcode

client-side	server-side
i don t have much experience with javascript but i ve managed to validate my form with both client-side and server-side validation except for the recaptcha field

7354920
client-side	server-side
the problem is that if i fill in the code correctly and press submit the client-side verification returns succes but the server-side validation always returns wrong

7354920
client-side	server-side
i ve discovered the fact that the same challenge field code is used for both client-side verification as the server-side verification

pop-up	dialog
i noticed that even if i set the orientation of the activity to portrait mode when the app store dialog pop-up shows up the activity can still change orientations

7355036
rspec	minitest
i think the better way is to become familiar with rails and ruby and only then dive into tdd bdd with test unit or minitest or rspec cucumber or a lot of other testing techniques

7355040
addition	modulo
if we examine the situation where n is 2 we can see that using xor does exactly this bitwise addition modulo 2

7355040
addition	modulo
we re just generalizing things to do bitwise addition modulo n for other values of n

7355090
xsl-fo	xslt
i prefer outputting my data into xml using castor xstream or jaxb then transforming it using a xslt stylesheet into xsl-fo and render that with apache fop into pdf

7355163
int	double
this will work whether mylist is a collection of int s double s or decimal s

7355184

7355231
children	parent
if you look at linearlayout and abslistview the parent of gridview source you ll see they convert their children layout params to linearslayout.layoutparams and abslistview.layoutparams respectively

7355231
children	parent
but if you set layout params manually afterwards you will get classcastexception somewhere in the parent container code since it expects its children layout params to be of some specific type

7355245
pop-up	dialog
i want to use the dialog modal window pop-up with a form in it they ve got as a demo

7355263
hide	show

7355276
guard	autotest
i m sorry for not providing a direct answer but i ve stopped using autotest myself and switched to guard

7355341
mouseleave	mouseenter
with that methodology i suppose that the easiest solution will then be to watch the mouseleave and mouseenter events of all ancestors and then check the mouse cursor position to see if it s in the form s screen rectangle your event handlers will be mashed full of events firing off as your mouse moves around the form

7355350
hash	salt
you password should be stored as at least a sha1 hash along with a random salt in the database

7355353
mouseup	mousedown
but you can implement dragging yourself using mousedown and mouseup events

7355353
mouseup	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown
by the way the draggable class attaches the mousedown listener to the svg element and the mousemove and mouseup listeners to the element s parent like the freedraw demo

7355494
mongodb	bson
if you are interested in the single file aspects of it then it shouldn t be too hard to create something using the bson serializer deserializer code provided in the mongodb driver to store bson documents in the file system

7355502
telerik	radcombobox
i m trying to use jquery to enable a telerik radcombobox based on the selection of another telerik radcombobox

google-chrome	firefox
you can use this cache busting technique in rails to make it work in modern browsers google-chrome ie8+ firefox 3.5+

7355582
uiview	subviews
i think the easiest way is to override the willremovesubview uiview subviews method of your nsview

7355599
pull	push
i m familiar with configuring a single default to push and pull from the same remote and branch but that does not work in this case since the push and pull branches are different

my goal is to make a variable of whatever the visible landscape picture is grab it s height then apply that to the portrait images for consistency

7355672

int	chars
2..0b is a placeholder for an int to be printed in base 10 taking up at least 2 chars and padded on the left with the chars 0

7355747
profiling	benchmarking
you should only worry about performance if you re calling your function in a tight loop and if profiling benchmarking show that your function is actually a bottleneck

7355785
width	margin
if you just give it a 200px margin and no width i think that would work best as it would use the remaining space and stay 200px from the left edge

7355795
google-chrome	safari
i was trying to do something nice to display an error message and everything was fine until i decided to try with google-chrome safari this is the code

7355833
versioning	upgrade
you need to upgrade to a newer versioning of php or think of a different way of meeting your higher-level requirement

7355878
versioning	upgrade
you best choice is probably to upgrade to versioning 7 it has some nice improvements over versioning 6.9 like html5 support

7355909
codeigniter	pyrocms
if you are looking for codeigniter based blog cms i would also suggest pyrocms one of the best i ve used

7355915
daemons	launchd
the most common form is a launchd daemons that runs under launchd described in the launchd daemons and agents docs

7355915
daemons	launchd
most daemons should be on demand. that means they should let launchd run them when something interesting happens they then should continue to run to handle additional events and finally they should let launchd kill them when no events have come in for a while

7355934
inherited	properties
this properties is not inherited but it does affect children in the

its an unnamed struct for which foo is a typedef

7356422
width	height
so i created a fiddle that scale some images with both css width and height and css3 transform click here to see to check it out and make sure but i don t have a good eye or maybe monitor i didn t saw any difference between css scaled or -webkit-transform scale scaled versions

7356438
cpython	ironpython
an interesting extension of your scenario is to have 3 kinds of worker processes written in jython cpython and ironpython

7356441
min	max
like you said it s probably best to just define the min and max

7356459
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
now i have subclassed the uinavigationbar of that uinavigationcontroller i know this is illegal this is an educational question and i have overrided the following methods

client-side	server-side
recaptcha intentionally rejects captchas which are submitted to their server more than once e.g by both the client-side and server-side validation

7356466

the culprit is not the having clause per se but all the transcendental functions sin cos acos you are using to calculate distance

7356486
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

7356594
setinterval	settimeout
also calling settimeout or setinterval with a string as the first argument is generally considered bad form you re better off passing a function as the first argument

7356622
uilabel	uibutton

7356628
firefox	safari
this happens in ie firefox and safari

7356719
toolbar	tabs
i am having four tabs in my tab activity and i need a toolbar with three buttons on top of tabactivity irrespective of current tab selection

7356764
width	height
in particular the tab containers will have zero widths and height the error logs will probably be giving an error about containers having zero width so the graph drawing will fail and leave an empty space

7356768
onresume	onpause	onstart	ondestroy	oncreate	ondestroy	oncreate	onstart
u can override gamescreen.java s oncreate onresume ondestroy onstart onpause onstop to handle ur variable

7356797
width	height
like flextras said width height has nothing to do with dpi unless you actually zoom into the application by 4.16x

7356819
width	height
because of this i have to use divisions of the screen width and height to display what needs to be displayed

7356835
prop	each
a value of 200 here is disastrous suddenly each is iterating 0-199 on the value of the prop

7356855

breakpad is currently used by google-chrome firefox google picasa

7356863
getter	setter
when i use property to generate getter setter methods

you want to use salting and a slow hash such as bcrypt scrypt or pbkdf2

7356966
hash	md5
to migrate your users over to phpass you ll want to have two password hash databases the old one with md5 hash and the new one with phpass hash

7356966
hash	md5
when a user logs in check whether you have an entry for them in your old password hash database with md5 hash and if you don t find an entry there look in the new password hash database with phpass hash

7356966
hash	md5
if you find an entry in the old database you ll want to use md5 to hash and check their password

7357077
ant	maven
i m converting an ant backed netbeans project into an maven project

7357078

7357090
post	get
i ve got ajax posting but it s getting redirected with get request not post request

it hosts live postgresql mysql mongo and redis instances

7357192
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome closes the form validation error message

opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
without changes to the test case the behavior is the same in opera firefox and google-chrome except the google-chrome bugs

7357207
post	get
you could create a column in the database to store unix timestamps for the times of the post and then sort by this column if your asking how to get the most recent post first

7357218
ant	maven
the way i understand the question the website maven project depends on the ant sharedlibrariesresource project

7357218
ant	maven
install sharedlibrariesresource to your local maven repository each time ant builds it

7357218
ant	maven
we can use maven ant tasks to achieve the first

7357227
imageview	imageswitcher
you can set the animations to the imageswitcher only imageview is only used to display a single image

7357267
int	boolean
is false - the first is an int the second is a boolean

7357298
width	height
if you have a grid of tiles then given a mouse position you can retrieve the x and y index of the tile by dividing the x mouse position by the width of a tile and y position with the height and flooring both

7357324
public	protected
you could reverse it if you wish but the key point is that you have one set of methods to access at a public privilege and another to access at a protected privilege level

7357334
titlebar	window
i think there is an article on the devexpress suport that might help you - unable to change report preview window titlebar caption

7357349

i ve been looking for ages for c++ examples for aero glass interfaces using just winapi createwindow createwindowex without atl wtl mfc etc

7357388
flac	ogg	mp3	ogg	mp3	flac
this library does not support mp3 the author wants to avoid licensing issues but it does support flac and ogg vorbis

7357424
persistent	transient	instances	transient
unfortunately this results in an object references an unsaved transient instances error because the cascade from parent to desk hasn t resulted in the new desk object being persistent yet

7357439
hide	show
you can hide show it at will etc

7357471
textview	imageview
according to the android documentation the default orientation of the linearlayout is horizontal which means your imageview and textview are in one line

7357552
des	aes
you can use aes des algorithm and write the encrypted password to disk

7357572
google-chrome	firefox
the yahoo pingbox on my site appears in google-chrome but not in firefox currently i ve 3.6

7357600
free	malloc
it is an error to pass to free anything not coming from malloc

7357609
free	malloc
you can t free that since it wasn t malloc ed in the first place

7357623
free	malloc
you are reassigning s from the malloc d pointer to a constant string literal which you then try to free

7357623
free	malloc
as the string literal was not allocated with malloc free ing it unsurprisingly leads to bad things

7357623
free	malloc
if you re using c++ then you should be using new delete rather than malloc free

7357647
kerberos	ntlm
normally when you configure to use windows authentication you are asking to use spnego which means using kerberos whenever possible and then fall back to ntlm if kerberos fails

7357647
kerberos	ntlm
ie7 stops at kerberos in certain cases but not falling back to ntlm

7357647
google-chrome	firefox	kerberos	ntlm
i guess firefox and google-chrome works because they are using ntlm but not kerberos

7357682
ready	each
i have everything ready just cannot get how to position those sites beside each other

7357696
public	protected	inherited	properties
it does also require a default public constructor but thanks to the protected setter on the name properties only code running in the inherited hierarchy can set the name so if an instance appeared without a name you know that someone is doing something wrong

7357705
move	drag
now note how the rectangles are rendered correctly but as soon as you drag one they fly off to the top left corner and cannot be move anymore

7357850
superclass	subclassing
this situation is called field hiding - the subclassing field output is hiding the field of the same name in the superclass

7357850
superclass	subclassing
in both your superclass and your subclassing

7357850
superclass	subclassing
references to output in the subclassing will be to its field but you re setting output in the superclass - the subclassing field will remain null

7357850
superclass	subclassing
change the declaration of output in the superclass to protected so the subclassing can access it

7357888
int	chars
it s not clear why it s int rather than chars admittedly - it would make sense if you could use this to send non-bmp chars but the documentation states

7357888
int	chars
the chars to be written is contained in the 16 low-order bits of the given int value

7357970
folder	directory
after that copy the following files from the app folder keeping the directory structure intact and run on any windows machine which has the air framework installed

7358027
maven	m2e
if you use the embedded m2e maven installation maven has no information to your settings

7358027
maven	m2e
m2e can only use the proxy set in your maven settings file not the one in your eclipse environment

7358042
hide	show
instead i have a 2-3 second delay then the overlay hide and the data show

7358044
mvp	presenter
with mvp validation is supposed to take place in the presenter implementations as they have access to your view instances during postbacks

7358055
width	height
where 280 is the width and 680 is the height you would take the original height of the scrollview here it is 340 and multiply it by the number of pages you want

7358067
hide	show
you can use differnt div tags and show hide them using

7358079

nhibernate	queryover
now i m fairly new to nhibernate 3.0 and queryover and i have a bit of a problem translating this sql query to c# code

7358324
pull	push
you might want to include both machinesâ public keys in githubâ s repository configuration so you can push and pull without a password

7358347
width	height
here i got class name imageview height x width but

7358359
getter	setter
i prefer readxxxx over getxxxx because getxxx may refer to getter setter methods of bean and may create confusion in maintenance of code

7358369
submit	submission
as it looks like you re firing an asynchronous request in the submit event handler rather than using the default form behaviour i would suggest disabling the checkbox or removing the event handler in the submit event handler and then re-enabling it in the success callback of the get method to prevent the user from submission repeatedly

7358378
firefox	safari
currently i am facing a design issue in firefox and safari

7358378
firefox	safari
it looks right in firefox but in safari it takes some space from the top

7358489
opera	firefox
i confirmed opera 11.50 worked as your expectation but firefox 6 and

7358534
spaces	delimiter
as you can see i have to deal with different delimiter newline spaces and comma as well as making sure that when reading in strings it respects the inverted commas as well as forgets them they don t end up as part of the resulting string

7358553
width	height
i mean by center the center in the width and the center in the height

7358555
nsurlcache	uiwebview
i have built a class that intercepts uiwebview resource loading by subclassing nsurlcache and overriding cachedresponseforrequest similar to this example

7358568
qabstractitemview	qabstractitemmodel
another option is the qlistview or other derivate from qabstractitemview but i can t find how to pass a widget as a qlistitemmodel or other reimplemented qabstractitemmodel

7358603
integer	unsigned
so 32 bit unsigned integer would do well

7358677

for other data types convert then to nsdata or nsstring

7361443
strcpy	malloc	free	malloc	free	strcpy	strlen	strcpy
it is correct assuming you meant strcpy and not strlen but it must be very clear from the documentation of the function that it s the caller s responsibility to free the returned pointer and what method does it have to use to free it new delete malloc free etc

7362037
integer	unsigned

basically you can use some other tools than perl to compute md5 hash of the word.

7362264
globalization	localization
you definitely should take a look at the msdn article series on globalization and localization

7362264
globalization	localization
asp.net globalization and localization

7362338
width	height
i assume when you say it isn t displaying the same as your screen size you are talking about the height and not width

7362338
width	height
in your style tag you have the height set to 417px if you want the div to fill the entire screen you need to set this to 100 just like the width part is

7362340
width	height
when a div with fixed height s content ends up getting larger than the div we need a scroll bar but the scrollbar takes out some width and thus a horizontal bar is added to

7362355
wadl	wsdl
unlike wsdl and mex for soap there s no widely used metadata format for rest endpoints wadl is one of them but it s not much used and not implemented by wcf so on the add service reference or svcutil will only see one endpoint in the metadata and only that one will be created

7362355
webclient	httpwebrequest
your webhttbinding -endpoint will do that return json or xml based on the incoming request since you enabled auto format selection but the way you d consume this service doesn t need to be with a wcf client - using webclient httpwebrequest should work out just fine

7362395
int	chars
this method first writes the length of the string as a utf-7 encoded unsigned int and then writes that many chars to the stream by using the binarywriter instance s current encoding

7362486
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve created a form form website page that works perfectly on ie8 google-chrome firefox safari opera and seamonkey but not when i m using the compatibilty view to emulate ie7

7362502
post	get
most of the time it s more ideal to use the post redirect get pattern so that users are presented with a resource who s state is not dependent on a server post

7362530
width	height
this is not working you better change the image size for depend upon the device screen height and width

7362537
emitmapper	automapper
i can t use automapper emitmapper or any other external packages

7362542
width	height
i haven t got the right dimensions for my picture when i try to adjust the width and height nder the i try to give dimensions to my picture of 640 as width and 960 as height however i couldn t do that here is what i got

7362566
mouseover	mouseout
i ve tried binding a hover event for all delete buttons that unbinds the row click on mouseover and rebinds it on mouseout like this pseudocode below

7362580
width	height
you need to unclick the conserver les proportions checkbox that will let you specify height and width without photoshop doing any automatic scaling

7362592
salt	md5
i thought that when salt is used md5 is computed from concatenation string + salt

7362620
google-chrome	firefox
note that the behavior is consistent across google-chrome firefox and ie

7362631
inherited	properties
hiding a method call in what others would expect to be an inherited properties isn t a readable or maintainable approach

7362639
freemarker	velocity
for traditional mvc you still have plain jsp jstl velocity and freemarker

7362653
post	put
hence i can issue a post request which would be treated as a put request inside the rest engine

7362696
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
you need to implement the java.io.serializable interface and write and read to and from the objectoutputstream and objectinputstream classes to store and retrieve data respectively

7362756
nexus	artifactory
i would highly recommend you consider setting up you own local instance of nexus or artifactory or archiva ...

7362770
width	height
let s say i would like to extract the width height using the following regexp

7362815
width	height
you might also need to play with the the height width of the webbrowser to specify the initial size

7362889
return-type	return-value
first the function signature of openfile has a return-type of void yet you check for a return-value here

7362889
free	realloc
third you can t call free filedata in func1 since you by calling realloc inside your func2 function have changed the value of where the memory is pointing and you are not passing the actual memory address for the original filedata variable by reference to your func2 function

7362889
realloc	malloc
in other words if the call to malloc in func1 returned a value of let s say 0x10000 and you called realloc on that allocated memory somewhere else in the code the memory that was allocated at 0x10000 has now moved somewhere else but the value of filedata in the context of the local scope of func1 is still 0x10000

7362889
free	realloc
then when you call realloc anywhere else you are actually modifying the value of filedata as it was allocated in func1 as well and can call free on that pointer

7362924
google-chrome	firefox
this code successfully opens a print dialog in both firefox and google-chrome

i m currently working with websockets and a php server it works very well with google-chrome and opera but not with firefox 6

7363095

then my other ideas was to use js s calendar pop up to get the start and end date and have some sort of script look up the date everyday to see if the deadline has reached yet or not..but all these arent very reliable ways or methods so perhaps someone here has more experience with this...cron jobs i am not very experienced with but i am not so sure how i would use php or js in the back end of my form to set a cron job for this

7363511
width	height
i m not sure if you problem is the same as mine but i found that accessing the width or height property of a normal django imagefield would read the file from the storage backend load it into pil and return the dimensions from there

width	height
was opened to address this but the django devs closed as wontfix because they want the width and height properties to always return the true values

7363555
hex	binary
knowing that you should be able to figure the rest yourself and handle binary and hexadecimal numbers understand that each number you listed is twice its predecessor what decimal values the hex numbers have what the next decimal number in the row should be and how to express option_10 in any numerical system and particularly binary decimal and hexadecimal

7364683
rational-numbers	fractions
in computing and programming fractions or rational-numbers are an alternative to floating point numbers since numerator and denominator are stored as integers the representation is exact as opposed to most floating point implementations which cannot represent most rational-numbers exactly

7364704
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have made this website www . ionisedmesh . com and a latest news box on the top but the problem is that while the blog posts headings are clickable in internet explorer they cannot be clicked while using firefox or google-chrome i havent tested with safari but i am sure it wont work on it too if it doesnt work on google-chrome

7364953
n-gram	words
one solution i can think of is storing the dictionary in memory with constant look-up time hash based set and then extracting all words n-gram from each sentence n can be set to the number of words in the longest phrase in the dictionary comparing each against the dictionary and keeping the longest ones that don t overlap

7365005

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this looks brilliant in firefox ie google-chrome and safari .

7365729
coalesce	isnull

7365745
vim	textmate
if you want to use fcsh on vim take a look on - it works exactly like the fcsh daemon you have on textmate

7365850
width	height
when i ve added this code no setting on width and height works

7365871
width	height
alternately you could use javascript to calculate the width and height of the viewport then set the style dynamically

7365899
width	height
so height width outerwidth scrollwidth etc are not going to work

7365936
clang	llvm
you might want to look at using clang llvm - you can probably modify it to output the data you want pretty easily

pop-up	dialog
i was thinking along the way of making my own jquery dialog pop-up with appropriate partial view loaded once a row is selected and add edit button is clicked

7366216
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine for us in google-chrome and firefox

7366231
dictionary	map
i m tempted to write this as a class dictionary since the keys are constant but since the keys map to attributes of an instance ie cols self.width this doesn t compile

7366238
serializable	deserialization
if you are concerned about performance with web services consuming and producing you might want to research alternative web service packages and replacing the xml serializable deserialization bits

7366356
google-chrome	firefox
it is working good under google-chrome and firefox but it is not working under ie

spaces	delimiter
an alternative solution is to try and match the format of the date instead of using so you no longer rely on the double spaces as a delimiter

7366398
hide	show
however instead of using up half the array as show in the code below it can be enhanced by using a better algorithm where you hide the value in the index array

7366478
graphics2d	bufferedimage
that you get the bufferedimage s graphics2d object via its creategraphics method

7366478
int	boolean
that you draw your box the more fleeting portion of the image directly in the paintcomponent using int class variables to tell paintcomponent where to draw and perhaps a class boolean variable to tell if to draw

mouseleave	mouseenter
i m trying to use mouseenter and mouseleave to start and stop a color animation function however it doesn t stop on mouseleave...please help me figure out

7366499
installation	upgrade
also indy is open-source so you can upgrade an indy installation using source code from indy s public access svn server or mirror

7366504
post	get
best practice is to use post redirect get pattern since you are asking specific about refresh after submit

7366517
post	get
note that in jsf 2.x you ve also the opportunity to use the new which fires a get request instead of a post request

7366537

google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari come with built-in debuggers that take 15 mins to learn how to set a breakpoint and then inspect the values of variables once it hits that breakpiont

7366745
children	parent
i made it by switching 2 of the children to absolute because they will never expand than i putted the children whom size wont change to the top and than i moved the last one upwards by few pixels so it overlays and still can resize the parent

7366750
children	parent
however it turns out that all children are evaluated prior to being stored on their parent so

7366752
inherited	subclassing
basically i have a base class and i can have any number of subclassing which inherited from it

7366778
children	parent
elements that are absolutely positioned do not take up any space so changes to the number or size of the children will have no effect on the size of the parent element

7366778
children	parent
if you want the parent container to expand contract with its children you need to float both the container and its children

7366798
apache	nginx
keep it simple -- leverage what apache or nginx or whatever offers you

7366798
apache	nginx
use apache or nginx or whatever to split the customer s url s from each other

7367057
getter	setter
both the getter and the setter behavior are defined by property declarations

7367057
getter	setter
this of course is only true if you use synthesize and do not override or change the getter and setter methods

however i d also suggest that you use a single container for all the banners and maybe put the the icons in there too and set the mouseenter mouseleave events on that rather than on individual banners

7367251
getter	setter
either thing is actually a getter setter with some horrible logic

7367257

folder	directory
i am not sure what you did to windows installation but your user.home points to directory vmware-host shared folder

7367442
maven	pom.xml
because you declare your project to be dependent upon bouncy castle in your maven pom.xml anybody using maven to depend upon your library will by default pull in bouncy castle as a transitive dependency

7367442
jar	war
for example jar type packaging by default does not include dependencies whereas war will include those in compile scope but not test or provided

7367457

7367566
linefeed	delimiter
for example if the server understand messages delimiter by the linefeed character you can send two distinct messages with the following code

7367581
fgets	strtol
you should read entire lines with fgets and then parse them with the strtol family

7367647
fast-forward	merge
it is likely that the merge has not been fast-forward because your branch had differences with remote one before pulling

7367722
sorting	grouping
sorting by the min of myrank per grouping will effect the same order as sorting ascending by myrank globally first then doing a distinc

7367723
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
in this case it may turn into a more efficient for-loop your loops iterates 500 times setting a bytes worth of the arrays to 0 every time

7367770
width	height
width height and depth are all constants and width is just as large as height

7367797

i have tried using ironpython and had too much trouble with unsupported cpython library my python code is using so i thought of trying the other way around and calling my c# code from python

7367979
folder	directory
i encourage you to put all data you want your server to be able to access inside its folder var www directory or subdirectories of it

7367981
chown	chmod
you can change permissions using the chown and chmod commands in a shell

7367996
hide	show
personally i use commands and have the main controller hide and show forms based on the commands passed in so there is as little logic in the forms as possible

7368019
int	double
an int will get converted back to a double invisibly which is why you weren t seeing any errors in your code

7368025
put	get
i just need to put the list into and get the list from the bundle or intent

7368099
pop-up	dialog
this pop-up a dialog box to confirm my action but i want to suppress it

7368127
mp4	h.264
the output mp4 file plays in flash browsers that support h.264 mpeg4 ios and android

the other slashes between directory in the path are just separators but the root folder is significant

7368129
folder	directory
users 1 answers 2 may refer to a different location than users 1 answers 2 the former is relative to the current directory and the latter always starts at the root folder

7368326
super	self
i often see this if self super init construct and i wonder why it s done

7368370
filewriter	bufferedwriter
a bufferedwriter around a filewriter will almost certainly be faster than any nio scheme you can come up with

put	get
download the admob sdk and just put it in a folder somewhere that won t get moved and just reference it in your android project settings

7368443
udp	tcp
if you need to print directly to a pos printer they usually have their own binary protocol that you can use over tcp udp

7368535
allocator	stl
for example you can provide an allocator to an stl container or you can override new and delete on a class by class basis

7368535
free	malloc
note also that replacing malloc and free will not necessarily change the allocator used by operators new and delete

7368535
free	malloc
if you re using c chances are you can wrap or replace key malloc and free calls with your custom allocator just where it matters and leave the rest of the program to use the default allocator

7368542
pop-up	dialog
i want to be able to handle it using the appdomain s unhandled exception handler which in our case logs the error pop-up a dialog notifying the user and exits the application but so far i have not found a good way to do this

maybe using calloc is part of the issue but i tried using malloc and it gave me the same result

7368704
disk	ram
it s going to take a long time because you ve only got 2gb ram and 6gb of data indexes and it s going to force a ton of swapping in out between ram and disk

7368715
for-loop	arrays
or a for-loop if you want to do this for each element of the datarecord arrays

7368725
pull	push
i tried to push pull my repo but it didn t do anything

i have several maven modules with vaadin library dependency in the root pom.xml file

7368923
inherited	properties
custom template base class inherited properties of template directive

7368933
margin	height
keep in mind that the height of an element does not include the margin and padding for the element they are added together in the end

7368933
margin	height
you should be able to put them both into another division at height 100 and make it work properly but you ll most likely find that the page still extends past the screen by 16px because of the margin on the body

7368938
y-combinator	combinators
the y-combinator pretty much like any other fixed point combinators will only work properly when your functions are called by need or lazily evaluated

7368946
mouse	keyboard
most applications do not support external automation so your only option in those cases is to use mouse_event and keybd_event to simulate mouse keyboard activity and or use postmessage and or sendmessage to send simulated messages directly to specific windows

7369065
hide	show
to hide the details div and show the immediately-following div assumed to be specs try this jquery snippet

7369065
hide	show
it attaches a click handler to every product-details div and when it fires it hide that div and show its immediate sibling

7369067
listview	gridview
i m using a gridview but i believe this should also work for listview

7369090
jar	war
maven only comes into the picture because you presumably have resource files in your project version control that need to be included in the jar or war or whatever artifacts that you are building

7369146
chown	chmod
1 chown this file to apache user and chmod it to 700

7369220
hide	show
when you hover the tag it show the submenu then when you go to click a submenu item you re not hover the any more so it hide it again

7369229
for-loop	arrays
if you want this function to also accept an arrays of rho phi z values i suggest you simply process the values in a for-loop as i doubt any further vectorization will bring significant improvements plus the code will be harder to read

7369253
children	parent
no it is not possible through pure css to make a parent element automatically resize to contain all of its positioned children

7369257
int	double
i want to use the extrainfo member to be a useful flexible addition to the message class so i would like for it to be able to contain any type an int node index a double path cost a relevant vector3 position from xna etc etc...

7369261
inherited	properties
controls that are not designed for user input for example the label control no longer render the disabled disabled attribute if their enabled properties is set to false or if they inherited this setting from a container control

7369284
dictionary	map
this will initialize a dictionary with the same keys that you parsed from your csv file and each one will map to an empty list to which i assume you will append your suspect row values

7369295
next	except
it looks like a normal function except that it contains yield statements for producing a series a values usable in a for-loop or that can be retrieved one at a time with the next function

7369311
hash	md5
i have one nvarchar column in sql server which stores passwords hash in md5

7369311
hash	md5
i use the following for generating the md5 hash

7369314
int	double
the rationale for this is that template-parameter-dependent name lookup is performed right before the instantiation of i so it finds h double but not h int

7369314
int	double
gcc seems to be looking up the template-parameter-dependent names in the template after everything else has been compiled so it finds both h double and h int and prefers the latter

7369314
int	double
clang seems to be looking up the template-parameter-dependent names in the template at the point where the template is declared so it finds neither h double nor h int

7369315
superclass	subclassing
in addition to the answers provided by matt ball and hovercraft full of eels you can avoid having to explicitly cast by declaring methods implemented by the subclassing as abstract methods in the superclass

7369315
abstract-class	superclass
as mentioned by kublai khan it is necessary to then make the superclass an abstract-class

7369358
folder	directory
right click on the folder directory web sites and select new - web site

7369373
put	get
to get strings out of read you d have to use the printed representation of strings put them in double quotes

7369374
versioning	upgrade
need to know the complete story so that we feel safe to upgrade to bigger versioning

7369378
apache	nginx
in nginx so that apache will never need to redirect

7369388
for-loop	arrays
since langauges is an arrays you can use it as ilist object and consume it in a for-loop like mentioned by json skeet

7369415
portrait	landscape
i believe you are providing support for both the landscape and portrait mode for the application so you should detect the device orientation in the cellforrowatindexpath method and create the cell for the current orientation

7369416
postgresql	mysql
i have both mysql and postgresql

7369419
versioning	upgrade
need to know the complete story so that we feel safe to upgrade to bigger versioning

7369423
submit	submission
3 submit via ajax to page 3 before submission the form to page 2

7369445
stdout	stderr
if you have a handle that was inherited from your parent process different from stdin stdout or stderr or a pipe from createpipe is it possible to get a buffered stream from it

7369473
hide	show
you could then just do a little jquery when you click more...to show the rest and hide more

7369495
bash	subshell
even running it as bash virtualenv_blah.sh wont work since this will simply create the environment inside the subshell

7369544
mousemove	mousedown
i assign an object to a variable in the mousedown event and track itâ s relative position by examining the mousemove event of the neighbouring panels as i drag the mouse over them

7369544
mousemove	mousedown
the problem is that the sender parameter of the mousemove event never changes â it always returns the object that received the mousedown event

7369600
erlang	lisp
other languages including the functional language lisp ml haskell erlang etc most of the major dynamic languages python ruby javascript etc and the other application languages c# scala go d etc support some form of lambda literal. even c++ has them now since c++11 although in that case they are somewhat more complicated because c++ lacks automatic memory management and won t save your stack frame for you

7369610
portrait	landscape
style media screen max-device-width 1024px and orientation portrait portrait media screen max-device-width 1024px and orientation landscape landscape #60

7369613

although this works fine in terms of deleting the product what ends up happening is that the browser will send one post request receive a 302 redirect and then do a get request immediately afterwards

7369649
bmp	png
i have an png image with alpha i need to convert it to bmp to be loaded to my opengl application

7369661
textarea	autogrow
but probably you if not now then you will after you get the idea want the autogrow textarea plugin

7369661
textarea	autogrow
then it will autogrow the textarea fitting the text amount length

7369692
notepad++	jedit
any other free editor like notepad++ or jedit would also do here

7369762
ienumerable	iqueryable
if you are not really using iqueryable interface simple solution would be to cal .tolist and work with ienumerable or list return type

7369767
mkmapview	mapkit
you might want to look at mkcircle and mkcircleview which are part of the mapkit api and are designed for drawing circles on an mkmapview

7369770
width	height
header size in this case would be determined by the size of variables holding width height and maxsize plus two bytes for p5 plus 4 bytes of whitespace

7369770
width	height
other cases where this might break are if the width or height are larger than an int very big image

7369770
width	height
or if the pgm is 8-bit rather than 16-bit which can be determined from maxval and possible width height and the filesize

7369775
uiview	subviews
and uiview has subviews property which is an nsarray of uiview objects

7369784
post	get
to the new page either by get termed query strings in asp.net or post here is an example how to do it

7369793
width	height
you will have to create picker programitcally so that you can create your own sized picker with cgrectmake x y width height then you will have to rotate it but rotating it will also rotate in the picker s datasources methods you will have to rotate the view inverse of picker s rotation i am including code hopfully it will help

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
work beautifuly in firefox google-chrome and safari but not in ie

7369799
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
what i normally do in these situations is create a uinavigationcontroller setting it to have no navbar at the top and another uiviewcontroller perhaps the one with a uitabbarcontroller in it which i set as the rootviewcontroller for the uinavigationcontroller

7369799
viewdidload	viewwillappear
then in viewdidload or viewwillappear you do you login logic and depending on the result push or pop the correct uiviewcontroller with no animation

7369812
width	height
50 50 is the width and height

7369818

7369943
min	max
pick the two extreme points with the min and max x value call them x min and x max and draw the line between them

7369943
min	max	minimum	max
in the case where you have multiple points with the same x value at the extremes pick x min with the minimum y value and x max with the maximum y value

7369943
min	max
split the list of points into two sub lists where all of the points below the line connecting x min and x max are in one list and all those above that line are in another

7369943
min	max
include x min in the first list and x max in the second

7369967
width	height
there is an scrollheight and and scrollwidth property that equals to width and height of what is inside an scrollable element

7369967
width	height
so setting height and width of that element to scrollwidth and scrollheight can solve the problem

7370070

7370179
width	height
this is how you vil get the size availabel for parent div.then set the width and height of parent div according to it.now if you have width of parent div its easy to set middle_div in middle of parent div

7370205
nhibernate	queryover
could someone help me to translate linq expression to nhibernate queryover

7370223
postgresql	mysql
but you might also want to consider if you re the person creating thousands of files in the first place whether that is the best way of storing your data - if you usually need the ability to search quickly you might want to either use a database instead of plain files mysql postgresql sqlite et cetera or keep a search index using sphinx solr or lucene

7370272
width	height
width 0 height 0 any self-respecting spam suppression software virus checker etc. will silently and automatically remove html elements with 0 size

7370315
portrait	landscape
but for a extra detail if you wanted to support only landscape left and portrait upside down orientation the function would look like this

7370316
button	checkbox
the site describes how to set styles for button radios and checkbox

7370346
rss	feed
i only want to read rss feed so it probably does not need to support the entire spec

rtos	qnx
the blackberry tablet os runs on top of the qnx neutrino rtos

7370361
rtos	qnx
qnx is most famous for being the real time operating system of which there are two versions qnx rtos v4 is an older product but is still used in many existing systems and still supported by the company

7370361
rtos	qnx
more recently qnx neutrino rtos v6 was released

7370361
rtos	qnx
questions specifically about the blackberry tablet os should probably not have this tag unless you are coding directly against the underlying qnx neutrino rtos apis

7370372
ubuntu	linux
i want to create a dsn in ubuntu linux 10.10 for a java application with a mysql back end

7370382
google-chrome	firefox
it differs from how it works in other browsers such as firefox google-chrome and ie

7370382
width	height
the result was wider in opera as it changed both width and height

7370382
width	height
that is if we change the width the height is no longer actual because the content spreads over the new width making itself shorter in height

7370382
width	height
that explains why the second jsfiddle worked as intended firstly i got the new width and applied it then the content occupied the new dimensions and only after that i got the new height and applied it

7370382
width	height
so if we need to change both width and height we need to firstly change the width and only then change the height

7370410
width	height
public absolutelayout.layoutparams int width int height int x int y

free	malloc
malloc is not a system call it is library libc routine which goes through some of its internal structures to give you address of a free piece of memory of the required size

7370763
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
word-wrap is supported in ie 5.5+ firefox 3.5+ and webkit browsers such as google-chrome and safari

iccube	mondrian
amongst them vou ve the classical mondrian rolap and one new coming iccube molap

7370929
for-loop	loops
you should also consider using a foreach loops instead of a for-loop

7370935
django	web.py
i am learning django but gave web.py a try first

7370935
django	web.py
can the web.py type classes be implemented in django like

7370939
graphdb	allegrograph
allegrograph okay they are a graphdb rdf store hybrid

7370939
stardog	allegrograph
an alternative approach might be starting with allegrograph or stardog

7370941
rjava	jri
try using the rjava distribution instead jri is now part of rjava

7370942
many-to-many	one-to-many
you may also specify the default comparative and sorting behavior of a relational collection by declaring the where and orderby property attributes on the parent entity of a one-to-many or many-to-many relationship

7371011
pull	push
use git push to publish commits and git pull to get the latest tree from the remote origin

7371028
jobs	cron
i found this article helpful for the error handling aspects of running cron jobs

7371047
glassfish	weblogic
these implementations are also come pre-bundled with java ee application servers glassfish and weblogic contain jersey

7371051
rss	feed
serving it as a web page or rss feed even when password-protected is very rarely wise

7371084
for-loop	arrays
this basically means that when you use the less than or equel to operator in your for-loop you re looping from zero to the number of items in your collection however since your arrays index begins are zero you re eventually going to be requesting an item from your arrays that doesn t exist

7371115
inherited	subclassing
the answer is very simple no subclassing do not inherited friend associations

7371115
children	parent
a friend can only access the private members of the class the association is declared in not those of parent and or children of that class

7371185
folder	directory
i am guessing using some ide you don t specify which that is copying certain files from your source folder into the destination either a jar or a directory of classes and resources

7371202
google-chrome	firefox
for the debugging part the two major browsers talking about actual browsers not ie google-chrome and firefox both have great debugging tools

7371202
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome has the built in developer tools ctrl-shift-i to launch and firefox has firebug

7371268
submit	submission
so i am in the process of gathering a user s email address and submission it to a database - but what i would really like to do is also submit an html email to them

7371279
put	get
here i ll put the files - please see because i didn t get what to do and how.

7371334
mouseover	mouseout
the simplest would be to modify your code to reference a variable here hold which is set on mouseover and cleared on mouseout

7371402
hide	show
and i want to press x class close to change height of parent div to 20px and show v class open but hide x class close in each div with class im separately

7371402
hide	show
then press v class open to change height of parent div to 220px and show x but hide v

7371402
hide	show
how can i hide and show only one of v which is child of the parent div which is parent of x class .close

7371406
post	get
you should not mix the post and the get method or you will run into trouble

7371431
viewdidload	viewdidappear
disable your currentlocation button until mapview get user s current location then the currentlocation button when get user s current location.you can do this by disabling currentlocation button in viewdidload viewdidappear and enable currentlocation button in method after

7371448
int	chars
my overall advice is to not compare a chars field to an int and rely on an implicit conversion

7371454
post	get
do post if you get some code for direct comparison

7371457
width	height
its working good if i use direction left or right becuase i have incrased width but how do i set the height of the th or table

7371461
keydown	keyup
i m trying when i navigate using keyup and keydown on dropdownlist the it focus on the next element but change the index of previous dropdown

7371461
keydown	keyup
actually i want to stop keyup and keydown indexing changing functionality on element

7371469
mouseleave	mouseenter
but it can byte when you rely on the mouseenter and mouseleave event for example with a control that is close to the edge of its container

7371478
addition	multiplication	subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction
you cannot know the values of x and y until runtime so there is nothing you can do but use an if like you were going to and think of the math that will require the fewest operations taking into account that 1 subtraction addition multiplication division usually

7371514
bufferedreader	bufferedwriter
i was initially using a bufferedreader bufferedwriter but i cannot set the data to private which means anyone can just edit the file

7371532
hide	show
hiding the element is done using the jquery hide method there is also show if you want to make the elements visible again later

7371533
mouseover	mouseout
i would use mouseover and mouseout as suggested in the jquery documentation like so

7371534
versioning	upgrade
you might want to upgrade - upgrading netbeans is a simple process all your settings are automtically configured in the newly installed versioning

7371555
int	chars
also you should make sure you use the correct key type - int 0 is not the same as a chars 0

7371561
post	get
this code will log post or get data to your firebug window if found place it in the page you request with ajax

7371576
google-chrome	firefox
i am still unsure what causes script error. with the period btw that s how it shows up in our ajax logger in firefox but in google-chrome we were able to narrow it down to.

7371621
redmine	chiliproject
if you drop the following file into lib redmine core_ext vendor_gem_source_index.rb of your chiliproject dirctory you should be able to run warbler

7371629
client-side	server-side
prereq use a template-engine that can both render server-side and client-side

7371629
client-side	server-side
this makes sure you can render models without js- through server-side templating and render models with js through client-side templating

7371629
sorting	filtering
initially all links product-detail page paging sorting filtering are real server-side urls no hashbang urls

7371629
sorting	filtering
the end-result is a page which can be navigated 100 with paging sorting filtering without the use of js

7371629
sorting	filtering
all paging sorting filtering urls result in a request to the server which in turn results in a new set of products being rendered

7371629
client-side	server-side
visually nothing should change after all server-side and client-side rendering was done on same models with same template but at least now there s a binding between the client-side model and the view

7371629
sorting	filtering
now every filtering paging sorting url should result in a client-side state-change which would probably result in your js-framework doing an ajax-request to the server to return new products in json-format

7371629
client-side	server-side
i ve done some testing to return html-snippets on ajax using server-side mustache-template rendering instead of doing the same on the client-side as suggested in my answer above

7371656
google-chrome	firefox
the load event does not correctly bubble up the parent document and the event.target isn t set by firefox ie9 or google-chrome which is required to do event delegation

7371671
public	protected
the fact that it is internal to list and it is protected locks everyone outside of the hierarchy of list from using the type at all all of the methods in node can be public

7371732
pseudo-class	visited
similarly the style defined for .foo a visited overrides the style for a hover when both visited as well as hover pseudo-class apply to an a element of class foo

7371740
gridview	rowdatabound
if you want to bind the image control url dynamically you will have to hook into the rowdatabound event of the gridview

7371752
qbytearray	qimage
you can construct a qimage from a qbytearray with the qimage fromdata static method

7371764
asterisk	pbx	asterisk	freeswitch	freeswitch	pbx
and asterisk and freeswitch are pbx software and probably are not what you are looking for

7371776
hide	show
to show hide upload fields you can use for example the css display attribute

7371832
crossover	mutation
yet since there are so many settings population size mutation rate crossover rate and so on... i don t know if this is due to some bugs in my code or because i made a poor choice of those aforementioned parameteres

7371832
crossover	mutation
as i said i m using tournament selection the crossover is implemented by chosing each gene with equal probability from one of the two parents and the mutation by adding or subtracting a value from 0 to max_perturbation to the current value

7371832
crossover	mutation
can you point me out to any tutorial discussing how to optimize the use of genetic algorithm with neural networks what kind of crossover works best what kind of population size is better also mutation rate and so on... or can give me any tips

7371837
inherited	properties
you can achieve this using tag properties of button any child of uiview inherited that in following way

7371852
inherited	subclassing
then for every class that wants access to the node they inherited nodeaccess as protected which grants them and all other subclassing access rights to node within the protected ruleset but prevents any other class from accessing node directly

7371866
int	boolean
for any of the types int float string boolean and resource

7371867
post	get
instead of trying to hide the username and password in get or post parameters you should instead use basic authentication which was invented especially for that purpose and is universally available in clients and is available using convenience methods in sinatra

7371867
put	get	post	get	post	put
if you get there you gather information about that resource if you post you create a new resource if you put yopu update n existing resource and if you delete well you delete it

7371954
int	chars
i have two chars 4 bytes that representing int value geted from stream

7371983
setinterval	settimeout
the only exceptions are ajax timers settimeout and setinterval and html5 web workers

7372020
int	chars
however to turn two chars into an int you can use

7372103
setinterval	settimeout
except ajax settimeout and setinterval there is nothing that can asynchronously executed in javascript

7372112
webclient	webrequest
the use of the webrequest class can be greatly simplified with a simple extension method that makes it behave like the webclient

7372138
for-loop	arrays
so instead of a for-loop i make use of the map method - each arrays element each input node is replaced with its id value

7372164
getter	setter
explain to me what is a setter and getter

7372179
typedef	struct
and the second snippet is a pure c typedef struct

7372201
multiplying	add
the obvious solution is to say that a unix timestamp is in seconds so just multiplying the number of days by the number of seconds in a day 86400 and add that to the current time time

7372208
mutators	setter
the mutators method sometimes called a setter is most often used in object-oriented programming in keeping with the principle of encapsulation

7372208
getter	setter
often a setter is accompanied by a getter also known as an accessor which returns the value of the private member variable

7372229
google-chrome	firefox
i tried it in google-chrome and firefox but not in ie

7372248
getter	setter
getter and setter are methods on an object that allow you to hide the internal implementation of something but still allow other objects to access things

7372248
getter	setter
in objective-c they are tied to the idea of properties - if you define a property you get getter and setter for the object s function

7372248
getter	setter
there s more documentation about properties here and jussi s link is a better overview of getter setter in general

7372287
google-chrome	firefox
use google-chrome firefox or any other name with the respective

7372310
decoder	encoder
you ll need to find or write a hex decoder and a base-64 encoder and use a as an intermediate form

7372312
udp	tcp
i m using udp and tcp packets

7372312
udp	tcp
the tcp seeme to work really good throgh the udp comes after a delay of 5 seconds sometimes

7372323
rss	feed
a url in this form returns the most recent n items of the rss feed

7372323
rss	feed
rss the url for the rss feed

7372323
rss	feed
rss the url for the rss feed

7372323
rss	feed
to get newest 1000 item of this rss feed the url to be used should look like

7372333
memcached	apc
the problem is that this file is really big - i ve tried memcached apc etc

7372377
width	height
the entire area will be covered however part of the image may not be visible if the width height of the resized image is too great

7372386
multibyte	setlocale
in linux you can either proceed to use wcstombs to transform the wide character into the system s and locale s narrow character multibyte encoding don t forget setlocale lc_ctype

7372390
setinterval	settimeout
i use settimeout instead of setinterval ... 1 to reduce cpu load in my case

7372408
jpql	hql
sure you can do it with hibernate tools eclipse plugin it s about hql but it can manage jpql

7372443
children	parent
finally there s a slight difference in how constructors are overridden in java children classes must call the parent s constructor refinement overriding whereas in python children classes can override the constructor and not call the parent s constructor replacement overriding

7372464
inherited	subclassing	super	implements
to use this subclassing make your custom view controller a subclassing of gmkeyboardvc and it inherited this feature just be sure if you implements viewwillappear and viewwilldisappear they must call super

7372468
move	drag
i have a magazine type app which has textviews on each of the pages i need to be able to ignore the swipe gesture and pass it to the parent so that when the user drag sideways it move to the next page instead of trying to scroll the textview

7372477
mouse	keyboard
you shouldn t be using the mouse press release events to detect actions on your buttons unless you have very specific needs and don t care at all about keyboard actions and shortcuts

7372480
width	height
you can adjust the width and height to your wishes

7372480
background-color	transparency
you can also use background-color rgba 1 1 1 0.2 where 0.2 is the transparency level 0 invisible 1 fully visible

7372480
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this css attrbute is available for firefox 3+ google-chrome safari 3+ opera 10+ and ie 9+

7372501
hide	show
you would add a click handler to your link to show its corresponding div and hide the others

7372531
post	get
i realise i should probably be implementing the mvc model here and although use this to populate the textboxes on loading can t pull the information from a textbox back out again on the post back to get values in the javascript function in the view

7372561
robocopy	xcopy
use xcopy or robocopy

7372600
put	get
for the dropdownlist if you put it in the form tag it will be bind to the model so you will get in the controller

7372658
children	parent
i had to add an after_save hook on the parent model to look up all of the children and save them

7372664
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome gives me blank output while firefox gives me the value in the text box

7372677
getter	setter
what s worse the selected property on the button only looks like a bound property with setter and getter but isn t never fires propertychange

7372681
macports	homebrew	fink	macports	fink	homebrew
2 install from a package manager macports fink homebrew - this makes it easier if you have complex c library dependencies

7372734
quicksort	mergesort
but remember mergesort is not in place it require 2n memeroy space.and mergesort also need to do many array copies which we don t include in the analysis of algorithm.in a word mergesort is really faseter than quicksort in theroy but in reality you need to consider memeory space the cost of array copy merger is slower than quick sort.i once made an experiment where i was given 1000000 digits in java by random class and it took 2610ms by mergesort 1370ms by quicksort

7372736
inherited	subclassing
i have a main class that is inherited by numerous subclassing

7372736
inherited	subclassing
the inherited main class has to be at least protected in inherited to prevent non-derivative classes from using or altering it via the subclassing

7372736
public	protected
all classes wanting rights to node inherit accessnode as protected so the accessnode class isn t public

7372736
public	protected
the problem is in order for templatelist to copy charlist a subclass of templatelist via read-only it needs access to the nodes of charlist to avoid using charlist s iterator - the problem is the nodes are protected to prevent external non-accessnode interference and implementing a public method that grants access to the nodes would defeat the point

7372736
inherited	subclassing
what i need is sideways inherited so all subclassing of type accessnode can access each other s node without granting access publicly

7372774
base	fractions
just like some fractions like one-third cannot be expressed exactly as a non-repeating base 10 decimal number many fractions cannot be expressed exactly as binary fractions

7372781
jobs	cron
many shared web hosts allow you to set up cron jobs

7372793
inherited	subclassing
i m not completely sure i understand what you mean by subclassing to alter each other s inherited main class variables

7372860
inherited	properties
my domain model is as follows where the location class is abstract one and each inherited class conatins related navigation properties

7372863
width	height
this typically happens when attempting to set the width or height property to a display object when it is still empty before a loader has finished loading

7372863
width	height
however i remember experiencing flash runtime bugs where the object s width height property wasn t updated when it should leading to exactly this issue though i m not 100 sure it is your case

7372863
width	height
if this is the case a workaround is to directly set the scalex and scaley properties rather than the width and height properties

7372863
width	height
otherwise you can use the width and height properties of the loaderinfo object instead of those of the loader object

7372875
post	get
i am wondering the best way to go about the issue to get the title of the next post and a preview of the body summary

7372909
google-chrome	firefox
this issue happens on android and google-chrome but not in firefox

7372953
put	get
you need to look at the apache httpd documentation to figure out how to get the front-end to put the information that you need into the http request headers on the way through

7372965
post	put
if i check with firebug there is a put tab with all my parameters and the parameters are correctly spelled since if i switch from put to post on both sides everything works

7373044
pdostatement	bindvalue
the data type parameter to pdostatement bindvalue isn t terribly useful

7373122
submit	submission
one way of submission a form is by including an input element of type submit within the form which is what the web designer has done here

7373140
width	height
beware setting width and height of an object in flash will scale the object

7373187
google-chrome	firefox
but if i try to run it from the console in either google-chrome or firefox 1 will still return but then send out a message of undefined

7373195
post	get
is there really any kind of difference using post and get in this perspective

7373227
slideup	slidedown
i have this simple flyer page which uses jquery to reveal a form via two buttons that when clicked call slideup and slidedown

7373248
min	max
where min and max are functions that return the min and max element of an array

7373248
min	max
if i understand correctly it should be easy to code min and max

7373275
multiplying	subtract
instead of multiplying and dividing by powers of 10 like the other answers you can use the fmod function to find the digits after the precision you want and then subtract to remove them

7373329
ant	maven
i m converting my project from using maven ant tasks for dependency management to ivy

7373329
ant	maven
since i was previously successfully using maven ant tasks i copied my

7373329
ant	maven
this is way more than the 65 jars the maven ant tasks were previously downloading

7373355
post	get
i get this funny message when calling a fb dialog to post to a friends wall in my new app

7373362
hide	show
below is the code usedto hide and show divs

7373369
width	height
an aspect ratio the way i understand it is width to height

7373369
width	height
hence given the 3 1 requirement the width of an image can be up to 3x the height

7373480
int	chars
wait a min as per c documentation getchar returns int but see in the above code i m storing it in chars

7373480
int	chars
and also in while loop i have compared c which is an chars with eof which is an int and compiler doesn t throw any error and my program executes

7373485
cvs	svn
teamcity has a plugin for each vcs system git svn cvs etc. in general it just polls the vcs for changes and if there are changes it checks them out and builds them

7373489
int	chars
it simply means that the returned value which is an int implicitly converts into chars type

7373489
int	chars
the compiler may generate warning messages for such conversion as sizeof int is greater than sizeof chars

7373497
int	chars
what you have demonstrated is that a chars and int in c c++ are pretty much the same and c c++ automatically casts between the two

7373508
min	max
the values of min and max are stored but the values array is not

7373563
int	chars
if you want to assign an int to a chars then you can

7373585
webchromeclient	webviewclient
i had javascript enabled i tried diffrent websettings i had set the webchromeclient and webviewclient looking for javascript errors.

7373653
integer	unsigned
for example if the number was 8 and the type was a 32 bit unsigned integer then the type would be 7 which would be copied to the first leftmost byte and then the next 4 bytes would be encoded with the actual number 8 in this case

7373685
int	chars
unsigned int pnnewsize int nblockuse const chars szfilename int

7373685
int	chars
int nblockuse const chars szfilename int nline line 1040 + 0x1b

7373700
inherited	properties
you can inherited from only one prototype and then copy the rest of the properties that you want

7373703
width	height
so i m currently reading every line from the rectangle of interest into an array which leaves me with a bitmap which has correct height but wrong width

7373743
udp	tcp
with cdns you can deliver your media to multiple nodes through tcp and udp both

7373756
serializable	deserialization
most languages have really easy json serializable deserialization to native data types

7373765
pull	push
i m getting this error when i try to clone push or pull a repository in a brand new ubuntu vm i m running

7373790

7373836
button	checkbox
it looked good and seemed to work well with flash components button checkbox texfields because they are transparent

7373851
put	get
i have put an image in canvas and i want to get the rgb value of the pixels of that image when the user moves the mouse over the image

7373878
ubuntu	linux
i do all my development in ubuntu linux so i didn t notice but the data doesn t show up in ie

7373939
integer	unsigned
from â 7.21.6.1 of n1570 the x specifier interprets its argument as an unsigned integer

7374001
width	height
hi i don t want an image for my submit button so i have gone with the default submit button but i want to edit its width and height

7374030
width	height
you can change height and width with css

7374036
width	height
just use style attribute with height and width option

7374042
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome just ignores the expiration i set and firefox never loads the page

7374054
post	put
i tried to put a bufferedreader in the client code and then post a new runnable just like the server code does

7374062
put	get
i shouldn t need help with the sorting but i don t know how to get the word count from each of the text files or put them into an array

7374127
inherited	properties
if you override the virtual properties the inherited class will use everything from the inherited class

7374247
inherited	properties
attribute lookup still follows a pretty fancy algorithm making hashtable lookups those are amortized o 1 but big o isn t everything walking up longish well not so much in the case of builtins inherited chains and invoking other descriptors properties getting bound methods

7374284
hide	show
now when i click the button in form1 it hide and show form2

7374298
sorting	filtering
category filtering and sorting is also not important at all right now

7374300
peer	p2p
the issue is that the connectivity and reachability of peer in a p2p networkis transient

7374310
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari seem to support it fully

7374320
post	get
i ll post it here if i get it

7374338
put	get
then i need to get json encode out put so im doing it like this

7374370
pop-up	dialog
it s supposed to do a pop-up with the message facebook dialog are so easy

7374396
portrait	landscape
the task i m currently trying to do with uitableviewcontroller is to have one-column-cell-row in portrait mode and two-column-cell-row in landscape mode

7374416
strsplit	substr
substr would work but i would recommend looking into strsplit

7374426
udp	tcp
keep in mind that implementing udp traversal is easier than tcp

basically for an unsigned integer you write 7 bits for each byte using the 8th bit to mark if another byte is needed

7374594
accessor	properties
declared properties address the problems with standard accessor

7374621
getter	setter
so when you do a synthesize the compiler will generate your getter and setter allowing one to do class.variablename value indicating that the compiler will execute class variablename value

7374624
getter	setter
these properties are convenience methods for creating getter and setter

7374624
getter	setter
if you are writing your own setter getter atomic nonatomic retain assign copy are merely advisory

7374624
getter	setter
with atomic the synthesized setter getter will ensure that a whole value is always returned from the getter or set by the setter regardless of setter activity on any other thread

7374624
getter	setter
that is if thread a is in the middle of the getter while thread b calls the setter an actual viable value -- an autoreleased object most likely -- will be returned to the caller in a

7374624
getter	setter
if thread a is calling the getter simultaneously with thread b and c calling the setter with different values thread a may get any one of the three values returned -- the one prior to any setter being called or either of the values passed into the setter in b and c

7374626
carrierwave	paperclip
i m starting to play around with carrierwave as an alternative to paperclip

7374646
versioning	upgrade
i used the upgrade code to find out the product code using msienumrelatedproducts api but when i try to use msigetproductinfo using the product code the versioning info comes back as garbage

7374687
getter	setter
the properties is a nice feature which gives you getter and setter method automatically by synthesize and give you relief by not setting and getting the value

7374697
free	malloc
is using c allocations is okey malloc and free

7374756
hide	fadeout
this is shorter and also for first run it is better that hide target by fadeout instead of hide

7374793
google-chrome	firefox
this code works in firefox but not google-chrome

7374810
post	get
is it right to do a get or a post

7374810
post	get
a get or a post

7374811
getter	setter
however there is a property decorator in python which provides getter setter access to an attribute or other data

7374813
fadein	fadeout
fadeout fadein and delay are jquery methods

7374821
maven	pom.xml
oddly i didn t needed that in another project using some very similar web.xml and pom.xml files i m using maven

7374827
post	get
get vs post in ajax

7374831
getter	setter
with a property you have complete control on his getter setter and deleter methods thing you don t have if not using caveats with an attribute

7374840
division	modulo
the modulo remainder of division prevents that the number is higher then the number of songs

7374848
put	get
i want make some get put delete call as well so i don t want to use any function like .getjson

7374868
post	get
shorter answer is use get for retrieval and post for modification

7374869
put	get
to be a little more helpful to get a cookie-friendly date i d probably just put the string together myself

7374892
getter	setter
the property allows you to get and set values like you would normal attributes but underneath there is a method being called translating it into a getter and setter for you

7374892
getter	setter
it s really just a convenience to cut down on the boilerplate of calling getter and setter

7374892
getter	setter
in python you can define getter setter and delete methods with the property function

7374911
min	max	minimum	max
title short name long name current maximum minimum day max day min

7374917
width	height
your demo link does not work but i did some tests and it worked fine for me using chrome when you add width height of 100 to the body html elements like so

7374918
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i m writing a userscript greasemonkey which i am developing in firefox but works in opera firefox and google-chrome

7374918
opera	firefox
the script does nothing at all so there must be some syntax error that firefox can handle but opera not

7374939
google-chrome	firefox
to answer my own question neither google-chrome nor firefox support more than two values in background-position

7374948
free	malloc
the key time to use malloc free is if you want the scope of your variable to last outside of the current function

7374966
subtract	add
i don t know what the range of your samples is but if they are around the same size you can subtract an approximate average from each value average the differences and add the approximate average back on at the end

7375070
passenger	webrick
i have tested this both on passenger apache and webrick so i don t think it is the apache that is causing this

7375073
mouse	keyboard
robot class allows to simulate key strokes pressed released typed and mouse movement acting as a user using the keyboard and mouse

7375073
mouse	keyboard
when you use the robot class you define the sequence of actions to simulate mouse movements and keyboard usage

7375106
folder	directory
looks like i had all the spring jars in my app web-inf lib directory which probably was bad because they are also in red5 lib folder so they were duplicated

7375133
textview	imageview
i need to be able to change two textview and one imageview

7375172
explode	implode
create just one field with pipes as separators and implode explode results

7375174
google-chrome	firefox
update this version works in firefox but not google-chrome

7375223
mouseup	mousedown
actually looks like there s a problem with the live method for binding both the mousedown and mouseup events

7375223
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
check with google-chrome and firefox for example it works ok to me but not in opera since as far as i know is doesn t support it

7375228
google-chrome	firefox
however it seems it s not working in google-chrome but it is working in firefox

7375256
mouseup	mousedown
but i m also not sure about how the cursor css reacts to mousedown and mouseup - i have a feeling that may be limiting in some browsers a bit of fiddling got it working on mouseup but not mousedown - which seems strange

7375362
free	malloc
the thing is c has two main things going actually a lot more the heap that stores memory that has been requested with alloc or malloc in c and these require to be free

7375385
min	max
min max incr and square are called 1 91 90 and 90 respectively

7375396
min	max
so if we walk through it min is called once initialization and until the condition is met max is called each time continue condition

7375397
for-loop	loops
the second two expressions in a for-loop are evaluated every time through loops

7375415
postgresql	mysql
i have selected so far mongodb postgresql mysql drizzle riak and kyoto cabinet

7375418
accessor	properties
as far as ambiguity the lexical analysis stage has already distinguished array_init from an object properties accessor or brackets inside strings regex literals foo bar or

7375424
post	get
my idea of a solution is to code up an http server for android and ios and then get post data with ajax so i can have access to the device s internal storage

7375430
suppressfinalize	finalizer
where dispose is used outside of the context of a finalizer then there is no need for the gc to call the finalizer and therefore suppressfinalize is used as an optimisation to prevent it happening twice

7375438
int	boolean
use with primitive data type like int boolean ..

7375450
subtraction	addition
you are looking at each character in the string exactly once and for each character your are doing either an hashtable insert or lookup and an addition or subtraction and a check against 0

7375462
disk	ram
to drive this point home consider that reading a value from ram is about 1000 times faster than reading it from disk

7375490
goto	break
note that people will tell you that the goto is bad and use the break and continue statements in loops like crazy

7375527
hide	show
bind a click event for the whole document and hide the menu if it is show

7375555
int	double
conversion from â a int bâ to non-scalar type â a double bâ requested

it s puzzling me that i ve got 2 functions with http post where one breaks foreign characters and i just do self.request.post.get text to get the value in both functions

7375705
google-chrome	safari
the code that works with google-chrome safari etc.

7375730
put	get
it works fine but when i put a button or any other control on the canvas i get the same background colour included in the elements

7375766
super	implements
now i try to implements the progressbar and i am a bit stuck obviously something super simple is missing out

7375770
google-chrome	firefox
my problem is that while window.performance works for google-chrome nothing works for firefox including window.mozperformance

7375775
multiplying	add
basically is there a way during run-time to change add s return value by multiplying it by some value

7375779
width	height
how to know the width and the height of image using app-engine image api wit python someone adviesed me to use the composite function - pass your image in as the sole input image and specify the canvas size as the desired size of the output image

7375785
daemons	launchd
i have a daemons which runs from root and launchd agent which runs from current user

7375802
superclass	subclassing
you can overload the function in the subclassing but that s essentially treating that function in the superclass as an abstract function which has to be overloaded

7375847
accessor	properties
for an unmodeled properties just use a conventional accessor something like

7375858
int	boolean
i am getting the following error message arrays used as indices must be of int or boolean type.

7375866
sml	curry
in sml it s common and easy to define a function using both curry and pattern matching

7375877
libxml2	xerces
also i would recommend using a library like libxml2 or xerces if you dont mind c++ to build your soap messages if you are doing anything more complex than sending a simple pre formatted request

7375878
stdout	stderr
it looks like you are redirecting the real cl.exe stdout but not stderr

7375972
pop-up	dialog
my mbp is connected over wifi so i turned off the wifi then turned it back on while xcode is running and suddenly it caused xcode to pop-up a certificate verification dialog for the ip where my svn repo exists

7375982
folder	directory
i have a php script which arrange folder by the alphabet but it also get a blank directory for some reason

7375987
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
the computing power to even generate a list of md5 hash of sha1 plaintext is huge but it s still no harm to have the salt there to protect against such an attack

7375989
hash	md5
see examples for different types of hash including md5 and sha256 in the manual

7376004
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

after a word break match but don t capture public or private or protected then one or more whitespace chars then one or more word chars as long as the word is not void or string or int or bool

7376067
google-chrome	firefox
i should mention that this jumping bug happens in both google-chrome and firefox

7376069
qpushbutton	qwidget
a qpushbutton is a subclass of qwidget so the style rule is applied to it

7376074
richfaces	icefaces	primefaces	icefaces	primefaces	richfaces

7376144
int	double
you cannot use int or double but you can use int or double

7376146
int	double
you can t use primitive data type like int or long or double if you want to use one you can look for the wrapper class that represent it

7376163
min	max
this example shows a spectrum of jspinner sizes for various min and max values

7376174
width	height
edit also just to make note of it many js-based animation issues can be solved by giving the animated elements defined dimensions via width and height css properties

7376192
google-chrome	safari
open up safari or google-chrome right click and choose inspect element... on something you have a short-hand property on and you should see the expanded property

7376203
post	get
basically i used a firefox extension to get post and get data from a login to my school website

7376203
post	get
i think it has something to do with redirects because the first post should redirect to the right place but i cant get it to work and trying to get the location header throws a null pointer

7376256
requestfactory	gwt
having upgraded to gwt 2.4.0 i want need to enable annotation processing for my requestfactory interfaces

fadein	fadeout
the fadeout and fadein work so i know that my javascript href is working

7376267
public	protected
i need to register all implementation of an interface via structur map the problem i have is that these instances does not have the default ctor i need to inject a dependency when i want to create n instance but because hibernate need public or protected default ctor i had to have a protected default ctor like here

7376275
nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue
i have a class that manages connections with nsoperationqueue and delegate methods for that class that are actually nsurlconnection delegate methods

7376291
qcombobox	qstackedwidget
i have a qstackedwidget which holds several pages full of various qlineedit and qcombobox children

7376317
twig	smarty	cvs	svn
my choice is netbeans - crossplatform open source svn and other cvs supports many tepmlate engines smarty twig and one of the fastest full featured ides

7376382
post	get
all in all it seems like you re missing a lot of pieces so hopefully some of these resources can help you get on track mac-iphone communication with a python server apple s bonjour documentation and an answer on a related so post with some good links

7376391
nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue
assuming the nsurlconnection s are created by tasks on the nsoperationqueue that you mention you may also be creating them on some runloop other than that attached to the main thread bringing a whole sweep of thread safety issues into the mix

7376455
getter	setter	accessor	properties
if you need getter and setter to expose some instance variables or you want some automatic retain release memory management or thread safe accessor then properties are a less verbose way to automatically create these smart getter and setter

7376463
trac	bugzilla
and i looked at several bug tracking tools to go along with my repository - lighthouseapp fogbugz bugzilla trac and so on

7376484
for-loop	loops
i am not sure whether there is some convenient way to get this done or not when i am trying to do it using while loops and for-loop

hide	show
the systemtray automatically hide itself but keep it s allocated 12 pixels and only show when you tap at the top

7376514
wav	riff
stop copying before you get to the wav riff header commonly the 1st 44 bytes

7376525
dbcontext	objectcontext
the difference between the ado.net c# dbcontext generator and the ado.net c# poco entity generator is that the former creates a context based on the dbcontext and the latter creates them based on the objectcontext

7376525
dbcontext	objectcontext
in both cases you then generate poco classes and either a dbcontext or objectcontext from the .edmx file

7376525
dbcontext	objectcontext
the entity framework power tools ctp1 reverse engineers a code first model from the database including poco class the dbcontext don t think it offers objectcontext generation and the mappings via the onmodelcreating method

7376553
gif	png
they all work and recognized the files gif png xls .

7376564
range	max
other columns range from all null one value to a max of 40k unique values

7376585
width	height
height width and border are for example only

7376643
put	get
now the administration things are done time to get to the index.php to show the data i put inside index.php when i open it here s what happened

7376645
google-chrome	firefox
if you have an es2015 environment as of this writing io.js ie11 google-chrome firefox webkit nightly then the following will work and will be fast viz

7376690
put	get
for example if you put the phone on a slightly tilted turntable you will get a sine wave in the x and y acceleration readings

7376694
jruby	mri
i ve been getting in to jruby myself lately and i am extremely surprised how simple it is to switch from mri to jruby

7376694
thin	unicorn
if you want to have an app server that supports threading and you re familiar with mongrel thin unicorn etc then trinidad is probably the easiest to migrate to since it s practically identical from the users perspective

7376695
int	boolean
i don t want to read the value as int or string and then convert the value to boolean

7376714
free	malloc
if what you want is array of bar length then malloc it and free it when you no longer need it

7376745
inherited	subclassing
therefore neither the class nor any public methods beside those inherited from object may be declared final and a default constructor must be accessible to the subclassing

7376780
google-chrome	firefox
i came up with the work-around below tested on the latest google-chrome and firefox

7376789
int	boolean
for example if the result boolean doesn t come from parameter int it still compiles

7376792
hide	show
you may customize this example include the mouseover events which will show hide the panels

7376815
width	height
i am drawing a screen to the web using javascript css and html by using a for-loop to iterate through the screen width and height in intervals of 16x16

7376826
comparator	comparable
apart from the comparator option i believe it would be possible to achieve the same behavior by just making your class implement the comparable interface

7376844
128bit	64bit
the way it works is i have functions for converting strings to 64bit 128bit or 256-bit numbers where the 128bit function calls the 64bit function twice the 256-bit function calls the 128bit one twice and the 64bit one either uses strotull or manually converts the string

7376844
boost	stl
due to licensing issues i work at a big corporation far removed from purchasing or legal decision making i need to use only standard libraries gnu boost stl etc... or else it will simply take me too long to get access to the solution

7376894
clang	llvm
however you might want to check if llvm isn t headed that way with a branch considering its both a compiler and jit using clang or gcc front ends as i ve seem some topics suggesting it might be implemented

7376901
firefox	safari
in safari all works great but in firefox 6 if i leave my site and then go back using hte back button i get the javascript instead of the page

7376906
scheme	racket
racket is a functional language a dialect of scheme with an class system

i ve started few weeks ago to use node.js at the moment i m developing my simple website with node.js + express but i m looking for a module to manage a blog a simple blog articles+comments

7377009
width	height
if i understand your question you just need to use the attributes width and height from a reference of google.appengine.api.images.image

7377108
switching	screens
when i open one of my screens for the fist time there is lag but after it has been opened and i switching it runs smoothly

7377137
addition	modulo	division	addition	division	modulo
there are some interesting parts the use of the integer division that is always rounded down the fact that in vb.net you have to tell to dim the maximum element of the array so the length of the array is +1 this is funny only for c# programmers and it s solved by the -1 in the dim the + 2 addition i need to round up the division by 3 so i simply add 2 to the dividend i could have used a ternary operator and the modulo and in the first test i did it and the use of the ternary operator if in getting the substring

7377150
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
objectinputstream will read object serialized in file by objectoutputstream

7377171
portrait	landscape
my subviews have different layout when in portrait and landscape orientation

7377188
width	height
adding width 100 height 100 to the form does not change anything

7377201
division	modulo
by performing a modulo division you will find the array position of the next character

7377208
onresume	onpause
even though it is stopeed in onpause it is started again in next onresume

7377302
google-chrome	firefox
it didn t work in firefox nor in ie9 but it did work in google-chrome

7377302
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and ie9 require a proper domain to run from presumably because they are more strict than google-chrome in the way they associate the localstorate object to a domain in google-chrome it doesn t need to be a domain as such

7377318
equals	gethashcode
i use the default here but you can override the equals and gethashcode methods in class custaction to define what is a duplicate for example

7377321
alarmmanager	appwidgetprovider
to do so set an alarm with an intent that your appwidgetprovider receives using the alarmmanager

7377333
portrait	landscape
i want landscape enabled only when a button is tapped and then back to portrait when another button is tapped

7377344
tiled	gaming
i am doing this because of the wide range of stuff in which parsers are useful web development programming language interpreters inhouse tools gaming engines map and tiled editors etc

7377389
hash	md5
create a md5 hash and use it as directory

7377400
getter	setter
in the same spirit you can also share some variables between functions defining those functions inside the module scope - in this case you may not need getter and setter methods and such global functions with shared state are closures

7377425
width	height
i used getimagesize function and store it to a variable then using the 3rd index of the array i can look at its width and height

7377425
width	height
the question is how could i make an if condition to allow only 80px width and 80px height of an image for an upload

7377428
selecteditem	selectedindex
the next this is to use the selectedindex or selecteditem property of the dropdown list component

7377440
width	height
index 0 and 1 of the returned array from getimagesize contain respectively the width and the height of the image

7377458
ibatis	mybatis
so far i have narrowed my choices to ibatis mybatis and ormlite

7377475
hash	salt
there is one constant though for both files and databases never ever store passwords in plaintext but use a salt hash

7377484
pop-up	dialog
android is a multitasking environment so hiding an app does not necessarily mean it gets closed but you can do it for example by calling finish in your onstop method or even in onpause if you want any dialog including sms pop-up to kill your app

7377488
hash	md5
you d have to make sure that the password field is big enough to store md5 hash

7377488
hash	md5
remember that md5 hash are 32 characters long

7377521
notepad	textpad
on windows machine i would probably go with textpad personally i now use programmers notepad 2 however it does not support a spell checker and i don t really thinks it s better than textpad by any measure

7377564
equals	gethashcode	equals	icomparable	icomparable	gethashcode
you can think of those contraints as a form of type-classes light normaly overriding equals gethashcode and implementing icomparable is sufficient to use it in this cases

7377581
chunked	transfer-encoding
the server with this problem are sending data in transfer-encoding chunked

7377679
required	placeholder
it may be that the api still required a placeholder passphrase but i believe it will be ignored in this case

7377687
post	get
and how i must format the post to get it up to facebook i d hugely appreciate it

7377714
width	height
this should give a complexity of where k is the width or height of your grid

7377727
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in google-chrome and firefox

7377733
solaris	bsd
i d like it to work across linux bsd mac os solaris etc

7377743
post	get
how can i get total comment for each post

7377754
hide	show
let say i have 10 div s with same id now 9 of those are hidden on page on and only one is visible what i want is once a person will click the next button it should hide the 1st one and show the next just after it and so on problem is that they all have same id s so how to can i achieve that

7377782
hide	show
if you re using a next button one thing you can do is keep a count of where you re upto in the array of elements with your class hide all elements of that class and show the one with the index you re at

7377800
width	height
but you don t set width and height for this view so it doesn t match its parent s width

7377846
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i can access the above through firefox by copying and pasting the url but can t do so through google-chrome or safari

7377852
inherited	properties
any objects or data that are passed to these messages will inherited from a very loose base class or implement an interface that exposes a properties of type idictionary that is contained within the core assembly

7377861
width	height
create a texture able to contain them both plus an extra row so the texture size would be 2 width height + 1

7377872
min	max
i have 3 integer fields in my database and want to search each of them with min and max values

7377924
spaces	delimiter
in addition you probably want to throw away any spaces following those delimiter

7377932
postgresql	mysql
mysql and heroku s postgresql sometime needs code modifications when switching between the two

7377987
pull	push
if you ve set up a git repository on your own server and want to use it as a central repository to push from pull to it should be a bare repository not a normal one

7377996
implements	extends
it s possible to figure it out but the easier solution that i implements last time i wanted this was to just make the hash an attribute of my object instead of extends hash

7378013
int	double
string recipe int order string instruction double est.time

7378019
libs	buildpath
i was expecting to be able to use all the libs in the buildpath of jars-project from the projectx since it references it in the build path

hash	md5
on the systems using md5 it was no problem to have a production development dyad as the resulting hash was the same

7378971
hash	md5
i thought if hash are different they don t match like md5

7378990
hide	show
you can use the following to bind the change of the select and hide show the divs

7379026
hash	md5
you didn t elaborate on that point but if you were simply looking for a more secure algorithm than md5 take a look at hash coupled with an algorithm like sha512

7379033
post	get
this is not recommended anymore since it gives needless access to too many actions and no restrictions on the access method get post etc.

7379039

now based on this you would expect that when i print the data.frame all columns except those int will be chars enclosed in

7379096
serializable	deserialization
i thought of using annotations and reflection to do the serializable and deserialization the annotation s should help in the cases where the member name is not the same as the json key for the member s value

7379100
profiling	benchmarking
profiling benchmarking you may be surprised how fast a few 100000 strings can be iterated through and how little any amount of micro-optimizing will get you in the end

7379120
addclass	removeclass
for this just use addclass and removeclass

7379156

titlebar	window
a window or a panel without a titlebar cannot become key so it can t get the focus

7379848
int	double
math.abs and math.min both return int s when passed int s as arguments so your code is doing int division instead of the double division that you are expecting

7379850
int	double
expecting a double when using int division has to be the oldest gotcha in the book

7379854
lwjgl	jogl
lwjgl is similarly well documented but is also fairly low level and in this way similar to jogl

7379869
folder	directory
i often use a eclipse plugins to quckliy generate project directory structure for example spring plugin helps to create webcontent folder to hold web-inf contents

7379895
width	height
note that the numbers that you put as count and size in the fread call are not that important as long as those two numbers multiplied are equal to width height components

7379895
width	height
as a final suggestion i recommend that you wrap your image in a class and add member variables that define the width and height and maybe the number of color planes as well

7379914
implements	extends
i have a class gridpanel extends jpanel with a static inner class toolselectcombobox extends jcombobox which in turn has two static inner classes toolselectcomboboxmodel implements comboboxmodel and toolselectcomboboxrenderer implements listcellrenderer

7379935
jar	manifest.mf
the whole jar file and therefore the manifest.mf is read during the install operation

7379951

7379959
width	height
in case you don t have fixed width height of element

7379960
uitableview	uisearchbar	uiview	subviews

7380496
drawimage	putimagedata
if you have a properly-formatted array of pixel data the only way you can update a canvas element is by calling either drawimage or putimagedata

7380496
drawimage	putimagedata
right now putimagedata is much slower than drawimage as you can see here

7380500
super	extends
but i can t-- because all of my activities extends my main activity and if i run by super it tries to call my main activities onrestart which will crash

7380504

if you don t want to upgrade to the trunk then you can apply changes from revision 6706 to your versioning of codes but building from sources is the only option

7380674
prepare	execute
in addition to sql injection protection prepare statements offer reduced load on the database server when the same query is to execute multiple times such as in an insert loop

7380674
prepare	execute
different apis require varying amounts of code to execute a prepare statement

7380676
prepare	execute
any other code you write execute query bind results fetch results etc. would also be needed even if you didn t use prepare statements

7380718
post	get
for some of the users we query we get no results on feed or post and get partial and outdated data when querying statuses

7380718
post	get
for other users we get data when using feed but it s not all the post on the wall we have noticed the missing post are ones with photos

i mean i need the width and height to be divisible by 8

7380867
width	height
these numbers below apply to both the height and width

7381010
uiview	subviews
in a uitableview i add a uiview as subviews but only for section 1

7381044
width	height
you stated that you need both the height and the width be divisable by 8 but in your example only height is divisible by it

7381055
getter	setter
in the code shown you never invoke the view property s getter only its setter

i know we could use post but we want to get data

7381220
put	get
i ve already put a hash into the url so that when things work we will actually get the correct data from cache as far as the url goes the calls would otherwise all look to be the same

7381303
nsstring	nsdata
the main problem with the example code is that many items are encoded as nsdata objects where nsstring objects should be used ksecattraccount ksecattrlabel ksecattrdescription and ksecattrserver

7381319
min	max
bonus points it makes it evident that we are assuming min max

7381356

google-chrome	firefox
it s working in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie 8

7381501
disk	ram
also keep in mind that once ram is exhausted your program will start running in virtual memory on disk which will probably cause far more disk i o activity than the program itself so if you re concerned about disk i o your best bet is probably to make sure that the batch of data you re working on in memory doesn t get much greater than available ram

7381526
filesystems	btrfs
zfs has snapshots but is not available as a first class filesystems under linux as does btrfs which is quite new

7381526
readonly	temporary
alternatively a lvm volume can have a block-level snapshot taken which can then be mounted readonly in a temporary location while a backup is taken

7381527
disk	ram
this might be a sort of ram disk with file system or a database

7381527
disk	ram
have a smallish shell script monitor ram usage and spawn every second another process of the following as long as there is x memory left or if you want to make things a bit more complex y i o bandwith to disk

7381561
button	marquee
i m seeing the marquee once i press the place button

7381563
mouse	trackpad
i don t think what you re seeing is mouse wheel scrolling as much as tap-to-click on your trackpad

7381563
mouse	trackpad
if your mouse pointer is pointed to a different part of the document than where you typing and you accidentally brush the trackpad and your trackpad os interprets that as a mouse click then the your input point will jump to the place the mouse cursor is pointed at

7381574
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the following example works in ie 4+ firefox 4+ and safari and google-chrome in versions released in the last couple of years

post	get
instead i m using post which isn t exactly bullet proof but still a better choice than get in this case

7381844
post	get
you can still mix and match post and get data on this form using the and php super globals respectively

7381844
post	get
although i am not recommending it you re life might be easier by using which is a merge of both post and get data

7381912
post	get
trying to hide the username and password by changing the http method from get to post has basically no added security

width	height
upon further investigation today i have discovered that after the rotation the cells will resize so that they use the height of the table as both width and height of the cell

7382175
put	get
in 1.2 we had num_latest which we could put in our info dict to get the latest items

7382179

on the mac in google-chrome safari and opera both the body live and the document keydown bindings work

7383120
cout	cin
the difference is obvious is os are input output streams while cin cout are the standard input output streams

7383120
cout	cin
cin cout are instances of i o streams not synonyms

7383120
cout	cin
if you use cin cout in your streaming operators ignoring the stream they should read write to then you ll end up with

portrait	landscape
first of all you will need two xib files one for a landscape orientation and one for a portrait orientation

7384188
portrait	landscape
as for preparing for landscape or portrait views using autoresizing can work but you may need to have totally seperate xibs

7384236
express	node.js
alternatively you could look into setting up express node.js to handle streamed uploading and use ajax to update dom in this case your node.js service would run decoupled from rails - you d be connecting to it from rails via json

7384261
post	get
to get the post url

7384282
move	drag
i have a tree in flex 3.5 and i want to use the drag drop functionality but i want to let the user only move nodes not copy them

pop-up	dialog
a uilocalnotification alert dialog shown when the application is in the background just like the text message notification pop-up

7384336
mvp	presenter
in the mvp design pattern the view should not access the model directly but should send commands to the presenter by calling presenter s functions

7384348
inherited	subclassing
instead the standard way to do this simulate object inherited when only a few attributes differ between the subclassing is to do something called single table inherited

7384502
post	get
browser not saves cookies but does a post don t know why not get but it doesn t matter

7384509
width	height
about the size it is important you use setcompositionsize instead of the sprite s width and height properties

free	malloc
thou i can see that the malloc returned properly free complained saying invalid pointer

7384537
stateless	stateful
mvc which i feel is the best server side webapp technology is very nice to develop with but simply doesnt have the stateful client side niceties that sl does and you have to deal with html javascript and a stateless client

7384547
.htaccess	httpd.conf
i am trying to implement some mod_rewrite directives for a php web site i m working on and i can t get directives in the .htaccess to be used.they work fine when placed in httpd.conf so i know that mod_rewrite itself is working ok

md5 password hash is used to store passwords in non-readable form

7384555
salt	md5
it uses md5 password + salt in many iterations result starts with

7384555
hash	salt
md5pass computes password hash from given passphrase and salt

7384555
salt	md5
there are many iterations of md5 pass + salt + result_from_previous_iteration so not just md5 pass+salt as i thought

7384561

7384653
public	protected
this concept is orthogonal to access and access specifiers that is this is so regardless of the members being public protected or private

7384660
public	protected
place the code in a public protected function

7384660
public	protected
since onclicklistener is an abstract class inside yours it can access public or protected methods from the class that nest it

using the 8 bit binary i can convert to hex for my pdu string

7384936
free	malloc
note malloc has a small structure 8 bytes at the start of each allocated block of memory before the block itself if you corrupt this then malloc and free will not work correctly

7384971
union	distinct
for example the following select query uses the same table twice but because each is within a distinct scope each separated by the union keyword no table correlation name is required

7385003
disk	ram
the problem of switching to disk once ram is gone and tricks to tweak this process should already be in place

7385014
children	parent
the code should be able to do webclient.cancelasync on the parent and its children s webclient when desired

7385038
punctuation	words
mostly the most punctuation words delimiters are around a whitespace so matching on would be a close approximation as well

7385049
serializable	deserialization
i recently read a comment saying that usage of serialversionuid to make different versions of the same class compatible for serializable deserialization is no longer needed from java 5 onwards

7385051
client-side	server-side
there it states submitmode#cancel indicates the client-side validation should be omitted though server-side validation still occurs . so you will still need to stop the server side validation

7385055
getter	setter
this function acts as a getter setter depending on whether a parameter is passed or not

7385059
client-side	server-side
form processing will be a whole lot easier as you won t have to do any pre-submit client-side or post-submit server-side processing of dynamically-generated radio buttons

7385069
width	height
don t set a fixed height and width properties for your controls

7385116
maven	m2e
in the indigo release maven is already included by the eclipse plugin m2e

7385117
serializable	deserialization
however it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialversionuid values since the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations and can thus result in unexpected invalidclassexceptions during deserialization

7385119
sorting	filtering
however there is such a thing as custom binding which allows you to take full control over paging sorting filtering

7385130
width	height
for example if you use a grid a textbox and a button with horizontal and vertical alignment stretch and width and height auto the textfield and button will grow and shrink dynamically

7385146
min	max	range	max	range	min
i wish to create that date filter as a range slider with max min are static and current selection

7385146
min	max	range	max	range	min
visible output has to be always in a format dd mm yyyy and i will show it for min max and from to range selectors

7385146
subtraction	addition
and this function works well for me however if step 1day i need 1 day value in unix to make addition + and subtraction - when user moves slider

7385167
hide	show
you can consider to implement hide show or enable disable some navigator buttons based on whether or which row is selected

7385173
cvs	svn

7385233
maven	m2e
m2e is the maven integration for eclipse

7385234
equals	compareto
the problem is that your implementation of compareto is not consistent with equals which is required by treemap

7385281
min	max
the ordering parts of the enumerable interface min max sort use but that s not important here

7385315

7385393
google-chrome	safari	mp4	h.264
this works perfectly in google-chrome but because it is ogv it will of course not work on the ipad so i need to use h.264 mp4 as that is supported built in with safari but when using the stream command 1 or 3 then i get no video displayed on ipad or google-chrome

7385394
put	get
if you want to wrap words in a text you would have to loop through all relevant elements on the page get their content using .text or .html find words in the text and replace them with the html code that wraps the words and put the text back in the elements

7385398
post	get
it simply consists in redirecting after a successful post so that the user refresh results in an idempotent get to be done rather than a post

7392828
post	get
you shouldn t be sharing the same method for get post

7392828
post	get
this is also generally not recommended because mvc expects a prg post redirect get behavior so you ideally want to redirect back to an action when done

7392828

if you want a view to act like a button use uicontrol it acts like uibutton events and is a subclass of uiview so you can add a touchupinside event when user taps the view and dismiss the keyboard also dismiss the keyboard when the user taps the submit button and that should do the trick

min	max
a min and max will get you the endpoints of the sequence which also requires grouping by the county id

7396817
equals	icomparable
while iequatable t should generally not be implemented by unsealed classes since such derivation would play oddly with inheritance unless the implementation simply calls equals in which case it would be pointless the opposite situation arises with the generic icomparable t

7396817
equals	icomparable
icomparable schedulerevent x .compareto y should report zero since the events have equals times but icomparable schedulereventwithmessage x .compareto y should return a negative number since aardvark sorts before zymurgy

free	malloc
than you need to free the memory that was allocated reserved by malloc

7397003
free	malloc
as a general rule for every malloc there should be a corresponding free

7397003
free	malloc
i don t see any calls to free in your code so it s impossible to say where your problem lies but i noticed right away that you malloc some memory and assign it to readline inside of a loop yet you don t call free on readline at the end of the loop so you are leaking memory there

7397004
free	malloc
think of malloc and free as begin and end

7397004
free	malloc
any time you call malloc do what you need to and once you re done always call free

7397004
free	malloc
to re-iterate free whatever malloc returns except null

7397010
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
in general - any memory allocated dynamically - using calloc malloc realloc needs to be free using free before the pointer goes out of scope

7397013
free	malloc
you should also add free readline after count++ in the last loop to free the memory created by malloc

7397017
spaces	delimiter
use paste -d qq1 qq2 if you want a spaces rather than a tab for the delimiter

7397026
opera	firefox
it is reported to be supported in firefox and opera

7397043
free	malloc
there needs to be a call to free for each successful call to malloc

7397043
free	malloc
that doesn t necessarily mean that you need to have equal numbers of malloc and free calls in your code

7397043
free	malloc
it means that for every malloc call that s executed when your program runs you should call free passing it the pointer value you got from malloc

7397043
free	malloc
you can almost certainly get away with not free ing allocated memory when your program terminates since it will be reclaimed by the operating system but just as a matter of style and good practice you should still match malloc s with free s.

7397043
realloc	calloc
i m ignoring calloc and realloc calls

firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
gwt still officially supports 1 safari 3 i believe safari 2 support has been deprecated and maybe even firefox 2 no devmode plugin but that doesn t mean the browser isn t supported opera is supported but has no devmode either so it s not possible to provide such a feature that would work in all supported browsers

since that would duplicate the categories in each localization and in many cases only the translation change not necessarily other keys you could work around this if you use a separate lookup table plist for the localized translation of the values in the category plist

7399306
getter	setter
a property is a field in your bean which needs a public getter and setter method

7399306

7400250
getter	setter
the purpose for it is to implement getter setter on arbitrary unparented variables

7400250
getter	setter
for properties in the global or window contexts you can accomplish the goal of having a setter getter for direct references to the object

7400250
getter	setter
and it is then available in all frames created later as a global routed through the specified getter setter

7400250
google-chrome	firefox
i ve crashed firefox and google-chrome a few hundred times in pursuit of this so far by doing things like redefining intercepting modifying object.prototype.valueof tostring function.prototype function.prototype.constructor function.prototype.call apply arguments.callee.caller etc

7400258
integer	unsigned
not ok means the static analysis tool did complain -- claiming that some operand of a bitwise operation is not an unsigned integer

7400292
put	get
it s been a while since i ve used hashtable for anything significant but i seem to recall the get and put methods being synchronized

7400327

7400433
queue	fifo
you probably want to have a fifo fifo queue

7400440
temporary	tablespace
based on the fact that it works when removing the group by my guess is that mysmallts is also assigned as the default temporary tablespace for that user

7400440
temporary	tablespace
building the intermediate result will be done in the temporary tablespace and when using the group by this gets too big for mysmallts

7400447
rss	feed
yes you can have an rss feed for any site but preferably for one that you are adding or changing from time to time

7400459

width	height
also tried with specifying the avassetwriterinput settings to quicktimemovie width height bitrate

7400480
int	chars
nothing in c is done below int eg when adding two unsigned chars even before the addition the operands are converted to int according to the default promotions

7400480
int	chars
in the last line first u1 and u2 are converted to int then the + operator is applied to obtain a int value and then that value is converted back to unsigned chars of course the compiler can use shortcuts

7400528
stdout	stderr
the standard method of logging in my experience is to use either the stdout or stderr streams

7400528
stdout	stderr
you re moving the standard output stream stdout which is used by cout to output.txt in write mode and you re moving stderr which is used by cerr to error.txt also in write mode

7400599
put	get
you have to put all needed elements into the parcel and get it from it later

7400605
rss	feed
it s a little tougher with static sites to get an rss feed because you can end up duplicating content unless you re prepared to add another tool to your site generation or do a little bit of programming and probably in a language different from the ones you re currently using.

7400605
rss	feed
but if you just write an rss feed on top of what you re doing right now you ll obviously be duplicating some or all of the site content which isn t ideal

7400605
rss	feed
so i d suggest that what you need is a way of taking your content and transforming it into an rss feed -- or vice versa

7400605
rss	feed
when i created a static-content site with an rss feed the way i did it was to start with the rss feed

7400605
rss	feed
then i wrote some code that would take the rss feed and create my html articles from it -- in my case i used xslt to transform the rss into a series of html files but you could use any technology you want

7400605
rss	feed
then whenever i wanted to add an article to my static site i d edit the rss feed just to add a new article with a new date etc

7400605
rss	feed
to it and there are tools around for various platforms for creating rss feed manually like this. then i d run my code which would burn my html articles so i d always end up with static articles and an rss feed in line with each other and only one source copy of the content

7400605
rss	feed
there s also tools out there for various platforms that can automate or semi-automate generating an rss feed from a bunch of stuff on disk which is a way of approaching the problem from the other direction

7400605
rss	feed
my answer therefore is that unless you re prepared to add another language or tool apart from css html and javascript to your repertoire there s no very satisfactory way to add an rss feed to a static site

7400616
decoder	encoder
or create own encoder decoder functionality

a friend tipped me to calculate crc32 hash also and concatenate with md5 to make collision possibility to zero and store it in binary 20 that way only 20 bytes would be taken as index instead of 255 currently varchar 255 set as url column data type

7403167

that way collision would also be avoided while keep low load on ram and disk space by storing 4 bytes for each row instead of 20 bytes md5+crc32

because c is a chars and not an int

7403783
int	chars
during the body of the loop the chars are mapped to the int 0..9 for the purposes of indexing the array n

7403783
int	chars
chars in c can behave like int when involved in arithmetic by being converted to their ascii int representation

7403790
int	chars
0 denotes a chars value which can be silently converted to int and the result is usually the ascii value of the chars 0 which happens to be 48

7403792
int	chars
for example you could define a string 012345 probably read from an external file and compute for each chars c- 0 which will give the int 0 1 2 3 4 and 5 respectively

7403820
int	chars
c is likely a chars which also has an int representation and in c it can be converted implicitly

7403820
int	chars
0 is the chars zero and a convenient feature of numeric chars is that they are laid out sequentially in their int representations

7403820
int	chars
so now that you know each chars has an int representation and that the number chars are laid out sequentially you can convert a chars to its int representation using simple subtraction

7403877
int	chars
in c 0 is an int whose value represents the digit zero as a chars not the value 0 which would be the null chars

ireport	subreports
using ireport v4.0.1 with jasperserver v4.1.0 i m trying to find a syntax for linking subreports to the main report that lets me test it in ireport then deploy to the server through the repository browser

7413216
ireport	subreports
the default syntax for subreports in ireport for the subreports expression is something like

7413216
ireport	subreports
that s great but unfortunately it then edits the file in ireport to save this change which means you can no longer run the report in ireport without manually re-editing all the subreports expressions - this makes the process of testing and deploying to the server really painful particularly when there are multiple subreports in a report

7413226
put	get
i see that i can put cookies to webview but i dont know how to get them from browser

7413253

sscanf with the x format specifier wants an int pointer not a chars one

7413358
integer	unsigned
x matches an unsigned hexadecimal integer

7413365
pull	push
ideally you d want to initiate a pull of data from the device when it receives a push notification from your server

7413381
int	chars
as the number now is an int you can use it in string context and extract the first two chars which will be the first two digits if the number is not negative

7413396
google-chrome	safari
you could use an rgba value for the border-color but then you get dark corners in google-chrome and safari i think where the borders overlap

7413489
hide	show
of course show hide of it depends on your app logic

7413500

7413548
width	height
the cons are that you can t user without knowing the height and width of the div you re going to create

7413555
width	height
but while i can specify the tilegroup to use 100 width and height and set the number of rows and columns to 3

7413580

7413648
getter	setter
do your class with all the fields and getter setter that you need

7413648

7413675
svg	vml
the reason it works with ie is because it transparently detects the browser and switches to drawing the graphics using vml instead of svg

7413683
getter	setter
this can be a problem when we try to force all co- authors to go through the getter setter because those method do some conversion checking or bookkeeping stuff

7413683
getter	setter
you d have to create an annotation and the annotation processor code to ensure that it is a compile time error if the field is used outside of it s getter setter method

7413692
getter	setter
in the worst case they remove your getter and setter and just put in a public field instead

7413692
getter	setter
then private fields are of course only accessed via setter and getter

7413692
getter	setter
you could move the data into a different class and use your getter and setter to access the data in the other class

7413711
margin	height
as soon as the element is visible it has a margin which is not included in the height animation

for-loop	loops
can only reiterate in this case you re pushing back an empty vector in a for-loop and accessing the data within the same loops using i so you must change it to

7414209
put	get
when doing a put or delete with an if-match header in case the etag sent by a client indicates staleness rather than just returning a 412 i d like to return the whole up-to-date entity including its new etag in the http header so the client does not have to perform another get round trip which they otherwise would certainly do - in my use-case at least they d do in probably 100 of the cases

opengl-es	glreadpixels
opengl-es you can t you could draw the texture to a framebuffer and use glreadpixels though

spaces	delimiter
these unnecessary characters usually include white spaces characters new line characters comments and sometimes block delimiter which are used to add readability to the code but are not required for it to execute

imho a chars 1 code is better than an int for employee types

7415659

method signatures distinguish between boolean and int but otherwise they are treated the same

7415785

a custom uiviewcontroller is allocated and pushed onto a uinavigationcontroller s stack

it may be possible by using libav aka ffmpeg library.you can decode the .flv file into some other formate and use it

7415847

7416076
sorting	grouping
i think that after sorting yo may use regular expression to find your grouping transition

7416093

the clientsocket class is extended by thread and implements runnable i ve also tried just extends or implements

7416130

then git pull and git push will do the right things

i am quite certain that this will only work with native types like string int float double boolean etc but not enumerations

7416183
int	chars
for instance the string defined by chars s hello world in c and a c statement like int debug 1 outside the main would be stored in initialized read-write area

7416379
inherited	subclassing
while it is most often used to specify subclassing it is not a mechanism to configure inherited relationships

7416379
super	abstract
since jaxb is attempting to instantiate an instance of the abstract super class foo.bar.base it appears as though your xml message does not contain enough information to specify the correct sub-type to be unmarshalled

7416409
nsstring	nsdata
you could convert nsstring into nsdata with the rest of your code is ok

7416417
ienumerable	icollection
edit normally we should be able to use ienumerable instead of icollection as it is supported with nhibernate but it seem not supported in ef

7416442
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
we had a similar problem with our google+1 buttons disappearing in google-chrome only no problems in firefox ie safari

7416456
google-chrome	safari
did some research and i have found out that you should have something like this to have updatepanel working with webkit which is the engine of safari and google-chrome

7416456
google-chrome	safari
you can check many links on the internet about updatepanel not working in google-chrome or safari also i believe i saw similar questions here in so.

i have implements by my way i have create inner class which extends the overlay class to draw the path route on map

7416600
width	height

jerkson	jackson
jackson has an official extension for scala jackson-module-scala and another one jerkson

lxml	beautifulsoup
sgmlparser has convert_entityref method but instead of deprecated sgmlparser i would recommend using lxml or beautifulsoup which have better parser api

7416762
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that google-chrome uses div s as lines break separator internet explorer uses p and the mozilla firefox uses only

7416787
post	get
to work around this one has invented the post redirect get pattern

7416787
post	put

int	chars
it s not an int it s chars varying 10

7416852
postgresql	mysql
depending on the database you use there may be a built-in driver ms sql access etc. or you may need to use a 3rd party one mysql postgresql etc.

7416923
folder	directory
ok so i would solve the problem by generating these classes in one directory and then move it to their original destination models folder

7416940
post	get
then i want to access the post and there is the problem post is a sub json if i can say that and there is x post so i can get a big string with all the code and i don t know how to get only the id for the first post then the id for the 2nd post

7417011
margin	text-align
i tried using text-align center margin auto but it won t come off the left side

7417076
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
what happens is that i d like to have two kinds of openfiledialog savefiledialog the default ones from windows api and custom ones with special features that suits my business scenario

7417076
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
i need it like this because i m also using third-party controls devexpress for example and i need that when any of the devexpress controls calls openfiledialog or savefiledialog the same business rule should be applied to define if the default or custom dialog will be shown

7417076
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
so everytime that anyone in my application scope calls openfiledialog or savefiledialog this business rule should be triggered to find out the correct dialog to show default one or custom one

7417078
hide	show
you can implement a show hide in your views that will deal with this

7417445
setinterval	settimeout
you should be using settimeout instead of setinterval

7417450
width	margin
when inspecting element i can see what looks like padding being that it is between the width of the box and the content but setting padding to 0px and margin to 0px does nothing the list starts further into the header than it should

7417453
setinterval	settimeout
change your setinterval by the settimeout function

7417460
inherited	properties
the properties you are setting are common to all through since they all inherited from uiviewcontroller

7417498
accessor	properties
as for thatâ s a combination of the prefix increment operator ++ an array literal defining an array with single element that is itself an empty array and a properties accessor called on the array defined by the array literal

7417514
opera	firefox
i m assuming you haven t overridden all of those stylesheet definitions for your list so you could include a so-called reset stylesheet - the one from eric meyer is very popular - or further inspect what is formatting your list by using tools such as firebug for firefox or dragonfly for opera

7417537
post	get
obviously for get i could use geturl url target but i can t find any similar functions for post

7417541
superclass	subclassing
i would recommend that you create a new uiviewcontroller subclassing that implements tabtitle and use that as the superclass for each of your custom controllers

7417664
getter	setter
is the ability to use them as getter and setter in classes which was always a nightmare to achieve before javascript can be used in the same way but they do both act almost identically from what i ve seen

7417666
sproutcore	cappuccino
so in other words with sproutcore and cappuccino and other full-blows mvc javascript frameworks you can let your client do what it does best render and display html css and javascript while leaving your server to worry about what it does best retrieve store and update data

7417666
client-side	server-side
i have written an article about the differnt approaches between server-side mvc and client-side mvc here

7417726
versioning	upgrade
if you use visual studio 2010 to upgrade your application from asp.net 2.0 or asp.net 3.5 the tool automatically adds a setting to the web.config file that preserves the behavior of earlier versioning of the .net framework

7417745
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
try setting the width with the view port meta tag and make sure the html body and map div are all set to 100 height and 0 margin padding

7417767
pull	push
you might as well come up with a schema where you can pull the data from the service to your data store let users play with it then push the data back when they re done

7417775
put	get
- how can i get the string url so i can put it in here

7417802
post	get
your raw json you get back is simply a dictionary and the post are an array held in that dictionary

7417837
mkmapview	mkannotationview
i want to use a custom image as a map where each pixel is considered the coordinates much as mkmapview uses a google maps map together with mkannotationview

7417848
accessor	properties
you may hide that properties by making access modifiers private for get and set accessor but the base properties must be virtual or abstract to be overriden

7417876
screens	mdpi
but there is three folders drawable-hdpi mdpi and ldpi the buttons im creating need different sizes for each folder correct so when u use for example small screens phone the buttons wont be too big

google-chrome	firefox
it functions the same in multiple browsers google-chrome ie firefox so

7417893
libjpeg	libtiff
you have to link with libjpeg and libtiff to get it working

7417899
inherited	properties

7417987
post	get
when i get information from a post form the html form adds slashes before random characters

7418002
mdpi	hdpi
your normal sized image should be optimized for mdpi 160dpi while the ldpi image is 25 smaller 120dpi and the hdpi image is 50 larger 240dpi

7418002
mdpi	hdpi
so even if you only have a hdpi image and no ldpi mdpi android will scale it down on devices with low ressolution displays and it should look passable

7418076
ddms	adb
use the file explorer of the eclipse ddms plugin or the adb shell command from your android platform tools to browse and delete the file system on your device

7418119
src	attr
i ve tried setting the attr src tag for the cropbox id but it needs to execute the php code inside first

7418159
required	placeholder
as i said this is only required for browsers that don t support the placeholder feature anyway

7418207

i m using nhibernate for some time and pretty often when i need to map parent-child collection in which the children are fully dependent from its parent i map these associations as collection of components

7418417
equals	tostring
tupleconstructor provides the constructors only canonical applies some other best practices with regards to equals hashcode and tostring

7418441
filesystems	fat
and notice that a fat filesystems doesn t support symbolic links so it doesn t know how to make it on that fs and it explains the operation not permitted error

7418442
stdout	stderr	stdout	fflush	stderr	fflush
stderr and stdout are 2 different streams and normally will be printed when fflush

7418470

7418494
datalist	datarepeater
eval or bind and fellows are executed usually when you bind a data-boundable control like datalist datagrid datarepeater and so on because these commands eval ... are applied against the datasource you are binding

7418501
put	get
the problem is i try to the get the data i put into the intent after the picture had been taken but it always says that the intent is null.pointer.exception

7418518
cpu	processors
i am guessing that even reading from shared data in openmp causes some parallel overheads as depending on processors architecture if different cores have their own cache... it may be necessary to refresh the cache to ensure that no other cpu has modified the data before reading

7418530
int	double
i have tried using double floats and int

7418537
button	checkbox
the capturing works well for all other widgets button checkbox ... but my glwidget remains blank to the normal user it is fully responsive

7418743
getter	setter
and i want to use setter and getter functions but i cant access them here is my code

7418745
hide	show
however the principle to make it work is to hide your page from view in css or with inline styles as the css will still have to load then once everything is ready in javascript show it all again

7418745
hide	show
that is because they hide the page the javascript loader loads then once the rest of the javascript has finished it hide the loader and show the page

7418773
put	get
then to get the number put in use

7418778
filtering	grouping
this leads me to the question of if i can filtering or grouping results based on the highlighted snippets that are returned

using instrumentation within xcode to profiling my code i always get a leak here

7418975
google-chrome	firefox
according to the discussions they did create it for firefox which it works in some people have commented it doesn t work in google-chrome so you might be looking at a solution that needs to target different browsers your question doesn t specify if it must work in google-chrome just that you were using it

7418975
mouseup	mousedown
this is what they are using to select the unread messages it looks like they are simulating the mousedown and mouseup events on each item

7418981
translation	localization
i am using .resx files and localization to translation all the hard coded text

7419000
ubuntu	linux
i m using a linux ubuntu 10.10 vm

7419003
trie	dawg
what you do instead is you build a trie data structure out of the dictionary or if you re really buff you build a dawg -- a directed acyclic word graph -- which is a sort of compressed trie.

7419003
trie	dawg
once you have a trie dawg it becomes very inexpensive to test every word in the dictionary against a given rack because you can prune out whole huge branches of the dictionary that the rack cannot possibly match

7419003
trie	dawg
don t forget that of course you only have to compute the trie dawg once if the dictionary is not changing over time

7419003
trie	dawg
you can optimize the memory usage by building a dawg out of the trie

7419034
put	get
also when i click on link that wants to open new tab or window i want to get the url and put it into iframe.src

7419044
submit	submission
you can also have other community users submit bugs a number of different ways including an open submission on your fogbugz site as well as via an xml interface so that your app can have a bit more control over things

7419048
google-chrome	firefox
if a user pass is already stored for the site google-chrome firefox will just silently handle tack on the authentication header

7419099
trac	bugzilla
trac and bugzilla would be a good place to start

7419138
hide	show
so making this script was suppose to hide the images from it and only show the ones that are there for the category it is on but also be able to see the other as it scrolls before they disappear

7419139
invokelater	invokeandwait
in order to ensure that you read the value after it is returned by the joptionpane the simplest thing you can do here is to change the invokelater call to an invokeandwait call

7419157
post	get
this is useful for both get and post ajax requests

7419170
next	except
except now i still see the no data message next to the button from the previous no data query

7419178
min	max
ie get count min max etc for last 15mins 1 hour 1 day 1 week 1 month etc

7419194
range	minimum
i thought maybe the mvc range attribute would allow me to enter only 1 value to signify only a greater than test but no luck there as it insists on minimum and maximum values

7419230
put	get
the data label wont be above the line itself i took the higher angle of the point and put the data label in higher-angle 2 - so it will be in the middle of the higher angle - i succeed to get the higher-angle but didn t succeed to get the position on graph in pixels relatively

7419242
gridview	rowdatabound
when populating the gridview you should populate each dropdownlist in the rowdatabound event

7419282
versioning	upgrade
the server then has complete control over who gets the upgrade and who doesn t part of the phone-home could include the current versioning and that would allow you to enforce the only x of clients get upgrade capabilities

7419319
slider	jcarousel
you can simulate a fading effect even though jcarousel knows only to scroll the slider

7419330
range	max
you can t store a number bigger than what your underlying data type could hold so that fact that the range attribute requires a max value is a very good thing

7419356
opera	safari
note opera 9.3 and safari 3 do not support url values

7419361
hide	show
you can make your code more dry by making this into one function - pass it an array of all the selectors and the one you want to leave out then on click loop through that array and if it matches the one you want to leave out show it if not hide it

7419399
pop-up	dialog
if an unhandled exception occurs somewhere in an external dll visual studio pop-up a dialog box that lets me select the path of its source code so that it can show me the exact line which caused the exception

7419411
width	height
you could also just change the height and width to make something bigger smaller

7419465
mockito	easymock	easymock	powermockito
powermockito is intended as an extension of both easymock and mockito

7419465
easymock	powermockito
from the horse s mouth powermockito is a framework that extend other mock libraries such as easymock with more powerful capabilities.

7419465
mockito	easymock	easymock	powermockito
in any case there is no easymock equivalent to expectnew and neither is there one in mockito either - that s exactly the hole that powermockito is trying to fill

7419468
chown	sudo
if you aren t the owner you ll need to do sudo chown to fix that

7419468
chown	chmod
or maybe you accidentally did a chmod or chown

7419484
bazaar	svn
i could make this a daily cron job which just does svn up and commits all the svn changes within a day into the bazaar branch in one single daily commit

7419491
google-chrome	firefox
the main point of jplayer is so that you can use html5 with flash fallback so you should leverage the html5 of firefox and google-chrome not depending on it falling back to flash

7419491
mp3	ogg
firefox doesn t support mp3 on html5 they support ogg which is better anyway

7419491
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
use .ogg for google-chrome and firefox .m4a for safari and .mp3 for ie

7419524
post	put
i put my .h and .cpp file in a pastebin post

7419642
printf	strtok
i am trying to work with strtok and strcat but the second printf never shows up

7419662
width	height
this means you have to resize your buttons according to fill the available space fill the available width of the display with 4 buttons and scale their height so that the aspect ratio of the graphic stays intact

7419662
width	height
first we create an outer linearlayout that fills the entire parent width the entire screen width and adjusts it s height depending on the content

7419665
folder	directory
i have a directory dst directory which has files and folder in it and i have src directory which also has files and folder in it

7419665
folder	directory
the same applies for some folder moving a folder and merging the contents with the same folder in dst directory

7419665
folder	directory
solved i solved my problem by using distutils.dir_util.copy_tree src dst this copies the folder and files from src directory to dst directory and overwrites merges where neccesary

7419683
put	get
i set monument.infobox right there in the loop and if i put a breakpoint on the line marked breakpoint 1 i can see that monument.infobox changes on every loop iteration yet when i get to breakpoint 2 which doesn t get executed until the event fires it references the last infobox i created not the infobox that i attached to that pin when attaching the event handler

7419731
carrierwave	paperclip
i m looking at changing to paperclip carrierwave or dragonfly for file uploads or maybe a rails 3 compatible maintained version of attachment_fu

7419747
accessor	properties
one of the appealing features of properties is that the properties accessor take care of retaining and releasing the objects they point to

7419765
folder	directory
my app needs to store a lot of small videos and images in a cache folder for this reason im using the standard sdcard android cache directory

7419788
int	chars
in which case you can convert a chars to its equivalent int value as follows

7419788
int	chars
if your chars array already holds the int value for each digit then you can of course skip the conversion and jump straight to the base-10 maths

7419829
getter	setter
it relates to getter setter method names

7419841
filesystems	fat
since the filesystems is more than likely fat or fat32 protecting it permission based way would be more convoluted

7419851
carrierwave	paperclip
i ve used both paperclip and carrierwave and if i were you i d go for carrierwave

7419865
spaces	delimiter
no as it is evident there are two delimiter comma and spaces

7419865
spaces	delimiter
that leaves me with chararray of the other string with the other delimiter spaces or comma

7419895
put	get
i always get errors such as no route matches put galleries 1 photos

7419971
int	chars
from what you have said in the comments it sounds like you want to cast the chars to int and write over the buffer that way

7419994
fgets	feof
on success a stream resource is returned which may be used together with the other file functions such as fgets fgetss fwrite fclose and feof false on failure

7420009
width	height
the specification for bordercontainer is that you must set a height on top and bottom regions and a width on left and right regions those dimensions are fixed and the center expands to take the remaining space

7420036
mouse	keyboard
i d like to keep this as a visualstudio task executed by a developer me with a monitor keyboard and mouse randomly and many times a day

7420057
jstl	taglib
global.jsp also includes jstl so you ve got access to standard taglib

7420060
width	height
the new onmeasure sets the width and height to be as large as possible

7420150
int	chars
another way would be to form an int from the two chars in a simple expression and switch on it

7420162
width	height
maximumsize width height where width max size you want the label to be and height how many pixels you want it to wrap

7420212
superclass	subclassing
class method in the superclass the method in the subclassing hides the

7420218
strdup	malloc
the structure has two char pointers which when used are created with either malloc or strdup

7420287
strcpy	strdup
the simplest way to achieve that would be using strdup strcpy since the former is nonstandard

7420320
hide	show
however when i execute only the top table is able to show hide not the second one

7420386
post	get
i am able to get the selected value in the post back

7420410
width	height
your super.onmeasure widthmeasurespec heightmeasurespec uses the passed in values i would think you would want these to be the actual measured width and height

7420473
for-loop	loops
i guess you could add another for-loop on the target_alphabet inside the existing for-loop and check for the characters not be same with a small if condition and continue the inner loops if same or break if not

7420494
post	get
i was able to do a get request but can t figure out how to work around the fact that google places has a nested parameter to post into

7420536
post	get
then when users post back this html you use it to pass to wkhtmlpdf and you get pdf

7420537
margin	height
you can perform the same type of operations for the height to get its margin border and padding

7420544
nsmanagedobject	nspersistentstore
basically you need to make sure that your background thread doesn t use the same nsmanagedcontext it must create a new one from the same nspersistentstore and doesn t pass nsmanagedobject between threads only pass object ids back to the ui thread not the objects themselves

7420551
joomla	phpbb
this is an example where you replace the text password with your own password and root with the username in most cases this is root the database names are joomla server and phpbb

7420553
packets	multicast
i want to create a socket for receiving icmp6 packets - to be more precise neighbor solicitation messages that are sent to multicast address ff02 1 ff00 0000 104

7420603
google-chrome	firefox
the login process works perfetly in firefox and google-chrome

7420608
mouseover	mouseout
i can t exactly put the finger on the problem in your code most probably it fails because mouseout event for link fires before mouseover event for the menu

7420628
ssl	https
unfortunately i can only post 2 hyperlinks so you ll have to swap the http protocol with https to see how each player renders under ssl

7420638
selecteditem	selectedindex
if multi-select is not enabled you can simply use the selecteditem and or the selectedindex properties

7420672
put	get
if i put my ip i get the same response but works if i put my host name

7420726
range	minimum
the simplest way to do this is to compute a box with a minimum maximum latitude and minimum maximum longitude and use between to exclude everything outside of those range

7420739
puts	gets
when ajax gets back from making the request it has all the html code of what goes in the window it creates a new div element and uses document.body.appendchild to add the element to the document and puts the html code into the div tag

7420813
viewflipper	horizontalscrollview
below the viewflipper i have a horizontalscrollview which contains textviews which acts as a navigation bar

7420860
geronimo	jonas	jboss	jonas	jboss	geronimo	jboss	glassfish	glassfish	geronimo
there s a rich choice of open free full java ee servers available check out glassfish jboss geronimo or jonas

7420884
mouseup	mousedown
you re not far off with your mousedown event handler but probably better to catch mouseup as this is the event that will fire when they have finished selecting

7420885
postgresql	mysql
last but not the least i will be using either mysql or postgresql as the backend database but would prefer the approach to be db agnostic - if possible

7420897
width	font-size
i m using sass scss and want to create a function mixin which will figure the max possible font-size for a container given a dynamic width

7420897
letter-spacing	font-size	letter-spacing	fontfamily	fontfamily	font-size
i set it to 12.3em which would be 123px relative to the font-size of the tag but that could change depending on letter-spacing fontfamily or other aspects

7420917
inherited	properties
doctrine supports inherited so you should create two different entities that share a common parrent say abstractvote which defines all properties

7420936
min	max
however i would not be concerned with the data being sparse in this case - there are relatively few columns involved especially if you have only one min max per weekday per product

7420939
many-to-many	one-to-many
imo things can get a little confusing when dealing with entities that have a one-to-many or many-to-many relationship

7420950
post	get
i can t seem to get the variable post name to work

7421058
unicorn	webrick
6 run unicorn -e production or rails s -e production if you re on webrick and visit root url

7421104
google-chrome	firefox
i noticed that in ie all versions if i press enter with invalid input for some reason both the keypress and blur events are fired i suspect it s the alert box but it doesn t do this on firefox google-chrome and it shows two of the same alert box

7421104
google-chrome	firefox
edit in firefox google-chrome i now noticed that a second alert box appears when i click anywhere after i try to validate with enter

7421112
nsxmlparser	nsurlconnection
the program read xml file using nsxmlparser with nsurlconnection

7421129
fadein	fadeout
i have a large block of html that needs to be replaced which includes fadeout fadein transitions

7421167
post	get
the funny thing is if i copy the form into a local mamp installation and run it i get post

7421190
getter	setter
the reason you re getting a warning from the analyzer is that a getter method is not required to actually return the exact same object as what you passed in to the setter

7421190
getter	setter
in short never assume that a getter returns the same object you passed to the setter

7421212
gif	png
this matches the lower quality of a gif or an 8-bit png but because you re not using those formats you should use imagecreatetruecolor docs instead

7421214
cpu	processors
should i just look for more than one cpu core and how do i detect that or maybe the processors speed or total system memory

7421233
firefox	safari
i see a memory leak in all broswers that i ve tried ie safari firefox

7421261
width	height
the above plot can also be generated with sectorchart although this plot is primarily intended to show varying width and height of the data and isn t fine-tuned for plots where you have fixed-width sectors and you want to highlight directions and data counts in those directions

7421266
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn	bazaar	cvs	cvs	svn
it is a generic solution thus it works with most popular version control systems such as cvs svn bazaar mercurial git darcs and some others

7421303
google-chrome	firefox
anyway current versions of google-chrome and firefox do not have this upper boundary

7421303
opera	safari
however opera and safari are still in the old days

7421303
google-chrome	firefox
then again if you are testing older versions of ie firefox or even google-chrome then you ll run into the 4kb limit as well

7421391
superclass	subclassing
you can t cast ordinary pointers between incomplete subclassing and superclass either

7421393
google-chrome	firefox
modern versions of firefox and google-chrome do this natively - they cache images and code whenever they can

7421412
free	realloc
freeing memory with free or realloc doesn t mean at all that it is returned to the system

7421441
prepare	execute
if you want to execute the same query multiple times with different parameters use prepare statements

7421454
lxml	elementtree
that would require using the elementtree or lxml modules instead

7421461
children	parent
this can be done but rabbitmq doesn t do it automatically you need to manage the lifecycle yourself by wrapping the children messages in a parent message

7421546
post	get
once i finally found the time to get back on here and look up the referenced post it had been updated to say that the fix was no longer needed

7421554
int	double
stick with double values and use a double-precision sin function or scale the number to a value less than about 6 int digits before converting to float

7421559
calloc	malloc
you can use calloc instead of malloc to clear the allocated memory to zero

7421564
memset	malloc
you will need to do a memset after allocating memory using malloc

7421564
calloc	malloc
since calloc sets the allocated memory to 0 this may take a little time so you may probably want to use malloc if that performance is an issue. ofcourse one most profile their usage to see if this really is a problem

7421605
redmine	trac
i am looking for something similar to trac or redmine but i would also like subtasking my tasks as well

7421606
accessor	properties
then in the vm the properties that was changed steps through that class inpc as part of the set accessor and this time propertychanged is not null so the propertychanged method is invoked

7421606
accessor	properties
for the result properties however inpc is not raised that properties doesn t have inpc invoked by the other properties s set accessor

7421612
jar	war
as a result i ve added the slf4j-api.jar 1.6 jar to my war file bundle

7421630
width	height
unfortunately the ipad screen and the iphone screen don t have the same proportions ipad s width height ratio is 0.75 and iphone s is 0.66

7421676
width	height
by default the width is set to 320 points and the height is set to 1100 points

7421742
google-chrome	firefox
it works in ie but does not work in firefox or google-chrome

7421785
hide	show
see this code sample on showwindow or sendmessage which tells an external window to show or hide itself

7421786
fileoutputstream	objectoutputstream
and then use a basic fileoutputstream to output since as i understand it the objectoutputstream is used to serialize a object to binary and does not have inherent support for json

7421828
hide	show
how to use the showwindow api to hide and show a form

7421840
post	get
once i isolate my new problems i ll post an edit and possibly close this question if i get my application functioning as intended

7421893
maven	pom.xml
maven will compare the local pom.xml s timestamp stored in a repository s

7421894
google-chrome	firefox
i copied the relevant code and css with some tweaks to the theme and it works great in firefox google-chrome ie9

7421916
rsa	aes
those are security protocols that use cryptographic algorithms like rsa and aes

7421926
width	height
again the data sizes almost correclty when the grid is created then changing the column width within the grid does not resize the row height as the item renderer adjusts to its new width

7421926
width	height
smaller width column some renderers have hit max height and are creating scroll bars the last renderer is still using the measured height of the label

7421971
memcpy	strcpy
to make this work for suitably loose definitions of work you would need to use either the strcpy or memcpy library functions

7422000
calloc	malloc	memset	malloc	memset	calloc
if you happen to have a requirement for a newly allocated block of memory you can call memset after calling malloc or you can use calloc instead of malloc

7422025
width	height
as mentioned by others setting height or width to x means x of the container and not of the background-image

7422035
hide	show
you may notice some white squares i just made a quick edit in this picture to hide the directories and images as i can t show them

7422054
free	malloc
using malloc free is discouraged in c++ and so i was wondering

7422064
google-chrome	safari
somehow i had the same issue always in google-chrome but not in safari

7422067
free	malloc
the code was tested with a large linked list about 6 millon nodes each 16 bytes in sizes against a naive malloc free scheme and performed roughly 15 faster than that

7422081
clang	llvm
i m using apple clang version 2.0 tags apple clang-139 based on llvm 2.9svn

7422088
range	max
in this case the complete dataset can be retrieved by setting all the range to the max values

7422147
post	get
that will get you only direct child li s with a class of post that are direct children of a ul that is a direct child of a div with a class of bloglist

7422183
decoder	encoder
in addition to the baseline specification the encoder and decoder support packbits modified huffman and ccitt bilevel encodings fax jpeg-in-tiff per tiff technical note #2 and deflate compression schemes can handle images with 16- and 32-bit integral samples and 32-bit floating point samples and can read and write tiled images of all supported data types

7422184
postgresql	mysql
however client server database engines such as postgresql mysql or oracle usually support a higher level of concurrency and allow multiple processes to be writing to the same database at the same time

7422184
postgresql	mysql
your best bet is to pick a few like sqlite postgresql mysql and see the performance implications of each by running some tests which simulate common scenarios you will encounter in you application

7422212
pop-up	dialog
you can use that to render a facebook pop-up with the share dialog inside.

7422224
lapply	read.table
lapply flist function x assign x read.table x

7422237
free	malloc
if you like malloc free you can use

7422349
apache	nginx
i run nginx for static content and as a proxy to apache mod_wsgi serving django

7422349
apache	nginx
i have example.com and test.example.com as proxy to apache django and static.example.com which serves all static files directly through nginx

7422368
mongoid	mongomapper
there is a maximum document size of 16mb currently for mongodb mongomapper or mongoid will make no difference to this

7422414
bluej	jcreator
i have not used jcreator too much but have used a little along with bluej and notepad ++

7422459
width	height
i would like to know if it s possible to force the camera to send video in landscape mode width height

7422459
portrait	landscape
what i want is to have the mobile in portrait mode but i want to show the video in landscape format of course it will be resized to fit in the screen as your screen is on portrait mode

7422459
portrait	landscape
i think of some possibilities and maybe to force the camera to record in landscape mode even if the phone is in portrait mode

7422467
fileinputstream	objectinputstream
on the other hand encapsulating a fileinputstream directly inside a objectinputstream works without any problem

7422489
post	get
the get or post method of the

7422526
switching	screens
in my game i m trying to switching from versus ai to versus human opponent within a single game viewcontroller according to user input from a previous menu screens

7422539
stdout	stderr
note that this only opens kernel handles so you would need to use _open_osfhandle and _fdopen to connect stdout stderr to your console

7422574
post	get
i m building a website where i want to pull a pages wall post which is publicly available you don t need to be logged into fb to see its contents however when i try to get the data using the open graph protocol using

7422646
getter	setter
the only solution i can find is to make getter and setter like and

7422665
folder	directory
in the project properties pydev - pythonpath source folder tab i have my java source directory listed

7422754
gmail	hotmail
now i want to know which email client gmail hotmail outlook the user opened the newsletter in and clicked the link to the website page

7422791
getter	setter
you can bind observers to change in these attributes basically that is what the getter and setter provided by backbone are for

7422792
hide	show
i have used jquery-loadmask plugin on my app it show processing animation when ajax call starts and hide animation when call finishes

7422867
folder	directory
the folder also has a web.config directory for itself

7422868
google-chrome	safari
the safari google-chrome debuggers allow you to see event listeners associated with any dom object

7422911
mousemove	mousedown
however you can certainly detect a mousedown event on the mask and use that to cause the window s mousemove event to adjust the position of the underlying image

7422911
mousemove	mouseup
you would then use a mouseup event to end the drag the window s mousemove event would no longer affect the position of the image

7422912
viewmodel	caliburn.micro
with caliburn.micro i d like to know the pros and cons of exposing an ef4 entity as a property of the viewmodel a technique discussed here and here

7422912
getter	setter
this allows me to avoid writing getter and setter for every field see onecustomer below

7422919

mouse	keyboard
users will not have access to a keyboard or mouse

7423025
std	ostream
a i don t know anything about ollydbg but in all cases std ostream makes it s own copy of text before foo returns so any changing of the variables after the call will not affect the output

7423078
inherited	properties
i tend to have my viewmodels inherited from dependencyobject and ensure that they are constructed on the ui thread which poises them perfectly to handle this situation - they have a dispatcher properties that corresponds to the ui thread s dispatcher

ivar	subclassing
did you subclassing uitableview or do you mean this is an ivar of your uitableviewdatasource

7423263
min	max
it is more that the annotation value of min and max is of type long so it can not express any number with decimal places

7423264
getter	setter
getter or setter if you want

7423285
post	put
in order to deal with a large request body in a http post or put relying on httpservletrequest.getcontentlength is not a good idea since it returns only integer values or -1 for request bodies 2gb

7423296
accessor	properties
a private accessor the properties is declared in a nameless category called an extension so that it is private and not visible to outside classes

7423298

because i have to install multiple versions of python on multiple oracle linux servers which are built via a kickstart process i wanted to build a python rpm for our yum repository

7423300
put	get
like many rpm newbies i get the build part but i don t really grok what happens at the end of rpmbuild and what actually gets put into the rpm file other than the files you specify in files and then what actually happens when you do the rpm install

7423337
hide	show
at this point the idea is just to allow the user to tap one image to reveal what is under it and then when they tap another image it briefly hide the second one and then show both again

7423341
gif	png
jpeg gif and png upload just fine this problem seems to be only with tiffs

nhibernate	queryover
from what i can read in the nhibernate docs i might be able to solve it by adding some a hint to my queryover chain requesting an explicit lock

7423396
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
you should add the uinavigationcontroller instance to the uitabbarcontroller and then add a table view controller to the rootviewcontroller property of the uinavigationcontroller instance which should make your life a lot easier

7423396
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the uitabbarcontroller and uinavigationcontroller instances are created programmatically and added to the window

7423396
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
this will add the detail view uiviewcontroller subclass to the uinavigationcontroller instance s view hierarchy for you and animate the transition

7423411
onkeyup	onblur
i would attach a onkeyup and onblur event handler to the various text fields

7423433
vsto	add-in
the vsto runtime supplies the com wrappers around iextensibility2 that is ultimately what excel exposed for add-in functionality

7423433
vsto	add-in
you have to have vsto installed for your add-in to work in excel

7423433
vsto	add-in
however if your add-in dll exports other functions that other apps might use and they don t involve vsto i +think+ you could just drop that dll on a machine without vsto and it d still be usable

7423488
dictionary	map
map aka dictionary are key value pairs

7423512
rss	feed
i m making an app that needs to be able to read an rss feed offline

7423524
google-chrome	safari
i m getting some parts of background not changing color properly in google-chrome and safari

7423553
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox both give similar errors that the page isn t re-directing properly in a way that will never complete - a redirect loop

7423586
hide	show	width	height
if you want to handle show hide of imm virtual keyboard window from your activity you ll need to subclass your layout and override onmesure method so that you can determine the measured width and the measured height of your layout

7423586
hide	show
now you ll be able to handle imm show hide window events

7423592
typedef	struct
to check for the java null in objective-c i can use kcfnull which is a typedef to some struct as far as i can remember

7423639
ddms	adb
i deleted adb file 0 kb without extension and ddms ran ok again

7423656
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
uinavigationcontroller pushes through two uiviewcontroller then a uitabbarcontroller your third

i am getting undefined as a value using the code below when i try to get the value of a textbox after a post

7423731
udp	tcp
put both udp and tcp servers on different threads

7423733
udp	tcp
you can use both tcp and udp sockets in this manner

7423739
inherited	properties
the basic idea of the oo and this is overly simplistic without going into massive amounts of inherited polymorphism etc is that you group together a collection of properties about a specific entity and methods that operate on a specific entity into a single class

7423763
width	font-size
the default width based on the parent font-size

7423763
google-chrome	safari
this solution has a known issue with webkit google-chrome safari browers

7423834
min	max
that seems awkward since every range-type response carries with it the min and max

7423834
min	max	range	max	range	min
so a question that takes a 1-10 range would be a row in integerresponse with min 1 and max 10

7423844
ubuntu	debian
probably would run it on ubuntu debian machine

7423844
postgresql	mysql
also would prefer mysql over postgresql based on my experience level with mysql

7423866
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
you could add the uitabbarcontroller to the app s window and then add the frontpage uiviewcontroller on top of it

7423871
width	height
alternative way you could attempt the same operation are to assign the value directly note the data property if memory serves me correct is height width depth format so

7423878
remoteview	appwidgetprovider
the basic foundation of an appwidgetprovider is that of a broadcastreceiver so you can create an intent with a custom intent myappwidgetprovider.action_next that will advance your cursor or index for your list or array to the next item and within onupdate render the remoteview to that you want to have display your data

7423901
getter	setter
the dot syntax is just a shortcut for calling getter and setter that is

7423901
getter	setter
you should generally only use the dot syntax when you re using getter and setter

7423909
maven	m2e
that way it s not resolved by maven but can be read by m2e

7423909
build-helper-maven-plugin	pom.xml
that way build-helper-maven-plugin add-sources would be called in eclipse without having you to change your pom.xml

7423918
for-loop	loops
when a for-loop executes it takes the name you give it and binds it in turn to each object in the iterable while running loops

7423941
superclass	subclassing
when nslog comes across the format specifier it sends a description message to the object that should should replace the token this is implemented in the superclass nsobject and can be overridden in the subclassing to get the desired output

7423964
post	get
i know how to get data sending requests with querys but i don t know how to send a post

7423982
google-chrome	firefox
turns out the following worked just fine for me in ie9 google-chrome 13 and firefox 6

7423991
width	height
if the parent layout has width height of fill_parent changing it to wrap_content might do the trick

7424010
children	parent
now i need to write the spouse sibling children grandchildren parent and grandparents function

7424014
versioning	upgrade
now when the time comes to upgrade to a later yii versioning you will need to bring your class in sync with cactiverecord again

7424018
uiview	uitouch	uiview	subviews
perhaps another helpful answer would be if you do get co-ordinates from a uitouch event then want to use this to center an image on these coordinates what would be the code you would use within a uiview subviews within a uinavigationcontroller based iphone app that would center the image properly..

7424040
macports	homebrew
you could save yourself a lot of trouble by installing a complete solution from a third-party distributor like macports or homebrew

7424067
ilist	icollection
i would like my news and post objects to have an ilist icollection comments property

7424075
rss	feed
i have an application that store rss feed in a sqlite database and it s ok

consider that if you save the .xml file you have to parse it every time for example when you want to show your rss feed into a list

7424105
folder	directory
the code below would not work even though i had the file in my fixture directory under the app folder

7424115

7424224
google-chrome	firefox
the effects work in google-chrome and firefox but not ie

7424226
google-chrome	firefox
and i have no problem with it working on google-chrome or firefox it has worked on every browser i have tested it on it also comes with really good instructions

7424272
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works correctly when downloading the file with firefox google-chrome and ie but not with safari

7424292
width	height
you also need the geo-spatial information the coordinates of a reference pixel say the top left pixel corner and the scale the geographic width and height of the pixels and this information is not stored in the file

7424298
min	max
the database connection pool fairly configurable min max sizes growth rates etc

7424316
google-chrome	firefox
good luck with that to establish a rule if you re a browser vendor especially given the recent disappearing of menus bars etc on google-chrome and then firefox and maybe other browsers that may indicate that vendors are chasing a goal of fullscreen display i just press f11 if i want to and want my addressbar back but that s another story and that they will likely be reluctant of losing 20px horizontally

7424334
post	get
i can give out the full trace from the browser as well but i don t want this post to get too wordy

7424359
qevent	qwidget
from the other widgets you would either need to installeventfilter on them too or just reimplement the qwidget event qevent event function in your main widget and look for those events there

7424364
children	parent
using the parent as a key to the hash and using hget key field for a particular child or hkeys key for all the children

7424405
put	get
i am currently writing a java application to retrieve blob type data from the database and i use a query to get all the data and put them in a list of where the columns are stored

7424412
onresume	onpause
you could have a base activity that tells your alarmreceiver service that is in the foreground during onresume and that it is in the background during onpause

7424416
min	max
reading more carefully i see you did mention min max and average

7424420
width	height
next for the subsequent images right bottom of this first image using the width and height of the image i would find out the coordinates where the next image would be placed

7424431
g++	gcc
so i took the answers from here and wrote a tiny benchmarking program and threw it at gcc similar results would be expected for g++ i think at -o0 at -o1 he optimises everything away and my benchmark is broken

7424448
ssl	https
it needs to be configured to handle ssl traffic and direct the requests to your app http and https

7424448
apache	nginx
here you can use apache or nginx

7424448
apache	nginx
passenger sits as a plugin in apache nginx to handle requests through to your application

7424448
apache	nginx
the article shows you how to set it up for pow and nginx but setting up for apache and passenger isn t too dissimilar

7424449
hide	show
why don t you just put the show more content in it s own div and hide and show that instead then you can just make the top level div height auto

7424484
width	height
when you scale to a certain height width the image size can vary far too much for our needs

7424507
apache	nginx
make deploy just reset nginx apache etc

7424519
visualvm	jstat	freebsd	linux
the problem i m trying to monitor some home made java applications on my freebsd server this should apply to linux servers as well using visualvm and jstat but i can t get visualvm to list the processes on the server even after i forwarded the assigned and random jstat ports in my firewall and can see a connection being made using sockstat

7424527
visualvm	jstat
once the two tunnels were open i opened visualvm and right clicked on the local machine on the left side and chose add jstat connection

7424531
sorting	filtering
the problem occurs when i enable all the bells and whistles such as paging sorting filtering etc

7424531
filtering	grouping
it looks like it puts the grouping by filtering sort data in an eventargument post variable

7424537
min	max
basically i m trying to find the max value for step 1 and the min value of step one as well as min max for step 2

7424541
chunked	transfer-encoding
chunked is not a valid content-type although it is a valid transfer-encoding

7424564
post	get
i can see that the csrf token is being passed in the ajax get but i don t know why it would matter anyways since it s a get and not a post

7424603
google-chrome	firefox
it is the object in the top right it looks perfect in google-chrome but in firefox it is not lined up

7424606
setinterval	settimeout
you can make an anonymous function and call it immediately except you use the settimeout function instead of setinterval

7424606
setinterval	settimeout
note that depending on the behavior you desire or in some cases for performance it can be better to use settimeout over setinterval

7424609
min	max
it groups time by step then finds the min and max for each group

7424633
hash	salt
and a salt a publicly known value stored along the hash distinct for each hash password and entering in the password hashing process

7424633
hash	salt
the salt prevents an attacker from efficiently attacking several passwords using precomputed hash tables

7424637
ant	maven
try ant or maven

7424651
int	chars
unfortunately the year is surrounded by three chars and then followed by 5 int

7424651
int	chars
so i would remove sea or another string of three chars at the beginning and the string of five int at the back and be left with 2001 in a new column titled year_id

7424692
post	get
i made a facebook application that people use to share links from my webpage to their walls and now i need to get back a list of the post made through it during a pediod of time from sep

7424732
width	height
i ve made sure the left cap width and top cap height of the 2x image is double that of the normal image which is what i m setting in code but it doesn t work

7424753
rss	feed
using objective c you can parse an rss feed or call an api on a remote site if you have access to that api which returns a json xml to your app

7424763
ssl	https
then as long as you are submitting to an https page the data should be safe without needing to encrypt it first the message itself is encrypted using ssl in this case

7424784
int	boolean
is usually either bitwise-and on int arguments or non-short-circuiting logical and on boolean arguments

7424799
pydev	virtualenv
you really have to add the paths of the base interpreter when configuring the virtualenv interpreter in pydev in the command line when you start that interpreter and do an import sys

7424806
qmodelindex	qabstractitemview
if you haven t already done it you should redefine the qabstractitemview indexat function which returns the qmodelindex at a given position in the view

7424822
int	double
you should assign your variables as float or double to save the correct value instead of using int

7424867
google-chrome	firefox
i checked the relevant css all hand-coded via the google-chrome browser s web developer tools google-chrome s version of firefox s firebug and couldn t find anything relevant

7424889
spaces	delimiter
the following function segments the source string using spaces as delimiter then recognizes and cleans up your alt and src attributes by not appending spaces while assembling the result

7424892
children	parent
change your nesting from a vertical parent with horizontal children to a horizontal parent with vertical children however this opens up possible vertical positioning issues so i don t favor this option

7424894
stdout	stderr
system will not give you the stdout or stderr of the application in its return value

7424900
min	max
if your processor has a fast instruction for absolute value as the x86 does you can do a branchless min and max which will be faster than an if statement or ternary operation

7424912
width	height
you can use specific width and height for laout_width layout_height as in layout_width 150dip

7424987
margin	font-size
line-height is relative to font-size you can t go any lower than that unless you declare negative margin

7425028
textview	imageview
each view item contains several textview s and an imageview

7425028
textview	imageview
the imageview is set with an image downloaded from the net using a separate asynctask thread so i can display the listview with textview items first whilst the images appear as the thread downloads them

7425072
rss	feed
first of all you want to find an rss feed you can find some of espn links here once you have an rss url all you have to do is type it between the quotes in the following string

7425072
rss	feed
the url provided is used to get the current weather which is not what you want but all you have to do is change that to the rss feed url you want to display

7425086
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
i have also see that someone say override getview in adapter and add onclicklistener to the view i don t know it will work or not on earth but why onitemclicklistener can not work

7425155
filtering	grouping
if you need to do filtering after the grouping use having

7425172
viewdidload	dealloc
load the cache in viewdidload and release it in viewdidunload and dealloc

7425215
google-chrome	firefox
edit i guess this bug is slightly different from the one in the question since it does occur in firefox ie google-chrome everything

7425239
int	chars
i m writing a small command-line program that reads two floats an int and a small string 4 chars max from stdin

7425257
folder	directory
in few words what i would like to do is to do not change public aaa directory and files on the remote machine and thus to do not track those with git on my local machine so that when i deploy with capistrano those folder on the remote machine are untouched

7425296
firefox	safari
i can t cut the actual video to seven seconds and use the loop function within the video tag as firefox and mobile safari don t support it

7425306
google-chrome	firefox
internet explorer google-chrome mozilla firefox

7425421
ubuntu	linux
the os is linux ubuntu and i do not use ide

7425425
google-chrome	firefox
all these images can display only in ie but the other browsers like mozilla firefox google-chrome

7425474
width	height
graphicsdeviceservice intptr windowhandle int width int height

7425493
google-chrome	firefox
however if your primary objective is to hide google-chrome firefox ie i don t think it can be done using white-hat methods

7425521
division	multiplication
when writing c++ code when i have to do division by a constant k from inside a loop i have often been able to squeeze out some gains in performance-critical code by defining outside the loop and using multiplication by ki inside the loop

7425522
google-chrome	firefox
everything works well in ie and firefox but on google-chrome is very laggy like it was loosing frames

7425528
decimal	ieee
i ve read a few texts and threads showing how to convert from a decimal to ieee 754 but i am still confused as to how i can convert the number without expanding the decimal which is represented in scientific notation

7425530
width	height
so the width and height of the tabs should be set to the size of the browser

7425536
hide	show
i don t know if this is related to your problem but i was running into some issues using only inputmethodmanager.togglesoftinput when devices would sometimes get out of sync and hide when i wanted to show and vice versa

7425536
hide	show
i ve had some success by taking advantage of the fact that while imm.showsoftinput won t show a keyboard imm.hidesoftinputfromwindow will reliably close one so when i want to show a keyboard i now call imm.hidesoftinputfromwindow followed by imm.togglesoftinput and use imm.hidesoftinputfromwindow by itself to hide one

7425536
onkeyup	onkeydown
and the keypresses get reported via the view s onkeyup and onkeydown methods

7425576
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested your site with google-chrome and firefox and i don t see any problem

7425598
width	height
the min-height and min-width for ie is the height and width but if you put width and height to your style other browsers will fix your div to height and width specified

7425608
decimal	ieee	addition	multiplication
converting a number from a decimal string to binary ieee is fairly straight-forward if you know how to do ieee floating-point addition and multiplication

7425608
decimal	ieee
now going backwards ieee - to decimal is a lot harder

7425637
post	get
according to this post controlling number of downloads on amazon s3 you can get the number of file downloads via the cloudfront api but it cant find any reference to this on the amazon site

7425675
mouseleave	mouseenter
i have a set of 3 that i need to change the class of each on mouseenter mouseleave and click

7425751
fast-forward	merge
so pay attention to the fast-forward merge that git uses by default don t forget to clean-up the history of branches you are about to merge that way into public branches

7425755
button	checkbox
i have made a simple paypal button generator with a checkbox and jquery to display form fields if checkbox is checked

7425756
filtering	grouping
as far as usage of these operator goes one possible approach would be to grouping all your sequence operator together same as linq queries where your sort of create a pipeline through which the collection elements gets processed one by one and then in the end if you need you can create the list from resulting seq as the list is created at the end of all the filtering mapping take etc work on seq and when the final data is ready you convert it to list

7425762
g++	gcc
the error message is from ld not from gcc or g++

7425762
g++	gcc
the gcc and g++ commands are a drivers that invokes the compiler the linker and other tools.

7425789
post	get
i am using this code in function.php to get post views count

7425851
keydown	keyup
1 i wonder whether it would be better to only move your character on keydown and stop him on keyup

udp	tcp	udp	rtp	rtp	rtsp
udp tcp rtp rtsp mms blocking non-blocking should i use to stream the live and constantly changing video to to my web client

7425931
postgresql	mysql	case-sensitive	case-insensitive
some databases oracle ibm db2 postgresql etc. will perform case-sensitive string comparisons by default others case-insensitive sql server mysql sqlite

7425943
free	malloc
if you only need to store the last list you should free the old memory in arr before malloc ing the new space

7425943
free	malloc
at the first set of data you don t have any existing malloc but it s always safe to free a null pointer so simply set the pointer to null at the start

7425948
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have not been able to repeat the bug on any other configuration including windows7 ie9 ie8 ie7 last 2 simulated with ietester windowsxp with ie8 firefox google-chrome safari etc

7425958
min	max
then i accessed max min stp and val property in user control s view model to perform my logic

7425959
width	height
if you have empty div tags with requirements for min height width then perhaps you should use absolute positioning in css instead of keeping the div tags in the document flow

7425960
free	malloc
you re also leaking memory because you re not calling free on that you get back from malloc and you re losing track of what you read in every time you assign a new value to arr

7425967
width	height
the following query should give a result set that includes one row for each image that has greatest height or greatest width compared to all images and it will have the id and table name in the row along with the height and width

7425967
width	height
since the maximum height and width may not be from the same image there can t necessarily be just one row in the result with a single image id and table source

7426023

my assumption was that the integer used as a constructor parameter would have been promoted to an unsigned int and been resolved but this is obviously incorrect

7430973
primefaces	icefaces
i am confused about icefaces primefaces or use jsp with yui dwr

7431022
int	double
i would assume the problem is that an int could just as easily be converted to a double

7431022
int	double
i know of no specifications in c++ that dictates an order of preference for implicit casting so when the compiler sees an int that could go to double or unsigned int it views the call as ambiguous

7431024
int	double
an int can be converted to both a double and an unsigned

7431086
post	put
it s important to put rewind_posts otherwise post loop will not work in other templates

hide red box layer update the position show it again

7431468
disk	ram
be aware that some data types can use more space in ram than on disk compressed format

7431468

so you can get bigger results for constants ram format than for table columns disk format when testing the same value or row of values vs

7431497
stdout	fflush
try fflush stdout

7431503
width	height
probably something similar going on with the scrollinglabelitemrenderer as the label probably doesn t get its width validated when it measures itself the first time thus sets the wrong measured size which the grid accepts and uses as row height

7431534
entities	entitymanager
i don t really want to turn on query cache because there are other entities in the same entitymanager that i don t really want cached

put	get
in your case i generally put functions and classes that i might want to import inside say native.some where i can easily get to them

7431570

but then i get the script code and only the script code â only the thin shim that interprets arguments and starts everything running by passing those to a main or go function as parameters â and put that inside of a scripts directory

7431574
min	max
depending on rnd min max and the width of int number of retries may be o 1 it does not increase with increase in number of elements or it may be worse than that

7431610
inherited	properties
by setting the width on the to inherited you can use the overflow properties to set the overflow behavior of the element

7431610
width	height
with the value scroll all of the element s contents will scroll in both x and y directions if the height and the width of the contents overflow that of the box

7431649

you could use the intersect method to get all the items they both contains

7431744
intersect	contains
edit so after looking at it it seems items is an objectcollection which doesn t contains intersect

7431775
min	max
same problem applies to floor rent max min conditions

the result is a private static reference to a jtextarea inside a scrollable panels inside a windowbuilder structure

7431800
hide	show
i need to show only 30 rows at a time and hide the remaining rows

7431800
hide	show
while dragining clicking vertical scrollbar it should show corresponding rows and hide the other rows

7431800

ie if one clicks on upper scroll button it should show one more upper item and hide one lower item and vice versa

7431810
ffmpeg	libavformat
i want to use the rtp data structures rtpmuxcontext in libavformat rtpenc.h provided by ffmpeg s libavformat however they don t seem to be available with the following install

7431827
width	height
for example i want to display the current x y width and height of the map rect but i don t know what events should i handle

7431874
width	height
if you want it to actually get smaller than the specified width height or the original width height of the image you need to do some scripting

7431874
width	height
this means you can hook up the resize event of the browser and reset the width height of the image equally while resizing

7431908
outputstream	inputstream
trigger a delegate â œdidresolveinstanceâ and it will set the inputstream and outputstream values

7431908
outputstream	inputstream
after get ting values for inputstream and outputstream it will call â œopenstreamâ method to open the input and output streams

7431933
super	self
this will automatically call because self inherits from super

7431945
superclass	subclassing
then you simply provide further implementations in each subclassing overriding the superclass method

7431945
superclass	subclassing
then when you need to call the method from the superclass you simply use and the correct subclassing method will be called instead

7431966
entities	entitymanager
clear detaches all entities managed by the entitymanager so is detached too and trying to persist a detached entity creates a new entity

7432002
inherited	properties
you can inherited your viewmodels from a baseviewmodel which can have a protected properties returnurl

7432030
stdout	stderr
you may also swap the stdout stderr streams i

7432030
stdout	stderr
stdout becomes the new stderr and stderr becomes the new stdout

7432045
width	height
look carefully at how the width and height are set in the following code

7432052
mouseover	mouseout
if you d test for a mouseover on the tooltip from within the mouseout of the link you could prevent it

7432088

just upgrade to latest versioning of mysql2 gem

7432162
inherited	subclassing
using inherited employee can be a subclassing of person

7432183
cobertura	checkstyle	maven	cobertura
i would recommend you instead use maven as your build tool and add the cobertura findbugs pmd and checkstyle plugins that will produce reports whenever you compile your code

7432202
outputstream	inputstream
let the point to a servlet url which gets an inputstream of the pdf and writes it to the outputstream of the response

7432202
google-chrome	safari
more hints can be found in this question how do i print an iframe from javascript in safari google-chrome

7432204
getter	setter	tostring	getter
the getter would call tostring on the decimal value stored and the setter would do the conversion back from string to decimal using decimal.parse or similar

7432285
width	height
2 use this code snippet to get the width and height of the screen in pixel and the decide by yourself what code you execute

7432356
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in most cases your google-chrome extension will work seamlessly in firefox and safari

7432356
firefox	safari
the service is still in beta trial and firefox conversion is working better than safari one

7432356
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i can t fully disclose what s our technical solution but this being an so answer i can add a few details we have re-developed a full javascript api stack that mimics most of google-chrome extension apis for safari and firefox

7432356
google-chrome	safari
safari 5.1 just introduced a popup corresponding to google-chrome s browser_action but we have already an alternative solution that works for previous versions

7432356
firefox	safari
we also provide a way to bring webapps to firefox and soon to safari

7432356
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
without pushing you towards our solution i might add that the time to fully cover the google-chrome api on both safari and firefox is probably not worth it - unless you plan to convert several extensions

7432388
getter	setter
as of a proper name for that type of construct well i have never seen your particular construct in c++ but if you consider other languages that is the basic concept of a property in c# where you can make the getter public and the setter private

7432392
google-chrome	firefox
all other browsers ie9 firefox google-chrome etc etc worked but not ie8 and below

7432418
folder	directory
many of these problems can be solved with a simple grails clean or if even that does not help try to delete the .grails folder in your user directory and run the plugin installation again

7432422
jobs	cron
i ve added the manage.py cron because its what you run to tell the chronograph function to look for jobs that need running

7432496
hash	md5
i can t use md5 sha hash etc

7432533
ubuntu	debian
i have 2 computers workstation with ubuntu and python 2.7.2 and debian lenny vps with python 2.7.2

7432593

indeed i misread the word width as height

7432658
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
- supported in ie 5.5+ opera and safari 4 and google-chrome verifed please check before downvoting

7432739
for-loop	loops
in this situation you want to use a for-loop instead of a foreach loops

7432762
udp	tcp
as of now apache synapse supports http s mail pop3 imap smtp jms tcp udp vfs sms xmpp and fix

7432792
google-chrome	firefox
if you open this site in ie then open it in google-chrome or firefox you will notice the gray space on the left hand side

7432816
postgresql	mysql
actually this was one of the many reasons we switched our main database from mysql to postgresql

7432835
gentoo	ubuntu
i did some additional checking and it appears that if i can get the software working with libudev then it should minimally compile on ubuntu slackware and gentoo which would be a really nice benefit

7432860
width	height
using the birt zoom options scale the document to fit height but it doesn t fit width because it first renders the html then apply the zoom

7432879
getter	setter
a hybrid approach to which i do sometimes fall back is to design my service model classes with getter setter for these dependencies - getdbadapter and setdbadapter

7432879
getter	setter
but at least the presence of the getter setter methods explicitly demonstrates that there is a dependency and allows me to mock it out or to provide non-default implementations

7432943
chunked	transfer-encoding
when using http 1.1 chunked encoding which means that the response has a transfer-encoding header do not set the content-length header

7432974
persistent	transient	instances	transient
however if the data is not transient and needs to be persistent so that work can carry on after an instances crash and by crash i mean something that terminates the instances or otherwise renders it inoperable and unrecoverable then your data must not be on the root volume but should be on another ebs volume which is attached to the instances

7433042
rss	feed
it is still possible to access the rss feed of the public pages

7433062
implements	extends
extends your controller with class zend_rest_controller instead of zend_controller_action and implements its methods for your rest android client to consume from

7433080
children	parent
instead of creating parent children and grandchildren at a time i want to create parent first then child and grandchild together.my code is

7433095
hide	show
source show hide the console window of a c# console application

7433115
int	double
however when the default tag is used it sorts only alphabetically by int or by double

7433122
helpers	actioncontroller
you don t have to manage view yourself there is an actioncontroller helpers called view renderer it does your job for you all you need to follow is its naming convention i.e if your controller name is bookcontroller then its view file should be located at views scripts book boo.phtml

7433162
printwriter	bufferedwriter
alternatively you could wrap your bufferedwriter in a custom printwriter class and only use the println methods for your index file logging

7433189
put	get
even if i put the calls to nav.viewcontrollers in a separate method which is called from the main thread i still get 0x0 nil

7433195
keydown	keyup
send a keydown event too not just keyup

7433306
requestfactory	gwt
i am building an app with gwt and appengine using requestfactory

7433337
stdout	stderr
this should keep stdin stdout of do-something in your terminal und redirect stderr to my pipe which is read by error-handler

7433351
wav	caf	wav	aiff	aiff	caf
based on what i read so far avaudioplayer only play aiff wav or caf and none of those are compressed

7433374
uiview	subviews
then make instances of this new class objects and add this object s uiview as a subviews using at the proper location on the screen its bottom

7433385
hide	show
i have a tabbar application where clicking on a tabbar item i should show a camera overlay view but it should not hide the tabbar camera overlay should just fit into the tabbar viewcontrollers just like behind the tabbar view

7433414
folder	dir	folder	directory
i should have a dir object which is the root folder and inside that one i should have an array of directory on each directory i could have another array of directory and so one.

7433418
filtering	grouping
i am trying to check for people in a certain range - let minage and maxage corresponding for age grouping with minage 18 and maxage 24 meaning i am trying to filtering out the people aged between 18 and 24.also datatype for dob of member is string

7433432
post	put
first you ll need to put those post vars into an array instead of splitting them up

7433440
yslow	pagespeed
also during your development when it comes to application optimization you might want to check out yslow and pagespeed as plugin tools for firefox firebug to determine the root cause of any latency issues

7433455
jar	war
you may check if the jar is in your war ear library directory or if the jar exists in jboss s lib dir

7433504
cldc	midp
looking at the connected limited device configuration cldc 1.1 and the mobile information device profile midp 2.0 specifications it appears that the java.text package does not exist

7433571
nexus	artifactory
now that i have that out of the way i suggest you use a maven repository manager like nexus or artifactory

7433571
nexus	artifactory
what artifactory and nexus do is create a network wide repository structure for third party libraries

7433571
versioning	upgrade
we have no idea if the foo project even supports this older versioning or if we got the buggy 1.3 and should have upgrade to versioning 1.4 back in the hoover administration

7433599
width	height
first query is what you have to get to get the max height and width

7433599
width	height
primaryid 4 5 from secondary_images match with the max height and max width of the previous query

7433666
svg	vml
fortunately however ie does support a language similar to svg called vml and there are a number of javacript libraries that allow ie to use both canvas and svg by converting them to vml

7433669
onclick	onmousedown
rather than use onmousedown i would just have the function in the onclick just make sure it returns false at the end of the function which i ve included

7433744
jasmine	qunit
don t overlook something like qunit or jasmine to unit test your javascript

7433754
httprequest	httpresponse
as we all know the httpapplication object holds objects regarding the requested page httprequest and the page where we are supposed to be redirected httpresponse

7433756
put	get	int	boolean
there s also get put extra methods for other data types like boolean int etc

7433793

i know php can output js - trying to just do something like in the php - but wherever i put that i get some syntax erros due to how the sections are broke up btwn the else

7433824
for-loop	loops
i have a for-loop with an anonymous function inside and in the function i want to access the current loops iteration

7433831
slideup	slidedown
for example for a 3-line div the effect results in an initial slidedown of let say 5-lines and then akin to a effect of slideup adjusts itself to the appropriate 3-lines

7433847
folder	directory
i want search in a directory for multiple pattern for example that result shoud return all files and folder that matched with my pattern

7433873
jar	war
it looks like the issue might be that your war doesn t have a dependency for your ejb jar defined

7433873
jar	war	jar	manifest.mf	war	manifest.mf
it s best to define a class-path entry your war s meta-inf manifest.mf for your ejb jar files if you have not

7433884
vbscript	vba
constants that are predefined in vba but missing in vbscript

7433893
uitableview	uisegmentedcontrol
i would suggest placing the uisegmentedcontrol in a separate view on top of the uitableview rather than in the tableheaderview

7433905
put	get
is there anyway to get more ram or to put your project onto an solid state drive

7433912
for-loop	arrays
i agree with hobbs...if you want to take many inputs like that you can use a for-loop and an arrays like this provided you are taking inputs from stdin

7433920
gridview	detailsview
one way to do this is to have a detailsview that is linked to the selectedvalue property of your gridview

7433920
gridview	detailsview
you can put the detailsview in the popup and it will display whatever was selected in the gridview

7433920
gridview	detailsview
see the controlparameter in this datasource looks at the id of the row that was selected in the gridview and uses that to populate the detailsview

7433924
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i try changing the frame in viewdidload and viewwillappear but nothing seams so work

7433925
post	get
verbs get head post

7433928
width	height
call the setpopovercontentsize animated method on your uipopovercontroller object and that will set the height and width of your popover

7433984
g++	gcc
the version of my g++ and gcc is 4.4.5

7433984
post	put
i am not sure i should put this question in a new post but i think currently it is better to follow the old one

7433995
int	chars
i think i almost understand what the problem is simplifying it a lot even if i speak about chars and enum they all are int and then the overloading is ambiguous

7434035
put	get
i put debug info in each destructor of my classes so after i close the dialog i normally get

7434077
mouseover	mouseleave
for the solution i have seen this question my mouseover mouseleave doesnt work and i have tried all the suggestions but nothing

7434088
int	chars
there are implicit conversions for both enum - chars and enum - int

7434088
int	chars
here there is implicit conversion for enum to int and so it is the one favored by the compiler over the one to chars

7434088
int	chars
compiler tries to convert from myclass to chars and finds that not having a user defined conversion operator chars both user defined int and simpleenum may be used

7434088
int	chars
myclass to int via user defined conversion myclass to simpleenum + implicit conversion simpleenum to chars

7434108
portrait	landscape
valid settings are 1 portrait 2 landscape

7434119
put	get
there you can just load some more items from wherever you get them put them into your adapter and call it s notifydatasetchanged -method

7434147
google-chrome	safari
this happens in google-chrome and safari but no other browsers

7434148
versioning	upgrade
you can either upgrade to the latest versioning of helios or better yet indigo or add the update sites

7434157
dao	facade
view dao facade service etc

7434185
int	chars
alternatively you might like to rethink why you have a function that has separate overloads for int and chars perhaps that could be redesigned as well

7434186
setinterval	settimeout
because of the nature of requestanimationframe you should never queue animations using a setinterval or settimeout loop

7434186
setinterval	settimeout
if you continue to queue animations via setinterval or settimeout while animation is paused all of the queued animations will begin playing when the window tab regains focus

7434189
width	height
but you must add solid width or height values

margin	height
a #gal container is loaded with lots of images 60 all with defined css height 100px and margin 5px

7434350
getter	setter
the reason why you may want to do the full way though is if you want to add a default value which can be done in the constructor in short hand form or add additional code to the getter or setter

7434383
getter	setter
synthesizing doesn t actually allocate your variables which is why they are null it just provides the getter setter methods for accessing the variables

7434405
children	parent
then to run a simulation just start with a few parent and generate a bunch of children to complete with each other

7434458
onresume	onpause
the problem is when it receives an intent immediately after finish has been called the onnewintent and onresume methods are called but my activity is then destroyed onpause ondestroy by android and the intent is not processed

7434492
getter	setter
auto-implemented properties are syntactic sugar introduced to address exactly these type of situation where the property is used just to avoid having a public field with no extra logic in the getter setter

7434518
children	parent
this whole example functions fine if all the data parent and children is passed at once at the beginning to addjsondata

7434538
implements	sealed
the best practice recommend when you implements dispose method in non sealed class you should have a virtual method for your derived classes to override

7434547
versioning	upgrade
if it is only compatible with b 1.0.0 then you ll have to create your own fork of the a gem and upgrade the gemspec to be compatible with b 1.0.1 and then use that repository as your gem for a instead of the rubygems versioning

when i switching activities say clicking a button to goto another activity all the elements on the screens as well as the background slides off the screens to the left

7434602
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
use the developer tools for your browser f12 for ie right-click and inspect element for google-chrome or safari install firebug for firefox to inspect the actual styles applied to the element in question

7434654
expander	grid
if i have two columns of a grid and want to put both in an expander control how do i make it so if both are open they have some default size on the screen like 1 3 for lhs 2 3 for rhs then one lhs collapses rhs takes up whole screen and when rhs collapses then lhs takes up the whole screen

7434658
oncreate	onnewintent
this activity can be started again by some intent but the oncreate will be called not onnewintent

7434658
oncreate	onnewintent
but you need to review you logic and enhance your oncreate and onnewintent method to gracefully handle your scenario

7434660
int	double
however since your printf specifies two int both 4 bytes in this case you are seeing the binary representations of 1.0 as a type double

7434663
min	max
let c be min a b and d be max a b

7434675
firefox	safari
but i just discovered that at least in firefox 6 and safari 5 on my pc there is a delay before i can press-to-select the next value

7434675
keydown	keyup
however in further testing with jquery i discovered that the javascript events keydown keyup and keypress are all fired as you d expect no matter how rapidly you press the keys

7434676
rss	feed
i am in the unfortunate position of needing to parse a rss feed since there is no other way to obtain the data

7434676
rss	feed
i figured i could modify it to do the same for the rss feed so i can get the data into a format that is easier use

7434693
getter	setter
as for your edit those __xxx__ functions are an ugly way to get the getter setter function without executing it

7434693
getter	setter
the function you posted copies getter setter without executing them

7434703
fontfamily	font-size
so instead of defining .create-button .cancel-button .create-and-new button you would just have a .button that defines padding size background color line-height font-size fontfamily and font-weight

7434709
aggregate-functions	sum
to ensure only one row you would have to use an aggregate-functions - count sum max - without a group by clause

7434711
implements	extends
i d like to tack on some interfaces to engine so i subclass it class interfacedengine extends engine implements awesomeinterface

7434740

i like to use jquery corner plugin if it is using ie it creates some divs with backgroud but if it using another browser like google-chrome or firefox it uses a the native css atribute radius

7434809
google-chrome	firefox
now the iframe works perfectly fine in google-chrome loads the content as expected but in firefox it seems to have disabled javascript in this case notice none of the script files being downloaded which is an issue as the widgets are extremely javascript heavy and don t function without it

7434809
google-chrome	firefox
i have provided below a jsfiddle showcasing this issue the site im loading in the iframe is just a javascript game but you will see it doesn t work in firefox but its okay in google-chrome

telerik	radcombobox
don t know what your budget is but telerik s radcombobox is very customizable

7434949
range	infinity	range	minimum
start two threads one which starts looking up towards positive infinity for a range containing the minimum and another one which starts looking down towards zero for a range containing the minimum

7434949
range	minimum
the faster you approach it the fewer steps to find the minimum if it s really on that side but the bigger the range left to be binary searched because on average you ll overshoot further towards zero

7434953
ssl	https
assuming this is intranet you can generate an ssl certificate and run your rails app through https

7434960
width	height
the #container will vary in width and height as it s contents will be dynamic

folder	directory
via mod_rewrite.these file maybe in sub folder like images|scrpt|js etc.so i ve to do it from root directory .htaccess file

7434972
int	chars
...the result of the expression is not an unsigned chars as you might expect but an int because of integral promotion

7434972
int	chars
when an unsigned chars takes part in integral promotion it will be converted to an int if your platform can accomodate all possible values of unsigned chars in an int else it will be converted to an unsigned int 4.5 1

7435006
serializable	deserialization
rival machines like the bbc micro had dedicated hardware for serializable and deserialization of data so the cpu would just say output 0xfe and then the hardware would make the relevant noises and raise an interrupt when it was ready for the next byte

primefaces	tomahawk
if you re not on jsf 2.2 yet or if you don t like primefaces ui grab tomahawk which renders the same plain html output as but supports a attribute so that you can position the items by the way you want

7435142
google-chrome	firefox
tested in google-chrome and firefox

7435177
width	height
you should display the link as a block and set width and height to 100

7435191
width	height
you won t have any luck with width and height as any transitions for these properties won t be hardware accelerated

7435191
width	height
in my tests the browser would first transition the height then the width would snap into place abruptly or vice versa

7435199
children	parent
now the ideal scenario for drop down menus would be to have the parent and children in tags however sometimes the design of the site does not allow this

7435213
ubuntu	linux
in linux you can add an init.d script juggernaut ubuntu example redis ubuntu example

7435253
int	chars
first make up your mind what is that you are trying to work with int s or bytes chars s and then act accordingly and consistently

7435260
google-chrome	firefox
example code this works as described above on my computer the error alert appears twice on firefox and once on google-chrome and ie7 obviously the timeout is set so low so that it would always happen

7435280
equals	gethashcode
implementing equals and gethashcode

7435283
int	double
this appears to be because the class jythonutils will only translate pystring pyfloat and pyinteger to string double and int even though the documentation for monkeydevice states you can pass any structured data type in the extras dictionary

7435284
put	get
if i put that together and add a space i get 10001011111 i have figured out that a number in binary can be shifted one column by dividing it by 2

google-chrome	firefox
i m running 70 000 lines of javascript in google-chrome s debugger and firefox 6 s firebug and there are no debugging problems

7435325
getter	setter
in other words the getter should contain nothing more than a call to getvalue and the setter should contain nothing more than a call to setvalue

7435327
opera	firefox
this will work with opera firefox iceweasel probably konqueror

7435379

7435418
children	parent
what methods in my parent view are supposed to be called when one of it s children invalidate itself

7435519
public	protected
every object creation eventually boils down to a call to new so the only way to completely avoid having a function return value be the only existing reference to an idisposable is to not have a class expose any public constructors and have all its private and protected constructors accept a reference parameter in which to smuggle out the new object instance

7435538
wmi	managementeventwatcher
one option might be to create a watchdog application installed as a service perhaps that monitors wmi events for stopping a process via the managementeventwatcher class in the system.management namespace

it works flawlessly in firefox but neither google-chrome nor opera can apply clipping path to foreignobject didn t try ie9

7435596
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
only firefox seems to support multiple elements within clippingpath if you add more than one rectangle there google-chrome and opera output something weird

7435596
google-chrome	firefox
so in order to use the first method in google-chrome i had to create a path in inkscape while in firefox i managed to create the bubble with two rectangles one big and one small and rotated

7435596
google-chrome	firefox
here are the jsfiddle examples demonstrates both variants with clipping path combined of 2 rectangles so works only in firefox uses path element generated with inkscape and partially works in google-chrome

but you could call malloc in such a way to make the struct holds 2 chars and as many int as you wanted let s say 10

7436098
int	chars
does the computer allocate 2+4 2 chars + pointer to int bytes for the standard struct test and then 4 9 more bytes of memory and let the pointer ptr put whatever kind of data it wants on those extra bytes

backbone.js	zepto
i was amazed that backbone.js can use either jquery or zepto as its helper library

7436824
int	chars
if you meant digits instead of numbers then you could use variables of type chars and then convert them to int although generally this would not be needed just to see which one is greater

7436827
equals	gethashcode
i try to override gethashcode and equals method but still it doesn t work right

firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have not tried this in firefox google-chrome safari or opera yet but i would assume that if all modern browsers share this glitch then it is not a design flaw but rather intentional to make searching a large box easier when viewing a web page in a browser window that has not been maximized to fit the width of the entire screen

7438073
google-chrome	safari
if you re using a webkit browser safari or google-chrome that error is

7438092
typedef	struct
you could have test types be defined as struct with a nested typedef declaration for the type of data

invokerequired	begininvoke
if so you ll need to look into begininvoke and invokerequired -- or store the results of the task in a member variable which may require the lock keyword

7438119
for-loop	loops
you are using for-loop syntax in your while loops

7438135
subclass	accessor	accessor	properties
there are certain classes available that help you with the storing and disposal of data see nscache for example but aside from that your model classes could simply be an nsobject subclass with some public properties and or custom accessor

7449769
put	get
if you put that in your analysis chain ie apply it it incoming documents when you index them and then compute facets for the resulting field with a query restricted to the fruit cluster you will be able to get a list of all distinct shingles along with their occurrence frequencies - i think you can even retrieve them sorted by frequency - which you can use easily i think to derive the title you want

in other words if the height of your background mainmenubtn image is 50 px in mdpi the hdpi version needs to be 75 px

7454181
mdpi	hdpi
you don t have to turn your button into a square definitely not but if you re trying to use a size like 50 px and 75 px for a particular height you might as well use 48 px and 72 px instead for both the mdpi and hdpi versions respectively

7454181
mdpi	hdpi
and if you re trying to use 110 px and 165 pixels for width again for mdpi and hdpi respectively you should pick instead 104 px and 158 px or something like that

also in practice you just write this lot of code to get one public field since you can change its value using the getter and setter

7456865
getter	setter
so in java and other languages the default is to use getter and setter anyway because they can be annoying to write but can spare you a lot of time if you find yourself in the situation i ve described

7462303
width	height
i m not sure why you re using left and top instead of width and height since you re trying to make a thumbnail

7462303

equals	gethashcode
object s implementations of equals and gethashcode which you re inheriting compare by reference

7462979
equals	gethashcode
if you have a different definition for equality you should override equals gethashcode to get the appropriate behavior

7463097
equals	gethashcode
if you re using value types the default implementation of equals and gethashcode are okay equals checks if the fields are equals and gethashcode is based on the fields not necessarily all of them

7463097
equals	gethashcode
if you re using reference types the default implementation of equals and gethashcode use reference equality which may or may not be okay

7463097
equals	gethashcode
if not override equals and gethashcode or implmenet for your t

7463097

the type class should again not necessarily implement the comparable interface and override the comparator method so as to decide the ordering within the treemap

7463281
comparator	comparable
unless a comparator which mutually compares the keys is provided in the treemap s constructor the keys must implement comparable

7463281
comparator	comparable
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals . this is so because the map interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a map performs all key comparisons using its comparator or compare method so two keys that are deemed equals by this method are from the standpoint of the sorted map equals

int	double
a template vector is basically a vector that can assume any of one defined type either all int or all double or all floats but not int and double and floats

7463987
int	chars
the reason there isn t a class like this conventionally is because each item takes up a different block size in memory a chars is a byte an int could be 4 bytes etc etc and it would take additional resources on look-up to know what to expect normal storage is contiguous.

put	get
now my problem is that when i enter data and call setdata on the onpause method it takes times to exit from at that activity.so during that time i display the progress bar when the user click back button.so these work fine but when the user enter no data then i want the progress bar to show but with less time as shown when the user enter data and call the setdata method of onpause method.but in my case whether the user enter data or not the progressbar will take 3 sec.so is there any way where i can get the time of first thread and put that time in my second thread

7472399
width	height
since you want 100 height - which is a pain in the ass most of the time - and all your columns and rows seem to be of a fixed width height this becomes really easy with fixed positioning which allows you to specify how far every edge of every container should be from the sides of the browser page

7472422

width	height
try setting the height and width using css like this

7472859
width	height
not using the height and width attribute of the img tag

7472859
width	height
setting only one of the height or width with css should scale the image proportionally

7472859
width	height
if you have no height and width attributes set on the img tag and you have only one of a height or width set with css then the image will scale proportionally in ie

7472859
width	height
i can get your code to work if i specifically remove the height and width attributes from the image and change your height and width settings to use css like this

7472859
width	height
fyi it s also possible to just set both css height and width calculating one from the other to maintain the proper aspect ratio

7472881
bluetooth	usb
need to configure the phone connected physically by usb or bluetooth in order to appear in a com serial port

7472881

however when i use the mac os x finder with the help of transmit but that makes no difference to put a file to the server i get no content

then use property in .h and synthesize in .m for getter and setter

7472997
int	double
one solution is to have additional overload s to the ambiguous function or operator in your case they are operator + const testable int and operator + const testable double

7473011
width	height
the following will create 4 new bindable properties to return the actual scaled x y width and height of the image displayed inside the spark image component

7473038

so what you would need is a bufferedreader to get stuff in and a bufferedwriter that takes all the input from the bufferedreader and outputs it to a temp file with the corrected appended data

7473038
bufferedreader	bufferedwriter
then when you re done both bufferedreader and bufferedwriter streams are closed you need to either discard the original file or rename the temp file to the name of the original file

so i think i can work with a tab bar controller and the first tab should be the login tab but i need to hide the tab bar from the view while logging in and after that i can show the tab bar with the other tabs

7473189

serializing entities can be problematic and is not really recommended at least not as long as an entity instance still holds references to proxy objects or is still managed by an entitymanager

7473189

also if a lazy-loaded entity is not loaded at serializable time it won t be loadable after deserialization

7473225

7473233
width	height
this seems to work fine except that the final classes extending vboxsub don t inherit the width height settings set in vboxsub when in flash builder s design mode

7473233
width	height
i d like to have each of these components all be exactly the same size so that when laying out the ui i know exactly how much space i have to work with - preferably without having to copy paste the width and height attributes into every darn mxml file and having to worry about updating each one if the w h ever change

7473235
post	put
your form_for will do a put request rather than a post request because it s acting on an existing object

7473582
jqgrid	datatables
maybe give datatables a try if jqgrid isn t working for you

7473604
width	height
as your padding is greater than the actual width height of the control

7473658
for-loop	loops
your output string was put inside the for-loop so at each loops the string is initialized the content generated in the previous loops was lost

7473668
zoo	xts
xts and zoo objects do not like to be displayed out of order so i think you would need to coerce them to a less order -ly class

7473719
post	put
backbone used the .id property not attribute of the model to determine whether it should put or post as shown here in the source code

7473949

one of the nicest things about membase and the upcoming couchbase server is the protocol-level compatibility with memcached

in my case it was related to verb restrictions on the requested action where the view was a post but the partial view being requested within supported get and head only

7474031
scheme	racket
racket includes a lot of really nice language constructs not included in r6rs scheme like match

7474049

in order for stl to work you have to port several things like static initialization for std cin and std cout and stack unwinding.

7474049

they don t do memory allocator and they don t do exceptions unpredictable and they especially don t do stl

7474071

this doesn t work in firefox and google-chrome

7474388

http get should be used for data retrieval only and http post can be used for updating content

much better if you re targeting a servlet 3.0 el 2.2 capable container tomcat 7 glassfish 3 etc wherein invoking methods with additional arguments is supported or can install jboss el which adds the same enhancement for el 2.1 then you should be able to just pass that object as action method argument

7474781

it has several different names including map dictionary table association table and more

7474815
std	ostream
you need to return a reference to std ostream object so that you can chain stream operations

7474827
width	height
it strikes me that you may not need to instanciate the ui elements themselves- you can very easily have a collection of dependencyobject-derived viewmodels each of which has the widthproperty and heightproperty set and possibly bound to the equivalent width and height properties of the visible cell ui element once those are created

7474848
daemons	launchd
i ve got a launchd daemons that runs as root outside of the user context

7474848
daemons	launchd
obviously i can t do this from a launchd daemons since it s not running in a windowsserver environment - so the other option is to spawn a separate process for each user that has access to be able to display a gui

7474848
daemons	launchd
the launchd agent could then communicate with the launchd daemons to determine when something needs to be displayed

7474848
daemons	launchd
so the server would send the launchd daemons a series of files which it is expected to copy out on top of the existing files

7474863
qobject	qwidget
you need to inherit from qobject or probably qwidget if you want to draw on the screen and then include the statement q_object which instantiates a few needed things

try mouseleave instead of mouseout

7474977
mouseout	mouseleave
now jquery s interpretation of mouseleave works slightly different than their version of mouseout

7474977
mouseout	mouseleave
i don t see why you would ever want to detect mouseout of descendant elements so this is the reason why i use jquery mouseleave for everything and never bother with mouseout

7474998
typedef	struct
in the first case your struct has two equivalent names struct element where element is a struct tag and element where element is a typedef an alias for an existing type

you might consider just omitting the typedef and consistently referring to the type as struct element

7474998
typedef	struct
note that you need to refer to the type as struct element not element within the definition itself since the typedef name element isn t visible yet

7474998
typedef	struct
the fact that the struct tag and the typedef have the same name may seem confusing but it s perfectly legititimate

7474998
typedef	struct
struct tags and typedef are in separate namespaces in the c sense not the c++ sense

7474998
typedef	struct
another alternative is to separate the typedef from the struct definition

width	height
however i need to be able to get the width and height between the points

7475004
width	height
this is easy when the rectangle is not rotated but once i rotate it my math returns the width and height shown by the red outline here

7475016
width	height
similar to the other answers but if you prefer not to define the width and height you can use float

7475026
post	get
the other post have helpful links but the actual code you will want to get lzo compression working is here

google-chrome	firefox
cannot select an item in a select box using selenium 2 firefox or google-chrome driver

7475099
width	height
if by width and height you just mean the edge lengths and you have your 4 pointf structures in a list or array you can do

7475135
typedef	struct
the struct definition in your typedef is an anonymous struct so you ll be able to refer to it with element without the struct keyword only

7475143
portrait	landscape
videos recorded on the device may be portrait or landscape

7475157
profiling	instrumentation

tabcontrol	tabitem
i have a custom tabcontrol in a wpf application attention the technology is not important as it may change that contains tabitem

7475355
implements	extends
for now the only solution i thought of was to extends the control and implements a new close event

7475388
min	max
if you need min max in order to avoid an expensive branch you shouldn t use the ternary operator as it will compile down to a jump

7475388
min	max
the link below describes a useful method for implementing a min max function without branching

public	protected
however protected private functions are for when you need to re-use some code that shouldn t be part of the public interface

7475461
public	protected
now i want to add an mvc twist some of the public methods on the controller are unprotected and i don t care who accesses them and some are protected by an attribute to ensure that only logged-in users can access them

7475547
put	get
first thing that came to mind was that it was caused of too many entries in the hashmap which caused every put and every get to be slower every time

7475566
hash	salt
sha-256 is more than sufficient for password hash just make sure to use a different edit salt for each user

7475588
button	checkbox

7475718
postgresql	mysql
it s been a while since i ve written raw sql i was hoping someone could help me out in optimizing this sql query so that it works across both mysql and postgresql

7475721
salt	md5
so md5 + strong password + average salt is better than usual password + super-extra-cool_hash and quite enough

7475732
wordpress	joomla
the first is hooking up with wordpress joomla

7475765
folder	dir
if the platforms are similar enough copying the numpy folder from the frontal server to somewhere in the shared filesystem a subfolder of your home dir that you would add to your pythonpath might work but a clean install is to be preferred

7475839
profiling	instrumentation
use instrumentation to profiling your memory to confirm

7475862
maven	pom.xml
sonar is really easy to setup and integrates into your maven build process with zero change to your pom.xml

7475938
implements	extends
the documentation generally is pretty difficult to understand and the sample wraps up some other things in with the basic sync provider example implements your own auth provider and extends contacts neither of which you need it sounds like but once you strip it down to the minimum it s reasonably straightforward

7475939
ffmpeg	libav
you can use libswscale from the ffmpeg libav mplayer projects

if you are just creating this as one batch then throwing the whole map out using a custom pool allocator may be a good idea here - eg boost s pool_alloc

7476062
post	get
in addition to your concern about the size of the get requests you cause the client to make when redirecting it s also not a good practice to turn post requests into get requests

7476512
submit	submission
both approaches in the form above will submit the form causing submission selected values

7476513
put	get
my advise would be to focus more on the .net framework and c# language itself as these are the basis and most of the .net framework is available in both so you should know it and get familiar to it then if your windows derive from a class called form or another called window as long as you know what to put inside and how to approach certain common issues everything else is a detail a big detail once you plan to make a huge application of a certain level bust still a detail

7476580
int	chars
a s int equivalent is 65 so it will print 65 if you print a chars like this -

7476614
children	parent
at first we d divide all the space we have and then multiply the inner element so we d get the situation where the rounding error occurs on the parent and all the children in this context would be ok

7476614
margin	text-align
but when it s not absolute positioned and you need to position it horizontally you can use display inline-block with text-align center or display block with margin auto

7476614
children	parent
also the ratio of the parent s shrinking and the children s expand must be chosen from what parts you want to divide the children

integer	unsigned
size_t is implementation defined but using visual studio s crt it s an unsigned 32-bit integer when compiling for 32-bit architectures and an unsigned 64-bit integer when compiling for 64-bit architectures

7477146
inherited	properties
it will inherited from gamecharacter just like any other properties or method just make sure you are using self.delegate since using delegate by itself will attempt to access a private ivar which would be generated in your case

7477184
mouseup	mousedown
i have a web application in which i have hooked mouseup and mousedown events

7477184
mouseup	mousedown
at the top of each of my mouseup and mousedown event handlers

7477202
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
some browsers implement the mouseenter mouseleave events that i ve noticed are more accurate than mouseout

7477202
mouseout	mouseleave
mouseleave does not fire from an element s children whereas mouseout does

7477233
affinity	irq
look at proc interrupts to identify the interrupts you want to move say everything matching eth0 and set the affinity by echoing a hexadecimal mask to proc irq xxx smp_affinity

7477269
ssl	https
also this might not work over https ssl

7477276
width	height
you need to put some height width on the elements as well

7477291
mouse	keyboard
in the past i ve used the p invoke sendinput function to generate keyboard and mouse events but apparently touch is a whole new beast

7477314
nginx	lighttpd
using trailing slashes is more portable - your application can easily run on other web server software like microsoft iis lighttpd nginx

but for some reason every time i access localhost 9000 it displays part of the http header - date server content-length and content-type - and the content

7477392
webclient	httpwebrequest
and just for clarification you are not actually using webclient you are using the httpwebrequest and httpwebresponse objects which are a different thing altogether

7477393
ubuntu	linux

7477446
client-side	server-side
since this is server-side i don t believe that i can use the tag because i think that s for client-side code

7477475
post	get
this post explains how to get it done easily using filezilla

7477492
stdout	stderr
the syntax error comes from your redirection of stderr to stdout

7477504
mouseover	mouseout
note to add the pause effect you need to stop restart the timeout call by clearing the timeout on mouseover and resuming on mouseout

7477550
jlist	jlabel
use a custom jlist cell renderer with appropriate jlabel and or any other swing component

7477591
getter	setter
also the logininfo can be turned into a real bean with setter getter and stuff just wanted to keep it simple

7477623
profiling	debugging
a default project has debugging and trace defined for the debugging profiling and trace for the release profiling

7477623
profiling	debugging
go to project-properties and ensure the debugging symbol is defined or not as appropriate for your needs for any-and-all profiling that exist in your project

7477637
opera	safari
safari and opera and others have their own name for that attribute until it becomes an endorsed standard

7477665
width	height
you can also extend this by getting browser height this example includes width

7477685
superclass	subclassing
the above code can easily be solved by imposing stricter interpretation of a class handles it s responsibilities. it s not the superclass s responsibility to initialize the subclassing so it shouldn t be the superclass s prerogative to call subclassing code before such initialization might be complete

7477724
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
even if the memory is reallocated in a new address space if realloc succeeds previous allocated memory with malloc is automatically free

7477766
free	realloc
if realloc resized it then realloc returns it if it allocated a new space in memory and copied the previous content of it it will free the old pointer and return a new one

7477766
free	realloc
but never overwrite the old pointer with the result of a call to realloc as you re doing in your code in facts when realloc fails it returns null and does not free the old pointer so if you are overwriting the only variable where you stored it you are losing the only way you have to free that memory and thus you have a memory leak

7477770
boost	allocator
another alternative would be to use a boost intrusive_set which will prevent the need for allocator when storing the items in the set

7477774
hash	md5
i want to generate an md5 hash for each line and write it to the same file overwriting the previous data

7477813
pop-up	dialog
i need the client process to run in the context of the unprivileged user and having a uac dialog pop-up is not an option

7477858
children	parent
by setting the weightsum on the parent you re saying that the weights of the children should equal that amount

7477878
cabal-dev	hackage
were on hackage with cabal-dev add-source

7477908
width	height
whatever function you have that loads the image should give you two things one is the image info such as width and height

7477908
width	height
and let s say b1_w b1_h b2_w and b2_h are the width and height of b1 and b2 which should be provided to you by the bitmap load function

7477908
width	height
for example if you want to stretch an image from width and height w1 and h1 to w2 and h2 here s the transformation

7477908
width	height
so your code would look like this all the width height and x y values are float unless otherwise specified

7477908
ceil	floor
to linearize the value for position xs ys you could either get the linearized value of floor xs ys and ceil xs ys and again linearize for that or do the same first over y then x which is the same

7477925
google-chrome	firefox
a difference in behavior between browsers is that when ie9 uses the reload method it clears the visible page and seemingly rebuilds it from scratch where firefox and google-chrome wait till they get the new assets and rebuild them if they are different

7478008
dictionary	map
in python the map is instantiated with a dictionary like this

7478053
fcntl	fork
if this isn t what you want to happen you will need to either manually close the file descriptors after fork or set the fds as close-on-exec using fcntl fd f_setfd fd_cloexec

7478055
ssl	https
your site doesn t need to use ssl but all calls it makes to the google+ api must use https

i am using the following to create an nsdata object from an alassetrepresentation to both export an image file as well as create an md5 hash from

7478085
hash	md5
when i re-add the exported file and perform the same operation the file s md5 hash is different

7478085
hash	md5
when i create the nsdata objects using uiimagepngrepresentation and perform the above operations the md5 hash match

7478122
nsurl	nsstring
you can just pass in the nsurl without having to convert it into a nsstring

7478141

7478176
width	margin
the div must be given an defined width in order for the margin trick to work link

7478182
stdout	fflush
adding a fflush stdout to the c application + previous approach success

7478182
cout	cin
interestingly this probably wouldn t happen in a c++ application using the standard iostreams since cin is tied to cout and before any input operation on cin happens cout is automatically flushed

7478206
tiff	png	tiff	bmp	bmp	png	gif	bmp	gif	png
the image file format is irrelevant as long as imageio can read it jpeg gif png tiff even bmp if really really necessary

7478269
folder	directory
lastly most larger projects have a common folder in either a high level directory or in the location where their message interfaces are defined

i m building application on skd 11+ android 3.x and when i m doing in-app billing request the checkout popup is always displaying in landscape mode - causing that my whole app rotates to landscape mode even though the app is locked to portrait

7478373
post	get
...to get the description i just added a custom field in my post and read it with this function here

7478379
flatmap	concatmap
this combination of a mapping followed by a concatenation is called concatmap in haskell and flatmap in scala and i m sure it has other names elsewhere

7478381
daemons	launchd
off the cuff i would say that you should arrange a way for your daemons to request the launchd agent to exit on demand the same way you would arrange for it to launchd on demand

7478381
daemons	launchd
instead you should rig it up so that when the daemons tries to connect to the agent launchd launchd the agent

7478381
daemons	launchd
you could do this by having the daemons connect to a unix domain socket registered on behalf of the agent by launchd for example

7478381
daemons	launchd
i believe it too has a launchd daemons perform the app updates

7478392
hide	show
when the button is pressed hide the label and show the text field - focus on the text field becomefirstresponder

7478392
hide	show
you are in editing mode now track for return key being pressed and once that happens set your label text to what has been entered resign first responder from the text field and hide it then show the label

7478422
setcontentview	findviewbyid
when you use findviewbyid you are actually trying to find a view inside the layout you specified by the setcontentview

7478430
hide	show
by show and hide i believe you are referring to the jquery functions

7478430
hide	show
i hide and show using

7478457
fadein	hide	hide	show
i want #load to show while hiding #body then hide #load and make #body visible with a fadein

7478457
hide	show
basically hide #body on page load show #load for a few seconds then hide it then show #body again

in udp land one way this can occur is when you send a udp packet to a host and the remote host doesn t have a listener on that port and bounces an icmp host unreachable message in response

7478501
mouseup	mousedown	put	get
i was initially thinking of checking mousedown and mouseup then put something in my game update loop to make it draw pixels to the screen but that didnt work out when i found i couldn t directly get the mouse x and mouse y without the events firing

nsstring	nsdata
this method recursively validates that all the contained objects are property list objects instances of nsdata nsdate nsnumber nsstring nsarray or nsdictionary before writing out the file and returns no if all the objects are not property list objects since the resultant file would not be a valid property list

7478562
min	max
what i am trying to do is retrieve open close min and max price days from a single table sample data below

7478562
min	max
min and max are easy

put	get
if i put the console.log inside of the .getjson then i get the appropriate value

7478727
width	margin
obviously if you don t set a width then the margin will have no effect because it will expand to the full width thus no margin area

7478727
width	margin
like stated above even if you don t specify the width the auto is still applied and is merely calculated as 0 as the division expands to the entire width and thus there is no margin to fill

7478769
carrierwave	paperclip
you can of course use one of the existing ready-made file-attachment libraries such as paperclip and carrierwave

7478774

7478774
post	get
edit after re-reading op s post i get that it should have the beginning tag and closing tag

7478824
hide	show
although there s nothing wrong with your inside-out hash approach the multiple arrays with shared keys it s quite possible you could filter the rows based on classes and use jquery to show hide them

7478824
sorting	filtering
personally i don t see what you re doing with jquery as not being behaviour - sorting and filtering is classic user interaction

7478891
zoo	xts
as dwin pointed out the index must be ordered zoo stands for z s ordered objects so you can t un-order xts zoo objects

7478922
serializable	deserialization
the way you explain it - it is serializable deserialization of a graph issue

7478929
folder	directory
you can add this folder to the additional include directory in the properties of your c++ project

7478934
serializable	deserialization
the show and read classes are meant to provide really basic serializable deserialization which usually produce valid haskell code

7478935

7479010
versioning	upgrade
the other one that was not working was created years ago and has been upgrade over the years to the current versioning i am working with

7479010
versioning	upgrade
the upgrade project evidently didn t get upgrade with the new build targets as newer versioning of visual studio became available

7479056
preferenceactivity	listpreference
the listpreference is created in an .xml file which is used in my settings preferenceactivity by calling addpreferencesfromresource r.xml.cam_settings

i do want to keep that directory with the local project folder just because it s easier to manage for me i want everything together

7479107
submit	submission
however if i add a hidden text input box it resolves the issue and i can only submit the form by selecting a suggestion from the autocomplete submission via this mechanism is handled by some jquery

7479119
pascal	delphi
it is constructed on the same base language delphi was object pascal but as rruz has already said is not the same

7479154
submit	submission
in your form submit handler check for that attribute before deciding to allow form submission or use .preventdefault to stop it from submission to server

7479162
width	height
the default state is set to height and width of 100

7479177
children	parent
the catch is each class in the hierarchy needs a chance to configure itself and it needs to cascade from the parent to all of the children

7479213
ant	maven
im new with maven and i want to migrate my framework from ant to maven but im stuck in a problem

7479272

7479397
pull	push
push this and pull this from your staging with

7479433
downcasting	upcasting	superclass	subclassing
you can only cast a referece to one of its superclass ie upcasting in which case the cast operator is not needed or its subclassing downcasting

7479433
superclass	subclassing
integer is neither a subclassing nor a superclass of string so you can t do that

7479437
daemon	cron
then a cron job or some other daemon process running on the server periodically checks that database table for emails to be sent or whatever it is you are offloading

7479473
mouse	keyboard
just put the mouse down and step away from the keyboard

7479529
hash	salt
the salt is then stored unencrypted alongside each hash password and gets concatenated with the user s plaintext password in order to check the hash every time the password gets entered

7479529
hash	salt
adding a hash means the rainbow table needs to not only include the values having any possible combination of alphanumeric characters a person might use but also the random binary salt which is fairly impractical at this point in time

7479529
hash	salt
so basically adding a salt means that a brute force attacker who has access to both the hash password and the salt needs to both figure how how the salt was concatenated to the password before or after normally and brute force each password individually since readily available rainbow tables don t include any random binary data

7479531
pascal	delphi
yet another delphi language is delphi prism which is an object pascal variant which targets .net

7479569
ncover	partcover	partcover	opencover
interfaces have no code to instrument and as such you will not get any coverage data for them this applies to ncover partcover and opencover afaik

7479570
hide	show
so it doesn t seem like a show hide scenario

7479585
getter	setter
for instance if i have a person table and a corresponding person entity with getter and setter for first last name email phone etc .

7479589
post	get
what i originally had in mind to do was user logs in with license on app - app post license to my server - server sends a response via a http get request - app evaluates response and if license is valid sets a value in a session variable a if invalid returns to login screen with an error

7479598
ivar	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
if your compiler is set to gcc there s a bug a subclassing that defines a property without a corresponding ivar definition which is perfectly legal hides any superclass ivars

7479614
int	chars
you can typecast chars to int and in fact you are

7479622

getter	setter
as long as your binding property is set to twoway and you have exposed the getter and the setter than the text you enter in the textbox is sent to the viewmodel

7479749
superclass	subclassing
typically the relationship of a subclassing to it s superclass is called is a

7479750
maya	blender	autodesk	3ds
however if you want to create something like this i believe you re probably going to have better luck using a true 3d application autodesk maya or 3ds max come to mind as well as maxon cinema4d or my personal favorite blender whichever suits your taste

7479754
hash	md5
that password would take 2.5e+03 cpu-years to crack on my inexpensive celeron e1200 from 2008 assuming an offline attack on a ms-cache hash which is the worst password hashing algorithm in common use slightly worse than even simple md5

7479756
client-side	server-side
php is server-side not client-side

7479760
int	chars
yes you could use assign both an int ascii value or a chars itself to a chars variable

7479767
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
notice that it is a uiviewcontroller subclass. you can also have multiple uinavigationcontroller in your app which is common for example if you have a tab bar

7479772
int	chars
however it is not a good idea to use int literals as chars values because it obscures the meaning of your program

7479773
int	chars
chars to int conversion is called widening conversions

7479773
int	chars
in widening conversions values do not lose information about the overall magnitude of a numeric value where as int to chars conversion is called narrowing conversions

7479835
post	get
i m trying to get the first image from each of my post

7479903

7480262
google-chrome	firefox
if i open in browser firefox and google-chrome it s work proferly

7480267
int	chars
the c standard says each enumerated type shall be compatible with chars a signed int type or an unsigned int type

7480271
prng	random
then you use it as seed in random which is less good that one is a non-cryptographic prng and its output may exhibit some structure which will not register in a statistical measurement tool but might be exploited by an intelligent attacker

7480278
post	get
| get the file from the post

7480278
width	height
| get the height and width

7480281

7480354
minimum	max
max rotation 0 minimum rotation 0

7480431
filtering	grouping
a workaround could be to create a link to the grouping which will call the same report and filtering it to show only the clicked grouping with the rest of parameters remaining the same

7480431
filtering	grouping
then the user can use document map to go to the grouping click it to trigger the filtering and print or export it to a file

7480440
width	height
my problem is i am using face detector example from following link but how to find square height width and replace image on square same as square height width.sorry for bad english communication

width	height
get the height and width from canvas.getheight canvas.getwidth respectively and then make a new bitmap with same size and set it to the canvas

7480525
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
also whereever possible make use of the layout manager margin flexibility settings and width height flexibility settings to minimise the need to hard code values

7480541
firefox	safari
i have a site i m building in dreamweaver cs5 and although my test site looks fine in firefox safari it looks awful in ie 8 on down

7480548
setcontentview	findviewbyid
using setcontentview will be trouble some when you use findviewbyid for a old layout

7480548
setcontentview	findviewbyid
as findviewbyid will look in the layout that is specified by setcontentview

7480554
for-loop	loops
your for-loop is setting after each time through loops

7480576
centos	linux
i m running the amazon linux ami 64bit which i believe is based on centos

7480578
cout	cin
of course you do want your prompts to appear before you read from the input stream but this is achieved by std cout being tied to std cin by default making std cout flush whenever the program attempts to read from std cin .

7480609
getter	setter
after the controller is popped by pressing the left nav bar button and the root vew displays again the count is still 3 one for the getter setter and apparently 2 other things that still hold references to it

webkit	gecko
the reason webkit and gecko work is because they have a lenience for the sake of compatibility

primefaces	icefaces
you could use the primefaces poll component if that s sufficient otherwise the only push technology that works with jsf that i know of right now is icefaces push

7480715
pop-up	dialog
you could have the dialog box pop-up the user says no but the next handler returns yes and that s what s returned back

valgrind complains that realloc produces an invalid free

7480728
int	boolean

you will have domain entities that are a reflection of your database erd diagram and you have no chance in injecting behavior since they are autogenerated by this custom tool

7480815
phpstorm	aptana
in the meantime we have introduced phpstorm after using zend studio aptana netbeans and eclipse and our whole team agrees that it is by far the best ide we have ever worked with

7480819
subtract	add
you can t do pointer arithmetic in java you can t add or subtract from a java reference you can only dereferencere it or compare it with another one

7480858
subtract	add
what it means is that in java you can t add or subtract to a pointer since memory management is done by the jvm itself

7480871
int	double
make sure it s an int -type field so that it doesn t use as much memory as say a float double or text

7480894
profiling	debugging
using this info im trying to profiling my activity using debugging class

mouse	keyboard
using these keyboard and mouse we can navigate to varios menu items and edit entries

7481272
mouse	keyboard
we have couple of test cases written to verify that mouse click and keyboard input events are working when pressed respective key

7481272
mouse	keyboard
so i have to use that and verify whether the mouse keyboard has performed the appropriate events

7481272
hid	keyboard
as i have gone through couple of previous posts it seems like that one of the way to achieve this is through virual hid device driver rather than actual keyboard and mosue

7481272
mouse	keyboard
i am more interested to simulate the mouse and keyboard events

7481303
getter	setter
there s a workaround for the property restriction though since in as you can use getter setter which are allowed in interfaces

7481321
actionscript	haxe
i know haxe is a cousin of actionscript it primarily targets as and because the author is also the inventor of nekovm therefore these two targets should be fine

7481373

in my pom.xml i ask maven to filter this directory

7481449
client-side	server-side
i use the constants-interface for the client-side and a properties-file on the server-side

7481580
getter	setter
often a setter is accompanied by a getter also known as an accessor which returns the value of the private member variable

7481580
mutators	setter
the mutators method sometimes called a setter is most often used in object-oriented programming in keeping with the principle of encapsulation

7481580
accessor	properties
the alternative to defining mutator and accessor methods or properties blocks is to give the instance variable some visibility other than private and access it directly from outside the objects

7481580
public	protected
it is often useful for the accessor to be public while the mutator remains protected package-private or internal

7481581
mutators	setter
setter is public mutators method used in object-oriented programming which gives new value to a private member of a class

7481596
gif	png
everything works fine when i choose a jpg png gif

7481606
sorting	filtering
so make sure you have an index on all columns that you use for sorting order by or filtering where and check if your table cache is large enough to keep your table in memory

7481699
submit	submission
from there the form submission have to be made via buttons that don t actually reload the page but merely submit a ajax query and i think it just manipulates the iframe

7481704
hide	show
jquery has a convenient overload for the toggle method which show or hide an element where you can write the show condition inline

7481725
implements	extends
anyway you have to implements extends the accountcontroller and viewmodel that you get with a new mvc project

7481725
iprincipal	iidentity	super	extends
if you want a super integration of your fields you can consider to extends the iidentity and iprincipal interfaces

7481762
google-chrome	firefox
here is working solution for google-chrome and probably firefox

7481776
automake	autotools
we need the autotools instead of handwritten makefiles because a standard-compliant makefile generated by automake offers a lot of useful targets under well-known names and providing all these targets by hand is tedious and error-prone

7481776
automake	autotools
so even though i m a bit late with this advice for this question do yourself a favor and use the autotools and automake

7481824
jobs	cron
what i want to avoid i don t know if is posible is to have some background task scattered around my platformm some of them using cron others using timertask db jobs etc.. becoming difficult to maintain

7481895
put	get	post	get	post	put
okay i couldn t be bothered to comment all of the answers here so i ll say it to you even though this post will probably get put down as its not a direct help

7481895
post	get
you need to be very careful when including files from a post or get request

7481906

i ve made a stored procedure which gets the file to download and call this from an application process ajax callback and with firebug i can see the post response but i wouldn t know how to get this displayed as an image

7481928
stdout	stderr
if you choose to log errors to stderr then it might be useful to call you prog like this stderr goes to one file stdout goes to another file and to screen

7481951
subtract	add
bitxor 2 x wil either add 2 or subtract 2 to from x so you have to solve both

7481953
implements	extends
but since a basket might provide some of the same interface as a product cost weight it d be more likely to implements this as a collection of products rather than extends the product class

7481986
screens	tablet
i want to make an application with a lot of different screens and the app should be available for a tablet and for a phone so the fragments will help me a lot here

7482030
google-chrome	firefox
i have this code below that works on firefox google-chrome but doesn t work on ie

7482032
ubuntu	debian	smarthost	exim
that is configure your local mail server in debian exim is the default and i guess it s the same for ubuntu to use a smarthost for mail delivery and configure it for rewriting such that all mail from your system is locally forwarded to the accounts of the people dealing with your mysql slaves and these people are aliased to external addresses

7482113
hide	show
what i do myself in order to help me to think is to show and hide dependencies associations or inheritances

7482113
hide	show
it means that i can click on the diagram background and select hide dependencies and then select show associations etc...i can also click on a class and see all related classes having dependencies associations etc...with this class

7482188
super	extends
you need to extends the permissionevaluator - this allows you to have super custom logic for determining access rights - you can check the type of the object or check for a particular id or check if the user invoking the method is the user that created the object etc.

7482266
hide	show
i want my keyboard to show when i m searching and hide when i m doing the actual search or when i touch click outside the uisearchbar

7482280
implements	extends
implements extends and enforce its value to respect the combined max

7482307
.htaccess	httpd.conf
if you re using php as an apache module you can put a directive in an .htaccess or httpd.conf restricted to the file or files you want

7482342
min	max
you have an index on startdate so it could start scanning that from the beginning doing key lookups back to the base table and as soon as it finds the first matching row stop as it has found the min startdate similarly the max can be found with another scan starting the other end of the index and working backwards

7482372
udp	tcp
network engine fully functional tcp udp http tunneling etc.

7482376
rdf	owl
there are formats like rdf owl etc

7482386
macports	homebrew
package updates homebrew or macports

7482386
libxml2	libxml-ruby
libxml-ruby is compiled against a specific version of the library libxml2 if the library is then updated it will sometimes work for a bit but generally be unstable like this

7482424
width	height
you may also have to adjust the defautl style applied to the template to set a height and width for the panningtitlelayer

7482445
implements	extends
you can implements your own custom item renderer extends uicomponent or label for instance and implements iitemrenderer

7482459
post	get
once you get the pdt or ipn message you need to post back to paypal with your unique auth_id and the tx token they sent in the original message

7482516
switching	screens
but i would strongly advise against this practice because you will greatly annoy your users because every time they switching back into your app they will be greeted by a splash screens that requires them to wait a second before they can carry on with their task

7482537
thin	unicorn
you ll find other similar questions which end with switching to unicorn thin or something similar and proxying from nginx

7482554
post	get
edit best way could be that there is an auto-incremented column i ll name it postid which helps us to get the first five post for each thread

7482574
kde	gnome
if xdg-open is not available you can also use gnome-open for gnome and kfmclient for kde

7482594
versioning	upgrade
previously my all queries were running fine in ci versioning 2.0 but when i upgrade to 2.0.3 some of my select queries were broken

as an example and i already have an asynchronous task that runs in the back ground and in 2.1 i could have getter and setter in there

7482623
explode	substr
strrpos + substr pathinfo explode +end are examples

7482672
switching	screens
applicationâ s first screens because users are likely to switching among

7482761

min	max
note that spline method gives you an approximation polynom that is both smooth - so it is easy to find local min maxs and both as close as possible to the original function and thus the local min max should be very close to the true value in the original function

7484974
min	max
to improve accuracy after finding the local mins max in the generated polynom for each x0 which represent a local min max you should look in all x such that to find the real min max this point represents

it s also very dangerous and can incur a number of undefined behaviors if you simply tried to use c-library functions like memcpy to copy c++ objects into heap memory allocated with malloc

7509367

if you are going to work with just malloc and free a nice rule of thumb to avoid undefined behavior pitfalls is to keep the objects you allocate and deallocate with malloc and free to pod-types

and lately i have noticed that each firefox google-chrome safari and ie 9 all yield the same results with the standard box-shadow and text-shadow and similar css styles

7512933
client-side	server-side
requestfactory sends only diffs what you changed on the object on the client-side so it needs to apply those diffs to an object on the server-side before calling your service method and that s why it needs to find the object by its id

7512937
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

the permissions on the lib folder are identical to the rest of the directory tree

7512960

with this you encode a source string in an md5 hash in string format too

7513334
folder	directory
add the trunk folder and commit it in the working copy directory

int	double
if you read the error message it says that you need to define a constructor in your class invoice that takes the parameters and double followed by int

7513367
post	get

7513410
free	realloc
naturally you must do the same for free realloc and whatever else you re using

7513440

7515901
put	get
i then wanted to put the function in a class so i can get up and running with classes

7515903

7516065
versioning	upgrade
i recommend to replace upgrade the jsf versioning of the servers in question to a newer versioning than the ones mentioned in those reports or to ship jsf libraries along with the webapp itself and add web.xml context parameters to instruct the server to use the webapp bundled jsf instead

7516790
pull	push
you might want to use push pull instead - the messages will then be queued up automatically without requiring replies in between as an aside i think this also automatically allows you to use multiple workers for scaling and load balancing

7516828

7518167
webclient	httpwebrequest
does wcf have any relation to httpwebrequest webclient etc

hash	salt
in this case a device should know its own serial number and be able to add or append some secret usually called salt to the serial and then hash or encrypt it

7518235
for-loop	arrays
you must use the vararraylowbound and vararrayhighbound functions to get the bounds of the variant arrays returned by the enumerateobjects function and then you can use a for-loop to iterate over the elements of the arrays

pop-up	dialog
when i do a git svn rebase and the dialog window pop-up to pick squash etc. the upstream dropdown box always defaults to fetch_head now

7518564
quicksort	mergesort
edit an additional related question would be if it s faster to use insertionsort in a pipeline manner to process the generated xpath results right when they are received or to wait until the whole result has been generated and use quicksort or mergesort

7518564
cpu	processors
in general i hope sorting and then computing the intersection of two lists is faster than o n 2 for the search of each item in the xpath result list even if the list is divided by the number of cpu processors available

google-chrome	firefox
the other option is to look at the web audio api in google-chrome or the audio data api in firefox

under the libraries tab click new folder and browse to the directory that contains settings then click apply

7521640

try moving your hover setup into the load callback function after you set width and height

7521877

since you are using 4 chars 4 x 8 byte memory you can instead use a 32bit int which will only require one memory address

7527541
ppl	tbb
in theory to switch from ppl to tbb you just need to replace a path from where you take ppl.h with tbb the header comes in and of course link with the tbb dll

7527541

7527774

the irony is that it is probably the versioning for which it was most needed the requirement for ie6 compatiblity with internal web apps has been one of the biggest reasons given for corporations refusing to upgrade from it

7527866
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

fold	combinators
these are just map fold operations in most cases and by making that a combinators rather than built-in syntax you can do things such as take two existing loops and directly combine them in multiple ways--nest one inside the other do one after the other and so on--by just applying a combinators rather than juggling a whole bunch of code around

if i was using a for-loop i would just start it at the end of the arrays and print out the arrays starting with the last element and ending with the first

7536808
width	height
i think you need to set the width and height of the wrapper uicomponent instance

7536808
width	height
uicomponents don t automatically resize to their content so it s showing up with a width and height of 0

7536841
width	height
the width of the image is fixed at 150px but i want the image to have height equal to content s height

7536851
filtering	grouping
this gives you a functional way of dealing with collections of data in a very sql-like manner select grouping filtering etc.

7536875
width	height
if you will not specify the width it will set the width equal to height as well

7536895
zlib	libpng
in my custom xcode 4 template i have a checkbox option to include the zlib libpng license at the top of each source file

7536900
width	height
the window border may be included in the width height for example in one scenario

7536948
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
is currently blank as in visit in google-chrome firefox opera and see just whitespace no content

7536950
switching	screens
if that s the case using the left and right buttons are okay as they are to switching between categories and not the previous screens

7536971
put	get
your swf should just be a client that displays that and allows players to select choices - do not put any game play logic inside it unless you want it to get hacked with cheat engine in 3 seconds

7536985
direct3d	directx
i believe its a software rending fallback although newer ones might be directx wrappers and it s a fairly old opengl version 1.1 since it predates their own attempt to dominate the market via direct3d

7536985
ati	nvidia
most modern desktop linux implementations will have some opengl support possibly via the proprietary official ati nvidia intel drivers

7536988
hprof	jprofiler
this indicates some sort of a memory leak yet even after dumping hprof and using mat and jprofiler i can t pinpoint it

7537000
spotify	rdio
it seems that music.listens only works for a certain set of applications such as mog rdio spotify slacker radio etc

7537003
cakephp	lithium
i m trying to migrate my cakephp apps to lithium and already use doctrine and twig as plugin but now i m also want to integrate zend libraries into apps and i have to integrate the zend helper libraries

7537021
for-loop	arrays
i m not sure what but for whatever reason when i initialize the number of rows and columns and do a nested for-loop on the arrays i created to implement this structure i get what appears to be more than a hundred rows and 30+ columns when i should just be getting a five by five board

7537021
min	max
i m also trying to specify a max and min value for my rand function but it appears that there isn t a way to do this

7537038
comparator	comparable
you do however have to write your own sort method and i d do this and have it use the comparator helper class or comparable interface to help with the sorting

7537085
svg	vml
ironically the vml format you mentioned is now deprecated in favor of svg

7537093
uitableview	uipickerview
the best way is to let the user pick from a uipickerview or uitableview with the state names you want the user to pick from

7537098
post	get
of course if you re not adverse to cookies you can set your own and just use that to propogate the user identifier rather that the get post methods outlined there

7537110
sprockets	jammit
this sort of thing depends on your platform but in the rails world you want to look at jammit or sprockets which is now part of rails

7537162
width	height
i ve got elements with different height but fixed width in a container element

7537165
google-chrome	firefox
with the recent firefox and google-chrome browser releases the default status bar has been taken from us to free up more screen space and de-clutter the ui

7537200
google-chrome	firefox
the code works fine on firefox and google-chrome but on internet explorer 8 it doesn t works and i get the following error

7537214
google-chrome	firefox
on a 2011 macbook pro i5 the average split in firefox takes 92.81ms and in google-chrome 237.27ms

7537264
post	get
should this be a post or a get

7537267
jar	war
package is a simple command used for simple single projects where you only have to create a jar war

7537312
getter	setter
i want to persist those lists from one class to another in our android app with the help of serializable interface and setter and getter methods

7537350
getter	setter
if later on you find the need to access the backing field you can explicitly declare it and reimplement the getter and setter using that field without breaking your interface

7537352
getter	setter
if you are not notifying or doing anything else then the automatic getter setter method is the quicker to develop that is not claiming it is the fastest or slowest to execute though

7537422
jar	war
if you want to customize this war you need the war respectivelly jar plugin

7537445
put	get	post	get	post	put
when you post the form to somethingscontroller and yes you should post it will fire the create action and there you ll get the value from params which is a hash--you access its values with and put it in session

7537481
hide	show
another option to disabling each control is to create a new div that is transparent but sits on top of the part you want to disable then just show hide that div from the code behind

7537512
post	get
i can t seem to find a way to combine fb s selector with my form so that upon submission i get post info that combines the user id s selected with the choices from my form

7537551
hide	show
so basically you would load the whole form at once then hide parts of it when someone clicks next to move on to the next steps in the processes it would show you could even animate a slide the hidden part and hide what they just completed

7537619
free	malloc
first the way you allocated your nodes in blocks you always have to free the whole block with exactly the same start address as you got from malloc

7537619
free	malloc
modern run-times have quite efficient garbage collection behind malloc free for its buffers not for user allocations and it will be hard for you to achieve something better better meaning more efficient but still guaranteeing the consistency of your data

7537642
ant	maven
only maven plugin and ant task support project structures with modules

7537655
width	height
you have to resize the image based to screen width and height to fit to the screen you are are running

7537660
google-chrome	firefox
tested with internet explorer 9 firefox 6 google-chrome 14

7537694
calloc	malloc
even at that times there were methods to obtain large pages from the system that where zeroed out by default so efficiency was not so much a problem with calloc than for malloc

7537744
mongohq	mongolab
mongohq mongolab are some of the dedicated managed mongo hosting services available

7537750
box-shadow	background-size
it s not the animation - the animation ran just fine when i had the external css disabled but it s the browser struggling to render the css3 properties namely border-radius background-size and box-shadow in this case over such a short period of time

7537760
sorting	filtering
and we can provide facility like sorting just like a explorer filtering column re-ordering etc

7537765
range	max
the first textfield max range is 7

7537771
width	height
i fixed camera width and height

7537785
superclass	subclassing
to say that another way this idiom allows a superclass such as an abstract factory to define methods whose argument types and return types are in terms of the subclassing type not the superclass type

7537802
range	max
the first textfield max range is 7

7537853
fadein	fadeout	src	attr
at first we set the display property to none via javascript so customers without would just see the image after the fadein we fadeout our image and change the image src with the attr function

7537865
width	height
you had fixed the height and width of the imageview

7537883
put	get
you should put it in an input type value and then in the server - use request id to get the val

7537959
outputstream	inputstream
now given that unless there is some way to somehow coerce an inputstream into a file suggests that there is not and i have tried looking around the java documentation as well this approach won t work if the reader on the other end of the outputstream receives that avro container file i m not sure why they allowed one to output avro binary container files to an arbitrary outputstream without providing a way to read them from the corresponding inputstream on the other end but that s beside the point

7538000
cruisecontrol	jenkins
you can use cruisecontrol similiar to jenkins

7538000
jobs	cron
but if you are running just a script you can have it executed with periodically with windows schedular or cron jobs

7538144
width	height
other thing i noticed is that you gave the textview the width and height as wrap content which will only take the size of the text

7538185
google-chrome	firefox
if it s a high traffic or commercial site i d definitely consider a commercial server certificate from an acknowledged ca since using a self-signed certificate will generate those ugly red errors you might see in google-chrome or firefox sometimes

7538191
accessor	properties
if you specify nonatomic a synthesized accessor for an object properties simply returns the value directly

7538207
int	chars
the original number length is about 10 chars which seem to be bigger then php s limits for int

7538222
rss	feed
i have a drupal site and i want to add to the rss feed a view count

7538270
children	parent
with clipping enabled children of a node should be clipped when leaving the area of the parent s bounding box

7538270
children	parent
for example i wand to have a node containing a set of text nodes as children which can be scrolled up and down withing it s parent bounding box and should be clipped when leaving the area of the parent s bounding box

7538332
post	get
however when looking at heroku i came across this post detailing what to do to get rails 3.1 working on heroku

7538400
rss	feed
i have a bit of javascript code that is getting loading in some data from an rss feed

7538400
rss	feed
i then need to process that data and then get some more data from another rss feed but it is dependant on the results of the first feed

7538434
pull	push
i have web application that have to access local resources files folders to be able to do git clone pull push

7538448
int	chars
if there are added two unsigned chars variables there should be overflow result should be 3 and then it should convert from unsigned chars 3 to int 3

7538482
rss	feed
the trick is to treat the loading of the rss feed like what they are asynchronous events

7538513
width	margin
the w3c specification says that the width of a box is margin + border + padding + width

7538530
qpainter	qimage	qtcore	qtgui
although qimage is in qtcore qpainter and the text drawing routines are in qtgui

7538547
width	height
i have a price start point of â 15 this would relate to the minimum width and height 100 x 50

7538547
width	height
the records already exist for each width and height permitation

7538550
spaces	delimiter
this dynamic column c would obviously have to be a read-only field because there is no way to determine if a spaces is a delimiter or a regular character

7538579
int	chars
for example for types smaller than int if two types chars and short int are added they are promoted to int before any arithmetic operation and result is an int type

7538579
unsigned	short
â 4.5 1 - an rvalue of type char signed char unsigned char short

7538579
unsigned	short
int or unsigned short

7538603
width	height
once i fill the modal content i ll get the height and width of the content and update the simplemodal

7538676
vim	emacs
write a filter or do it with emacs vim or your favorite editor to substitute the call report var1 to a statement that pushes the hash into an array something like push all_hashes

7538686
vim	emacs
emacs and vim can do what you want

7538692
stdout	fflush
stdout is normally line-buffered that means that the buffer is fflush to the device when it sees a n

7538692
stdout	fflush
you could as well call fflush stdout but it is cumbersome

7538692
put	get
the morale of the story is when you printf for debugging purposes always put a n at the end of every line or you can get partial mixed contents

7538701
super	extends
i always don t call super when i extends sprite

7538701
super	extends
till now i don t have any problem and i have never seen code which call super in constructor which class extends sprite

7538703
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
i can retrieve the qgraphicsscene size perfectly fine namely 2100x2970 like i set however the geometry of the qgraphicsview widget is incorrect

7538703
width	height
but the widget showing the scrollbars and the scene through the viewport just doesn t provide me with the correct widget width and height

7538703
qgraphicsview	qwidget
in the qtdesigner the qgraphicsview widget shows to have qwidget geometry of 1126x643

7538834
centos	linux
basically its only for linux centos 5 platforms

7538840
post	get
therefore there are no cookies get variables post variables or anything of the sort

7538863
vim	emacs
on unix emacs and vim are really the only games in town when it comes to sophisticated command-line editors so a good java mode for one of those is what you want

7538879
udp	tcp
i m used in deploying console base application that acts as a stand alone application a mixed of tcp and udp servers with custom protocol

7538879
udp	tcp
now my application will not just support a custom tcp udp server inside but also web functionality for management

7538919
versioning	upgrade
i recently 5 or 6 months ago had to upgrade to versioning 5.x and did so without any problems

7538988
pull	push
one of many clients who have random pull addresses push a request to a server at 5555

7538988
pull	push
i assume that the push pull architecture is suited for this

7539040
int	boolean
int and decimal numbers boolean values should be managed

7539047
innodb	myisam
all previous benchmarks had a fatal flaw that one the char 1 table was myisam and all other were innodb

7539053
int	chars
int are much faster than doing string comparison but i think your better of using chars m or f

7539067
kryo	avro
one piece of advice - make sure you use a really good binary serialization library avro protocol buffers kryo etc. couple with a decent communications framework netty

7539149
cvs	svn
the idea of a revision like you d have with svn or cvs doesn t map all that well in git

7539199
fadein	fadeout
i want the welcome message to fadeout slowly and then the other div to fadein its place and then fadeout - obviously when the welcome box no longer exists

7539202
puts	gets
instead of worrying about the newline at the end of the file it puts the newline before the line to be printed except for the first line which gets handled outside the for-loop

7539208
vim	emacs
both vim and emacs will read â œeditor hintsâ in the file text usually embedded in a comment that contains commands or settings for the editor to obey when opening the file

7539208
vim	emacs
for hints that will work with both emacs and vim place a comment block at the end of the file

7539218
versioning	upgrade
after a lot of trial and error and pulling of hair i upgrade to the latest versioning 3-8-7-rc1 and tried again this does work but isn t ideal for all instances occasions

7539234
fadein	fadeout
you need to call the additional fadein and fadeout inside of a callback function to the first one

7539276
rss	feed
to actually read the channel i think you can use either the rss feed for your channel or the youtube data api and parse this than let the user choose the sperate videos

7539294
screens	tablet	screens	mdpi	tablet	mdpi
the reason those two really high resolutions exist in mdpi is because they are only used on tablet which have a larger screens size...so the dpi rating works out to still be in the midrange

7539337
inherited	properties
for example if i have the customers table the wizard will create â œcustomersrowâ class that inherited from global.system.data.datarow with the corresponding fields as properties

7539362
namenode	hdfs
hdfs-site.xml has configuration settings for hdfs daemons the namenode the secondary namenode and the datanodes.

portrait	landscape
i can successfully start my device on landscape mode but my framebuffer stays on portrait mode no matter how i rotate it or force its rotation

7539386
implements	extends
i had to work around this problem as well my solution was to implements an adapterview by myself to emulate the gridview behevior without extends scrollview

7539414
post	get
i was planning on using ajax post to info to ci but so far unable to get it to work

7539454

unsigned	short
where backc and forgc are given integers and the data type word is just a typedef for an unsigned short int

7539626
min	max
tell me if i m wrong but you re not look at the case max a i min

7539626
min	max
in decreasing order or increasing order it might works but it s pretty useless since for a sorted list you can find min and max with this espression

7539658
google-chrome	firefox
i ve researched around this subject for quite some time but i can t find out which method or code is causing me problems with ie7 and ie8 - it works fine in ie9 google-chrome and firefox

min	max
i need reflections on my implementations of the c++11 variadic versions of std min std max

7539857
min	max
here are my two alternatives for std min where std max is implemented analogously by just replacing std min with std max

7539892
stateless	stateful
when we need to use the ejb services in a managed bean we just add a stateless stateful or singleton annotation

7539892

7540173
ssl	https
you should be using off-the-shelf tools like ssl https whatever to solve this problem rather than doing it wrong yourself

7540194
ati	nvidia
i could also imagine that it depends on whether the two gpus are controlled by the same driver or not or even worse let the machine have an ati as well as an nvidia card both supporting different gl versions

7540201
rss	feed
to show the latest articles from the blog you could fetch the rss feed of the wordpress installation and display it in your rails application

getter	setter
the problem is when an item is clicked i have getter and setter class that gets the url for a particular item and passes it to the launching activity like this.

i recommend you to use image url instead of using hide show

7540433
try-catch	exception-handling
i figured that the try-catch block around the external plugin loading procedure would suffice but obviously it doesn t since after catching the first exception-handling the finalizer is still invoked on the gc thread which finally crashes the application

7540440
margin	text-align
use text-align padding margin float clear and positioning rules to get your html elements to appear where you want them to on the page

7540477
put	get
for state objects so that all created states get put in the

7540496
getter	setter
idrawntext would only expose getter but not setter but its documentation would explicitly state that objects implementing idrawntext may or may not be mutable via other means

7540498
put	get
one option is to create an httpmodule and put your code in there since it would get to the page requests before the actual page starts processing

implements	extends
i haven t checked is set up madam and implements a custom iusersecurityauthority by extends madam.usersecurityauthoritybase to check the credentials against ldap

7540756
int	double
the problem is most probably that globals- var is a float or double convert it to an int or some other integer-type and it should work

7540781
folder	directory
anyway the question is when i publish my asp.net website it creates the publish folder and publishes files such as web.config and the images directory

my requirement is to populate the calendar with events from different websites which publish an rss feed of their events

7541266
rss	feed
the problem lies in the fact that the rss feed from different websites are not consistent with each other

7541272
button	checkbox
as a solution i thought to use adorner for that user control mypopup the problem is my user control mypopup contains button and checkbox after applying adorner these controls are not accessible

7541300
uiview	uiwindow
uiwindow inherits from uiview

7541300
uiview	subviews
uiview has the subviews property

7541324
cpython	pypy
as you suggest in your update your problem was that you were using py.py which is for running pypy s interpreter on top of cpython

7541324
cpython	pypy
pypy has a higher recursion limit than cpython normally

7541327
width	height
i want to open a new window with width 600 and height 300

7541373
min	max	range	max	range	min
the usual approach i use for this generate n unique random numbers is to fill a vector with the total range of numbers for you here min - max random_shuffle that and then just pull as many values as i need from the front that

7541377
put	get
however if i put it on highscoreviewcontroller.h i must put the implementation in choosecharacter.m or i get

7541378
implements	modifiers
however in c++ i could implements a better encapsulation when passing objects to methods with const modifiers

7541382
bmp	png
in example i send only formula from server and client creates image based on it which i can use as jpg png bmp background and do repeating etc

7541386
glfw	freeglut
the two cross-platform libraries that do the least other than creating opengl windows are freeglut and glfw

7541386
glfw	freeglut
freeglut has about a 5.2mb distribution after unzipping while glfw has a 2.6mb distro

7541415
ubuntu	linux
i am trying to create an array of type int of length 10 6 in c++ dev c++ which i used to create comfortably on my last laptop 32 bit windows 7 ultimate ubuntu linux 2gb ram and every other environment i have programmed on it should take around 3.5 mb of ram

7541423
inherited	subclassing
in you can actually auto-register the subclassing with an inherited callback

7541429
int	chars
you can convert your chars to its int equivalent by subtracting 0 from it

7541440
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
you generalize the wrong way from the specific debian ubuntu to the generic all linux distros

7541465
onclick	onfocus	onclick	onscroll
you need to check all event handling attributes - not just onclick but everything onfocus onload even onerror and onscroll can be hacked

7541470
mouseup	mousedown
for a click event to occur it must always follow this series of events in the order of occurrence mousedown event then mouseup

7541470
mouseup	mousedown
any number of other mouse events can occur at any time between the mousedown or mouseup events

7541502
onclick	onfocus
but as soon as you remove the readonly attribute onfocus or onclick the input field scrolls in focus again

7541597
loops	if-statement
besides the two reads inside your loops i assume you want to have a block after your if-statement

7541628
getter	setter
i want my facade to have url getter and setter

7541660
puts	gets
my problem is that when the snakes body gets put up in the gui it puts it directly on top of the head instead of 12 spaces behind it

7541722
getter	setter
the are essentially methods a getter and a setter that pass through the value

7541737
width	height
so in order for the size of the views to be determined in a way that is completely proportional to the size of their parent and thus to each other as well you must also set their height or width for a horizontal linearlayout to 0

7541737
width	height
in this case the left-over space is in fact the entire height width of the linearlayout which is then divvied up proportionally among the children based on their relative weights

7541768
fink	homebrew
maybe homebrew or fink also have gcc and the like included

7541844
shadowing	named
i believe the reasoning behind it is that it allows the parameters to be named nicer by preventing shadowing of member variables

7541851
jlist	jtable
currently i have a jtable jlist and a jbutton

7541851
awt	swing
after reading up on swing a bit i assumed it was due to my editing the table model from a thread that was not the awt dispatch thread and promptly put the lines that edit the table model in a swingutilities.invokelater runnable block

7541882
wtl	atl
i ve seen many wrappers for the windows api mfc atl wtl etc. but none of them seem to use exception-handling -- you still have to check the error codes for most functions which is easy to forget or to omit due to laziness

7541938
post	get
i wish to rewrite a mysql query which use month and year functions to display all the post from a certain month which goes to my function as a y-m-d parameter format but i don t know how can i get the last day of the given month date

7541943
folder	directory
i guess this is a beginner s problem but i was trying to check if a directory exists in my documents folder on the iphone

7542007
mvp	presenter
if you re using winforms take a look at the mvp model view presenter pattern which helps separate code related to data business logic and user interface

7542042
for-loop	loops
to prevent it facebook adds the for-loop code to the front of the string so that if you try to eval it you just get an infinite loops and a hung browser

7542044
domxpath	domdocument
you should highly consider using domdocument and domxpath to parse your document instead of regular expressions

7542044
domxpath	domdocument
domdocument domxpath example

7542051
srp	principles
i am trying to learn the single responsibility principles srp but it is being quite difficult as i am having a huge difficult to figure out when and what i should remove from one class and where i should put organize it

7542073
accessor	properties
you should then always use accessor for all properties whether they are public or private except in init and dealloc

7542110
background-image	box-shadow
you could do something sneaky like making a gradient the background-image of an element that s behind the one you re setting this box-shadow on which you could use make it appear like the shadow is darker on one side

7542124
switching	screens
in order to switching the current panels being displayed depending on where the user is in the menu i made each menu screens aka

7542190
gridview	objectdatasource
to administer the users i got a gridview aspxgridview from devexpress that i populate from an objectdatasource

7542212
octal	decimal
600 octal eqals 384 decimal

7542218
button	checkbox
i was thinking of trying to change the text on one button group to strings like one two etc but that introduces a bigger problem with how i have created the checkbox in the first place

7542233
octal	decimal
open expects you to give it a value for the mode in octal not decimal this is why you basically always see an extra leading zero when dealing with modes in c code since in c you write an octal literal with a leading zero

7542233
octal	decimal
600 in decimal is 1130 in octal

7542235
tcpclient	networkstream
i am sure it is not too complicated to write one myself but presence of the timeout properties on both tcpclient and networkstream kinda suggests it should be already working that way

7542251
serializable	deserialization
it is generally slow to do a serializable deserialization

7542255
jcheckbox	jradiobutton
use jradiobutton for this rather than jcheckbox since i think it is gui standard to have a set of jradiobutton that only allow one selection rather than a set of jcheckbox

7542293
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately this screws up the padding of my width 100 div in the latests versions of safari firefox and google-chrome probably all browsers too

7542317
box-sizing	border-box
add box-sizing border-box

7542326
superclass	subclassing
but class clusters are different than factory method in that the superclass knows about all the subclassing and it is the superclass that callers interact with

7542333
margin	height
the padding and negative margin seem to cancel each other out rendering the proper height as long as the data content inside the divs doesn t spill over the 500px limit pretty nifty but it obviously has a huge limitation as is

7542410
unsigned	short
see also convert a vector unsigned char to vector unsigned short

7542438
hash	md5
i keep an array of md5 hash of intermediate expression

7542438
yacc	bison
for other languages our old friends lex yacc or the newer bison might be of help

7542456
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
however i have a specific page on my site that i want to render in a standards compliant way in firefox google-chrome opera and safari but due to a very annoying issue involving zoom levels in the microsoft ssrs report viewer 10.0.0.0 control see here for a more complete description i need to render the page in compatibility view mode in ie9

7542500
width	height
follwing post explains what you can do to fit text in a div with certain width and height

7542525
fadein	fadeout
changed your framework to jquery since i don t know much about mootools you can change the fadein and fadeout effect for whatever you want

7542529
int	chars
you can use an int scaled as necessary or convert to chars form

7542542
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly in google-chrome but doesn t work at all in firefox greasemonkey

7542546
post	get
he was maintaining an mvc solution which had a common input form with a controller with two actions a get action and a post action

7542546
post	get
both actions were returning the same view which was filled with inline logic and conditionals checking whether it was a post or a get

7542568
fileinputstream	objectinputstream
if you want to read objects then you would create an objectinputstream from the fileinputstream you got

7542628
subtract	add
i want to do this so i could parse the numbers into doubles and add and subtract them later on

7542637
int	double
see how can i extract the mantissa of a double for aprogrammer s explanation of the frexp function which will decompose a float into its int exponent and a double mantissa

7542647
ubuntu	centos
and i have this working on centos 5.5 ubuntu 10.4lts and win2k3 environments fyi

7542711
width	height
paul s code set the element s width and height to the window s width and height

7542754
dropbox	icloud
however since users will only have limited free icloud storage and many won t want to pay i am also implementing dropbox for backup restore only

7542770
switching	screens
after you ve drawn the frame into the texture you can go ahead and bind the texture and draw a quad over the screens remembering of course to switching the framebuffer back to your regular framebuffer

7542777
post	get
i specify the method as post but it uses get anyway

7542788
oncreate	onstart
once the user has exited your application and re-enters or presses the icon on the homescreen oncreate followed by onstart and onresume will be called for your first activity so you do not need any logic in onrestart your code in oncreate will do the setting up for you as it did the first time

7542788
onstart	ondestroy
onrestart is only called when the application goes from the stopped state onstop has been called but not ondestroy to the started state onstart is called but onresume has not yet

7542811
gif	png
i m trying to combine about 45 png files to make a gif or to make a video or some type of movie or animated image

7542838
calloc	malloc
what you can do is declare the variable as a pointer instead of an array the use malloc or calloc to allocate space for the array and store the result in your variable

7542838
calloc	malloc
i used calloc instead of malloc here because a static array would be filled with 0s by default and this would ensure that the code was consistent

7542920
octal	binary	octal	decimal
i m making a table with decimal binary octal and hexadecimal columns

7542922
hide	show
or maybe is there any other way to do what i need show element 1 wait hide element1 wait show element 2 wait hide element 2 wait restart

7542969
hide	show
you want to use visibility not display to hide and show because visibility maintains the allocated space of the cell

7542972
jython	pypy
other implementation of python such as jython or pypy may behave differently i m less clear on their details

7543021
put	get
you don t appear to be using the formatted name as the key when calling get on the map meaning the keys you pass to get are not the same as those you passed to put

7543024
gson	jackson
for parsing json like this twitter api users show response i ve been using jackson and gson java libraries as candidates to do this work

7543024
gson	jackson
i m only interested in a small subset of properties of the json so gson was nice because of its very concise syntax but i m losing an internal battle to continue to use gson as jackson is already used elsewhere in our application and it has documented better performance which i concede are both good reasons to lose gson

7543027
implements	extends
public class ringtones extends activity implements onclicklistener

7543036
uiview	uiwindow
every video tutorial and book i have read displays the following code to add a uiview to the uiwindow

7543036
uiview	uiwindow
my understanding of the above code is that a view which is an instance of a uiview is added to the window which is an instance of uiwindow

7543036
uiview	uiwindow
however somebody kindly pointed out to me that uiwindow inherits addsubview method from uiview

7543036
uiview	uiwindow
if uiwindow inherits the addsubview method of uiview then how can it go back up the inheritance tree

7543082
client-side	server-side
as chris cooper said make sure that you also do server-side validation because it s pretty trivial for a user to turn off javascript and avoid your client-side validation rules

7543144
touchesbegan	touchesended
then you can override touchesbegan touchesended and manage all your touches there

7543154
sudo	passwd
to grant permission temporary you can run make with sudo make install and enter your passwd

7543164
hash	md5
i always just hash the file using md5 or sha1 and use that as a filename

7543178
int	double	int	boolean	int	chars
an important thing to understand is that java does not explicitly specify pointers - rather whenever a non-primitive not chars byte int double float long boolean short is passed to a function it is passed as a reference

7543178
for-loop	loops
you can t just loops through with a for-loop for all of them because then the last one s next would throw an indexoutofboundsexception

7543194
capitalize	capitalization	punctuation	words
so effectively what this does is capitalize each words in the string and each blank string and lonely bit of punctuation too but again that s not important -- capitalization doesn t change characters that have no concept of case

7543205
uiview	uiwindow
just remember a uiwindow is simply a uiview with additional behaviors and data

7543207
post	get
i will post my upstart script below which is basically the same as from the website above with some path changes but when i run start jobname i just get an error start unknown job jobname

7543212
put	get
i believe you are supposed to just use the get and put methods where the get methods parameters would be the key for what you re trying to get and the put method s parameter would just be the entity you created s object

7543224
teamcity	dotcover
jetbrains teamcity has a free version that includes their dotcover technology as well as an mspec runner

7543236
versioning	upgrade
it looks like apple is trying to force developers to pay an unnecessary upgrade to lion by refusing to allow xcode 4+ to be downloaded on any other versioning of mac os thus i m left with xcode 3.x

7543237
chunked	transfer-encoding
mime-version 1.0 rets-version rets 1.8 rets-server interealty-rets 1.5.247.0 transfer-encoding chunked cache-control private private max-age 0 date sun 25 sep 2011 00 45 51 gmt set-cookie asp.net_sessionid jt11w155vitdtlnwt2p3l345

7543266
ssl	https
unless you use https and ssl this is inherently insecure since an attacker can pre-emptively replace your javascript with malicious javascript that sends the user s password to an evil server then does everything else normally

7543272
hash	md5
you could store your password as a one way hash ie md5

7543306
fadein	fadeout
i tried to use the fadein and fadeout effect as you can see in this page

7543378
folder	directory
i noticed that one of the first thing it does is enumerate through the directory structure of the tiles folder to find out the available tiles

7543382
clang	llvm
llvm clang could be hard choice for 8bit computer

7543394
post	get
i m trying to send a http post request to a google server and get the response

7543396
udp	tcp
have a look at using udp and tcp adapters in spring integration 2.0 m3

7543402
post	put
i am able to put an add comments form in a post page but i want to also learn how to add comments by going to a new page with an add comments form

7543447
children	parent
now the children list items are also tabbed the submenu is inheriting the style from the tabbed parent

7543448
post	get
when you are redirecting to the comments controller pass the post id and get it from comments controller

7543452
stdout	stderr
i ve tried a several variants of the subprocess invocation as well as plain old os.system -- setting stdin stdout stderr to pipe or to various file handles changes nothing

7543540
dictionary	map
i have been able initialize a dictionary with the data for my map however i get a sigabrt whenever i try and run the code

7543588
boost	stl
depending on where you placed it but in almost all cases _crtdumpmemoryleaks will not show you the truth when using stl boost smart pointers

7543630
free	malloc
when i run valgrind i see that the memory i malloc ed for my ini strings is not free

7543640
mouseover	mouseout
however one thing i feel i need to make clear is that this doesn t start gif animation on mouseover pause it on mouseout and continue it when you mouseover it again

7543677
mamp	wamp
for example you could host a php website with apache and even have a developer hosting environment such as mamp lamp wamp

7543694
next	except
everything works well except i would like to remove the message next to the like button that reads

7543762
maven	pom.xml
for some maven pom.xml i found there are extensions in the build section

7543763
16-bit	64bit
in the book i ve learned that a nibble 4 bits 8 bits 1 byte next is a word - which is usually in groups 8 bits 16-bit 32 bits or 64bit so on and all this makes perfect sense to me

7543783
freebsd	opensolaris	freebsd	linux
the linux wacom project s source code has also been ported to other open-source operating systems such as opensolaris and freebsd

7543832
children	parent
if you don t reset the pointer to the constructor the all the children will report that the parent object is their constructor

7543900
post	get
you can handle it by server-side scripting when javascript is disabled you must do works by post get requests so you have to recode your web application

7544011
implements	extends
i first tried extends defaultdirectededge but then getedgetarget stopped working - probably because i need to implements start end vertices

7544045
rss	feed
i am making an app that will load stories from rss feed and store them locally in documents folder so they would be available offline

7544060
mouse	keyboard
there is an addon that can even remove the menu bar â you ll need to learn keyboard shortcuts this is a good idea anyway moving a hand to from the mouse is much slower

7544090
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
the qgraphicsview class is part of qt s graphics view framework and is used to visualize the contents of a qgraphicsscene in a scrollable viewport

7544091
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
a qgraphicsview is a class from the qt toolkit which provides a widget for displaying the contents of a qgraphicsscene

7544123
integer	unsigned
unsigned integer types the operand with the type of lesser integer

7544123
integer	unsigned
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank

7544123
integer	unsigned
operand with unsigned integer type

7544123
integer	unsigned
integer type then the operand with unsigned integer type is converted

7544123
integer	unsigned
otherwise both operands are converted to the unsigned integer type

7544183
width	height
although setting setting uiview of homecontroller s width and height to 320 x 320 px does not prevent the view to show full screen

7544196
post	get
use the post redirect get pattern

7544223
post	get
an http standard says you ought to make a get redirect after receiving post request

7544223
post	get
in case you want to handle post errors you can use post redirect get pattern

7544245
margin	height
just set the top and bottom margin of the webview according to the height of that buttons

7544279
hide	show
give class toggle to any element you want to apply show hide functionality and here s the js

7544304
dictionary	map
i d just use a hash map or dictionary since this is microsoft

7544343
ready	each
and after applying the site-patch to codebase you ll get ready to use code for each and every site

7544387
free	malloc
as it returns a character meaning if i use malloc a free would have to be used within another function

7544417
gwt	dwr
now gwt is not a straight out replacement for dwr

7544417
gwt	dwr
however if it s not and you d like to use gwt in a fashion more similar to dwr you can have your javascript code functions and your gwt java classes and you can call js functions from java via gwt s jsni api

7544425
mef	prism
so mef is not the same thing as prism

7544425
mef	prism
you can have prism modules loaded by mef

7544425
mef	prism
so summing up mef works great with sl and also with prism

7544457
qmainwindow	qwidget
this is working for me connect signals when initializing your qmainwindow or main qwidget as in the saltycrane example

7544469
post	get
i go to google.com post å žå in search and get such url

7544469
post	get
then i go to taobao.com post å žå to search and get url like this

7544491
vp8	3gp	mp4	webm
also video codec format h263 h264 mpeg-4 vp8 and container format 3gp mp4 webm are two different things

7544534
affinity	processors
far as i know it s nothing to do with processors affinity as i ve tried setting that to each of the 2 processors

7544549
equals	gethashcode
instead of using an array create a class to hold your data and define equals and gethashcode to compare the values

7544590
folder	directory
i did notice that the folder icon that results from using your code is different than the folder directory icon on the jfilechooser

7544598
rss	feed
your client can also create a page which is public and then just get its feed simply via rss no need to sign-in and no need for access token in this case

7544598
rss	feed
url for rss feed should be

7544608
google-chrome	firefox
we have customized ribbon js scripts that loads properly in ie and firefox but in google-chrome which is a requirement to use it due to its high response time it does not load the ribbon at the first instance

7544621
try-catch	exception-handling
your idea about how the try-catch works is correct when an exception-handling is thrown inside the try-block all the remaining code in it is skipped and it jumps directly into the catch-block

7544646
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
then objectinputstream or objectoutputstream to readobject or writeobject

7544744
pop-up	dialog
and if there is it pop-up with a dialog

7544759
google-chrome	firefox
i tried in firefox and google-chrome same results -- but it could be the browser acting up of course

7544768
folder	directory
only seems to recognise a directory if it is located in the same folder as the script

7544771
put	get
you could also use the recursive put and get commands to get and put data only when needed

7544821
folder	directory
assuming you have the image folder inside your template s directory if you re building a child-theme and the datepicker belongs to the parent you can use template_directory instead

7544833
hide	show
i m using jquery to show and hide elements upon user interaction

7544836
width	height
in my new application i want to have one linear layout width height xxxdip and green background

7544865
jboss	glassfish	jboss	resin	glassfish	resin
first step if you are using a java ee 6 compatible container like glassfish v3 resin 4 jboss 6 or 7 etc and you have put something like commons-el.jar in your web-inf remove it

7544891
maven	pom.xml
what i want to do is add those jars for jsf 2 icefaces2 in pom.xml file as maven dependencies

7544902
inherited	properties
nested types can access properties fields and methods of the containing type even those declared private and those inherited from base types

7544902
inherited	properties
when deriving from a base class the derived class inherited all except private methods properties and fields of the base class

7544902
inherited	properties
nested classes don t inherited anything but have access to everything in the containing class - even private fields properties and methods

7544913
public	protected
inheriting from a parent class does not allow a nested class to see its parent s private members and methods only protected and public ones

7544921
width	height
i could scale it down but that would be quite unprecise since width and height need different scaling which is hardly possible

7544962
couchbase	couchdb
so far the unql participants include sqlite couchdb and probably also couchbase but i think as time will go on and the specification will take it s form more vendors would join the effort to participate and support this unified querying language

7545010
mathml	mathjax
mathjax opensource javascript library to render maths support multiple syntaxes including mathml and latex

7545018
pull	push

tapestry	wicket
my recommendation is to pick 3 or 4 i d go with tapestry gwt spring mvc and wicket and then spend a couple days working through the introductory tutorial that each of them offers

7545158
keydown	keyup
the keypress event is different from the keyup and keydown events as it contains the key actually pressed

7545168
versioning	upgrade
i ve written it in a way so that updates and upgrade generally only involve uploading the new versioning via ftp and deleting the old one - i just don t touch the uploads or themes directories everything specific to the site is either there or in the database

7545267
nodevalue	innerhtml
i ve tried to use createelement div give it an id and the html as innerhtml and then trying to replace it with it s nodevalue after inserting it but it gives me dom errors

7545294
installation	upgrade
we have a list of installation which we can ping with a http request so the system knows to run the download or the click can hit upgrade when they log in

7545298
width	height
this is required because it needs to recalculate the actual height width after the changes

7545299

you could alternatively use javascript to dynamically calculate the width and height of the user s browser window then render the css code accordingly so the div is always in the middle of the browser regardless of the inner image dimension

7545345
fadein	fadeout
all you need to do is change the two functions to use jquery fadein and fadeout like so

7545345
mouseleave	mouseenter
the proper way would be to rework the code and use mouseenter and mouseleave on the thubmnail elements

7545379
apache	nginx
the dev server shouldn t be used to server live code so when you launch your code on your production server you will always need to use apache nginx and will have to restart the server anytime you want to see the changes

7545631
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that firefox is rendering the cell height differently than google-chrome or ie8

7545631
google-chrome	firefox
open it in both firefox and google-chrome ie to see the difference

7545633
google-chrome	firefox
its working in firefox latest version + google-chrome but not working in ie 9

7545642
backbone.js	javascriptmvc
what backbone.js does so do several other javascriptmvc implementations is that it provides a means of organizing the code into a modular pattern known as mvc pattern which is all about separating your code into three loosely coupled layers

7545779
google-chrome	firefox
use firebug for firefox or google-chrome dev tools to get a better error trace

7545795
min	max
if supplier has 2 top clients then top client will be with min order id which means - who first created order and get max items - it will be top

packets	multicast
on our device we observed that the ipv6 ns packets with multicast address of layer2 were droped

7546062
hash	md5
so the migration will be spread over time some passwords will be hash with md5 other with sha-256

7546062
hash	md5
if it matches then the password is good and since the password is known by the app at that time the app also hash the password with sha-256 and replaces the md5 hash with the sha-256 hash in the database

7546062
hash	md5
you need to be able to distinguish a md5 hash from a sha-256 hash which is easy since they have distinct sizes 16 bytes for md5 32 bytes for sha-256

7546062
hash	md5
please note that hashing passwords with a raw single application of a hash function is a pretty lousy way of doing it security-wise and replacing md5 with sha-256 will not really improve things

7546062
hash	salt
to really prevent the attacker from guessing the passwords you also need salt per-password random data stored alongside the hash password and a suitably slow hash function thousands possibly millions of nested hash function invocations

7546078
ubuntu	centos
the home pc is running ubuntu and the server is centos

7546102

7546245
min	max
hm if you want really expressive statistics besides average max min also standard deviation or even 95 confidence interval or serial correlation you ll have to take a close look at the tools since most of them are weak on statistics

7546269
x86	64bit
if you have problems getting the application to start due to unsatisfiedlinkerror and you are using a msvc2008 build then try installing the microsoft visual c++ 2008 sp1 redistributable package x86 note there is also a 64bit version of this as well this link is for the 32bit version which is relevant to using 32bit qtjambi on a 32bit jvm if you also want the 64bit version search for the same page with x64 in the title instead of x86 on the microsoft website

7546297

7546329
post	get
from that you can get the id and call your ajax post or whatever you want to do with it

7546370

i ve looked at several other questions and answers and in all of those cases the problem was related to a nsurl being passed when a nsstring was expected

you could make 8 different wall post but there is a chance that you application will get disabled for too many wall post if enough users hide your application or mark it as spam

7546614
setinterval	settimeout
if you want it to only run once after 30 seconds you are looking to use settimeout not setinterval

-webkit- for webkit browsers google-chrome safari

7546677
google-chrome	firefox
the following code for a navigation menu works brilliantly with ie8 and firefox google-chrome etc

7546709
int	double
or more likely as lindydancer points out the float bits may be passed in the right place for an int but because they are first promoted to a double representation by extending with zeros there are 0s where printf expects the first int to be.

7546714
strdup	malloc
i think gdb may be complaining about the fact that you never check the return value of malloc or strdup to see if it s non-null

7546720

7546786
ubuntu	debian
however as of this time it seems that rapache only runs on debian ubuntu mac

7546787
width	height
one case where that error could happen is when your image has zero for either its width or height but not for both because of this bug which seems to be fixed after opencv 2.1

7546821
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested with win32 google-chrome firefox and ie8

7546837
draggable	droppable
i have draggable droppable tree where user can add new elements

7546846
stdout	stderr
there are some pitfalls sigpipe will be sent to the parent if it reads on a pipe with no active writers and using up an fd other than stdin stdout stderr in a child process may confuse some badly-written child processes though close-on-exec can help fix that

7546858
codeigniter	cakephp
my personal favorite is codeigniter but many other are out there like cakephp symphony zend and many more

7546859

7547008
consistency	acid
i can speak only for couchdb but there is no need to choose between eventual consistency and acid they are not in the same category

7547054
google-chrome	firefox
i tweaked the headers so google-chrome knew to only allow the proper domains but firefox disallows cross-domain on xhr regardless

7547054
google-chrome	firefox
this was fixed by simply switching to gm_xmlhttprequest instead which allows cross-domain in firefox and thankfully which google-chrome also supports

7547078
screens	mdpi
of course the images won t look great on smaller mdpi screens since they will be scaled to 2 3 size

7547106
maven	pom.xml
i added the icefaces repository to my maven pom.xml

7547188

7547385
struts	stripes
if you re doing a website then look at one of the action frameworks like stripes or struts 2

7547385

i wouldn t use uinavigationcontroller modal windows or a uitabbarcontroller

7547467
outputstream	inputstream
t open outputstream after reading from an inputstream that httpurlconnection can t handle more than a single write read

7547472
put	get
just put this in your code and use the ip address where ever you want and also get the location of the user using your app as this gives global ip

7547501
google-chrome	safari
no such problem exists in any ie7 ff3.6 google-chrome 16 or safari

7547509
google-chrome	firefox
i have found that google-chrome and not firefox or ie weirdly is caching this file so that the same version gets downloaded even if it has changed server-side

7547513
spaces	delimiter
cut doesn t seem to treat consecutive spaces as one delimiter

7547519
avassetwriter	avassetreader
avassetreader can write to a file using avassetwriter

7547519
wav	riff
to get pcm you can write a wav file format and then skip the riff header s on read

7547545
width	height
make sure that your wrapper doesn t have a height or width set and put the clearfix on container_12 or container_16 and it should expand all the way down

7547550
rubygems	rvm
if you re using rvm you can change the version of rubygems with the following command

7547557
min	max
i need the pixels to saturate max 255 or truncate min 0 instead of wrapping

7547738
portrait	landscape
this is a warning to anyone trying to implement landscape and portrait with two views in a single xib ios 4 with xcode 4

7547738
portrait	landscape
so for example if you have a xib with a view for landscape and a view for portrait and both views contain the same interface objects in different positions such as a uilabel in landscape and a uilabel in portrait

7547738
portrait	landscape
it is not possible to link the uilabel in your portrait view and the uilabel object in the landscape view to a single uilabel object in the view controller at the same time

7547738
switching	screens	portrait	landscape
i find this a disappointment as the ios uiviewcontroller documentation ios 4.3 suggested that i could implement custom landscape and portrait views by switching between two views programmatically as the screens rotates

7547738
portrait	landscape
in my code every time i update the landscape outlet i also update the portrait landscape

7547808
boost	stl
if you want to write maintainable production code then it s a good idea to use stl boost and avoid raw pointers except in code that is unlikely to have to be read very much

7547843
min	max
just wanted to hone in on the fact that an index full scan min max is simply not the same as an index full scan

7547843
min	max	range	max	range	min
however an index full scan min max or index range scan min max only gets the smallest or largest leaf block from the range but can only be employed as long as the column is not null which is a bit silly and really a bug since a null value is by definition neither the smallest nor largest value

7547843
min	max
the min max optimization is an implicit first_rows action and doesn t need the where .

7547843
min	max
interestingly the min max optimization is normally not considered by the cbo for function-based indexes that s another little bug

7547886
post	get
so you are setting up your post params with an arraylist and you can get the responce from the server if you logged in via httpresponse .and another thing i m setting up the username and password in the code because it is just to how you the idea.if you have any questions feel free to ask

7547959
post	get
php works at server-side and you have to use post get requests

7547982
for-loop	arrays
then you can easily use rows as an arrays and can step in a for-loop until count rows -1

7547987
width	height
it depends on your situation and isn t always possible but if you could manage to get the links to be display block display inline-block or position absolute you would be able to explicitly set their width and height

7547991
width	height
i have a container rectangle and element rectangle both are specified only in height and width

7548035
put	get
however when the function is called again to put the cell back in its original position which is the else part i get no animation

7548127
post	get
this is what i did for get it should work for post too

7548183
move	drag
i would keep the nodes in a table you can assign a default position in the 2d grid from there based on the level they have but from there it will need some human input possibly drag drop system which move the nodes to different positions in the grid do crud actions

7548196
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox and safari work great

7548242
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i know it doesn t work in opera safari and firefox

7548255
width	font-size
adding float left to the first-letter inverts the bug with bigger font-size the width of inline-block shrinks

7548260

i m unable to figure out how can i post the file to php and get the response from there

7548358
integer	unsigned
when converting old-style function declarations and definitions to use prototypes you sometimes have to be careful about parameters with narrow types float and integer types narrower than int or unsigned int due to the promotion rules

7548365
rss	feed
i have just made a phonegap application that parses an external rss feed using jfeed

7548368
super	self
i don t think you need to remove the original table view from the super views as the self

7548370
folder	directory
download the source code and book.h will be under the common directory folder

7548372
innodb	myisam
insurance if myisam fails you you can move directly to innodb tables

7548407
width	font-size
i was initially hoping that a value of -0.25 would be sufficient -- ie a quarter of a character on each side would reduce the width of each character by half which would be what we want because the first letter is font-size 2em so it s twice as big

7548428
paypal	recurly
people tend to mention amazon s google s and paypal s payment service but recently i came across services like chargify and recurly

7548441
folder	directory

disk	ram
so especially if you have lots of writes or limited disk space and or ram your best bet is to just use one multi-column index on a b

7548451
folder	directory
if you mean that you want code in package foo.bar without having a matching directory folder of foo bar under some source root - no i don t think eclipse supports that

ram is much faster then disk io

7548499
jar	manifest.mf
ex jar cmf manifest.mf archery.jar system library java extensions objectdraw.jar

7548503
queue	fifo
treat the memory buffer as a fifo queue and use a mutex to protect the queue pointers

7548506
post	get
what you can do to get around this is use an executorservice and post futuretasks on it

7548561
soundpool	audiotrack
or since api level 9 you can assign a session id to audiotrack which should allow you to play audio tracks with soundpool if i understand correctly and then you would ideally want to create static audiotracks

7548564
atof	strtod
atof and strtod is c function and they are not returning nan upon failure i prefer working on std string so i just asking if anyone already writing some wrapper to std string that i can use if you don t mind

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
win7 all works fine on several browsers google-chrome firefox ie safari

7548751
children	parent
now your tables contain the distinct parent and children as well as their old ids

7548751
children	parent
you have to write an update query now that assigns the new parent ids into the children table

7548789
mouseover	mouseout
you can use the mousechildren property - set it to false to prevent children generating yes generating mouse related events which in your case will rid you from unwanted mouseout events as there would be no correspoding mouseover event generated when your cursor enters a childs area

7549477
mouseover	mouseout
also there only seems to be a delayed timer for the mouseout and not an interval option like the mouseover

7549477
slider	hoverintent
the only way i can think of would be to create an invisible link the entire size of the browser window and run a second hoverintent function to change the slider when it rolls over this but i don t think that would be the best way

cufft	fftw
i have the same input data as would go in fftw however the return from cufft does not seem to be aligned the same was fftw is

7558496
comparator	comparable
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a treeset instance performs all key comparisons using its comparator or compare method so two keys that are deemed equals by this method are from the standpoint of the set equals

innodb	myisam
if there are many modifications of the data it s said that innodb works faster because it uses row locking instead of table locking like myisam

7558597
innodb	myisam
if you need foreign key constraints or transactions you can only use innodb wheras if you need fulltext indexes you can only use myisam tables at the moment

7558597
innodb	myisam
for example the master could store a table as innodb which makes it fast for inserts updates and deletes while the slave s could store the same table as myisam and offer the best performance for selects

superclass	subclassing
you would only need to call object.__setattr__ ... inside a class definition and then only if directly subclassing object -- if you were subclassing something else spam for example then you should either use super to get the next item in the heirarchy or call spam.__setattr__ ... -- this way you don t risk missing behavior that superclass have defined by skipping over them directly to object

i m just trying to get a number from a hidden form input and plus 1 to that number and then put that value to the incremented number

7559746

7559996
post	get
just can t make up my mind on whether to use post or get method at my search form

7559996
post	get
my idea was to use post method where the form would be redirected to the same page so i would get a list of users filtered by search string

7559996
post	get
the post method would be a little bit more hassle but on the other hand there are advanced options within the search form about 5 checkboxes and i don t like the idea of having meesed up url bar with way too many values and i expect users not to use pagination after search session so often so the values wouldn t get to the address bar so often if post method used

7560048

the class s structure includes a main class frame that holds the map stored in string array then makes a map class and puts the string array grass and water textures also the tile height and width and the graphics object the init is called inside the paint method soo i will get an graphics object not a null

7560091
union	distinct
please note that union distinct is required to filter on duplicates while doing the union

daemon	cron
cron is implemented via a daemon so it s always running

7560261
jobs	cron
depending on your system s shutdown order cron may actually be sent the shutdown signal fairly late in the shutdown process so jobs scheduled for the moment the shutdown started may still run

add this project as dependency in the checkstyle pmd plugin configuration in your pom.xml and it will work in maven and in jenkins hudson if you simple call the maven checkstyle pmd goal

7560567
for-loop	loops
the return in your for-loop isn t overwritten -- the method will return the value in loops if your conditions are met

7560594
equals	gethashcode
i assume that article is a reference type and is implemented with suitable equals and gethashcode methods respectively - otherwise the above would only work for equals references same object in both lists .

7560599
for-loop	loops
exceptions are a more idiomatic way of handling errors and the foreach loops is preferred to a for-loop when you re just iterating over collections

7560676

if you store something into tempdata in your get action and then render a view an ajax request for example from this view would kill the tempdata and you won t get the values back on your post request

7560698
submit	submission
just submit the new binary but remember it will replace the original submission it will go to the end of the queue and it will wait for review as before

7560715
post	get
in controller imagescontroller i have crop action get and post

7560735
converter	multibinding
as noted earlier consider converter or multibinding for various values instead

7560745
post	get
the http get post mechanic creates obvious composition roots at which to invoke the di container

7560754
sorting	filtering
my idea is that the cafes table will contain a comma separated list of the attribute names like human legible for easy display with minimal db calls and then also have the option table for filtering and sorting queries

7560759
post	get
as far as post is concerned forget about it using the location property tat works only with get requests

7560768

7560852
int	chars
the problem occurs when you try to convert back to chars from int

7560859
next	except
to get the full effect of the median of three it s also important to sort those three items not just use the median as the pivot -- this doesn t affect what s chosen as the pivot in the current iteration but can will affect what s used as the pivot in the next recursive call which helps to limit the bad behavior for a few initial orderings one that turns out to be particularly bad in many cases is an array that s sorted except for having the smallest element at the high end of the array or largest element at the low end

7560859
prng	random
in a case like this you could use a truly random seed or you could include your own prng instead of using rand -- or you use use median of three which also has the other advantages mentioned

7560887
width	height
if the original poster wants vertical and center alignment its quite easy for fixed width and height of the button try the following

7560888
width	height
update if op is looking for horizontal and vertical centre this answer will do it for a fixed width height element

7560898
int	double
but this is not guaranteed to make the conversions function correctly because a double can easily represent the entire 32-bit int range without loss of precision but the same is not true for a 64-bit int

7560907
google-chrome	firefox
i am curious as to why my ajax-call is failing in google-chrome it works perfectly fine in firefox

7560907
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly in firefox but in google-chrome it doesn t even alert anything so it doesn t even get into readystate 1 which is when you send it -- that seems rather odd

7560975
post	put
i find it hard to believe that put and delete would work but post wouldn t

7560983
int	double
converting a pointer to an int is one thing as long as the int is large enough you can get away with it but a double is a floating point number - what you are doing simply doesn t make any sense because a double is not necessarily capable of representing any random number

7560993
int	double
conversions from 64-bit int to double can be lossy

7560993
int	double
a double has 53-bits of actual precision so int above 2 52 give or take an extra 2 will not necessarily be represented precisely

7560999
flip	slide
what i would really like is for the status bar to curl-up with the initialization screen if i am using curl-up or flip if i am using flip to reveal the full screen but i will settle for the status bar to slide up during the 1.0 second interval that the initialization screen is curling up

int	double
but you re converting from a pointer to an int which is permitted but implementation-defined and then from an int to a double which is permitted and meaningful for meaningful numeric values -- but converted pointer values are not numerically meaningful

7561032
hide	show
you can generalize this further of course but the idea is that whenever you switch tabs you just toggle a method to hide everything that s visible and then the deferred makes sure this happens in the right order show the one thing that s not

7561047
int	chars
dos int 08h reads a chars from stdin and does not echo it

7561047
int	chars
if you want to echo the chars call int 01h

7561048
octal	hex
be careful with user input due to the 0x hex and 0 octal prefix options

7561207
post	get
solr supports searching through post http requests instead of get requests which will allow you to have a much bigger query

7561213
atof	strtod	atoi	atof	atoi	strtod	strtol	atoi	strtol	atof	strtol	strtod

7561406
google-chrome	firefox
if you open the error console in your browser google for a howto or use a tool like firebug firefox addon or the google-chrome web inspector you ll see that there is an error when your script executes

7561410
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
i can get this to work once but i m trying to set up a for-loop based on the length of my basic string storage arrays - this arrays holds in this example 6 instance name strings - each time my for-loop loops i need to run a search in my multdimensional arrays for the next consecutive instance name

7561410
for-loop	arrays
which works great if i m only searching for one elements in my arrays - but soon as i need to find multiple elements in a for-loop using their code it falls apart

7561417
pop-up	dialog
i am opening a pop-up dialog like-

7561427
ant	maven
maven and ant are very different build tools

7561427
ant	maven
in ant you write all the logic yourself whereas a standard build process is baked in with maven

7561427
ant	pom.xml	ant	maven	maven	pom.xml
if you understand well how maven works it is theoretically possible to take a pom.xml and generate an ant build that emulates the behaviour of the maven build

7561427
ant	maven
i m not aware of any solution which can easily convert in the other direction mainly because ant is missing maven functionality such as dependency management

7561427
ant	maven
instead of trying to convert an ant build into maven i d recommend that you keep your existing build logic and delegate the management of your classpath to the ivy or maven ant tasks

7561452
firefox	safari
we have gotten reports that the submit button sometimes doesn t do anything in firefox ie 8 and safari

7561503
mp3	wav
i am trying to decode an mp3 file to a wav file by using the processbuilder class under linux

7561517
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
use one loops for the searching in the arrays that s loops code you already have and wrap it in another for-loop which executes that searchloop

7561542
opera	firefox
well this took far longer than i care to admit and is only reliable in from my own limited testing chromium 12+ and firefox 5+ on ubuntu 11.04 it does not work in opera 11

7561542
opera	firefox
that being the case i ll show only the excerpts to cover firefox and chromium though the linked js fiddle has vendor prefixes to at least try with opera even if it fails

7561606
textview	imageview
i am curious why would i ever use button or imagebutton when textview imageview and everything else all can have onclicklisteners all can have src s and background attributes states and everything else that a button or imagebutton offers

7561622
many-to-many	one-to-many
i tend to find that pure many-to-many relationships are quite rare and there is usually a good case for introducing an intermediate entity and using two one-to-many relationships

7561636
post	get
but you still have to send some data to the server via post get ajax calls to actually track the session on the server-side

7561657
onchange	onblur
onchange is a better choice than onblur or focusout because blur and focusout also fire when the contents of the text field hasn t changed

7561675
serializable	deserialization
this is needed for serializable deserialization of the data to java objects

7561686
uitableview	uipickerview
but then a simple start to solving this would be to use a uiimageview for the picture and a uitableview uipickerview below for the options

7561686
uitableview	uipickerview
read those class references on apple s documention uitableview here and uipickerview here

7561695
sitecore	n2cms
the one feature that i m looking for is the ability to create custom types with custom fields as i can do with both sitecore and n2cms on .net and both drupal and joomla on php

7561718
uitableview	uipickerview
i would use a uiimageview as the picture and use either a uitableview uipickerview or uibuttons for the answer choices

7561797
post	get
take a look at this blog post to get the basic idea

7561834
.htaccess	httpd.conf
although defining on a per page basis is not feasible as you stated although not idea if using apache you can set the value in a .htaccess or the httpd.conf file

7561909
setinterval	settimeout
you could use setinterval instead of settimeout and use a simple modulo to make it rotate

7561922
stdout	stderr
i have tons of data coming to stdout and i do not want to parse it to get my stderr

7561922
stdout	stderr
right now when i run the above command i get only a few lines of my stdout 3 but it shows up in the stderr file and stdout is empty

7561941
post	get

but again the ad banners are only landscape or portrait

7561989
hash	md5
i am pondering creating a hash function like md5 or sha1 using the rsa crypto algorithm

7561992
google-chrome	firefox
this is what i ended up doing and it works very nicely in firefox google-chrome and ie 7+ no errors at all

7562000
stdout	stderr
the reason youâ re only getting the first line of output is that the rest of it is sent to stderr not stdout

7562000
stdout	stderr
there is a process_info option you can pass to get both exit status stdout and stderr

7562006
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
only impacts internet explorer and firefox works in google-chrome and opera

7562021
inherited	properties
uilabel has a background properties it inherited from uiview set it to clear

7562035
hash	hmac
so in short yes this seems like it could be possible and secureâ but unless there is a really compelling reason i would use a standard hmac if you want a keyed hash

7562046
onresume	onpause
in your activity onresume register a broadcast receiver and make it display a toast remember to unregister it in the onpause

7562082
width	height
it has instance variables for things like width and height

7562082
getter	setter
i thought of making a filled interface but the problem is then i have to implement the getter and setter for both

7562084
daemon	cron
processes invoked by the cron daemon have a minimal environment generally consisting of and

7562121
getter	setter
you could have a fillableshapebase which is abstract and extends shapebase but has the added isfilled property with getter and setter

7562174
parsley	mate	parsley	robotlegs	mate	robotlegs
automated dependency injection frameworks such as mate robotlegs parsley or swiz

7562210
antialiasing	transparent
in indexed mode pngs store the transparent color index in their metadata but the process of creating the thumbnail will alter pixels due to antialiasing so you cannot preserve indexed transparency in

7562222
rss	feed
one thing i ve noticed is that my blog posts show up very different in my rss feed than on my actual blog

7562222
rss	feed
presumably this is because css doesn t apply to rss feed so layout is messed up

7562222
rss	feed
in the actual rss feed it will be laid out sans css and the will be to the left of the presumably

7562225
uiview	subviews
it could be a simple uiview added as subviews shown with bringsubviewtofront

7562254
pull	push
you would than push that branch and have all your developers pull it down and rebase their local branches onto rebased_master

7562303
sorting	grouping
collection views are how wpf supports sorting and grouping

7562348
inherited	subclassing
you should have a detailviewcontroller class that inherited from uiviewcontroller or some subclassing like uitableviewcontroller

7562360
google-chrome	firefox
i don t know if it s related or not but when loading the js sdk in google-chrome i get cannot read property cb of undefined and firefox says b is undefined

7562363
mouseleave	mouseenter
use mouseenter and mouseleave instead

7562381
tiff	png
my personal choice of preference is bullzip which can turn anything to pdf also to png tiff and other formats as well

7562411
hide	fadeout
you can use hide or fadeout

7562420
nsbutton	nspopupbutton
i m trying to get a smaller nsview to slide out with a nspopupbutton and some nsbutton from the top of the main nsview when a button is pressed

7562433

7562460
appfuse	spring
2- appfuse great starter application plus tutorials uses spring

the twist is that i have a new requirement to translation the application in saudi arabian and i d like some suggestions on how i should be tackling this and also a critique of my current thinking to see if you can spot any flaws in my understanding of localization with microsoft .net

7562517
post	get
after looking at some other post it seems that you can write a bash script and do some hacking to get the program installed...but i can t find a really good explanation of this

7562533
fadein	fadeout
you would have to perform two fadein fadeout in parallel

7562588

getter	setter
however within the singleton class you have setter and getter that are not synchronized so you may have some threading issues there wrt embinstance

7562649
google-chrome	firefox
my code behaves two different ways in firefox and google-chrome

7562650
post	get
the actual form name is not sent in the post or get variables

my guess is to hash the password put username password in the post body and send it over https

7562685
width	height
when image is loaded get its width and height

7562687
width	height
try using shorthand to declare your background and if possible set a fixed width and height on the element

7562693
width	height
if the width and height are really unknown beforehand then you ll

7562694
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works without any issue in firefox google-chrome safari and on the iphone safari as well

7562744
ssl	https
the important parts are that you transmit the form data in the post body that way it s not cached anywhere nor normally stored in any logfiles and use https that way if you have a good ssl tls certificate nobody can sniff out the password from observing your network traffic

7562744
hash	salt
instead you usually store a salt hash form and then apply the same salt hash to the password received via the form data so that you can compare the two

7562753
width	margin
the fact that you had set 730 to the panel s width and the layout is only 704 pixels wide indicates that you have a margin in your panel

7562753
put	get
a whole lot of effort is put by vaadin developers to get the sizing right and there shouldn t be anything without an explanation there

7562758
ssl	https
if you re using https then you can send the name and password in a post body which will be secure from eavesdroppers assuming you trust ssl

7562780

floating-point	fractions
in general any number that can be expressed as a fractions with a power-of-two in the denominator can be expressed exactly in ieee floating-point

7562964

i think it is best to avoid computing modulus of double or float and stick to int or long to get better results

7562966
ant	pom.xml	maven-antrun-plugin	pom.xml
i can always include my ant script in pom.xml using maven-antrun-plugin but i want to avoid using ant if possible

7563234
nswindow	nspanel
the view that gets used as the sheet nswindow or nspanel needs to have a title bar

7563282
calloc	malloc
either replace malloc with calloc or use after you call malloc

7563282
free	malloc
the reason it s not breaking if you don t free could be due to ret being declared on the stack - then do not free malloc it

7563321
for-loop	loops
doing this you will see that your first for-loop is not closed and you are doing while loops still inside your for-loop

7563511
width	height
trying to animate both the width and the height of these boxes on click

7563553
width	height
you didn t animate the height as well as the width width 200px height 200px

7563553
width	height
basically you create the element with the final width calculate its height and then remove it

7563563
width	height
to animate the height just add a height value under the width in the animate call

7563582
subtract	add
the script allows the user to add and subtract a group of input boxes so if they want to input a single line item they do just that.

7563635
ant	maven
then you should see some clear parallels between your ant build and the maven lifecycle and default plugin bindings

7563635
ant	maven
if you still need a classpath set up in ant use the maven ant tasks to let maven build the classpath for your ant script

7563635
ant	maven
leave any custom stuff in ant build files and invoke it using the antrun plugin from maven until and unless you convert to using a maven plugin for it

7563635
ant	maven
the possibility of using the antrun plugin goes back to my original answer of invoking pieces of your existing ant script from maven

7563635
ant	maven
if this multi-directory thing has to stay and is already taken care of by ant refactor that into a target task that can also be used from maven

7563654

i just cannot figure out how to transfer photos to my server because when i use get method to post base64 strings the server says the uri is too long

7563694
floating-point	fractions
the best approach i know that gives reliable results for any two floating-point is to use continued fractions

7563694
floating-point	integer
this version is much more robust and seems to work with any positive floating-point number except for inf nan or extremely large or small values that would overflow an integer

7563694
floating-point	fractions
basically any fractions with 8 - 9 digits in the numerator denominator has enough entropy to cover nearly all dp floating-point values barring corner cases like inf nan or extremely large small values

7563713

runtimeexception may be ignored and will propagate up the stack exactly as though you wrote throws nullpointerexception in every signature

7563792
aggregate-functions	sum
or by merging values in other columns by subjecting them to aggregate-functions such as max count sum etc

7564474
realloc	malloc
this uses the counter-intuitive property of realloc that it will do a malloc if the pointer passed in is null

7564474
realloc	malloc
you can instead do a check on and use malloc then and realloc otherwise

7564480

httpconnection	downloading
for every downloading i created a thread and i downloading the file with an httpconnection instance by reading from the connection in a while loop

the problem was that the server i was trying to install magento onto did not support mysql innodb - only myisam magento uses the innodb engine

7570203
button	checkbox
you just have to put some textbox checkbox or radio button as required with your form setting its fonts font size its datatype

7570255
post	get
googling seems to imply get or post data along with every request is the way which was my first guess

7570261
google-chrome	firefox
the problem that i am facing in firefox and google-chrome and not in ie is that the grid is not getting cleared

7570262
rubygems	rvm
in my case i opened a terminal window went to library rubygems 1.8 gems mysql2-0.3.7 and as soon as i did rvm barked saying it encountered a new or modified .rvmrc file

7570264
put	get
you can also get the xml and put it into the youtube .net client structures for easy access although not easily it is possible if you want to capitalize on the object models that they already have but drop down to the xml to get values that the api doesn t expose

7570291
profiling	instrumentation
so to have your instrumentation running you need your developer and distribution profiling set in the xcode configurations properly

7570327
post	get
in that api they are mentioning how to get access token of a particular user but they do not mention how to post in users wall using the access token

7570346
rss	feed
since not specifying the encoding produces an error for you i think it is possible that the rss feed is not valid xml

7570367
min	max
note that i might have your axis direction guessed wrong you might need to swap some min max in that case edit fixed according to comment north is positive and east is positive

7570374
width	height
for example width height or left can be animated but background-color cannot be. property values are treated as a number of pixels unless otherwise specified

7570450
hide	show
then you will be able to make use of the .datepicker show and .datepicker hide

7570460
portrait	landscape
i have a custom uiview which has a dedicated manually set frame for portrait and landscape orientation because autoresizingmasks just don t work in my case

7570460
uiview	subviews	portrait	landscape
my problem is now that my uiview furthermore has subviews that also have a dedicated position for portrait landscape

7570460
portrait	landscape
if i now leave my viewcontroller in portrait orientation rotate to landscape on another viewcontroller and then come back to this viewcontroller i see that my view got resized correctly but the subviews of my view which get positioned in layoutsubviews are not repositioned yet but are resized in an animated fashion after the view already appeared

7570496
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested this on firefox and google-chrome to no avail

7570583

7570745
trac	mantis
point to bts trac mantis vcs svn git hg wiki mail list nntp night build ci build etc.

7570756

in this case i would make a wrapper class with those two attributes implement equals and maybe implement comparable and comparator delegating onto the two elements of the composite key

7570792
google-chrome	firefox
the css works in firefox and in google-chrome but not in ie

7570831
width	height
hello i need to get the height and width on the fly of an uploaded image

7570831
width	height
this is the php function i am using but it does not return anything for the width and height

7570839
pop-up	dialog
if that doesn t do it i think it will simply set the visible property of the label to false in code behind when you trigger the event that pop-up the dialog

7570862
srp	principles
violates single responsibility principles srp

7570885
oncreate	ondestroy
during debugging i saw that the service s ondestroy method is called directly after returning from oncreate

7570891
udp	tcp
means that every packet tcp udp etc that you send from your intern lan to internet will use as source ip the private lan ip probably 192.178.x.x instead of the public ip

7570897
libxml2	libxslt
it sounds like you might have overly old versions of libxml2 and or libxslt

7570897
libxml2	libxslt
i encountered identical problems with libxml2 2.6.26 and libxslt 1.1.17

7570902

7570917
opera	firefox
if you open the link in firefox or opera you ll see the layout as it should work the green here is caused by margins i have deliberately set

7570964
google-chrome	firefox
it seems that in firefox the box-shadow is overlaid on top of the border in google-chrome it hides underneath

7570970
implements	extends
as you asked you want to know if it s possible to have more than one run method in a class that implements the runnable interface or extends the thread class

7570970
implements	extends
now if you read the runnable or thread api you can see that the class that extends thread class or implements the runnable class overrides in case you are extends thread class the run method or implements the abstract method run in case you are implements the runnable class

7571046
super	self
i m not sure whether it s the complete answer but one major flaw is that you re using instance variables self super in a class method + id bpmanager

7571046
superclass	subclassing
and writing that just made me realize that the problem looks like accessing a subclassing method on an object instantiated as the superclass but that should have been overwritten in the dispatch

7571095
post	get
you should be able to get the code from the website itself but if you need the code i can post it here

7571103
post	get
the answer you found with tagging all the urls using a get token or a post field is not going to work very well

7571134
int	chars
some of the bytes have their high bits set so when interpreted as signed chars and then converted to int for display they appear as negative values on account of their two s-complement representation

7571227
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it also works perfectly fine when it s sitting on the development server using google-chrome firefox safari mac and two cellphone browsers

7571247
profiling	debugging
for debugging i can say which port the jvm must listen etc since the machine i m trying to access is behind an ssh gateway so i manually create an ssh tunnel but i ve been googling about the same thing but when profiling and i couldn t seem to find

7571260
jboss	glassfish
other servers like tomcat glassfish jboss etc are open source

7571363
int	double
c is a double variable but the value being assigned to it is an int value because it results from the division of two int s which gives you int division dropping the remainder

7571378
int	double
in order to use the double version which returns a double at least one of the int s must be explicitly casted to a double

7571385
int	double
when you divide two int the result will be an int irrespective of the fact that you store it in a double

7571390
pull	push
basically we used a hybrid method determining when to push or pull based on user statistics

7571394
bash	zsh
it was working fine on bash but when i installed zsh shell and oh-my-zsh then it started raising following dependency error

7571398
int	double
you re giving it two int operands so it s doing int division and then the result is being stored in a double

7571418
squash	merge
i would like to rebase so that my working tree looks like the following example by squash the last commit to the merge preserving the rest of the tree exactly the way it is

7571418
squash	merge	squash	branch
even by using the -p option when i managed to successfully squash the last commit the tree line that showed the merge of mclongnumber to the master branch was lost from the log

7571428
maven	pom.xml
here is described clearly but it seems that there is only one pom.xml file and the sample shown at there is not an multi-module maven project

7571430
division	modulo
the modulo remainder of division by n 0 is always in the range 0 n

7571431
division	modulo
since the modulo returns the remainder of division of one number by another a number divided by n will always return a number lesser than n

7571452
profiling	debugging
after several weeks of profiling and debugging traces it turned out the villain was the jit-compiling of the queries at runtime

7571477
int	double
when dividing two numbers of the same type int double etc. the result will always be of the same type so int int will always result in int

7571477
int	double
which casts the int result to a double after the calculation in which case the fractions data is already lost

7571477
int	double
division between an int and a double will result in casting the int to the double note that when doing maths the compiler will often upcast to the most specific data type this is to prevent data loss

7571481
post	get
for the object here s what i get when i click get code i m changing header links since i can t post more than 2 links on my account

7571490
google-chrome	firefox
ie8 google-chrome and firefox appear just fine

7571515
rss	feed
every time a user inputs an rss feed in a text input it will display the results in the same page since i m using an ajax on fetching the data

7571522
int	double
if you want to keep a and b as int s yet divide them fully you must cast at least one of them to double double a b or a double b or double a double b

7571522
int	double
b c is a double so it can accept an int value on assignement the int is automatically converted to double and assigned to c

7571552
versioning	upgrade
please upgrade to versioning 1.10

7571564
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome firefox and safari it works as i expected creating the model and displaying the alert

7571640
for-loop	arrays
don t use implode here you should use a for-loop to get each value of the arrays

7571701
inherited	properties
i would recommend creating classes for each tier year month and day and having them all inherited from something like a treenodebase class which contains properties for isselected isexpanded and

7571701
children	parent
don t forget to hook up a propertychange notification for your children so that when treenodebase.isexpanded gets changed the parent object s isexpanded value changes too

7571739
gtk	gdk
you can do it with the old gdk drawing api but it disappeared in gtk 3

7571739
gtk	cairo
what works in both gtk 2 and 3 is to use the cairo api for that

7571749

7571921
min	max
you will want to use the max datetime and min datetime from your main table as inputs into whatever method you use and 10 seconds for the span obviously

7571925
stdout	fflush
note that if you need to inspect this output while app_a runs then you need to change app_a so that it fflush stdout after printing or else change stdout to be unbuffered

7571942
union	distinct
i got it working by using an approach similar to remou s above but you probably wanted union all otherwise two identical rows will not be inserted as union has an implicit distinct and i seemed to need an outer select that was aliased otherwise it didn t work

7571944
post	get
what happens is you re clearing the built in params controller action etc... but the method always returns get and post variables

7571975
getter	setter
in fact though even if your xml serialization is customized using explicit getter and setter s you can still see some significant gain with protobuf-net

7571988
post	get
i want to construct a query where i can get all the post tagged with a given id and the other tags associated with those post

7572080
onstart	ondestroy	oncreate	ondestroy	oncreate	onstart
what you do need to define are the oncreate onstart onpause onstop ondestroy methods

7572087
post	get
dotnetopenauth already upgrades long urls from get to post and does so at the 2048 character length threshold

7572096
post	get
suppose your programming id is 1 and u want to get all post with tag id 1

7572108
post	get
in this mapping i have confirmdelete as a get and delete as post

7572138
put	get
you can as others have suggested put the variables on the querystring but you suggest that might get too long

7572147
windows	wow64
64bits windows can run 32bits applications that is what wow64 layer provides windows on windows

7572170
width	height
rather than feeding in maximum height and width i want to feed in maximum area so that long or narrow images will appear visually to be roughly the same size

7572177
google-chrome	firefox
i have so far seen an api that works with firefox only and another on github that works with google-chrome only

7572206
post	get
i m developing a forum app for facebook and i m trying to get the page to scroll to the latest post on a page if the user wishes

7572207
ggplot2	gridextra
this can be easily done in ggplot2 with the help of the gridextra package

7572346
next	except
this also works great except if you were in fullscreen when the next video starts to play you are taken out of it and back to the app

7572424
pull	push
my plan is to not allow developers to commit or ftp directly to the server instead we would push our work to either the live or proof hub which would then in turn cause the live proof workspaces to pull the changes from their respective hub

7572450
setinterval	settimeout
use setinterval instead of settimeout

7572506
cos	sin
the new longitude x x cos b - y sin b

7572506
cos	sin
the new latitude y x sin b + y cos b

7572528
datamapper	activerecord
it implements a datamapper pattern instead of an activerecord pattern

7572573
superclass	subclassing
for one thing it allows you to create subclassing without the pita of explicitly calling the superclass constructor

7572590
width	height
i have one image url online url now i want this image height and width how can i get this it s greatly appreciate if anyone answer this

7572590
width	height
i want to preview the image with 150px height and 150px width so i set it up in aspx page height-150 and width-150 for img tag

7572590
width	height
if i assign the above url to img src it will throw the 150px width and 150px height but i need the original height and width of the above url image

7572590
width	height
if i didn t set it up anything for the img tag i will get 0px of height and 0px of width

7572633
children	parent
java collections pass collection of children as collection of parent

7572656
strncmp	memcmp
edit replaced strncmp with memcmp in verify_piece and cleaned up both write_incorrect_piece and write_correct_piece

7572661
spaces	delimiter
my delimiter is three spaces followed by three numbers which is actually the id that i need for the row

7572662
division	multiplication
in the previous standard for multiplication and division in standard arithmetic the default mode of rounding for inexact results was truncation to 32 significant digits

7572676
ssl	https
also you mention an ssl cert but it is an http url not https

7572691
command-pattern	presenter
a simple implementation of command-pattern would be to let iview have a that is supplied by the presenter and let a specific implementation of a view decide how to fire these actions by doing

7572739
inherited	properties
you have access to your route values in request.requestcontext.routedata so you can make base controller and public properties siteidentity in such case you can access it from all actions in all inherited controllers

7572751
uiview	subviews
the uiview property autoresizingmask allows you to specify how your subviews should behave when their superview in this case the uitableviewcell s contentview gets resized

7572774
int	double
where 1.0 are of type double and 2 3 5 are of type int

7572780
move	drag
my problem is that being a canvas the object to drag and the obstacle at the same time makes it not to move at all

7572789
put	get
if you put this in the foreach loop you ll get a timer for every serial port that will dispose its given serial port after 3 seconds

7572798
flexmojos	swc
however it s main artifact type is not a tar.gz it s a swc i m using flexmojos

7572846
versioning	upgrade
versioning of flash player versioning 9 upgrade 3 is not installed in the

7572862
width	height
since i believe it s all setting the part you can see to the specified coordinates width height

7572873
children	parent
the other option would be to make the app lion only and use the parent child nsmanagedobjectcontext design and then your children will be more aware of each other

7572895
google-chrome	firefox
i m having a problem loading images cross-domain in firefox for webgl and it works fine in google-chrome

7572895
google-chrome	firefox
the access-control-allow-origin response made google-chrome satisfied with cross-domain images but firefox is not

7572903
implements	extends
it extends defaultlistmodel implements tablemodel while you should do extends abstracttablemodel implements listmodel

7572907
min	max
the simplistic code i currently have sets the y-axis min value to 100 and the y-axis max value to 930

7572907
min	max	range	max	range	min
always take the ceiling floor of a data point -- it is not very clear when a data point shares the same value as max min range plotted

7572907
range	max
excel plots 1200 as the max range when graphing 0 100 1 500 2 930 3 1030

7572979
hide	show
i d like a method that uses only css transitions to effectively and attractively hide show content on hover

7573016
width	height
the issue responds to webkit not firing the load event on cached images so if the width height attrs are no explicitly set in the img tag the only reliable way to get the images is to wait for the window.load event to be fired

7573016
width	height
the window.load event will fire always so it s safe to access the width height of and img after that without any trick

7573024
post	get
i figured out how to form the post data packet but what i don t get is how to avoid the authenticity-token problem

7573043
google-chrome	firefox
it is already implemented in webkit google-chrome etc. as well as firefox but your mileage may vary

7573060
rss	feed
before i dive into writing a validator to check if a url is actually pointing to an rss feed i did a bit of searching for some validators that may exist out there but had little luck with any reliable ones

7573096
getter	setter
in this example i use autoload to create the getter and setter and then have those instance variables available in my object during the while loop

7573119
ssl	https
my web host provides a shared server for ssl https - its free as part of my package - your package may include similar

7573131
getter	setter
another reason is although you don t have to specify the setter and getter you still can

7573131
getter	setter
however there is a good reason for setter and getter for encapsulation

7573144
factors	mean
i need add a column called wt to this dataframe that contains the weighting factors needed to calculate the weighted mean

7573152
inherited	properties
for javascript properties functions to be inherited you need to add them to the prototype and not to the object itself

7573177
post	get
so whenever i create or update a post through whichever controllers i always get redirected back to post 4 post 123 post id whatever

7573177
post	get
i want to get redirected to the particular controller the post being edited or created lives under

7573177
post	get
when trying to access a new post form i get the following error

7573188
post	get
i ve read this post and this one but they do not specify how to get ahold of the output which is generated within the launch method in the first place

7573204
width	height
to convert your 640x480 image to a standard 10 000-ish pixel size you need a new image size of 86-87 height and 114-116 width

7573295
google-chrome	firefox
the map works correctly in ie9 and firefox still working on google-chrome

7573303
opera	firefox
works in opera ie and firefox for me

7573323
client-side	server-side
your server-side code files are no place for the client-side code

7573398
int	boolean
the return value for select charindex is an int not a boolean type

7573422
put	get	post	get	post	put
below is an example of a restful service that supports put delete post and get

7573443
getter	setter
the getter and setter would then modify the wrapper s property

7573487
ocean	petrel
the wizard that comes with the ocean sdk for petrel 2011.1 actually works with visual studio 2010 as well as visual studio 2008

7573491
mybb	phpbb	mybb	vbulletin	vbulletin	phpbb
it seems like phpbb mybb and vbulletin and others i come across all use md5

7573491
crypt	salt
i d like to do integration with my main site s authentication with something more secure sha or just the builtin crypt password salt but don t want to hack up a dependency to pieces so it becomes difficult to upgrade

7573581
google-chrome	firefox
i am trying to make new website and i would like to know how to make it compatible with cross-browser as now i am able to view my website perfectly with google-chrome and when i see the same with firefox 7.0 it s looking very ugly and with ie 8 its looking better.so i would like to know how to make compatible

7573605
width	height
so i would like pass width and height as arguments to the image class

7573628
width	height
but to maintain design space i have made the block size 200px in width and 300px in height

7573628
width	height
but i want to set maximum width and height

7573673
width	height
it sounds like actually you are setting width and height rather than

7573694
getter	setter
when i m trying doctrine orm generate-entities it creates php files with getter and setter in camel case

7573696
uninstall	upgrade
you don t have to uninstall vs2010 pro to upgrade to ultimate

7573696
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
just run the ultimate installer without doing anything to your existing vs2010 pro installation and your versioning will be upgrade

7573710
class-method	eigenclass
class-method are on really methods of the eigenclass of an instance of class think about what is self in def self.method

7573715
width	height
max width and height are just that

7573715
width	height
i just made a text html page and the smaller images worked fine with the max height and width set

7573718
width	height
the only way i can imagine achieving a fluid width + height box with the borders that you have in the way that you want is to use a second image for the west and east containing divs

7573766
division	multiplication
those operations are o 1 because of the multiplication division

7573778
inherited	properties
it inherited the properties but i can t get access to it

7573800
setinterval	settimeout
i would not suggest using a setinterval when dealing with animations due to the way newer browsers are making changes to the way setinterval and settimeout work when the tab is not the active tab

7573830
salt	md5
this is what s wrong md5 + one salt + another salt applied to a six-character password is breakable these days with current pc hardware in seconds just by brute force alone

7573881
concave	convex
polygons are either of concave convex or complex

7573953
google-chrome	firefox
another great way to see exactly what s happening is to use firebug in firefox or the google-chrome inspector see exactly what styles your table rows are picking up inheriting or being overridden

7573961
post	get
i either want the jsessionid to arrive embedded into a get method url name value pairs or to be part of a post request name value pairs

7574040
hash	md5
you can t decrypt a md5 hash function and you chose a bad algorithm if you want to transmit information and the receiver can t read it

7574040
hash	md5
md5 is a cryptographic hash function because it s very difficult to produce a block of information that has a specific given hash value

7574074
put	get
we parse files and put the data into a database if i parse the exact same file with the same code it was never changed i get different results

7574092
packets	pcap
on the other side of the network link will be a receiving application that simply writes every packets it sees to its own pcap log

7574092
dpkt	scapy
while looking for something with scapy s capabilities i ran into dpkt but i didn t find a lot of documentation for it

7574097
skype	webex
skype webex and team viewer works in windows but i find them to be flaky in linux

7574138
google-chrome	firefox
both of these methods are extremely fast in google-chrome firefox but terribly slow in ie 7 8 9

7574145
fflush	gets
bufferedwriter uses a fixed-size buffer and will fflush automatically when the buffer gets full

7574180
google-chrome	firefox
everything works great in firefox and google-chrome but not ie 7 and ie 8

7574188
post	get
as you can see everything looks ok but everytime i fill out my simple form and post the content i get this come up in my browser..

7574190

7574282
pull	push
usually these are remote repositories of the same repo s clones on peers and servers with which you push and pull

7574300
try-catch	exception-handling
it s generally considered bad practice to suppress ignore errors instead why not use a try-catch block to capture the exception-handling and do something with it

7574300
try-catch	exception-handling
if you really don t need to do anything about the exception-handling at least put a comment to that effect in your try-catch block it ll make your code more readable when you come back to it later

7574330
width	height	portrait	landscape
landscape is fully stretched width ways and portrait height ways

7574438
direct3d	gdi
it s a feature rich cross-platform gui toolkit and it supports a variety of graphics driver gdi x11 opengl direct3d

7574440
width	height
this should decrease the height and width by the totals of the margins then offset the top and left with the margins needed for those

7574447
implements	extends
my action class does not extends from actionsupport instead it implements preparable

7574460
oncreate	findviewbyid
you cannot use findviewbyid before oncreate and this is what you are doing if you try to initialise with a value like that

7574466
google-chrome	safari
here s a simple example that works find in google-chrome and safari

7574466
width	height
the #foo div has its height and width as a percentage of the body

7574468
fullcalendar	cluetip
i m using the cluetip plugin together with the jquery fullcalendar to show event details which works quite good

7574529
setcontentview	findviewbyid
this is probably because you are setting setcontentview after findviewbyid so the view hasn t been inflated yet

7574529
setcontentview	findviewbyid
change the order around making sure setcontentview has been called before you call findviewbyid

7574540
setcontentview	findviewbyid
is not directly about your question but you have to put this lines after setcontentview cause the findviewbyid method

7574581
int	chars
i don t know if you can get away with a 64-bit int the max length of an email address is 254 chars and in this case where you need to preserve the uniqueness of each hashing will not do it

7574696
for-loop	loops
i am using a for-loop that assigns each comment div in loops a unique id like

7574725
for-loop	loops
i think this is because the article variable is stored outside of the scope of the for-loop in coffeescript and the click doesn t execute until after loops has already completed

7574770
filtering	grouping
my problem now is that using a channel field grouping on the root channel obviously filtering through all categories and entries associated

7574789
pull	push
the problem comes in how to convert calling execute which dumps a ton of data into the idatawriter object push to a pull method so that the ienumerator s movenext and current can be used

7574835
subtraction	addition
obviously any addition or subtraction needs to be currency aware so

7574875
int	double
the formatprovider is to handle the culture dependent . or separator in decimals or int and double

7574883
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to versioning 3.2.2

7574956
implements	extends
if you want to track some additional information about a logged-in user say their primary teacher in the spring security context then you need to implements the userdetailsservice and extends the spring security user object with your additional data

7574967
springsource	grails
i have installed springsource tool suite v2.7.2 with groovy and grails support on ubuntu

7574988
postgresql	mysql
then i have my homebrew install of mysql for rails eventually i switched to sqlite postgresql for heroku

7575003
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
however it s a relatively new addition to the dom and unsupported in older browsers like ie 7 ie 6 safari 4 firefox 2 and opera 9

7575018
ant	maven
a better way to work is to use tools like ant or maven to handle the build process for you

7575023
rubygems	rvm
trying to updgrade rubygems to version 1.8.10 via rvm and this error

7575023
rubygems	rvm
have tried to remove rubygems via the rvm also and then run the update again but no luck with it

debian	linux
os linux debian 6.0.2

7575074
int	double
t i return a double from two int being divided

7575117
uitableview	reloaddata
when the user wishes to go back to the view you will simply need to check for saved values and load them on to the uitableview with tableview reloaddata

7575181
children	parent
it looks like you are creating a data structure here where children have pointers to their parent

7575215
post	get
you have to stop using cookies altogether and maintain session state using only values passed by get post

7575228
postgresql	mysql
however mysql and sqlite allow you to do a select distinct id from test order by whatever while postgresql does not

7575263
post	get
edit just tried using a post request and get 403 target feed is read-only

7575336
int	chars
addendum another option is uuid_short for a 64-bit unsigned int rather than a chars field

7575344
margin	height
to be honest if you re trying to get equal height floated columns and you re using javascript for the solution anyway don t depend on padding margin

7575354
subtraction	add
if you don t want to nest queries and you want to have only one select you must add another column to your column list note that it is actually copy paste of grosssales and credits columns with subtraction sign between them

7575356
stdout	stderr
i m not 100 sure whether this will intersperse stdout and stderr the way you want

7575396
min	max
here is an extended seekbar which allows you to set a min max in floats rather than integers

7575396
min	max
this is just to add min max value as floats

7575437
memcpy	memset
my mediaitemmanager is a c++ class it does call new delete and memset memcpy

7575437
memcpy	memset
cplaylist makes no calls to memset memcpy functions

7575482
gif	png
for instance if i wanted only images types to be uploaded i would restrict the possible selections to image jpg image gif image png and the selection dialog would grey out files of other mime types

7575486
hash	salt
you insert your new record retrieve its new id then hash that id with a salt and update the record with that hash value

7575573
uinavigationbar	uisegmentedcontrol
personally i would use uisegmentedcontrol and place it in a uitoolbar or uinavigationbar

7575664
express	node.js
i have a node.js app using express that stores data in a mongodb locally

7575699
google-chrome	firefox
and this behavior occurs only in ie9 the site works fine in firefox and google-chrome

i am developing a program that calls r functions from java using jri rjava

7575811
rjava	jri
i have read the faqs for jri rjava and have been scouring the internet for fixes but have made no progress

7575811
rjava	jri
added r_home library rjava jri to the path environment variable this is where jri.dll is located

7575811
rjava	jri
set the following vm options in netbeans -djava.library.path e r r-2.13.1 library rjava jri this is where jri.dll is located

7575812
portrait	landscape
my portrait picture is a 768 x 1004 px png file and my landscape picture is a 1024 x 748 png file

7575812
portrait	landscape
when i drop the portrait picture everything looks fine but when i do the same with the landscape picture i have a big yellow exclamation point that appears

7575812
portrait	landscape
when i build and run the minimalistic project in the ipad simulator i get the portrait splash vertically in portrait orientation ok and the portrait splash horizontally in landscape mode not ok

7575829
post	get
what i want to do is disable the submit button when the form is submitted then re-enable it after 5 seconds or so so i don t get multiple post

7575871
uilabel	uitextview
i did something similar by simply having uilabel s and uitextview s lined up vertically

7575878
vbscript	vba
this would be easier i think in vba than vbscript but afaik it is possible in vbscript

7575894
width	margin
need to research if further but if you know the original width of .content then you can add the same negative margin to it â so it would compensate the original width

7575894
width	margin
and if you ll need to animate the accordion you ll just need to animate the margin alongside the width

7575913
pull	push
basically that means the servers can never push anything but can always pull

7575959
rjava	jri
the message indicates that it the path e r r-2.13.1 library rjava jri jri.dll is invalid

7576014
quad	uniform
however if you re talking about quad rendering where each quad has a different color then the uniform update overhead and multiple draw calls is going to kill your performance

7576023
printf	fgets
but when i use fgets with a popen stream with various shell commands and then print the resulting array with printf the newlines are retained and the output looks the same way as though i had gone through a terminal

7576053
children	parent
in our existing win32 tree when we add the truck 2 node we manually cycle through the child nodes and add the dummy nodes as required and children to create the tree based on the type of nodes in the children list and potentially a property on the child node - the personnode has a flag on it to indicate if its a passenger or crew so we know which parent node to add it should belong to

7576066
pop-up	dialog
for example when i click on a button a non-opaque dialog it pop-up correctly but after a couple of opening and closing of the dialog it does open

7576086
post	get
we call newsession just after a login to mark the session-id to be renewed on the next get request post requests don t work well due to the restore of the view state but the post redirect get with seam will issue gets quite often

7576086
put	get
you might want put it into your filter -- or you just mark your session to be refreshed in the next get request

7576102
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged	inotifycollectionchanged	imultivalueconverter	inotifypropertychanged	imultivalueconverter
therefore i think all binding related implementations of ivalueconverter imultivalueconverter inotifypropertychanged inotifycollectionchanged should be always public in order to work with xaml

7576104
membase	couchbase
membase and the soon-to-be-released couchbase server will easily handle your needs and provide dynamic scalability on-the-fly add or remove nodes replication with failover

7576116
post	get
try either switching to a post method or appending a timestamp to the get request querystring and see if that prevents the caching

7576129
width	height
however i do not explicitly specify the width and the height of the rectangle which means it adapts to the size of the grid which contains it the size of the grid depends on the screen resolution amongst other things and is not known before hand

7576129
width	height
i d like the radiusx and radiusy properties to be percentages of the rectangle s width and height respectively

7576181
inherited	properties
the two key properties used are background-image inherited and visibility hidden

7576181
inherited	properties
background-image inherited will make the element inherited properties from its direct parent if no image is specified this means no properties will be inherited

7576181
inherited	properties
due to this we need to make the ul for the sublinks menu inherited the properties from its parent too.

7576263
width	height
a height and width of the screen and aspect ratio

7576295
thin	webrick
rack handler thin rack handler fastcgi even rack handler webrick which is the handler rack selects above in default mode

7576301
ubuntu	debian
for debian ubuntu

7576308
background-position	background-size
i don t think you need html5 so do something similar the first step is placing an image as a background of a div and using css3 background-position and background-size take care of moving and scaling the image

7576312
width	margin
in your case you might just be able to drop the width and margin styles in that class

7576330
pop-up	dialog
instead emit client side javascript to pop-up an alert dialog or add a div that a user can click to make it go away

7576336
min	max
when doing a gradient fill on an area chart the gradient ratios are used only between the min and max of the chart

7576336

to make sure that it was using the ratios only between the min and max i inserted a zero 0 into the chart and the gradient expanded to the full height

7576386
cumsum	reshape
v 1 size max reshape cumsum ones max size size max 1

7576386
cumsum	reshape
v 1 size max reshape cumsum ones max size size max 1

7576395
multiplying	modulo
since you asked for a trick you could use a common auto_incremented id and fake it by multiplying with a big prime and then modulo 2 32

7576406
client-side	server-side
in addition since i m planning to handle all form elements using client-side scripts i don t really need any special server-side functionality so i m having a hard time figuring out what advantages do i get from using editorfor textboxfor

7576438
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
when this code is executed in google-chrome firefox ie5 ie6 or safari the literal is not parsed and simply assigned to the array correctly

7576457
spaces	delimiter
if you set applescript s text item delimiter to spaces then this would actually be better than the previous script.

7576461
put	get
firstly i would change the query here to ask for all values in the table and perhaps put some condition to constrain what you get back to make sure your cursor then contains all your values

7576508
versioning	upgrade
i m using an action filter that checks what browser versioning is being used on my site if it s an older browser i put up a div at the top asking them to upgrade

couchbase	couchdb
the couchbase distribution of couchdb couchbase single server supports google s snappy compression for the json files on disk

7576548
google-chrome	safari
the embedding of content inside seems to work on all other modern browsers ie9 google-chrome even safari on window

7576583
int	boolean
using the spread operator here causes groovy to attempt to calls a method with a signature like getstaticmetamethod string int string boolean

7576637
getter	setter
i am creating a gem and wanted to be able to modify an activerecord object by creating attribute getter and setter dynamically to a serialized attribute

7576637
getter	setter
i realize that i will need to extend activerecord with a module containing the method has_serialized and that i will need to use define_method to add the custom getter and setter however i can t figure out how to combine the two using the block syntax i want for definition

7576644
children	parent
i have a parent view model that contains a collection of other view models of same type children

7576644
children	parent
in the parent i am using a itemscontrol to show the children views

7576647
gunicorn	uwsgi
alternative #3 nginx is pretty easy to install locally and you could just point it at your django server no need for gunicorn uwsgi whatever

7576667
post	get
this code will work for both post and get

7576677
post	put
so if i put it into a post it works fine in the preview but when i publish that post there s only a note that my browser requires javascript please help

7576679
portrait	landscape
when the view is loaded in either landscape or portrait the picker is sized the same as the appropriate keyboard

7576679
width	height
however when you rotate the device once inside the view the picker doesn t resize it s height properly like it does with it s width

7576707
free	realloc
on subsequent operations free realloc it would subtract a few bytes to get to the bookkeeping area

7576731
libxml2	libxslt
i had the exact same problem and it s due an old libxml2 libxslt

7576749
imperative	declarative

using - uiview subviews allows me to avoid outlets for every single item

7576986
listview	gridview
i am not very familiar with gridview or listview not sure if they can do these below

7577030
children	parent
this is not tested code but i would scan recursively children of the parent element and build xhtml like this

7577064
memcpy	memcmp
but if you want to look at the bitwise representation of an object useful for things like memcpy and memcmp you ll need to cast their addresses to s or if you like and work with them byte-by-byte

7577070
free	malloc
if you allocate mostly large arrays and performance ends up being a problem you may want to switch a few of these to the c heap you have access to c s malloc and free in d or if it has a scoped lifetime some other allocator like regionallocator

7577071
junit	testng
i think for java i would go with either with junit or testng frameworks if you have persistence data base involved in the application i would add dbunit to the mix

7577071
ant	maven
if you have build scripts like maven or ant or gradle i would also suggest you look into jenkins and similar tools to automate builds

7577071
ant	maven
i am suggesting maven because it has life cycle events for testing you can add targets with ant i have not used gradle but if i was given choice i would choose gradle

7577072
put	get
some browsers provides a kind of preview image that represents the element while i m dragging it and when i let the element in the container with the drop event i need to get the position where the user wants to put him

profiling	benchmarking
rails includes built-in options for detailed profiling and benchmarking beyond basic logging

7577204
listview	gridview
both gridview and listview can do paging if you put a datapager in them

7577204
listview	gridview	gridview	objectdatasource
i don t believe the value for the sortparametername parameter is filled in by the listview when using an objectdatasource - it might or might not be when using a gridview

7577214
.htaccess	httpd.conf
as pat mentioned while i was looking for the appropriate syntax you can use .htaccess or modify httpd.conf itself if you are using apache and have access

7577215
width	height
solved it by adding width and height to #slider

7577218
google-chrome	firefox
it works great in firefox and google-chrome but crashes in a really puzzling way in ie v8

7577271
put	get
don t override put - as you observe it s fragile and doesn t get invoked if you call db.put instead of the model s put function

7577275
google-chrome	firefox
it is running on the same machine as the browser google-chrome right now but as far as i can tell the behavior is the same with firefox 7 and ie 9

7577275
post	get
of course a difference here is that this is a get not a post but i ve tried that in my script and it makes no difference

7577296
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it s working pretty well so far runs pretty well on ios devices and also in safari firefox and google-chrome

7577296
google-chrome	safari
the output on ios google-chrome and safari shows the parts of the texture corresponding to 0 2 and 3 in a vertical line with the 2 animating up and right

7577301
hash	hmac
it s fairly trivial to demonstrate that an hmac is going to be faster however signing a message requires first hashing it then computing the signature over the hash whilst computing an hmac requries first hashing it then computing the hmac which is merely two additional one-block hash computations

7577303
hide	show
i have looked for tutorials online but they only show how to show hide with a button

7577324
stdout	fflush
and as mentioned you need to end your printf s with n or call fflush stdout or it will get buffered and not print

7577377
button	checkbox
looked and found solutions with broken links or that did not work for me that said i am using the multiselect found here i need to get the selected checkbox when i hit a button to use them in c# i am totally stuck on this one and the example used in the demo that does it is in php -

on windows the directories c temp c tmp temp and tmp in that order

7577517
integer	unsigned
the binary literals have to be only unsigned integer numbers

hex	binary
if there is no way to do it mathematically i feel like i am going to have to convert the hex into binary and then perform twos complements on it but again i dont know where to start

7577524
getter	setter
this is because the object returned by the getter method may not be the same one you passed to the setter

7577524
getter	setter
the setter may have made a copy for example or may have failed validation and set a nil instead. this would mean you were leaking the original object and over-releasing the one the getter gave back to you

7577524
getter	setter
in the case where the property is a retain type and both the getter and setter are just the synthesized versions all of the above examples will work

7577538
filtering	grouping
if you fill out your directory settings with the correct but set the grouping object filtering to an ldap filtering that will match nothing you will not import any grouping

7577542
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this only happens in ie9 but i have only tested against safari google-chrome latest firefox ver 5 6 ie8 and ie9

7577552
sorting	filtering
all the functionality sorting paging filtering is taken care of

7577554
uiview	subviews
or create a custom uiview class as you had listen for touch events and slowly adjust two subviews positions to follow the drag action

7577613
qcombobox	qstyle
apart from that i think the only option you have is to create your own widget - but even using painting functions from qstyle mostly drawcontrol i guess and scraps of code implementing separate qspingbox and qcombobox this will mean lots and lots of work

7577620
ubuntu	linux
linux rhat ubuntu

7577635
hex	binary
i ve searched on google but couldnt find any help in this regard however i did note that opening the file in binary is recommended for editing with hex

7577647
fflush	gets
if the system is suitably underloaded then going to sleep will mean the os gets control and lets the i o queue fflush so it would have that effect

7577650
apache	nginx
in production environment your webserver apache nginx iis takes care of gzipping static so doesn t matter whether gzip works in dev or not

7577673
try-catch	exception-handling

free	malloc
i have to use c asm to create a memory management system since malloc free don t yet exist

7577828
free	malloc
i need to have malloc free

7577828
free	malloc
a memory stack where malloc grows the stack and free p shrinks the stack by shifting p..stack_pointer this would invalidate the shifted memory addresses though...

7577838
put	get	post	get	post	put
i had put the part in the post section of the view not the get section of the view

7577886
min	max
i don t think its practical to ask the os about the min and max as they can use virtual mem mem-management to dymanically adjust that as needed

7577894
multiplying	transpose
for a class a question that was posed by my teacher was the algorithmic cost of multiplying a matrix times its transpose

7577894
multiplying	transpose
i understand that when you multiplying a matrix by its transpose you have to calculate less of the matrix because its symmetrical but i can t think of how to manipulate an algorithm that could take less than o n 3

7577908
google-chrome	safari
whereas it is displayed in mozilla google-chrome and safari

7577978

7578154
opera	safari
i have seen in some posts that opera and safari can have trouble with these

7578156
int	double	int	chars
same type but both must be int chars float double or pointer

7578173

getter	setter
let s say i want a private variable in myclass to be accessible only by two functions the public getter and setter

7582664
getter	setter
however the getter and setter behave normally

7582664
getter	setter
edit 1 a use case is having the getter setter perform error checking or other form of logic

7582664
getter	setter
and then any class can inherit it and access state only through the getter setter

7582664
getter	setter
of course the class is useless without modifying the getter and setter according to your desired logic

packets	multicast
m - the packets wasn t broadcast but was multicast

7589124
packets	multicast
the way the linux networking stack determines the difference between in b m and p is i think by looking at the destination address of the packets and seeing whether it s a broadcast address ff ff ff ff ff ff on networks using ieee mac-48 addresses a multicast address has the group bit set on networks using ieee mac-48 addresses or the address of the adapter on which it s received

7589142

uiview	subviews
you need to modify initwithcoder of your custom uiview class to programmatically load the nib that defines its subviews layout

7590364
virtualenv	setuptools
but now when i m trying installing in a virtualenv and when i run python setup.py develop setuptools distribute ends up adding usr lib64 python2.6 site-packages to the easy-install.pth but not opt devtools lib64 python2.6 site-packages

7590381
next	except
next you pump the file into an array and lob off everything except the last 300 lines

7590396
post	put
just post it on the site and put a password on the directory and tell your friends the password

7590414
folder	directory
the default path assumes your public directory sits in the same folder as your application and library folder but this is changed easily by editing the paths above

7590419
rss	feed
lets say two users are interested in sport category rss feed from the streaming api but each user has its own filtering mechanism on the server which results in different push data sets.

7590443
min	max
you could use other functions for max to give you different answers for example min

7590471
hash	salt
with salting and sha1 you hash the password to be sha1 password + salt but i m not sure how to verify it

7590499
hash	salt
so you store the salt along with the hash salt + hash

7590499
hash	salt
to verify check that hash salt + password equals the stored hash

7590499
hash	salt
the main purpose of using a salt is to ensure that two equal passwords don t hash to the same thing and also to make an attack on the hash password more difficult

7590499
hash	salt
without salt you d just have to break a given hash once and for all to identify all passwords that hash to it

7590499
hash	salt
with salt you d essentially have to attack each hash anew

7590499
hash	salt
note that in these modern days of cheap parallel computing hardware gpus and cloud a single salt hash is not all that secure anymore as it can possibly be discovered by brute force in feasible amounts of time

7590512
for-loop	arrays
arrays don t implement which is the normal interface used by the enhanced for-loop other than for arrays

7590522
hash	salt
with salting the attacker has to operate on each password independently starting with an entire dictionary of words salting them hashing them and then comparing them each to the salt hash password

7590522
hash	salt
one common method of storing the salt is to just append or prepend it to the hash and store it in the database

7590522
hash	salt
since the salt and hash are of known length it s pretty easy to pull them out independently

7590526
post	get
you post your xml file and u get the sourcecode for your c # classes

7590528
for-loop	arrays
i think arrays are just special cased in the for-loop s implementation

7590926
nsstring	nsnumberformatter
when i try to convert the nsstring 8.8 to a nsnumber by nsnumberformatter

7590959

note it s also a 1 to 1 implementation of observer-pattern so the interconnection between view and presenter is necessary

7591279
gridview	repeater
inside this repeater i have a gridview sqlds and 2 checkboxes

7591282
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
instead of focusing on uibuttons and their events i removed the uibuttons and focused on the touchesbegan touchesmoved and touchesend methods

7591348

width	height
is there a way to resize a window independently of the preferred back buffer width and height

7591469
serializable	deserialization
if you are determined to store this non-relational data in a relational database you ll be dependent on either your own code or some eav-based object serializable and deserialization library for whatever programming language you re using

7591470
viewdidload	viewwillappear
no viewdidload no viewwillappear just a pushed nib with nothing else

7591770
checkbox	dropdownlistfor	inherited	properties
it would seem that what you are trying to accomplish is to have a single class that is mydropdownlist be able to inherited properties from the dropdownlistfor and to have the mycheckbox class inherited properties from the checkbox class while having your two my classes have some extra properties which happen to be identical

7591800
hash	md5
the way i have previously done this is storing the md5 hash of the password not the actual password

7591800
hash	md5
on the server side you need to check if the login is coming from a cookie and then check if the hash is the same as the password in your database after its been hash through md5

7591829
width	margin
once you do that you can set the centering div so it has a specific width and also set it to margin auto

in your example the class will be called flipappdelegate which inherited all of the methods and properties of the nsobject class and which implements the uiapplicationdelegate protocol

7592076
getter	setter	accessor	properties
since properties normally just need basic accessor a getter that just returns the current value and a setter that just sets the current value using synthesize is a shortcut to let the compiler create the variable to store the value the getter method and the setter method for you automatically

7592095
put	get
for reference if you have visual studio 2005 installed you can run one of the special command prompts they put in the start menu to get access to the command line compiler and tools

7592120
getter	setter
synthesize is simply a shortcut to generate getter and setter for your variables

7592455
min	max	range	max	range	min
another detail is that you probably want to explicitly pass in a range otherwise one will be chosen for you based on the actual min and max values in your data

if a singleton is stateless it s a degenerate case of being stateful and thread-safe is trivially true

7602991

fast-forward	merge
you can merge branches and leave the branches visible or you can heavily rebase and fast-forward merge so your history never shows a single parallel line

7604309
mouse	keyboard
i m curious if it would be better to pass a parameter to the click event or use a global to detect if it issued by the keyboard or mouse or if it is better to just do what the plugin did and have the code inside the keydown function

7604329
portrait	landscape
currently i have a dual pane layout for both landscape and portrait on a tablet

7604329
portrait	landscape
now i can see that for some tablets it would make sense to have a single pane for portrait and a dual one for landscape

7604329
portrait	landscape
a if in landscape a fragment stack of depth n say is in the right pane then on an orientation change to portrait i would still want fragment n to be displayed and the stack to be maintained

7604329
portrait	landscape
it should be mentioned that i understand that you can have have different layouts for portrait and landscape and am finishing up a large project with a dual pane layout for both portrait and landscape so ok on the lifecycle of an orientation change

7604377
floating-point	fractions
see the floating-point guide for a detailed explanation of how binary fractions work

7604377
floating-point	integer
a biased exponent is used because it allows floating-point numbers to compared for value exactly like integer numbers if a bit pattern a is greater than a bit pattern b when interpreted as integer the same is always true if you interpret the patters as floating-point numbers

7604383
postgresql	mysql
the only recommendation i have try postgresql instead of mysql

7604430
qmainwindow	qdialog
i m having trouble imagining the context in which one would open a qmainwindow parented to a modal qdialog

7604470
puts	gets
these two together make is so that before a new row is inserted it checks to see if you specified the value of id if not it increases the generation by one and gets its current value and puts it as the id column

7604472
move	drag
when anyone click the image and drag the mouse it move the image

7604474
for-loop	arrays
however i suspect you want to define your arrays of rectangles outside of the first for-loop

7604489
geocoding	geocode
rather than geocoding through google each an every time that i would like to display it on a google map it seems better to simply geocode each address upon entry and store the coordinates for later

7604502
ssl	ocsp
for ssl connections this includes the ssl handshake and the ocsp validation step

7604513
put	get
instead you have to work out what you want to happen when the user presses the button put this in a method and get the button event handler to call that method

7604531
folder	directory
if you look in your current project folder you will see a hidden .bundle directory

7604571

im trying to hide the tab bar for a specific view and show it back when the screen is touch

7604695
superclass	subclassing
failed prototype initially we prototyped a 3-deep class hierarchy using one discriminatorcolumn on the superclass and included the second discriminatorcolumn on subclassing

7604725
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
in the view controller you want to not have a tab bar add to viewwillappear or viewdidappear to reverse that have a touch-up-inside event trigger

7604726
post	get
i think i saw something about web.py begin only able to get input if given a post or get but i didn t see anything in the source code that should prevent this

7604781
opensso	openam
with another access manager product opensso openam

7604800
macports	homebrew
the advantage of homebrew over macports is that it tries to rely as much on what is provided by the native os as possible without installing any additional duplicate libraries

7604826
ostringstream	std	ostream	ostringstream	std	ostream
all those people telling you to use std ostream for the type instead of std ostringstream are absolutely correct

7604826
ostringstream	std
you shouldn t be using std ostringstream that way

7604853
min	max
the query contained only aggregate functions min max that were

7604859
post	get
i may find myself having to use post more often as the encrypted text might be longer than the original - pushing the limits of get when many fields and their data are present

7604879
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
either for add subtract multiplying divide and exponent respectively

7604937
subtract	add
yes it is possible to add or subtract any number to your variable n

7604962
switching	screens
i m trying to make a simple little tool that would allow a user to switching from normal operation to a mode where all application messages are disabled and they can use the mouse to do some freehand drawing then switching modes again to keep their drawing on the screens while they do whatever other normal stuff they want

7604963
client-side	server-side
there are a lot of similar questions but they all deal with server-side slowness - this is all about client-side issues

7604977
disk	ram
and since you have 32gb of ram try to load as much as you can into ram and sort it there then write back to disk

7604993
xslt	xquery
xslt or xquery would be more appropriate tools fix errors found in the xml

7604998
octal	binary	octal	hex	hex	binary
unadorned integer literals including binary hex and octal numbers yield plain integers unless the value they denote is too large to be represented as a plain integer in which case they yield a long integer

7605007
expandablelistview	expandablelistadapter
what i did was to set the expandablelistview s divider to 0 and then insert divider groups into it s expandablelistadapter

7605097
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome safari and firefox both document.foo1 and document.foo2 return undefined

7605099
width	height
cityville seems to have a version of the fb api that allows them to go 100 width height within a facebook iframe

7605119
post	get
this allows your script to make cross domain post get and options

7605119
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have only verified this works with safari google-chrome firefox 3.6

7605127
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the desired effect is working in firefox and google-chrome but not safari

7605141
typedef	struct
typedef struct data_struct

7605141
free	malloc
always good to free anything you malloc

7605143
getter	setter
to make it mutable change the fields from public final to private and add getter setter

7605159
google-chrome	safari
khtml like gecko google-chrome 14.0.835.186 safari 535.1 1317346730

7605187
google-chrome	safari
try looking at the generated source code or inspecting the dom using firebug or the developer tools of google-chrome safari

7605258
nswindow	nspanel
i changed the class in the nib from nswindow to nspanel and everything seems to be working okay

7605263
pull	push
an android app that will interact with that server pull and push data into the server

7605270
post	put
note here i m intentionally using post instead of put to indicate a partial update

7605290
hide	show
so you can improvise using states binding a tabbar to the names of the states and hide show panels based on state

7605329
put	get
i currently have my properties files put inside my project folder so if i change the content of those files while my web app is deployed the jsf pages that use these resource bundle won t be able to get updated automatically unless the server is restarted

7605344
folder	directory
there s the main home.php view.php etc in the root directory then a program directory with the main scripts and value objects then utilities and components folder that contain miniature view type classes

7605364
post	put
with your current code specifying the form s action as index doesn t make sense rails form helpers can either post put or delete

7605405
int	chars
i am making a caesar cipher and am trying to convert the chars value of each letter into an int so the shift value can change it

7605405
int	chars
it says it cannot convert int into chars

7605420
int	chars
cannot implicitly convert type int to chars

7605421
postgresql	mysql
also if you are planning on providing a web interface and service at the server level my guess is you are going to be storing a fair amount of data i would look into a more robust and scalable database such as mysql or postgresql

7605442
comparator	comparable
this is the exact situation faced by the comparable interface its comparator method wants to take an argument the same type as the object it is called on

7605462
google-chrome	firefox
i am testing with firefox and google-chrome

7605523
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
using objectdatasource means you have to perform your own select update insert and delete method that usually found in sqldatasource

7605523
listview	gridview
and you ll lose other feature too because a simple ienumerable alone can t be bound in two ways to other list control such as listview and gridview

7605534
post	get
the orderid will get passed by post get or a class call

7605542
emacs	gedit
you d be better off identifying what gedit does that makes you want to use it instead of emacs and extending emacs to make it do that too

7605583
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that it works fine in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie7

7605606
google-chrome	firefox	post	get
i m using the fllowing code to set cookie in django 1.1 but the cookie get deleted every time the page refresh or during post in ie 7 ie 8 and safari.for firefox and google-chrome it works fine

7605624
implements	extends
mybookshelf extends activity and implements an interface called by asynchronous download and unzip processes

7605708
cout	cin
you seem to be intending to read and write one character at a time - cin and cout are both capable of working with integral values and this would be ideal here

7605820
apache	nginx
defaults to true but in the production environment is turned off as the server software nginx or apache used to run the application should serve static assets instead

7605871
rss	feed
most browsers or email programs already have an rss reader build in and you can also set them to poll the feed either daily or on demand

7605884
put	get
what i need to know is what is the best way to put each id into a variable and pass it to a database query and get the results i need

7605963
datediff	difference
datediff month date1 date2 will only compare the difference between the month parts and does not take days into account

7605992
spaces	delimiter
for instance if spaces can also be part of the split delimiter such as

7605999
getter	setter
this is a public field so groovy creates a public getter and setter for it and makes the field private

7605999
getter	setter
the getter isn t used but spring sees the setter and since beans are configured to be wired by name as opposed to by type the bean is injected since there s a match between the setter name setspringsecurityservice and the bean name

7605999
public	protected	inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
but like any public or protected properties the dependency injection is inherited so just remove it from all of your subclassing and leave it in the base class

7606005
post	get
it s http get post requests

7606054
emacs	gedit
it d probably be easier to coax emacs to emulate gedit than the other way around

7606075
post	get
this class supports post as well as get

7606103
getter	setter
now you can getter and setter on the java class and then output the xml

7606129
folder	directory
if another folder in the repository is specified as an external of the folder you are checking out it will be be included in the working directory after an svn update and can be committed along with the remainder of the contents of the working directory

7606151
hide	show
faster for the user to navigate from section to section javascript hide show is instantaneous

7606239
listview	gridview
you can do a findviewbyid on both the listview and gridview

7606252
cassini	iis
when the url path starts with 1.0 i want cassini iis to go to myservice.svc

7606303
retaincount	dealloc
when the first one is sent the application then runs off and calls dealloc on the image because the retaincount has decreased to zero

7606304
bmp	png
my program works very well in both png and bmp files

7606313
xlib	cairo
cairo uses xlib and in some cases cairo-gl think customized opengl to work with on linux and other platforms

7606313
gtk	cairo
there is also the fact that gtk uses a lot of other libraries like glib pango and of course cairo

7606313
gtk	cairo
to optimise gtk you may try changing the backend of cairo difficult unreccomended and requires another ton of glue code or stop using libwimp this will make gtk look less native

7606345
google-chrome	firefox
when i run my website on firefox mozila and google-chrome then all these three frame is displaying

7606363
retaincount	dealloc
then i am printing retaincount in dealloc method

7606416
wxpython	pygtk	wxpython	pyqt
my suggestion though would be picking up one gui toolkit pyqt pyside for qt pygtk for gtk+ or wxpython for wxwidgets

7606508
rss	feed
but however this is dependent on the structure of the rss feed itself if the structure is different it won t work so i was wondering if theres a more broader and less specific way to grab all the titles from a rss feed

7606525
postgresql	mysql
similarly to postgresql there s another function in mysql too that returns the actual timestamp the one that corresponds to the time of the evaluation the statement s particular part that contains the function and that function is sysdate

7606532
folder	directory
bow the problem is how can i link each of the different web.config file with its corrosponding virtual directory for each the website because both of the virtual directory will target the same folder of code base

7606555
terminate	timeout
my application require timeout of 10 min if there is no activity on the application from last 10 min then either the application is terminate or login login credential in sqlite db is shown

7606569
width	height
this will mean you can assign it a width height

7606629
screens	tablet
well as per my understanding android-sdk supports tablet from the beginning but since 1.6 onwards multiple screens support was enhanced and made developer friendly

7606633
ienumerable	iqueryable
i m not sure whether i read it somewhere or maybe just got used to this assumption - i always thought that when the ef api returns an ienumerable and not iqueryable then this means that the results have been materialized

7606637
serializable	deserialization
the problem you are experiencing is that the c# version of jsonpath does not include a json parser so you have to use it with another json framework that handles serializable and deserialization

7606637
idictionary	ilist
jsonpath comes with a built-in basicvaluesystem that uses the idictionary interface to represent json objects and the ilist interface to represent json arrays

7606637
idictionary	ilist
so if only you could take a json string and parse it into a nested structure of idictionary objects ilist arrays and primitive values you could then use jsonpath to filter it

7606637
serializable	deserialization
as luck would have it we can use json.net which has good serializable and deserialization capabilities to do that part of the job

7606651
int	chars
on x86 architecture normally the net effect is just that you will get some strange value if the function is returning a true native type a chars or an int that fits in a register and you may instead get memory corruption or a crash if the function is for example returning a class instance std string

7606661
getter	setter
the purpose of property declaration in the .h file it can also be don in .m file is to tell the compiler how to handle the getter and setter for this property when you use dot syntax

7606672
vsto	add-in
from within an outlook vsto add-in i want to clear the current selection

7606705
versioning	upgrade
i guess it is time to upgrade to the next versioning

7606749
implements	extends
long story short if you haven t already you should try implements your own iworkflowprovider that extends sitecore.workflows.simple.workflowprovider and configure it in your web.config

7606783
jar	war
and in the application assembly segment it is sufficient if you specify just the war file and add the model jar file as a dependency to the war file

7606801
getter	setter
the getter setter of the list are in superbean and i should use this superbean in my backingbean to get the value of the itemlist

7606822
stdout	stderr
-u force stdin stdout and stderr to be totally unbuffered

7606822
stdout	stderr
on systems where it matters also put stdin stdout and stderr in binary mode

7606861
portrait	landscape
mobile safari typically does a zoom when changing from portrait to landscape instead of re-doing the page layout and that may be what you re seeing

7606882
implements	extends	iprincipal	iidentity
i will implements and extends the iprincipal and iidentity so when you access user.identity you will find lastname and firstname

7606882
iprincipal	iidentity
for my projects i have extended iidentity and iprincipal with my classes adding the properties i always need to be there

7606882
iprincipal	iidentity
while in iprincipal identity iidentity and isinrole boolean

7606929
min	max
the group by must go before order by and you should choose what value of i.value do you want max min ...

7606930
min	max
you either have to add i.value to the group by clause or use an aggregate function min max avg ... on i.value

7606937
hide	show
when the focus in a particluar rect of the screen it need to show up a message and need to hide automatically

7606951
mouse	keyboard
occurs when either a mouse or keyboard action moves the scroll box

7607009

gray boxes change height on resize but constant width

7607017
width	height
blue box changes height and width on resize

7607017
width	height
cyan box changes width but not height on resize

7607022
g++	gcc
may be it s not your case but check also your source doesn t have c extension this may fool the compiler and use g++ not gcc as a command the library you ll link are different

7607056
ienumerable	iqueryable
i am not surprised that they are running slower than when the queries were against iqueryable but now that they are running against ienumerable there is a big difference between the two

7607066
rss	feed
extract all feed rss atom etc. that is associated with this page

7607097
put	get
i m trying to create a login screen in silverlight and i was taken two textboxes and put them in two of rows in grid layout but when i run the app textboxes taking right alignment and stick with end of the window right side any one help me to get out of this

7607126
dotnetnuke	n2cms
i came across dotnetnuke and n2cms

7607169
uiview	subviews
if you just want simple image as background of your uiview just add it as a subviews and center it

7607185
folder	directory
i have managed this for a regular java program by adding log4j.xml under src folder so i could set the directory in it it worked it is writing logs to a txt file created

7607210
submit	submission
i m trying to build a micro-app where a user pastes a link clicks submit the link is added to the database and is also shown called from the database in a list below the submission form

7607219
width	height
you can create uiview with line s height and width and give background color to it

7607262
vsto	add-in
i m developing vsto outlook add-in so i m using sharepoint client object model

processors intel r core tm i5 cpu m 520 2.40ghz 4 cpus

7607315
cpu	processors
processors intel r core tm 2 duo cpu e6550 2.33ghz 2 cpus

7607377
x86	64bit
for some reason the webbrowser control in c# defaults to using a 64bit ie backend if available and that version wouldn t work with the x86 dll we built because the wmp object only looked into registry entries for 64bit versions of filters

7607377
x86	64bit
by setting your build configuration in visual studio to target an x86 cpu rather than any cpu for the application that runs the webbrowser control you can ensure that even on a 64bit version of windows that the webbrowser control uses the 32-bit back end

7607402
many-to-many	one-to-many
recently i mapped many-to-many with composite primary key you can easily change it to one-to-many

7607407
yslow	pagespeed
following the guidelines of pagespeed and yslow is also always a good idea

7607449
int	boolean
they are working fine while i m using string int whatever fields but seem to interfere with squeryl s syntax sugar for boolean conditions

7607456
fadein	fadeout
i wish fadein fadeout in silverlight was as easy as jquery made it

7607486
button	checkbox
we can see the play list on the left a jtable with a filter text field and random checkbox above it and the enqueue history button below

7607521
uibaritem	uiresponder	inherited	subclassing	uicontrol	uibutton	uicontrol	uibaritem	uicontrol	uiresponder
basically any class which inherited from uiresponder not just uicontrol but also uiview subclassing can become first responders but uibutton inherited from uibaritem and nsobject

7607555
waitpid	fork
i m debugging a program which repeats the typical procedure of using fork where the child process does some delegated task as the parent calls waitpid to wait for the child to finish and then continues

7607567
inherited	properties
to solve this i ve got mypopoutwindow to inherited toolstripdropdown but in the constructor set the toplevel properties to false

7607576
portrait	landscape
however when i load that in portrait mode or landscape mode the content is fit to the size of the web view

7607609
serializable	deserialization
the classes needed for the actionscript serializable deserialization are part of the as3corelib library

7607663
google-chrome	firefox
what you really need are the numbers other people get when visiting your site- you could include it in a form questionaire or mailing from firefox 7 and google-chrome so far.

7607708
put	get
next if what you put into the map is an arraylist then you can just cast what you get out to that type again

7607767
getter	setter
intellij generates the following getter setter code for boolean fields

7607818
qthread	qobject
don t subclass qthread subclass qobject see

7607901
getter	setter
btw the getter setter signatures should have the same type which yours dont

7607903
maven	pom.xml
i understand that you can create only one artifact from one pom.xml in maven

7607934
screens	tablet
also other android tablet phones can be used with pens even if they re technically not made to support pens but those pens are just special styluses that emulate the capacitive touch of your finger so with those devices the screens can not tell the difference between your fingers and that pen so you can not assign them different functions which is definitely not as good

7607941
wav	riff
the formats might be wav riff matroska mp4

7608009
addclass	removeclass
i m using the addclass and removeclass methods from jquery

7608023
dojo	dwr
dwr + dojo demo

7608059
accelerometer	gyroscope
kkinput offers the same convenient way to test for keyboard input to get accelerometer including filtering gyroscope and device motion attitude values and the current touches

7608158
int	chars
scanf d ... is more complex first it optionally discards whitespace spaces enters tabs ... then it reads as many chars as possible to represent an int and stops at the first chars that can t be used for int like a n

7608163
stdout	stderr
without the process.standardinput.writeline it prints 61 lines on stderr 1 line on stdout and creates mp3 file of 1212457 bytes

7608163
stdout	stderr
add the quit and it prints less number of lines on stderr nothing on stdout and a much smaller mp3 file

7608179
put	get
your other solution is to take the div outside of its container so it doesn t get cut off and put them both inside of a new container

7608214
mouseover	mouseout
have two event listeners attached to the polygon for mouseover and mouseout

7608242
google-chrome	firefox
for years i have been using smooth-scrolling plugins in my browsers firefox google-chrome

7608310
jruby	mri
the problem is that you have probably installed version 0.4.6 which is not specific to the jruby platform but also installs incorrectly on mri

7608310
jruby	mri
so the error neo4j not found is because you are using jruby and installed the neo4j.rb gem in mri

7608316
ienumerable	iqueryable
difference between ienumerable and iqueryable is not in the way how data are fetched because iqueryable is ienumerable

7608332
strsplit	substr
this uses the strsplit string delimiter method which splits the string around the delimiter returning an array containing the resulting substr

7608344
firefox	safari
my script has been tested in firefox 6 and safari 5 and i have the same problem happening in both browsers

7608363
pop-up	dialog
we tracked this down to a problem on the webdriver node that the test was using - usually it was some pop-up dialog being open which apparently blocked the test run

7608365
width	height
it works fine with absolute values for width and height for these vbox s but when specified in percentages the vbox uses all the available space 100 for any percentage value

7608365
width	height
image 2 with width 25 and height 10

7608384
setcontentview	findviewbyid
the findviewbyid is relative to a layout and must be called after setcontentview if i remember well

7608464
inherited	properties
but is it possible to define new properties or attributes to newly created ui elements i mean not inherited but brand new to define some specific behavior i am not able to handle with default propertis or attributes

7608490
gdi	stretchblt

width	margin	width	height	margin	height
usually the default is content-box which means that the padding border and margin all add to the height width so you ll need to factor that into your calculations if you have the box model as content-box

another options is you can change the box model to border-box using the box-sizing css property

many good answers already so i ll add one that does not rely on regexes but rather on that the key-lines contain three spaces tab delimiter entries and the values only one

7611121
hide	show
edit i think what you re asking is oncreate ran from the ui thread you want to show a progressdialog and in the same method return a value from an http request and once it completes hide the dialog

7611121
hide	show
show progressdialog call http request get value hide progressdialog without adding another thread for the http request or the progressdialog will not show which in turn means your return http request code must be outside of the calling oncreate method

7611127
filtering	grouping
just put in a where filtering before the grouping

7611131

7611396
portrait	landscape
maybe the fact that this imageview activity is configured to use an different layout for portrait and landscape view i m using this with an different copy of xml layout inside the layout-land folder

7611396
portrait	landscape
the main difference in the portrait and landscape layout is that portrait uses a linearlayout with vertical orientation and have an gallery widget that uses that imageview while the problematic landscape uses horizontal orientation and listview instead of gallery

7611410
innodb	myisam
i d suggest that you just convert the innodb tables to myisam

7611632
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have noticed that when instantiating a uitabbarcontroller it loads all it s dependencies and is really stubborn when trying to release an entire uiviewcontroller

7611632
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i ve done a few things to combat this when i ve had high memory uiviewcontroller attached to a uitabbarcontroller

7611656
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox + internet explorer but i just noticed that it adds a 1px border margin padding in webkit browsers safari google-chrome which moves the box a bit.

7611701
put	get
you can either edit that background image get a new one and point to that or put in some nifty webkit code or something head tag of index.html

7611728
folder	directory

7611739
equals	gethashcode

7611742
hide	show
i have a question actually i need one if else for hide or show one div i had wrote the following function but it didnâ t work

7611753
free	malloc
malloc and free do not call object constructors and destructors since there is no objects in c

7611761
folder	directory	put	get
if i create a directory called folder and put an .htaccess file in it i can get the redirect working but other urls which refer to that folder no longer work

7611761
folder	directory
using identical syntax but omitting the folder from the 2nd line works if the .htaccess is in the folder directory so i know the above can t be too far off - but as i said i cannot do that

7611791
mouse	keyboard
doing this makes me take my hands off the keyboard and use a mouse something i generally try to avoid.

7611803

7612114
mouseover	mouseout
you also have a problem with using .hover -- that actually encapsulates two actions mouseover and mouseout

7612114
mouseover	mouseout
when you assign two functions to it the first is mouseover and the second is mouseout but when you assign only one function to it that one function is used for both mouseover and mouseout

7612114
fadein	fadeout
so in effect your code is causing the element to fadein and fadeout on mouseout

7612126
fadein	fadeout
try adding .stop before each fadein and fadeout

7612137
equals	gethashcode
every object implements the gethashcode function and equals function

7612177
iprincipal	iidentity
you need to create your own classes that implement iidentity and iprincipal

7612202
equals	gethashcode
if a reference type does not override equals gethashcode a dictionary using the default comparator won t care about any of the key objects fields or properties and thus won t notice or care if they change

7612202
equals	gethashcode
it s simplest to think of the default gethashcode method as returning a number related to an object id and the default equals method as comparing object id s

7612202
equals	gethashcode
if the only part of an object that is examined by equals or gethashcode is the object id then for purposes of those functions all objects are immutable

7612222
hide	show
you can use that utility function as pseudo at the top of each page and the same function also be used to hide or show sections in your page

7612231

i think you want to be using onitemlongclicklistener instead of onclicklistener

7612267
children	parent
you re hiding all of the children of the parent list element which will hide the parent element since it has nothing to display

7612267
google-chrome	firefox
use google-chrome console or firebug in firefox to view the html tab for that element after it s hidden and you ll notice each of the li s for the ul#home are display none

7612334
disk	ram
for other applications such as embedded systems or some but not most virtual machines where the disk has been created in ram this will be different and storage mechanisms such as eeprom compact flash card or punch-card could be used

we re considering a development workflow where each individual feature is developed on a separate branch then merged into trunk master when it s ready for release

7612435
free	malloc
there is overhead associated with calling malloc and free

7612435
free	malloc
since you are doing a lot of mallocs and frees you could wind up severly fragmenting your heap where you may not have enough contiguous free memory to do a malloc elsewhere

7612472
x86	64bit
on some 64bit architectures for example many linux and solaris x86 systems i work with int is 32 bits and long is 64bit

7612504
int	chars
since chars can be assigned to int you can use string.charat to create an int array with the chars values in reverse order

7612518
children	parent
after form is submitted in edit httppost method i give my parent object a new children collection of two child elements with their isselected properties set to false and true respectively that is opposite from httpget method and call view method to render my model

7612524
stdio	fflush
i do not know enough c++ to actually find out why but they seem to have tempered with how stdio writes to that stream how it s buffered or do it in such a special way that the streamreader on the c# side is not fflush until the default 4096 byte buffer is full

7612524
stderr	fflush
so in conclusion all i had to do was to manually fflush stderr in sox.c after each fprintf stderr ... call in display_status ...

7612549
free	malloc
calling multiple malloc free can actually increase the memory used by your process without any leaks involved if the size passed to malloc is variable as proven by this question

7612572
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
i have found that malloc realloc and free are pretty expensive

7612585
int	chars
because you can use an int you can assign an int a chars value

7612585
int	chars
you will have to convert from the int back to the chars to assign it to astring.charat 2

7612719
int	double
okay i found the answer finally and it might help those creating sprites the width when divided into the amount frames has to be a whole number since the measurements are in int not float or double so it moves because when the frame gets divided it came out to a fraction instead which caused it to moves i guess whatever that float extra measurement was

first of all i can t upgrade to a newer versioning of the player because i need the displayclick fullscreen option to work and it doesn t with versioning 5

7612959
width	height
i m making a liquid website so everything resizes so far so good...my page has a couple of iframes they will resize just great in i.e using for height and width but when it comes to firefox only the width will resize and not the height the frame ends up pushing over my tables and making the whole thing look wrong

7612968
width	height
using firebug on a local demo at the stage they go out of line you can see the inline element styles for left top and width height are different

7612972
width	height
just change the height width of the outside border and you use this block of xaml like a textbox

7613196
post	get
using my custom ajax library in the aforementioned browsers i can make as many ajax requests as i want in any order using get and or post methods and they all work flawlessly

7613196
post	get
so for example either of the following ajax post requests will pass post data if they are the absolute first ajax request whether get or post

7613241
width	height
the only time they get updated is when you actually create the rectangle object passing the height width and x-y points or setting x y height and or width of a rectangle properties

7613241
width	height
since in my program i am only trying to define the boundary or the area for drawing the shape of a rectangle i set the x y width or height

7613241
width	height
as far as figuring out the width and height of a rectangle you don t have to once you set its width and height once

7613241
width	height
every time you reset the x and or y value of a rectangle it maintains its width and height

7613302
gif	png
there is a decompress_bitmap call that will read in png jpg gif and many other formats

7613316
jar	war
consider a maven project with multiple interdependent modules let s say three jar modules a b and c which are dependencies for a war module z

7613316
jar	war
this means my jar modules are constantly building only rarely leaving a gap for my war module s to build

7613316
jar	war
also the constant running of builds means that if i commit a change that touches jars a and b the war file z may be built once for jar a which builds quickly and then again for jar b which takes longer

7613334
telerik	radcombobox
i m not sure whether this is an option for you but the radcombobox from telerik is extremely flexible

7613355
folder	directory
this tells the browser to look in the current folder not the root folder for the directory foo and then the subsequent directory and the file

folder	directory
all pages inside web-inf directory not accessed to user so if this is a simple jsp pages move it to public folder and check that it accessable via browser

7613433
mouse	keyboard
it looks like mouse events will add listeners to canvas elements fine but keyboard events don t seem to be working for canvas elements

7613460

7613586
exponent	modulo
one side of an rsa key will consist of the modulo and an exponent

7613586
exponent	modulo
the modulo will be a large number not representable with the normal integer types and the exponent is typically a large number for one side and a relatively small one for the other

7613586
exponent	modulo
avoiding certain vulnerabilities requires additional steps such as adding random padding into each piece of data and ensuring that the padded data raised to the exponent from the key would exceed the modulo if it weren t done as modular exponentiation

7613629
put	get
simply use get and put to check-in check-out files

7613647
unsigned	short
i m trying to create an unsigned short data type in sql server but so far all i ve managed is to get it to not allow any negative values which wastes half of my storage space

7613647
unsigned	short
so when i store my unsigned short value to the database i just need to cast it as a signed short

7613647
unsigned	short
this will properly display my incorrectly cast unsigned short

7613660

7614795
width	height
but what will work is setting its width and height to 100

7614795
width	height
so starting from there we simply wrap the iframe in an element which we can reliably style to make less than the window 100 the size which elements default to when none of their parents have a static height width

7614795
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
after we make the iframe 100 high and wide we cannot put any margin padding or border on it because that will be added to the already 100 height width

7614795
width	height
in fact to make it be only the 100 height and width you have to make sure you removed the iframes default border

7614841

the reason why it doesn t compile is because properties accessor are syntactic sugar for method calls and you can t take the address of the return value of a method

7616458

7617894
int	double	int	chars
the same applies to chars and short values which are always promoted to int first. considering that in your case the float value was obtained by reinterpreting memory occupied by a pointer object and then promoted to double it is not surprising that the results you observe make no sense whatsoever

7617919

7618381
single-quotes	double-quotes
for consistency single-quotes are preferred to double-quotes

7618381
single-quotes	double-quotes

i think the best you could do is make a cron job that periodically checks a file x for cron jobs and runs them

jobs	cron
then all you would have to do is add jobs to x instead of to cron

7621577
children	parent
when you implement uinavigationcontroller this class is your the parent that controls all the children viewcontrollers that will be pushed into the stack

for this example i ve chosen the delimiter spaces apostrophe and semi-colon

7621838

7621935
post	get
while the standard requires that it asks the user if a post is redirected all popular browsers simply interpret the redirect as a get

7621935
post	get
in short you can t redirect a post that way you ll have to find another way without a round trip to the client or use get

7621935
post	get
also you should be aware that unless your requests are done via https both get and post will present the sensitive information to any listener as post simply buts the query string into the http request and not the url

7621959
post	get
i ve been playing around with positioning and z-indexes for a while and can t get it working so i thought i d post a jsfiddle to see if someone could help shed some light

7622067
maven	pom.xml

why not just have two seperate web services one for get and one post

7622109
post	get
so i think i ve found a solution use get vs post

7622120
pop-up	dialog
it displays all hidden sheets and very hidden sheets in a pop-up dialog that also gives you the ability to unhide a single sheet or all hidden all veryhidden or both

7622186
width	height
for example width height or left can be animated but background-color cannot be.

7622194
content-disposition	content-type
of course you can change content-type and content-disposition from the amazon s3 console but the interesting thing is to do it programmatically

7622216
trie	tree
i m not sure if you would benefit from using a suffix tree here as the base of the characters being entered into the trie is only 10 compared to the base-128 for ansi strings but it s possible

7622251
width	height	imageview	imageswitcher
i am trying to get the height and width of a drawable in order to set its scale to be fit the xy of an imageview in an imageswitcher via a matrix using a matrix to enable multitouch

7622279
pthreads	fcntl
the pthreads specification for fcntl states

7622279
pthreads	fcntl
the specification for fcntl does not say but perhaps there is a general provision in the pthreads specification that mandates a deterministic order on operations to clean up after a process that exits uncleanly or crashes

7622347
hide	show
you can use this code to show and hide the tab bar

7622384
google-chrome	firefox

7622445

i ve found valueinjecter the best out of the automapper emitmapper and a few others on codeplex

7622605
ant	pom.xml
above assumes that your ant script is inside the pom.xml and not externalized

7622613
openmpi	mpich
so install a popular mpi mpich openmpi on a linux box and get going

7622613
cpu	processors
if your programs are going to be cpu bound i d suggest only running job sizes that equal the number of processors cores on your machine

7622613
vmware	virtualbox
edit since you tagged it as a virtualization question i wanted to add that you could also run mpi on multiple vms on vmware or virtualbox for example and run your tests

7622684
folder	directory
i think they are meant to be used when you don t want the .git folder to be in the same directory as your working tree

7622718
min	max
one can use this to make some custom summary calculation another as the standard types sum min max count and avg

7622720
google-chrome	firefox
i tried on all browsers ie9 google-chrome 14.0.835.186 m and firefox 6.0.2 and i get the same exception

7622726
addclass	removeclass
...and the script would just do addclass selected when you select it and removeclass selected when you deselect it

7622741
int	chars
that s why getc returns an int and not an unsigned chars - because the chars read could have any value in the range of unsigned chars and the return value of getc also needs to be able to represent the non-character value eof which is necessarily negative

7622744
migrate	staging
when we re ready to migrate to production qa first tests the deployment process in their environment will be a staging environment once we get one and then operations deploys this to the production environment

i have the following uiview architecture x y width height

7622780
int	chars
normally i associate strings to keywords that describe them and then store them in a database table with a structure of id int id varchar 16 language chars 2 string varchar

7622781
getter	setter
in most cases there are plain getter and setter but other methods might be used as well

7622834
awt	swing
but to be really portable you d have to abandon console mode and use a windowing mode awt or swing

7622839
awt	swing
it s hard to do in pure java if not impossible unless swing awt has implemented it by now

7622839
xlib	xcb
way is to use jni and do it through xlib xcb

7622839
xlib	xcb
if you don t know what this is google how to read a property from a window in xlib xcb

7622856
ninject	spring.net
however it seems that ninject structuremap and spring.net i only did check these three require the custom factory attribute to be added to the file

7622861
post	put
there is one image which i put in each of my blog s post of my signature

7622870
getter	setter
it has become more popular the past few years for better or worse to use anemic data models where a class is nothing but a bunch of fields and corresponding getter and setter

7622870
getter	setter
i would argue that in this design you would be better off with public fields since the getter and setter provide no real encapsulation but just fool you into thinking you are doing real oo

7622906
width	height
you should be able to just grab those and combine them with the location that the user clicked within the parent container as well as the width and height of each cell to determine which cell was clicked on

7622929
wordpress	joomla
i m not sure that it would resolve the issue entirely but at least then you could separate out the issue of is the joomla .htaccess conflicting with the wordpress .htacceess and causing a slowdown

7622952
outputstream	inputstream
i have tried trimming the byte array down and sending it i ve manually written out -1 to the outputstream multiple times but the inputstream never reads -1

7622952
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
i also even tried using the out input stream directly from the socket instead of using the already created objectinputstream objectoutputstream and it still doesn t work

7622965
scheme	racket
racket got me up and running in scheme with little to no thought

7622993
stdout	stderr
so the local ssh stdout will be from the remote commands stdout and the local ssh stderr will be a mixture of the remote s stderr and any of the ssh command s own error messages and other output such as the debugging information you d see from adding the -v --verbose options to your ssh invocation

7622993
stdout	stderr
and any results you get from its stdout or stderr cannot be conflated with possible output from any intermediary processes such as the ssh binary .

7623016
put	get
ultimately i decided to put this answer out because clearly you are already editing the templates for control and perhaps if you apply it to your own work you won t get this anomoly

7623035
width	height
you will then also be able to store other properties such as width and height

7623055
min	max
besides the fact that i want use normal rather than uniform distribution my code always returns either the same number max or just 2 numbers out of the interval min max

7623080
put	get
pretty much i don t want to put these tasks in the users script because i m scared they would get run a lot more than is necessary and i d prefer to keep it separate

7623147
uisegmentedcontrol	uibutton
because normally when action handlers are called they pass the object that initiated the call to the method like a uibutton or uisegmentedcontrol

7623159
width	height
for example you seem to be creating the same texture with the same width and height given the same pixel data

7623188
ddms	hprof
hprof file analyzed using mat same data is generated by eclipse ddms

7623192
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
since you re already using objectinputstream and objectoutputstream you can use their respective readobject and writeobject methods to read write entire objects at a time

7623206
wav	ogg	mp3	ogg	mp3	wav
i can reformat for mp3 ogg wav whatever works

7623233
google-chrome	firefox
this is my solution tested in google-chrome firefox 6 and ie7+

7623254
client-side	server-side
i have client-side data local data always sorted and i don t want jqgrid to re-sort the data for grouping like server-side sorted data behaviour-- groupdatasorted true

7623259
hide	show
you can sometimes disambiguate with a in my example or in yours but as my example show you can always hide a variable so much that it s no longer addressable

7623275
post	get
i already got the get json getrequest working in afnetworking but this post request is giving me some problems

7623292
hide	show
using jquery i am trying to hide the submit button and show an ajax loading gif once it is clicked

7623309
rss	feed
rss feed have the root element rss see specification

7623309
rss	feed
hint if you check for rss instead of feed like for atom in your isrss method you don t have to use the ternary operator

7623344
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
for me graphicsmagick is performing far better than imagemagick

7623360
ostream	istream
the idea is to create a device class which implements the low-level interface read write seek and then instantiate an istream ostream derived class using your device class to do the actual i o

7623372
versioning	upgrade
if you are willing to upgrade to versioning 3.2 or better you can take advantage of the concurrent.futures.processpoolexecutor

7623387
post	get
post the specific error message you get

7623404
for-loop	arrays
it should be pretty intuitive that the for-loop will traverse the arrays and find the and stick an m in it s place

7623438
google-chrome	firefox
issue is it work great and efficiently in google-chrome and explorer but firefox gives error for this regex

7623462
children	parent
i have seen array based implementations of static binary trees which do not waste memory for pointers and instead do operations on the current index to go to its parent or children

7623475
ubuntu	debian
sounds like you don t have the python openssl libs installed or in your python path try installing python-openssl debian ubuntu package name or your server distro equivalent

7623482
nstimer	nsrunloop
i setup an nstimer which is doing this snapshotting rendering in a defined frequency and which is added to the the nsrunloop for tracking

7623485
google-chrome	firefox
this happening in both google-chrome v14 and firefox v4

7623492
onmousedown	onmousemove
when onmousedown fires on the resize target start tracking onmousemove

7623492
onmousemove	onmouseup
when onmouseup fires clear the onmousemove handler

7623505
maven	pom.xml
looking at the maven pom.xml for easymock 3.0 the dependencies are

7623562
mouseover	mouseout
first of all you would be better off with hover rather than a mouseover mouseout pair

7623570
httpresponse	request
if an error occurs during the fetch the httpresponse given to the callback has a non-none error attribute that contains the exception encountered during the request

7623578
lseek	fcntl
all of the functions chmod close fchmod fcntl fstat ftruncate lseek open read readlink stat symlink and write shall be atomic with respect to each other in the effects specified in ieee std 1003.1-2001 when they operate on regular files

7623584
division	modulo
in math division by 30 gives a remainder between 0 and 29 -- that s what modulo 30 is

7623584
subtract	add
so you need to take the day subtract 1 to get a day between 0 and 29 instead of 1 and 30 add 24 then do the modulo 30 then add 1 to get back a day between 1 and 30

7623588
free	malloc
and then remember that it needs to be free at some point by the caller unless the malloc fails and this function therefore returns null

7623636
processors	hyperthreading
i have a machine with 2 quad-core hyperthreading processors

7623658
put	get
i put an alert of haysaldo inside jquery and i get true but outside jquery i get false s

7623740
put	get
i am trying to put this together with codeblocks g++ and get the following error message at the linking stage

7623748
rss	feed
the key purpose of my app is to download an xml file from rss feed then parse it and pass it as html file to a webview with this method webview loadhtmlstring astring baseurl nil

7623765
for-loop	arrays
i would read the file into an arrays or arrays list and then use a for-loop to print it from the last index to the first

7623770
apache	nginx
how can i stop this and also remove the index.php remove the url because codeigniter tutorials only contain apache s rewriterule which isn t valid on nginx

7623776
subtract	add
say i need to add or subtract

7623790
subtract	add
if you add the month then resolve the invalid date then subtract the day you get 2011-02-27

7623817
rss	feed
then it should be fairly easy to construct a rss feed using that query

7623836
submit	submission
i have an mvc project i m working on and am creating a set of different submit buttons each which pass a different value to the controller on submission

7623847
width	height
you can also pass in a minimum height and minimum width

7623869
children	parent
when i setopaque false on the parent the children still have opacity

7623885
int	double	16-bit	64bit
hell some of them had 60-bit words so it would get weirder yet. further assume that on that machine sizeof double is 64bit while sizeof int is 16-bit

7623903
children	parent
another case - a parent element scales its children and then you add the canvas to that parent so the width is modified by the parent

7623922
hash	md5
do a md5 hash of the file contents put it in a database or something and check against it before downloading anything

7623945
boost	stl
as unclebens alluded to the functional header in the stl has some useful features if you aren t using c++11 or boost

7623946

7623987
put	get
one way to get around this is to manually put a call to _typeface_js.initialize just before your closing tag

7623995
clang	llvm	llvm	clang++
apple also installs the wonderfully named clang and clang++ front-ends for llvm

7624008
versioning	upgrade
but for upgrade testing you would have to leave them the same or use a temporary id and name for both the previous and upgrade app versioning

7624027
clang	llvm
beside the already mentioned llvm-gcc and clang there is also an apple-supplied gcc-4.2 without llvm backend at usr bin gcc-4.2 in xcode 4.1

stdout	stderr
since you are able to recognize output help text without any parameters i assume you are capturing the process s stderr and assume you are doing the same for stdout as well though javac does not seem to write anything to stdout

7633341
getter	setter
if the law of demeter sounds good to you and you re into object orientation and possibly with a java microsoft -stack background then the style would be to create getter setter methods

7633341
getter	setter
that being said backbone.js models already have getter and setter methods .get and .set

7633364
pop-up	dialog
it seems to work as expected for me in a console application at least in debug builds a dialog pop-up that allows you to break into the application using the debugger but in release builds nothing happens

this works perfectly with google-chrome firefox and in safari

7633540
hash	md5
if you are only interested in passwords you might as well use hash functions md5 sha and compare the input hash with the hash of the password

7633545
portrait	landscape
the reason is that the ad needs something close to the device width in portrait mode 480 for the ad so it is only available in landscape mode when you re adding it inside a dialog

7633556
jsf	seam
since you are using cdi you could either stop using that and switch to using jsf 2 managed beans which has a viewscoped annotation or you could continue to use cdi with seam faces 3 which apparently also supports viewscoped

client-side	server-side
it s better practice to separate client-side code javascript from server-side code php

7634215
getter	setter
the reason your data doesn t display is because the two properties in your listitems class are not declared properly they need to be fully declared properties using getter and setter like this

7634229
awt	swing
my guess is that the internalconsoleframe object created is being blocked by the native swing awt thread until the complete execution of the api call

7634325
google-chrome	firefox
if you display the javascript console in either google-chrome or firefox it should show the error

7634346
hide	show
i ve noticed the android market application when you click over search button it show the keyboard but when you click the back button the search edittext become invisible and the keyboard is hidden the problem that i cant hide the edittext after the keyboard is hidden after pressing the back key because i cant find a listener for hiding the keyboard event

i am not sure if you need to subtract or add half of the width but i think you can do a little r d on it

7634489
width	height
width and height are float-s

7634492
screens	hdpi
the samsung galaxy tab 10.1 1280 800 has a much bigger screens than that of the gt p1000 so i am assuming the gt p1000 should read from hdpi and 10.1 should read from xhdpi

7634546
screens	mdpi
mdpi refers to the screens density in dots per inch not the overall size

7634559
for-loop	loops
jsonarray objects have a function getjsonobject int index you can loops through all of the jsonobjects by writing a simple for-loop

finally i found the way to upgrade brisk s cassandra versioning

7634721

twist will run with firefox for me but it is not as reliable as google-chrome and really impinges on development

7634813
jobs	cron
i have several cron jobs that run automatically and i was requested to add a button that says run now in the browser.

7634813
jobs	cron
some of these cron jobs need to be executed from command line as they take around 15 minutes.

7634918
min	max
jcomponent is a bare-bone container it has no ui delegate and no inherent size - it s up to your code to return something reasonable for min max pref

7634921

to get it work and still having the iis to require ssl you need to make some changes in your endpoint in the config file set the address property to the service s address with https and the listenuri property to the service s address with http

7634926
gridview	repeater
i have a repeater and inside it a gridview

7634971
mdpi	hdpi
for 10.1 tab you should use drawable-xlarge-mdpi folder and gt p1000 should also use mdpi but as i have seen on many online posts that gt p1000 has problem it has mdpi density but it uses drawables from hdpi i have not checked myself so for gt p1000 you can try to use drawable-large-hdpi folder if drawable-large-mdpi does not wok

7634996
getter	setter
however you can implement a getter setter function abstract this might be what you re looking for

7634997
postgresql	mysql
don t know what the function in mysql is but if concat_ws works like textcat_all does in postgresql then the following should work

x86	64bit
x64 means a cpu that is x86 compatible but has a 64bit mode as well most often the 64bit instruction set as introduced by amd is meant

7635108
x86	64bit
so most of the time you can simplify it this way x86 is intel compatible in 32-bit mode x64 is intel compatible in 64bit mode

7635136
x86	64bit
in the transition period from 32 bit to 64bit many apps were built as universal with 3 or sometimes even 4 architectures combined into one fat binary aka universal binary typically ppc x86 and x86-64

7635136
x86	64bit
however in some cases you might want to use the 32 bit x86 executable even in a 64bit x86-64 environment in the case you mentioned where you have older plug-ins which are 32-bit only and can not be used with a 64bit executable

7635165
getter	setter
if you want to share a number or boolean between several classes you should create your own wrapper class with setter and getter for the bool value or subclass nsnumber

7635227
width	margin
assign a width and use margin auto

7635252
integer	unsigned
if the bitset is small enough that all the bits can fit in unsigned long then you can use its conversion functions to perform integer arithmetic on it for example

7635276
mousemove	mouseenter
now everything is working fine with my plugin but when you mouseenter from the top it screws up from time to time move your mouse in and out fast and it will happen for sure i think this is because i am getting different values from my mouseenter event and my mousemove event which are both used to calculate how to scroll the inner elements

7635289
tiff	png
but as png and not tiff

7635298
stdout	stderr
and the stderr integer from the c program should get stored in a separate variable and the stdout from the c program should get stored in another separate variable in perl

a queue may also be configured to deliver in fifo + priority order but that s not an option you consider

7635383
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

note the demo works only in safari and google-chrome not in firefox and ie

7635543
width	height
it will set the width height related to view

7635545
short	base
in short asp.net doesn t know about ie9 browser id thus returning default compatibility flags including ecmascriptversion see system.web.httpcontext.current.request.browser which turns off script generation in base class

7635548
interpolation	splines
here it is spherical averages and applications to spherical splines and interpolation

7635550
hide	show
if you re still not convinced that this is the right thing for you you should probably hide your elements and show them only after you ve repositioned them

7635653
draggable	droppable
i have two columns that have draggable and droppable divs within them

7635694
pull	push
however the op is asking for some sort push notification mechanism as opposed to pull and i think for that kind of thing websockets are the way to do it

7635765
goto	break
a lambda expression cannot contain a goto statement break statement or continue statement whose target is outside the body or in the body of a contained anonymous function

7635784
pull	push
we are using gitolite to facilitate those who work on there own machine so the can push and pull with there private key

7635817
public	protected
i would write this with the access types of public protected and private which are important in oop

7635836
width	height
i think you can customize all your css rules using the so in case of the parent element s width is reduced by 400px for ex you can set childs width height margine etc by values like this

7635917
spaces	delimiter
the remainder of the text file contains an unknown number n of tokens that are whitespace-delimited delimiter are a mixture of spaces tab and newline characters all to be treated identically as delimiter

7636015
getter	setter
i declared as a private and i d like to create getter and setter for this

7636052

the copy clases are created by me inherited from the originals override all of the properties to readonly and copy the values from the original in the constructor

7636367
hide	show
if you want to show and hide a window try this

7636385
integer	unsigned
java does not have unsigned integer types so they have to go with int

7636497
udp	tcp
in normal udp or tcp routing you can do this completely in userspace by modifying the routing tables

7636520
min	max
when i enter a value that is below or above the min max value i get an error message onblur as expected

7636520
min	max
however when i re-enter a new value within the min max the error remains

7636556
mongodb	bson
however the node-mongodb-native driver gives you clean duplication of almost the entire mongodb api and since bson is translated to json and javascript is a flexible dynamic language there s really no need for an orm

7636556
mongoskin	node-mongodb-native
mongoskin is built atop node-mongodb-native but gives you the ability to have additional javascript method bindings and deal with connections and cursors easier

7636564
width	height
i have given a fixed height and width to grid for now

7636564
width	height
i dont want to give any height width to panel grid

7636566
serializable	deserialization
the serializable runtime associates with each serializable class a version number called a serialversionuid which is used during deserialization to verify that the sender and receiver of a serializable object have loaded classes for that object that are compatible with respect to serializable

7636566
serializable	deserialization
however it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialversionuid values since the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations and can thus result in unexpected invalidclassexceptions during deserialization

7636568
midi	osc
it can handle loads of different audio file formats + midi and hopefully osc soon...

i write a simple code in c++ and i compile it with g++ on linux ubuntu 11.04 and i don t get any errors but when i run the executable file i get this error segmentation fault

7636647
serializable	deserialization
in these cases you should strongly adhere to the serializable contracts - and this not done by just setting serialversionuid - usually you must also overwrite the methods for serializable and deserialization to cope with different versions

7636656
client-side	server-side
you re mixing javascript a client-side language with php a server-side language

7636673

folder	directory
when i add folder as a folder references directory tree is preserved but none of the .xib files are compiled to .nib

7636773
free	malloc
it is generally considered best practice to call malloc and free in the same function

7636773
free	malloc
in your example this would mean that you call malloc pass the generated buffer to foo as parameter print the result and call free

7636781
mp3	wav
wav is supported but not mp3

7636827
hash	salt
you could just concatenate the serial number of the device the feature name code and some secret salt and hash the result with sha1 or another secure hashing algorithm

7636827
hash	hmac
you should also use an hmac instead of naively prepending or appending the key to the hash

versioning	upgrade
microsoft have retained most of their old non-standard functionality even in newer versioning of their browser in an effort to retain backward compatibility for old code many corporate intranets were written by microsoft-trained experts and use these features so they need to keep them otherwise no-one will ever upgrade past ie6

i have an app where i would like to support device rotation in certain views but other don t particularly make sense in landscape mode so as i swapping the views out i would like to force the rotation to be set to portrait

7637322
portrait	landscape
all of the screens in my app are portrait only with the exception of one screen which can be rotated between landscape and portrait by the user

7637322
portrait	landscape
the solution i implemented was to hide the navigation bar while in landscape mode meaning that the user can only return to previous screens whilst in portrait

currently we have an automated process that builds everything and packages it up into msi s for us using teamcity and nant

7637463
boost	allocator
any slowness baring the initial allocator can be attributed to a highly tuned free-store allocator new vs the mechanism that boost uses to manage allocator in the shared memory segment boost might use portable and more expensive synchronization mechanism to serialize allocator

7637481
hash	salt
so a salt hash alone generally doesn t buy you much time before they ve cracked a large percentage of you re user s passwords

7637481
hash	salt
this adds a large volume of complexity to the hash so that each test of each password takes thousands of times longer than a simple salt hash

7637481
hash	salt
see a working example by reading another example of how to store a salt password hash

7637488
folderbrowserdialog	openfiledialog
the folderbrowserdialog component in .net framework and the openfiledialog implements the idisposible interface meaning we should call its dispose method at some appropriate time after we ve done with it or something bad happens unmanaged resource leaks

7647130
jar	war
to take a specific example the war project war-a has a dependency on an internal jar project jar-a with a scope of compile

7647130
jar	war
should i allow the list of required 3rd party jars to be bundled within the war be resolved via the compile scope dependencies of the various internal maven jar projects we have

then you declare them to be inline-blocks with a width and height matching that of your image and give them a background-image of your choosing

7647964
free	malloc
another potential problem is that when passing a pointer to an array allocated with operator new to operator delete it is possible that when free is called by operator delete as is common in many implementations although not required by the c++ standard the pointer passed to free is not one that was returned by a call to malloc

7647981

7648127
dbcontext	objectcontext
these comments apply directly to the dbcontext because it wraps wraps objectcontext to expose simplified and more intuitive apis. see documentation

7648131

7648267
google-chrome	firefox
firefox has an issue with html escaping that they have no intention of fixing and google-chrome has a pretty major problem with includes

7648269
onresume	onpause
a better solution would be to save whatever state your application is in on onpause then restore the state in onresume if when the user comes back

7648278
width	height
if you have then you can use a scaling factor to enlarge or shrink the width height of the imageview - it also means that you can pull back the exact height width of the image because it has the same dimensions as it s container

7648281
public	protected
if no options are used javap prints out the package protected and public fields and methods of the classes passed to it

7648469
i2c	spi
as those articles i read said the device driver modules are likely to be automatically loaded on demand by kernel i am therefore wondering about the recipe how kernel figures out which module to load for a specific device sound card i2c spi device etc i also cannot thoroughly imagine how the kernel detects each hardware device while boot-time

7648832
getter	setter
with getter setter way long

7648832
getter	setter
calling with getter setter not a bit clear however c# makes it cleaner

7648832
getter	setter
in some cases it is mandatory to use setter and getter but if not then i think that it is a bit overkill to use it as default

7648851
getter	setter
if your property is atomic then obviously you must use both the getter and setter

7648868
post	get
once i get this working i ll post about any latency issues

create a baseview that all views will inherited from and give it a properties to store the customers current customer

7649483

let the servlet send a certain broadcast to the respected clients in the room each time a certain player do something so that the other clients don t have to do a get or post every x ms

7650197
post	get
i m not sure why you want to have the url changed but if you want to make it bookmarkable then you shouldn t use which defaults to post but just a plain html which defaults to get with plain html inputs and button and define the parameters as in the target page so that jsf will set them in the bean associated with the target page

put	get
if you re writing as well to update the file you d again get the cached data put it back onto disk as a file update the file then re-serialise it to update the cache and in a distributed environment like this i d be concerned about how much time that would take and whether other servers would be making concurrent updates to the same data

7651915
int	boolean
basically the data that all those events carry are very simple strings int and boolean

7651933
instances	transient
this problem is arising because you are treating the dbcontext like a singleton by declaring it as a static field but then you are treating it like it like a transient instances by disposing it as soon as any instances of codefirstrepository gets disposed

7652129
implements	extends
implements the container class and extends enterprise_pagecache_model_container_abstract

7652176
width	height
so the last values will be assigned the top left width and height of the new div you just inserted instead of the one before that

7652236
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
this tiny overhead on add is vastly outweighed by the savings on lookups since all programmers should know and understand that case-insensitive compares are vastly slower than case-sensitive especially with unicode - the cpu can t just do a block compare of data but must check each pair of characters specially even using a table look-up this is vastly slower

the problem i m having is that after the frist prepare statement is execute subsequent statements hang on the execute method

7652473

a fixed height header that spans the width of the screen

7652842
width	height
a fixed width nav under the header on the left that spans the remaining height of the screen

7652842
width	height
i understand how to implement the horizontal aspect of the liquid layout so that the nav remains fixed while the content area takes up remaining width but i don t understand how to implement the vertical aspect of liquid layout so that both the nav and content area take up at least the remainder of the height and at most the height of their content assuming that this is taller than the screen less the header height

7652858
width	height
with this you can completely remove the height and width attributes of the iframe

7652877
public	protected
the flag itself may be private but there should be a protected and or public disposed property to avoid requiring every derived class to implement its own disposal flag

7652919

7653756
primes	palindrome
it s just a simple palindrome primes program but it s really giving me a hard time

hash	md5
i m looking for a function for c c++ that behaves identically to php s md5 function -- pass in a string return a one-way hash of that string

7656219
hash	md5
the reason i m searching for said function is for the same purpose i would use php s md5 function to store a one-way hash of a user s password in a database rather than the actual text of the user s password in case the database s data is ever compromised the user s passwords would still be relatively secret

7656229
hash	salt

i can t find where you get the post titles in your code but to truncate a string to 35 chars you simply need something like

your next step might be to set breakpoints in both fileinputstream and fileoutputstream unless you know whether the file is being read or written to attach a debugger and watch for your file to be opened by one of those

attach it with the ancient onload or addeventlistener attachevent depending on your browser support requirements

unlike su sudo authenticates users against their own passwd rather than that of the target user to allow the delegation of specific commands to specific users on specific hosts without sharing passwd among them and while mitigating the risk of any unattended terminals

7656621
implements	extends
a class can implements multiple interfaces but it can extends only one class

7656643
for-loop	arrays
you can however use a for-loop to save an int with an increasing name and have it call it back the same way when you need it and store it into another arrays

7656650
free	alloca
it looks like newarray allocates the array on the heap using mallocarray which will need to be free d explicitly but witharray allocates the array on the stack using allocaarray assuming alloca behaves the way it does in c which will be reclaimed when the calling function returns

7656653

it looks much worst in google-chrome but i would like to get it working in firefox first

7656715
stateless	stateful
i understand your confusion between stateless service and a stateful host and how the two can interact

7656717
equals	gethashcode
imo since equals is always the final arbiter on the equality of objects gethashcode is only ever a shortcut for non-equal values

7656717
equals	gethashcode
in the case of identical values returned from gethashcode regardless of whether the objects are actually equals equals will then always be called to compare

7656743
switching	screens
also i have to prompt the user for password while switching from execution to configutation mode just once durnig the session i have made the password screens and implemented in configuration

7656799
memcpy	malloc
i fixed this by simply using malloc and then memcpy instead

7656802
children	parent
as long as everything is in the same domain you could work out a method for communication between the children frames via the parent

7656823
int	chars
if you specify the type as int you can t use that function to check if a string contains a certain chars for example

7656844
free	realloc
there s a good chance that by calling realloc within a method inside the program you re actually loading it into a local variable which is then thrown away and your program continues to use the older pointer which has now been free

7656859
shim	polyfills
if you want to use it now and make sure older versions of firefox support it although they will disappear in few months you can put this insertadjacenthtml polyfills shim in your site and the method will work everywhere

7656874
int	double

7657025
put	get
the trick to get a where condition to work with a left outer join is to put the criteria in the join clause

7657034
submit	submission
looking at the scaffolded grails architecture and extending that to building forms for an end-user web app the pattern seems to be to devote two actions to a page that collects form data the first to display the page including any errors from previous submit and the second to act on the data on submission producing errors and a returning to the first action as need be or b going on to a successor action controller if no errors

7657063

in the mean time if you still wish to use jquery to do this you can either set the height or the width of the element you re trying to slideup or slidedown

what makes me say that is that although it s true that many decimal values cannot be stored exactly in float or double that doesn t hold for int of this kind of magnitude

if you want you can prepare your gray button checkbox from this image katzer pictures spice_checkbox.png

7661593
inherited	properties
if however you do wish to perform vector comparisons perhaps your data is constrained in a manner that makes this more viable the simplest may be to first normalise both svgs convert all shapes to paths eliminate all metadata apply inherited of all properties and normalise their values normalise path data to always use the same form etc. and use this for two purposes first to look at the diffs in the normalised tree structure

7661623

7661882
int	chars
store the largest and smallest in int types not chars types

7661911

7662585
range	max
you need serialiable to lock the range above max

screens	mdpi
for example tab like galaxy 10.1 pr motorola xoom has xlarge screens but mdpi density so for them you make a separate folder drawable-xlarge

7663231

devices with small screens like galaxy pop are mostly have ldpi density normal screens like galaxy ace are mostly mdpi devices and devices with large screens like galaxy s2 are mostly hdpi devices and some devices like tab p1000 have large screens but mdpi density and for them you have to make folder drawable-large-mdpi

opera	firefox
you ll notice that in firefox 7 and opera the gray box has the word next in it

7664573

okay found the answer turns out the java native to the function was using int instead of double

7664974
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
my guess is that monotouch probably can t garbage collect uiviews or uiviewcontroller because they re still being linked from somewhere in uikit like a uinavigationcontroller

7664983
jquery	tooltipster
now i prefer a jquery plugin called tooltipster

7665037
post	get

7665217
udp	rtp
i can able to get raw udp packets with rtp protocol

7665225

it checks if i ve a folder id within my pics directory and if not the script creates a new one

margin	font-size	margin	height
the combination of font-size 12px and line-height 1 should make the height of the paragraph and anchor without padding margin and border 12 pixels

rather than post all the code i m wondering if i could get some ideas first since the script is pretty involved and i don t want to waste anyones time

subclass	abstract-class
however abstract methods cannot have a body therefore if you mark a method as abstract then it has to be implemented by a subclass you can t implement them in the abstract-class

7665500
subclass	abstract-class
however you can have an abstract-class without abstract methods then subclass only needs to extend it

7665534
memcpy	realloc
it tells you that in do_opt in the file esp.c at line 111 you have called realloc to allocate 146 bytes of memory and now the function memcpy is trying to do a 4-byte write starting at 144 bytes from the start of that memory block which will cause a write outside of the allocated region 144 + 4 146

7665580
mouse	keyboard
the program i m working on detects user inactivity in the ui mouse + keyboard and time-outs if the user has no activity over a configurable time span

7665582
getter	setter
you really don t need test for trivial getter setter but writing just one test for a method may result in confusion if the test fails

7665587
int	chars
in this case since the int template argument to return_type is 2 you ll get the chars type as the output

7665638

alarmmanager	wakelock
but now reading along the web i find that who uses alarmmanager still need a wakelock

7665713
alarmmanager	wakelock
the alarmmanager holds a cpu wakelock as long as the alarm

7665713
alarmmanager	wakelock
once onreceive returns the alarmmanager releases this wakelock

7665816
post	get
also this guarantees you will get the numbers in whatever format you re expecting because you can just append the resulting post variables together

7665839
many-to-one	one-to-many
downside is - the mapping is always one-to-one and the collection brings confusion and the relation is more of one-to-one many-to-one not one-to-many

my answer got too long to put here so i turned it into a blog post

7666354
client-side	server-side
ok i think we have made you a bit confused here with this whole client-side server-side fiasco

7666354
client-side	server-side
if you make sure the form is not vulnerable to email injections you have client-side validation captcha and server-side validation of some form it does not have to be super complex it will stop spam. keep in my that today s great solution is not so great tomorrow

7666354
client-side	server-side
if a spammer goes around the client-side security the server-side security will still be there

dsl	dynamic-languages
imo your best bet is to implement stuff like this using a dsl or just use a more dynamic-languages like jruby or groovy for these pieces even if the rest of the system is in java

7666421
post	get
for example if you decorate your function with only get requests will get routed through it anything else like post will look for another function or throw an error if nothing else is present

put	get
there is a data param in the ajax function that will automatically create your get string i put it in the example if that is what you want

7666901

min	max
higher dimensional arrays would require running min and max as many times as there are dimensions which you can get using ndims

7667387

instead preferredsize is usually honored but setting this should be avoided as instead you ll want the components themselves to set their preferredsize based on their contents or other properties such as rows and columns for a jtextarea or columns for a jtextfield or string text for a jlabel

udp	rtp	rtp	rtsp
as i can see you already know how to do that start rtsp session setup a rtp avp udp

7668578
udp	tcp
no matter the transport udp or tcp the data format is mainly the same

7668578
udp	rtp
so to get data from udp you only have to strip off first 12 bytes which represent rtp header

7668578
udp	rtp
then read one short 2 byte that represents the length of the rtp data that follows so read that much bytes and now do the same as for udp

7668578
udp	mtu	udp	tcp
h264 and mpeg4 data are usually packetized in sdp there is packetization-mode parameter that can have values 0 1 and 2 what each of them means and how to depacketize it you can see here because there is a certain network limit that one endpoint can send through tcp or udp that is called mtu

7668578
udp	tcp
this can be done by encoder streamer on tcp and udp transport or you can relay on ip to fragment and reassemble video frame on the other side.

7668578
udp	tcp
the first is much better if you want to have a smooth error prone video over udp and tcp

7668578
udp	tcp	udp	rtp
h264 to check does the rtp data which arrived over udp or interleaved over tcp hold fragment of one larger h264 video frame you must know how the fragment looks when it is packetized

addition	multiplication	subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication
assuming you have an ieee754 architecture and if you are only performing addition subtraction and multiplication and if the result fits then it should be correct

7668661
put	get
now you could simply put the num rules before the expr rules and allow the default reduce reduce conflict resolution to deal with it the first rule appearing in the file will be used if both are possible but that s kind of ugly in that you get these conflict warnings every time you run bison and ignoring them when you don t know exactly what is going on is a bad idea

7668685

post	get
write this script as you would if a form were being submitted from another page ie it ll have post and get variables validations etc

7670079
post	get
next you ll use jquery to grab the data get post params from the page and make a request to the php script you created

7670079
post	get
so basically write a php script as you normally would that returns something other than html signifying success fail or a response message unless you need to inject html right into the page and then use jquery.post or jquery more generic jquery.ajax method to have your browser request that script with the get post vars you define and parse the response

i am using php undercontrol and the code browser report some crap index error on every setter getter code like this

7670198
getter	setter
the getter setter are covered by the unit testing the complexity is none since there is no if for switch foreach

7670198
getter	setter
ps self answering myself might be because the complexity is none but my main issue is that every getter setter generate a warning because of the crap index so is there anyway to tell phpunit php code coverage to make the crap equals to 0 for function with a 0 complexity index

7670209
stdout	stderr
my advice would be to create a simple java wrapper around the ganymed-ssh library that takes the java s stdin and outputs it to the shell s stdin and also pipes the shell s stdout and stderr to java s equivalents

7670510
int	chars
then i changed int ch to chars ch it also worked for me

7670510
int	chars
i changed chars ch to int ch then it s working fine

7670552
int	chars
since fgetc can return the int corresponding to any chars plus a distinct value eof you cannot store its result in a chars and then test for eof reliably

7670591
cpu	affinity
if i understand your question correctly all you need to do is set the affinity of the process or thread to be the set of cores that reside on a cpu

i want my data model and my getter and setter set like a simple java class let eclipse create all the getter and setter and if i call them i want the data to be stored persistently

7671066
getter	setter
i dont understand why this oo language has this very comfortable way of objects and getter and setter to easily define a data model but when it comes to persistence i need dozens of helper classes

7671083

i want to know it means structs only or any type derived from value type like int double enum ant so on

7671345
int	double
as for int double float and other built-in types they re all value-types

7671345
int	double
for example int is basically system.int32 and double is system.double and so on

7671382
int	double
i want to know it means structs only or any type derived from value type like int double enum ant so on

7671382
int	double
your so-called simple types like int double and enum are nothing more than c# keywords that correspond to the system.int32 and system.double structs and system.enum class which is based on system.valuetype which makes enums also value types despite enum being a class itself

for example you can easily add a getter or setter to your dynabean that is explicit and the code would read very idiomatically and cleanly interact with other bean apis

7677153
many-to-many	one-to-many
you can choose to have one-to-one one-to-many many-to-many connections and is insanely fast

7677158
integer	unsigned
for the last line as if a signed integer -4 had been read and converted to unsigned int

7677162
subtract	add
i understand for example that add age subtract would be the same as age + subtract but after that i just become lost

7677177
nsstring	nsdata
1 base-64 encode all the nsdata you receive from the transactionreceipt property of your skpaymenttransaction object into a nsstring object

7677201
n-gram	words
i need advice for n-gram of higher order improving the kinds of results that come from bcf and tcf and advice on the best way to identify the most unique individual key words

7677215
accessor	properties
the assignment won t affect car1 nor will any properties accessor or methods you do on car after that

7677218
izpack	uninstaller
i am trying to create a custom uninstaller with izpack

7677246
hash	salt
definitely use a salt when computing the hash but do not store the salt in the same location as the hash

7677256
integer	unsigned
i is an unsigned integer

7677274
maven	m2e
only in the latest versions of these m2e and m2e-wtp plugins weboverlays are supported the old maven builder we see in the is not capable of doing that

7677274
jar	war
by default maven war plugin not eclipse plugin will copy the resource files from dependency war also jar in to the context path when we maven build the project

7677328
division	modulo
you should be able to use division as you ve stated and modulo division to accomplish what you want

7677329
getter	setter
the getter and setter for this transient property set the appropriate id field which in turn updates the database

7677346
packets	pcap	tunnel	packets
i took a pcap trace when accessing a website using opera mini on my mobile and as opera mini uses a socks proxy to tunnel http traffic the wireshark trace shows most of the packets as socks packets

7677375
cvs	svn
unlike cvs or svn there is only one project as far as mercurial is concerned and actions commit update merge status work on the entire project tree at once

7677401
division	modulo
there are lot of different arms and there are arms which do not have a division instruction as ray toal already mentioned modulo is usually implemented as additional result of the division implementation

7677437
range	max
first loop s range would be max - 1 to 0 both inclusive

7677437
range	max
second second loop s range would be max to 1

7677441
stdout	stderr
after reading python-daemon source i ve added stdout and stderr to the daemoncontext and finally was able to know what was going on

7677460
width	height
what i want is to automatically resize the iframe on load and on resize event so that it fits the available width and height of the panel

7677475
spaces	delimiter
if you want to parse all words you can use the spaces as your delimiter then you get a row for each word

7677480
equals	gethashcode
distinct uses the default equality comparer which means you ll have to override equals and gethashcode on streetinfo for it to work

7677494
realloc	malloc
you can use malloc and realloc though if you need this facility but i would advice against that and suggest including and using std vector instead

7677496
equals	gethashcode
you could override gethashcode and equals in streetinfo - but that wouldn t be terribly nice in its existing form given that it s mutable

7677518
hide	show
currently to get each sub-menu to show and hide i use this jquery

7677539
stdio	fflush
exit will fflush the stdio output buffers but those same buffers are being managed by the parent whereas _exit will just end the process

7677602
width	height
you can get the element s client width and height by element.clientwidth and clientheight

7677602
width	height
you can set the element s width and height by assigning element.width and element.height

7677661
int	chars
but the kicker bug is that you are unloading from the stack into an int when you are closing the that should be changed to a chars which outputs a + instead of 43

7677694
vfork	posix
the current posix standard does not support vfork at all

7677694
vfork	posix
in the old 1997-ish posix standard the page for vfork said

7677741
draggable	droppable
i have two droppable containers that have draggable divs in them

7677741
draggable	droppable
the relevant code in that jsfiddle is that function where the container divs are made draggable and droppable and where the contained div elements are made draggable with containment of document

7677763
comparator	icomparer
if the parameters were passed by reference instead of by value performance with value types would be enhanced at the expense of impaired reference-type performance and of course compatibility with the existing comparator t and icomparer t

7677768
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
for some reason this does not render the press release text from the json string in ie but it works fine in safari google-chrome firefox opera.

7677787
accelerometer	gyroscope
i have build an imu consisting of an accelerometer and gyroscope that can provide 6dof motion output results to pc

7677886
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome work fine with just the first line as i expected

7677887
equals	gethashcode
now overriding equals no problemo but i have some issues with gethashcode

7677919
integer	unsigned
and in unsigned __int64 0xf0000000 0xf0000000 starts off as an unsigned integer type because it cannot fit in an integer type

7677923
filesystems	fat
first off make sure you are mounting with filesystems type vfat -- and make sure your kernel is compiled to offer vfat support it s a sub-option of fat

7677930
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i tested this on several browsers the latest firefox ie safari opera old ies - even ie6 worked and on a basic test inserting a text input with type name and maxlength attributes they all passed

7677944
width	height
you can play around with width and height percentages width and height values in options variable and even push the legend to bottom as one single line

7677949
free	realloc
you should never use realloc or any other c memory allocation functions in combination with memory allocated or free by operator new and delete or and as pointed out above

7677956
width	height
i have 4 inline-block elements with fixed width but variable content and i want all of these elements to have the same height - that of the largest element

7677985
opera	firefox
in opera firefox etc

7677992
equals	gethashcode
as others have mentioned using anonymous types is a good solution because the compiler creates the equals and gethashcode methods for you

7678003
profiler	yourkit
here are the results from yourkit profiler

7678019
free	malloc
you could write your own allocation and deallocation routines and use them instead of malloc free for the strings

7678019
free	malloc
if your routines malloc one or more big buffers and portion out little bits of it then you can free the whole lot in one go just by calling free on each big buffer

7678022
hide	show
but in the meantime the calling function has already done the hide show action

7678022
hide	show
for the dialog position not to be affected by the hide show actions those actions must happen after the dialog box closes

7678022
hide	show
the only way i could ensure that this happens was by putting the hide show calls inside the dialog button functions like this

7678040
for-loop	arrays
the variable lsresults- file is actually an arrays reference not an arrays so you have to de-reference it to iterate over it with the for-loop

7678043
int	chars
i am writing a java program that uses a treemap and the performance slows down to a crawl once there are 10 s of thousands of int chars mappings

7678043
int	chars
i was wondering if there is an implementation of some type of sorted set implementation out there that can use the int and chars primitives and has something like the headmap and tailmap functions

7678046
pull	push
once your cloned repo has these you can push or pull changes like so

7678060
tablet	galaxy
this all works fine but when testing on a galaxy tab running android 3.1 i get this exception if i launch the app when the tablet is in portrait orientation

7678060
oncreate	setcontentview
it is happening on this call to setcontentview in the oncreate method of my initial activity

7678099
integer	unsigned	implements	extends
here is how gcc does it it sign extends if the integer type is larger than the pointer type this ll happen regardless of the integer being signed or unsigned just because that s how gcc decided to implements it

7678112
hide	show
and then you can use css to show hide the child elements

7678146
superclass	subclassing
solved actually the error happened because it wasn t using the methods of the subclassing cause they were implemented up in the superclass that s why it worked if called from a listaiterador class but don t if called from the upper class

7678146
implements	extends
hi i created a listiterator class of a generic type it extends iterator so i did implements the iterator s methods in the listiterator class

7678180
put	get
from what i understand is that i cannot put special symbols like but with this way i will get the hacked way prices by advanced search from home page in multiple select dropdowns

7678208
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this script is working perfectly with google-chrome and safari but firefox is bugging up for some reason

7678208
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works great in google-chrome and safari but in firefox it bugs and the keyboard nav instead only works if you re typing in an input or textarea

7678222
versioning	upgrade
even if you were using the new entity framework you still can t get visual studio etc to track changes in a database schema automatically for you you d have to track the changes between versioning manually and apply them usually when the upgrade app runs for the first time

7678303
ubuntu	linux
i m on linux using gcc my gdb version is gnu gdb ubuntu linaro 7.3-0ubuntu2 7.3-2011.08

7678337
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
the most weird thing is that this doesn t happen in google-chrome firefox or opera

7678377
put	get
if you are getting your assemblies from the command line and creating an assemblycatalog for plugin1 then you will also need to tell it about plugin2 and get that into an aggregatecatalog or put them all in a directory and use a directorycatalog you could pass the directory name on the command line

7678511
imagemagick	magick++
now i m trying to do the same thing with imagemagick to be more correct with magick++

7678521
put	get
the best solution would be something like a black box so i can just feed the list of afr points and get out 12288 coefficients but i would be grateful also for multiple libraries pieces of code if only it can be put together easily

7678529
quicksort	mergesort
don t get me wrong but mapreduce actually use sorting algorithms like quicksort and mergesort to sort the input for the reduce step

7678545
int	chars
in c chars literals are of int type so

7678563
chromium	webkit.net
chrome uses webkit chromium engine while webkit.net uses cairo and openwebkitsharp nightly

7678570
qsqlquery	qsqldatabase
qsqldatabase and qsqlquery are lightweight wrappers around concrete implementations so your first example is fine

7678570
postgresql	mysql
removedatabase is equivalent to closing the file for sqlite or the connection for odbc mysql postgresql so that s typically something you would do at program termination

7678582
google-chrome	firefox
i m using jquery and flot in google-chrome and firefox

7678586
int	chars
3 chars literal type int

7678610
google-chrome	firefox
i m working on a site for a client and they ve asked for a fix for the font rendering in firefox and google-chrome not looking as good as it does in ie

7678612
hide	show
you can actually bind the column as normal but you can show hide them at runtime using jquery

7678648
stdout	stderr
redirect stdin stdout and stderr of the started process to files or pipes if you impose strict limits on runtime and number of concurrent processes

7678665
put	get
and to use the entities correctly and seamlessly with the caching i need to detach the entity from the current context before i put it in a cache and attach it back the the new context when i get it from the cache

7678668
pop-up	dialog
that is when the user clicks the button instead of the page loading onto the screen i would like for the print dialog to pop-up and allow the user to print the report directly to the printer since they are able to view the report using the separate button if they should so desire

7678672
google-chrome	firefox
my css styles are not working for some of my ids that is the styles aren t being applied or even seen by google-chrome or firefox

7678731
istream	getline
i could use istream get or istream getline but then i have to avoid the new line characters

7678782
post	get
you can force this by passing a get post variable though it s a bit hacky

7678782
post	get
form post or even a get querystring

7678788
rubygems	bundler
c dev ruby ruby192 lib rubygems 1.9.1 bundler gems delayed_job-8efc2aa99e8b lib delayed backend base.rb 28 in

7678791
implements	extends
understand implements support and extends primarily a .net shop

7678793
width	height
doing it from onmeasure is a good way to do it even though your code doesn t work since you re not using the measure spec you ve created. you could also override onfinishinflate and call getlayoutparams and change the width and height fields

7678795
hash	md5
i came cross the similar issue that we were using java md5 hash to determine whether a file has been processed

7678846
post	get
rails also allows you to define nested resources within your routes that will give you for example post 1 comments 1 edit and in your action you basically get params post_id and params id

7678864
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
while ie does use cleartype fonts by default this can be turned off in tools internet options advanced tab multimedia settings option always use cleartype for html checkbox turning it off doesn t seem to change the fact that ie will render text slightly differently than firefox google-chrome opera etc

7678890
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
for large amounts of memory you should be using the head with malloc and or calloc and free

7678898
free	malloc
large objects whose size isn t known at compile time should be allocated via malloc which means you need to keep track of the allocation and release them with free

7678974
quicksort	mergesort
so you d express a traditional sorting algorithm like mergesort or quicksort as a map reduce if you wanted to do it as a parallel computation

7678974
quicksort	mergesort
it s not a question of is map reduce better than mergesort or quicksort because map reduce is just a tool for implementing a sorting algorithm like mergesort or quicksort in a parallel way

7679068
pull	push
second you can use tofront and toback to pull objects to the front or push them to the background

7679221
children	parent
you will get the children with classname color of the parent tag with class link

7679234
mouse	keyboard
but i don t want to connect a screen keyboard and mouse to work directly on the desktop

7679249
mouse	keyboard
but when i click a virtual keyboard button the mouse events seem to interfere with ime and basically just cancel the composition

7679270
google-chrome	firefox
our issue lies in that we are getting a double post back in firefox and google-chrome for some reason

7679270
hide	show
does anyone have a straight client site solution or a solution where we don t have to use an update panel to get the status or our calls to the server and show and hide an update panel

7679286
sorting	grouping
we had severe performance problems with tadvstringgrid from tms which is based on delphi tstringgrid when loading sorting grouping large grid sets but also when inserting one row at the top of the grid expanding a grid grouping node

7679301
disk	ram
when the user minimizes your application windows will eventually swap its address space to disk freeing up ram for other programs

7679352
svg	vml
obviously both are missing from ie8 and earlier but ie does support a competing format called vml which is an xml-based vector language similar to svg

7679352
svg	vml
there are javascript libraries available for ie which will render both canvas and svg graphics using ie s vml engine

7679353
opera	google-chrome
in opera it looks a bit lower that in google-chrome within a text but i wish it to be exactly by the line of text in any browser

7679366
ubuntu	linux
on linux ubuntu 11.04 for some reason a python script specifically the django s manage.py but i don t think that matters recently started acting strangely

7679426
superclass	subclassing
it looks like your subclassing isn t being set up properly as you are setting the subclassing s prototype to a concrete instance of the superclass

7679426
superclass	subclassing
i m not sure exactly what you re trying to achieve but i d wager that the subclassing constructor needs to call the superclass constructor directly something like this

7679450
getter	setter
to get this working read about getter and setter with __get and __set

7679492
children	parent
if you know that all of the elements are children of the same parent you can use the index provided by each

7679534
svg	vml
however ie does support an alternative graphics format called vml and there are javascript tools for ie which allow it to convert both svg and canvas into vml so you can use either of them and they will work in ie using these tools which makes both svg and canvas effectively cross-browser compatible

7679557
antivirus	mcafee
i need to trigger my antivirus mcafee when accessing a test-virus url via python

7679581
ubuntu	linux
i hardly know anything about ubuntu or linux

7679603
implements	extends
in clauses 2 and 3 it is possible to create a relationship by creating a new class that extends arraylist and implements adjustmentlistener

7679635
avaudioplayer	avfoundation
i decided to choose the avfoundation and avaudioplayer for this purpose

7679650
put	get
also you should put quotes around line so you don t get burned by any pipes or semicolons hanging around

7679749
versioning	upgrade
to install upgrade versioning from ubuntu s repositries are too old

7679825
folder	directory
in my experience installing subversive prevents eclipse from copying the .svn folder to the build directory

7679859
put	get
it can take a lot of effort to even deter those who really want to get around whatever licensing you put in place

7679882
implements	extends
where noncachingfooloader simply extends fooloader and then have dbfooloader implements noncachingfooloader and wire up accordingly

7679884
int	boolean
public linkedhashmap int initialcapacity float loadfactor boolean accessorder

7679899
subtraction	addition
subtraction is not the inverse of addition

7679944
spaces	delimiter
by default awk uses spaces as its column delimiter so this simply tells awk to print out the second column

7679957
free	malloc
the c++ standard states explicitely that the c malloc and free functions must not call operator new or operator delete 20.6.13 3 and 4 in the c++11 fdis

7679971
innodb	myisam
i am using mysql database innodb and myisam both engines

7679984
free	malloc
malloc free is not necessarily compatible with new and delete
